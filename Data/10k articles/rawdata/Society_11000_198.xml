The '''American Youth Congress''' ('''AYC''') was an early [[youth voice]] organization composed of youth from all across the country to discuss the problems facing youth as a whole in the 1930s.  It met several years in a row - one year it notably met on the lawn of the White House. The delegates are known to have caused a disturbance when they attempted to access the [[United States Congress]].  They focused on the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]], which was taking youths at age 18 off to war.  At the time in the United States one was not legally an adult in any way until the age of 21. They also focused on the economic exploitation of youth.

The formation of the AYC is also widely seen as a precursor to the establishment of the [[National Youth Administration]]. Both the AYC and the NYA are notable for the support which First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] lent to them.

== History ==
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. Speaker Abbot Simon, Secretary of the World... - NARA - 532101.tif|thumb|Abbot Simon speaking at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] on April 19, 1940]]

The American Youth Congress, or AYC, was formed in 1935 to advocate for [[youth rights]] in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the ''American Youth Bill of Rights'' to the [[U.S. Congress]]. [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s relationship with the AYC eventually led to the formation of the [[National Youth Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, A., Hopkins, J. ''et al.'' (2003) [http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/american-youth-congress.htm "American Youth Congress,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019032029/http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/american-youth-congress.htm |date=October 19, 2007 }} ''The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers.'' Teaching Eleanor Roosevelt. Hyde Park, New York: Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site. Retrieved 7/30/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the National Youth Administration in the 1930s, Eleanor Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." &lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.gwu.edu/%7Eerpapers/teachinger/glossary/nya.cfm "National Youth Administration,"] ''Teaching Eleanor Roosevelt Glossary.'' The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project. Retrieved 7/30/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1936, the AYC issued a ''Declaration of the Rights of American Youth'', which addressed several issues, mainly inalienable rights issues that affected youth, and the economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of the declaration is found at [http://newdeal.feri.org/students/ayc.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;   By 1939 the movement claimed 4,697,915 members in 513 affiliated organizations nationwide.

In 1939 the [[HUAC|Dies Committee]] subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the [[Young Communist League]]. Eleanor Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. That year [[Joseph P. Lash]], who later married [[Trude Lash]], described his 1937 defection from the Socialist Party in the Communist weekly, ''[[New Masses]]''. He was one of First Lady Roosevelt's boarders at the White House during the hearings.  Another officer, [[Abbott Simon]], slept for two weeks in Lincoln's bed during the hearings. In addition to his role in the AYC, Simon was a staff member of the [[Communist Party USA]] publication, ''Champion''.

On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of First Lady Roosevelt, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by  [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] from the South Portico.  The President admonished them to condemn not merely the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Nazi Germany|regime]] but all [[dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15918 Franklin D. Roosevelt, "Address to the Delegates of the American Youth Congress. Washington, D.C., February 10, 1940"]&lt;/ref&gt; The President was reportedly booed by the group.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the [[American Peace Mobilization]].  Among them was [[Joseph Cadden]], one of the overnight guests.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Later in 1940, despite Eleanor Roosevelt's publication of reasons called "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," the American Youth Congress was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newdeal.feri.org/er/er26.htm |title=Eleanor Roosevelt, "Why I Still Believe in the Youth Congress," in New Deal Network: Selected Writings of Eleanor Roosevelt, originally published in ''Liberty'', (April 1940): 30-32. |access-date=2005-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006022108/http://newdeal.feri.org/er/er26.htm |archive-date=2016-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aramean flag''', or '''Syriac-Aramean flag''',  is the [[ethnic flag]] designated for the [[Arameans (modern)|Aramean people]], adopted in 1980 by the Aramean journal [[Bahro Suryoyo]] of the Syriac federation in Sweden ({{lang-sv|Syrianska Riksförbundet}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atto|first=Naures|year=2011|title=Hostages in the Homeland, Orphans in the Diaspora: Identity Discourses among the Assyrian/Syriac Elites in the European Diaspora|publisher=Leiden University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended to represent their nation and homeland as well as the [[Aramean diaspora]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/sy%7Darama.html|title=Syriac-Aramaic People (Syria)|publisher=Crwflags.com|date=18 June 2001|accessdate=16 November 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081204205821/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/sy%7Darama.html|archivedate=4 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the flag was design based on the [[Winged Sun]] symbol, replacing the sun by a [[torch]] symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] in [[Christianity]].

The design is specifically based on a relief depicting [[Gilgamesh]] between two bull-men supporting a winged sun disk, excavated by the [[France|French]] [[semitologist]] [[André Dupont-Sommer]] (1900-1983) at [[Tell Halaf]] in the former Aramean [[city-state]] of [[Bit Bahiani]], today located in the [[Al Hasakah]] governorate of northeastern [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://imagery.trubox.ca/935/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2958">An '''artificial hymen''' is a type of [[prosthetic]] created for the purpose of simulating an intact human [[hymen]], usually to [[fake virginity]].&lt;ref name="CNNGo"&gt;[http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/none/unlikely-chinese-product-could-start-trade-war-249866 CNNGo: "The unlikely Chinese product that could start a trade war"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010133026/http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/none/unlikely-chinese-product-could-start-trade-war-249866 |date=October 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/28/artificial-hymen Guardian.co.uk: "Male Orders Hymen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Artificial hymens are made of a material which, when properly inserted, adhere to the inside of the [[vagina]], temporarily giving the appearance of an intact hymen and releasing a red liquid that looks like blood when subjected to pressure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Controversy==
Artificial hymens ordered over the internet from retailers based in [[China]] by consumers in [[Egypt]] have outraged conservative politicians in the latter country, who have demanded that the product be banned.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=8752944 ABCNews: "Egyptian Lawmakers Want to Ban Fake Hymen"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/07/world/fg-fake-hymen7 LA Times: "Gadget to help women feign virginity angers many in Egypt"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8279276.stm BBC News: "Egypt anger over virginity faking"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/05/egypt-fake-hymen-kit-may-_n_309737.html Huffington Post: "Egypt: Fake Hymen Kit May Be Banned"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy stems from the product's adherence to centuries-old misunderstandings of [[virginity]]. The medical community has established that not all women are born with a hymen, and those who are, do not necessarily bleed from [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]].&lt;ref name=emans&gt;Emans, S. Jean.

'''Belizean Creoles''', also known as '''Kriols''', are [[Creole peoples|Creole]] descendants of [[Black people|Black Africans]], [[slavery|enslaved]] and brought to [[Belize]] and [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] log cutters, who were known as the [[Baymen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belizenet.com/bzeguat/intro.html Belize-Guatemala Territorial Issue - Chapter 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985885 (Johnson,Melissa A.) ''The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras''. Environmental History, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Oct., 2003), pp. 598-617, ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years they have also intermarried with [[Miskito people|Miskito]] from [[Nicaragua]], [[Jamaicans]] and other [[Caribbean|West Indians]], [[Mestizo]]s and [[Indian people|East Indians]], who were brought to Belize as indentured laborers. These varied peoples have all mixed to create this ethnic group.  

The [[Belizean Creole language|Belize Kriol]] language, developed initially among the Africans and Europeans, was historically spoken only by them. The Creoles constituted the majority of the population until the 1980s and became synonymous with the Belizean national identity. As a result, the use of the Kriol language has become more widespread and is now spoken by about 75% of Belizeans, including the many new immigrants since the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In the 21st century, Creoles are found predominantly in urban areas, such as [[Belize City]], in most coastal towns and villages.

==Ethnicity==
Until the early 1980s, Belizean Creoles constituted close to 60% of the [[population]] of [[Belize]]. But, the demographics of the country have changed markedly. Because of the combined effects of immigration to Belize of people from other Central American countries, and emigration of an estimated 85,000 Creoles, most to the United States, in the early 21st century the Creoles make up about 25% of the population of Belize.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; As a result of centuries of mixed-race ancestry, persons identifying as Creole express a wide range of physical features ranging from dark skin and kinky hair, to fair skin and blonde hair, with many gradations in between. The term Creole denotes an ethnic culture rather than any narrow standard of physical appearance.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

In Belize, Creole is the standard term for any person of at least partial Black African descent who is not [[Garifuna people|Garinagu]], or any person who speaks Kriol as a first or sole language. Thus, immigrants from Africa and the West Indies who have settled in Belize and intermarried with locals may also identify as Creole. The concept of Creole as mixed race has embraced nearly any individual who has Afro-European ancestry combined with any other ethnicity, including Mestizo or Maya.

When the National Kriol Council began standardizing the orthography for Kriol, it decided to promote the spelling ''Kriol'' only for the language but to continue to use the spelling ''Creole'' to refer to the people in English.&lt;ref name="Song"&gt;Decker, Ken (2005) ''The Song of Kriol: A Grammar of the Kriol Language of Belize''. Belize City: Belize Kriol Project, pp. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Crosbie, Paul, ed. (2007) ''Kriol-Inglish Dikshineri: English-Kriol Dictionary''. Belize City: Belize Kriol Project, pp. 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to local research, the Belizean Creoles descended from unions between polyglot [[buccaneer]]s and European settlers who developed the [[logwood]] trade in the 17th century, and the sexual assault of African slaves they kidnapped to cut and ship the logwood. The National Kriol Council of Belize says that black slaves had been used as workers on the Central American coast from the 16th century and earlier, and were working for the Spanish further down the coast. By 1724, the British too were acquiring slaves from Jamaica and elsewhere to cut logwood and later [[mahogany]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The earliest reference to African slaves in the British settlement of Belize appeared in a 1724 Spanish missionary's account, which stated that the British recently had been importing them from Jamaica and [[Bermuda]]. 

In the second half of the eighteenth century the slave population hovered around 3,000, making up about three-quarters of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;Bolland, ''Colonial Society'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Most slaves, even if they were brought through [[West Indies|West Indian]] markets, were born in Africa,primarily from [[Ghana]] ([[Ga people|Ga]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]] people,&lt;ref name=kriol&gt;http://www.kriol.org.bz/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] - [[Fante people|Fante]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.laprensa.com.ni/opinion/10808 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194459/http://m.laprensa.com.ni/opinion/10808 |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}  La expresión musical popular centroamericana y la herencia africana (in Spanish: Central American popular musical expression and African heritage). Posted by Manuel Monestel&lt;/ref&gt;), around the [[Bight of Benin]] and [[Bight of Biafra]]; [[Nigeria]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Efik people|Efik]]&lt;ref name=kriol/&gt;); the [[Congo Basin|Congo]], and [[Angola]]. Other slaves were taken from the [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Fula people|Fula]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Kongo people|Kongo]] peoples.&lt;ref name=kriol/&gt;  

The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] (known as Eboe or Ibo) seem to have been particularly numerous; one section of [[Belize Town]] was known as Eboe Town in the first half of the 19th century. At first, many slaves maintained African ethnic identifications and cultural practices. Gradually, however, they combined some of their cultures, as well as adapting to elements of Europeans ones in a process of creolization, creating a new, syncretic [[Belizean Kriol people|Creole]] culture.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Bolland, Nigel. "Belize: Historical Setting". In [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bztoc.html ''A Country Study: Belize''] (Tim Merrill, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 1992). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

By most accounts, the slaves in Belize led a better life than most in the West Indies, but were still mistreated. Many escaped to neighboring Spanish colonies, or formed small [[maroon]] settlements in the forest. These slaves reputedly assisted in the defense of the fledgling settlement for much of the late 18th century, particularly in the 1798 [[Battle of St. George's Caye]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; This history has been debated and generates controversy in Belize.

The Creoles settled mainly in Belize Town (now [[Belize City]]) and along the banks of the Belize River in the original logwood settlements including [[Burrel Boom|Burrell Boom]], [[Bermudian Landing]], [[Crooked Tree, Belize|Crooked Tree]], [[Gracie Rock]], [[Rancho Dolores, Belize|Rancho Dolores]], [[Flowers Bank]], and [[Belmopan]]. There were also substantial numbers in and around the plantations south of Belize City and [[Placencia]]. Many Creoles were involved in the trade in live sea turtles, and other fisheries. As the 19th century progressed, they spread out to all the districts, particularly [[Dangriga]] and [[Monkey River]], as the colony grew. Their sense of pride led to occasional clashes with authority, such as the 1894 currency devaluation riots, which foreshadowed greater conflicts to come.

In the 20th century, the Creoles took the lead in organizing development of the settlement. Riots in 1919 and 1934, combined with terrible conditions resulting from a disastrous hurricane in 1931, led to development of Belize's first trade unions. From that organizing, they developed the first political party, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP). Creoles continue to lead the nation in politics. But conditions in Belize City worsened after [[Hurricane Hattie|another major hurricane in 1961]]. Shortly thereafter large scale emigration began (and continues) to the United States and England. From those countries, working individuals sent back money to assist families left behind. 

Attempts to unite Creoles for development, such as the [[United Black Association for Development]], met mixed results.

==Language==
{{Main|Belizean Creole language}}

==Culture==
As part of the September celebrations, the annual Creole Festival is held on the grounds of the House of Culture.  The festival is notable as part of an effort by Belize's Creole population to assert itself as a distinct group, rich with its own traditions.

===Maypole===
[[Maypole]] is a celebration that includes a maypole, a tall wooden pole, decorated with several long colored ribbons suspended from the top. This is similar to ''[[Palo de Mayo]]'' or ''Maypole'' in [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur|RAAS]] region in [[Nicaragua]]. There is no definite answer as to how the custom reached Nicaragua. Many historians point out that there are many differences in the celebration and that it came from the Nicaraguan [[Creole peoples|Creoles]] who inhabited Nicaragua's Caribbean coast; other historians believe it came indirectly from [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite news | first=Yadira | last=Flores | coauthors= | title=Palo de Mayo: Bailando alrededor de un árbol | year=2004 | publisher= | url=http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/mayo/30-mayo-2004/variedades/ | work=El Nuevo Diario | pages= | accessdate=2007-07-26 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704173423/http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/mayo/30-mayo-2004/variedades/ | archivedate=2007-07-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional fire ''sambai'' of [[Gales Point]] Manatee is an unusual Creole dance which survives from colonial times. Then slaves met in different parts of Belize City in "tribes" based on their African region of origin to celebrate Christmas holidays. Traditionally the group would form a big circle in the night around a full moon in the center of a square. One person at a time would go in the middle of the ring to dance. The male dance is a little bit different than the female because it is a fertility dance. The dance marks the time when girls and boys who are considered sexually mature may dance in public as part of their passage.

==Music==
From colonial days, music and dance have been an essential part of the Creole culture. Drum-led dancing was a major part of Christmas and other celebrations in Creole communities. A style of music called ''Brukdown'' originated from the all-night "brams" or parties thrown by Creole families; these focused on both social commentary and hijinks. Brukdown is a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[music of Belize|Belizean music]].  

Its most well-known contemporary performer and innovator, [[Wilfred Peters]] is regarded as a [[Belize]]an national icon. It is a mixture of European [[harmony|harmonies]], African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm]]s and [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] format, and lyrical elements from the native peoples of the area.  In its modern form, brukdown is a rural folk music, associated especially with the logging towns of the Belizean interior. Traditional instruments include the [[banjo]], [[guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]], dingaling bell, [[accordion]] and a donkey's [[jaw]]bone, played by running a stick up and down the teeth. Brukdown remains a rural, rarely recorded genre. This music and the social gatherings associated with it are on the decline as youths adopt the cultures of the outside world.

==Food and drink==
[[File:Boil Up National Dish of Belize.jpg|thumb|[[Belize]]an [[bile up]].  A combination of various boiled, starches, vegetables and "bile cake", accompanied with either fish or pig tail]]
Among the main staples of a Creole dinner are rice and beans with some type of meat, for example stewed chicken, baked chicken, stewed pork, stewed beef etc.; salad, whether potato, vegetable, or coleslaw; seafoods including fish, conch, lobster; some game meats including iguana, deer, peccary and gibnut; and ground foods such as cassava, potatoes, cocoa and plantains. Fresh juice or water are typically served, occasionally replaced by soft drinks and alcoholic beverages (homemade wines made from sorrel, berries, cashew, sorosi, grapefruit and rice are especially common).  Breakfasts usually include Creole bread and Kriol bun, johnny-cakes and frycakes (also called fry jacks). In recent years Creoles have adopted foods from other groups, particularly "Spanish" dishes made with tortillas. A more general national Belizean cuisine has developed and adopted traditional foods brought by the many Central American immigrants.&lt;ref name="RW"&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Wilk | coauthors= | title=Home Cooking in the Global Village | year=2006 | publisher=Berg Publishers, Oxford UK | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rice and Beans, Stew Chicken and Potato Salad - Belize.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rice and Beans]] (with [[Coconut]] Milk), Stewed Recado Chicken and [[Potato Salad]]]]
Creoles in general eat a relatively balanced diet. The [[bile up]] (or boil up) is one cultural dish of the Belizean Creoles. It is a combination of [[boiled eggs]], [[fish]] and/or [[Pork tail|pig tail]], with a number of ground foods such as cassava, green [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, and [[tomato sauce]]. Other important Creole foods are cowfoot soup, a thick stew with cocoyam and tripe, and a wide variety of dishes made with fish. Coconut milk and oil are common ingredients, though they have become increasingly rare and expensive. A plague of "lethal yellowing" killed most of the coconut trees in the 1990s. 

In [[Belize]], cassava was traditionally made into "bammy," a small fried cassava cake related to [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] cassava bread. The cassava root is grated, rinsed well, dried, salted, and pressed to form flat cakes about 4&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. The cakes are lightly fried, then dipped in coconut milk and fried again. Bammies were usually served as a starchy side dish with breakfast, with fish dishes, or alone as a snack. Cassava Pone (Plastic Cake) is a traditional Belizean Creole and pan-[[West Indian]] cassava flour cake, sometimes made with coconuts and raisins. Other common desserts include Sweet Potato Pone, Bread Pudding, stretch-mi-guts (a kind of taffy), tableta (coconut crisp), wangla (sesame) and powderbun, as well as a variety of pies.

On 31 December 2010 the largest groups by foreign nationality were citizens from [[Turkey]] (104,556), [[Poland]] (40,988), [[Serbia]] (19,230), [[Italy]] (15,842), [[Russia]] (15,332), [[United States]] (12,733), [[France]] (13,262), [[Vietnam]] (13,199), [[Croatia]] (10,104), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (10,198), [[UK]] (10,191), [[Greece]] (9,301), [[Austria]] (9,246), [[Ukraine]] (8,324), [[Lebanon]] (7,078), [[Spain]] (7,670), [[Bulgaria]] (9,988), the [[People's Republic of China]] (5,632), [[Thailand]] (5,037).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/pms/2011/11-02-04.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085632/http://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/pms/2011/11-02-04.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a large Arabic community, mostly from Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq.

The '''Brokpa''' are a small community of [[Dard people]] residing in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] region, about {{cvt|163|km}} northwest of [[Leh]] and {{cvt|62|km}} north of [[Kargil]] in [[Ladakh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heritage-key.com/world/nomadic-tribesmen-nazi-icons-who-were-aryans ''From Nomadic Tribesmen to Nazi Icons: Who Were the Aryans?'', heritage-key.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807100522/http://heritage-key.com/world/nomadic-tribesmen-nazi-icons-who-were-aryans |date=7 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are mainly found in Dha, Beama, [[Garkon]], Darchiks, [[Batalik]], Sharchay and Chulichan.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Part of the community are also located in the Deosai plateau just across the [[Line of Control|LOC]] in the villages Ganoaks, Morol, Dananusar, and Chechethang in [[Baltistan]]. Like the people of [[Gilgit]], they speak a variant of [[Shina language]], [[Brokskat]], unintelligible with other Shina dialects. They are said to have originally come from [[Chilas]] and settled in the area generations ago. They are predominantly Vajrayana Buddhists with a blend of folk animism and minority follow Shia Islam.

Minaro is an alternate ethnic name. 'Brogpa' is the name given by the Ladakhi to the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bkk Ethnologue. Brokskat - A language of India. Minaro]&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from Drukpa, which comes from the Tibetan word 'Drugu' (for an ethnic ''Turk''.) This is an accurate demonym, considering that the Turkic [[Trakhàn dynasty]] were once ruling the Karakoram region. Or it may just mean འབྲོག་པ། (pronounced Brokpa in Ladakh) a word for nomads.

==Diet==
The traditional Brogpa diet is based on locally grown foods such as barley and hardy wheat prepared most often as tsampa/sattu (roasted flour). It takes in different ways.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} Other important foods include potatoes, radishes, turnips, and Gur-Gur Cha, a brewed tea made of black tea, butter and salt.

Dairy and poultry sources are not eaten because of religious taboos. Brogpa eat three meals a day: ''Choalu Unis'' (breakfast), ''Beali'' (lunch) and ''Rata Unis'' (dinner). Brogpa vary with respect to the amount of meat (mainly mutton) that they eat. A household's economic position decides the consumption of meat. It is only during festivals and rituals that all have greater access to mutton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/S-EM/EM-02-0-000-08-Web/EM-02-2-000-08-Abst-PDF/EM-02-2-077-08-099-Bhasin-V/EM-02-2-077-08-099-Bhasin-V-Tt.pdf Bhasin, Veena: Social Change, Religion and Medicine among Brokpas of Ladakh, Ethno-Med., 2(2): 77-102 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy and employment==
The Brogpa economy has shifted from agropastoralism to wage labor, and the division of labor that relied on stratifications of age and gender is now obsolete. The Brogpa transition to private property, monogamy, nuclear families, formal education, wage labor, and their incorporation into a highly militarized economy of soldiering and portering illuminates the complex workings of modernity in Ladakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhan |first=Mona |section=Becoming Brogpa |title=Counterinsurgency, Democracy and the Politics of Identity in India |publisher= Routledge South Asia Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]] in [[Sweden]]''' was practiced until 1910. It is now outlawed by the [[Swedish Constitution]] which clearly states that capital punishment, [[corporal punishment]], and [[torture]] are strictly prohibited. At the time of the abolition of the death penalty in Sweden, the legal method of execution was beheading.

== Dates for abolition of the death penalty ==
* Capital punishment was abolished for all crimes committed in peacetime on 30 June 1921.
* Capital punishment was abolished for all crimes, including those committed in time of war, on 1 January 1973.

The clause that prohibits the death penalty has been a part of the Constitution since 1975. Sweden is a state party to the Second Optional Protocol to [[ICCPR]] (ratified in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-12&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Protocol No. 6 to [[ECHR]] (1984), and Protocol No. 13 to ECHR (2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm Second Optional Protocol]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121143327/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm |date=21 November 2007 }} to ICCPR; [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=114&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=1/28/2008&amp;CL=ENG Protocol No. 6]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170429/http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=114&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=1%2F28%2F2008&amp;CL=ENG |date=16 July 2011 }} and [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=1/28/2008&amp;CL=ENG Protocol No. 13]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170454/http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=1%2F28%2F2008&amp;CL=ENG |date=16 July 2011 }} to ECHR – text of the treaties, dates of signatures and ratifications&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Riksdag of the Estates]], a majority of the peasants worked for the abolition of the death penalty, for example when the new penalty code of 1864 was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Seth, Ivar: ''Överheten och svärdet – dödsstraffsdebatten i Sverige 1809–1974'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Titles ==
Two titles were used for the [[executioner|official who carried out the execution]]. ''Skarprättare'', who carried out beheadings and ''Bödel'', who carried out other types of capital punishment. Originally beheading by sword was reserved for nobels, where as commoners could be beheaded by axe or hanged. By the 18th century all beheadings were made by axe, for commoners and nobles alike, and some crimes such as [[forgery]] always carried the punishment of hanging. During the 19th century, each [[Provinces of Sweden|province of Sweden]] along with the City of Stockholm had an appointed executioner who travelled the area to carry out executions. In 1900, a national executioner ({{lang-sv|riksskarprättare}}) was appointed, a position that was filled by the last executioner [[Albert Gustaf Dahlman]] who until then had been responsible for carrying out executions in [[Stockholm]].

== Last execution ==

=== Last execution ===
[[Johan Alfred Ander]] was the last person executed in Sweden. He was sentenced to death for a murder during the course of a  robbery that was committed in January 1910. His sentence was not commuted and he was executed 23 November at [[Långholmen]] in [[Stockholm]] using a [[guillotine]] (the only time a guillotine was used in Sweden). The executioner was [[Albert Gustaf Dahlman]], who died in 1920. At his death at 72, he was the last of all executioners in Sweden.

=== Last death sentence issued ===
[[Mohammed Beck Hadjetlaché]], an exiled [[Russian monarchy|monarchist]] and member of the [[White movement]], received the last death sentence in Sweden, on 28 May 1920, for robbery-homicide of three Russian nationals, all supposed [[Bolshevik]] sympathisers in the so-called ''Ryssvillan'' ("Russian villa") in 1919, though the crimes, denounced as particularly gruesome and meticulously planned, may have claimed of another four victims, all missing to this day. His accomplices received lesser penalties, and after appeal, the death sentence (as was practice at the time) was changed in [[Svea Hovrätt]] (appellate court) to a lifetime of hard labour. Hadjetlaché allegedly succumbed to mental illness in jail, and died in confinement in [[Långholmen]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfcp/0114.html|title=191-192 (Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 36. Supplement. Globe – Kövess)|date=1 January 1924|publisher=[[Nordisk familjebok]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last woman sentenced to death – also the last death sentence ''not to be reprieved'' – was the "angelmaker" [[Hilda Nilsson]], who was sentenced to the guillotine on 14 July 1917 for the murder of several infant children. She preempted the execution by hanging herself in her cell in [[Landskrona Citadel]]. It is suggested that a decision to commute the sentence had in fact been taken, but if so she did not know of it at the time of her suicide.

=== Last execution of a woman ===
The last woman executed was [[Anna Månsdotter]], who was executed on 7 August 1890 by [[decapitation]] with an [[axe]]. Månsdotter and her son Per Nilsson had murdered Per's wife, Hanna Johansdotter. Månsdotter was also involved in an [[incest]]uous relationship with her son, who was sentenced to life imprisonment and who was released in 1914. The last woman executed in the capital of Stockholm was [[Helena Katarina Löv]], who was decapitated for the murder of a child on 19 September 1829.

=== Last public executions ===
[[File:Avrättning 1876 Hjert Lidamon Villåttinge härad.jpg|thumb|right|The execution of Gustav Erikson Hjert, 18 May 1876]]
The last public executions in Sweden were carried out 18 May 1876. Both executions, by means of beheading, are supposed to have been carried out at the same time in the morning, at 7. The executed were [[Konrad Lundqvist Petterson Tector]] and Gustav Erikson Hjert and the executions were carried out at [[Stenkumla|Stenkumla Backe]] near [[Visby]] and at Lidamon (near [[Malmköping]]). Both had been sentenced to death for the same crime, a failed robbery against a stagecoach two years earlier, which resulted in the murder of one of the passengers and the driver of the coach. The executions were carried out by [[Per Petter Christiansson Steineck]] and [[Johan Fredrik Hjort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slbrott_hjert-tector.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120217132752/http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slbrott_hjert-tector.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-02-17 |title=Hjert Tector Högman |publisher=Algonet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last use of method other than beheading ===
The last time a method other than beheading was practiced was in 1836; the method used was [[hanging]] by the neck. Although it was not subsequently used, it remained available as a form of capital punishment until the Penal Code of 1864 removed that option.

=== Last execution for other crime than murder ===
The last time a death sentence was carried out for any other crime than murder was on 10 August 1853 when Mårten Persson was executed for aggravated assault at Rögla (near [[Ystad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogi.se/avrattade/form.php|title=Avrättade|publisher=Sveriges Släktforskarförbund}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last execution carried out for a non-fatal assault was on 29 March 1837, when Anders Gustaf Lindberg was beheaded in [[Stockholm]].

== Number of executions during 1800–1866, 1867–1921 ==
Between 1800 and 1866, 644 executions were carried out in Sweden, the second highest per-capita number in Europe after [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slbrott.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524195131/http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slbrott.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-24 |title=Högman |publisher=Algonet }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Bernadotte, ''Om Straff och Straffanstalter'' (1840), unknown page&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, when the Penal Code was reformed, and the use of capital punishment was severely restricted, rather than abolished (as had been proposed), and [[hanging]] was abolished. In the following years (from 1866) up until the abolishment of the death penalty in 1921, fifteen people were executed (out of about 120 sentenced). The only crime that after 1864 carried a mandatory death sentence was the slaying of a prison guard by a prisoner serving life sentence. Two of the executions carried out after 1864 were for this crime; the execution of Jonas Magnus Jonasson Borg in 1866 and the execution of Carl Otto Andersson in 1872.

[[File:Officiers of the Six Companies b.jpg|thumb|Men of the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]] wearing the Changsun]]
A '''''{{Audio|Chang2shan1.ogg|changshan}}''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|長衫}}|p=chángshān|l=long shirt}}) is a traditional Chinese dress (or robe, long jacket or tunic) worn by men. In function, it is considered the male equivalent of the women's ''cheongsam'' (''qipao''). It is also known as a ''changpao'' (''chángpáo'' {{linktext|長袍}}, "long robe") or ''dagua'' ({{linktext|大褂}}, {{linktext|dàguà}}, "great jacket"). It was often worn by men with a ''[[Magua (clothing)|magua]]'' or "riding jacket". These types of dress were widely adopted beginning under the [[Manchu]] ({{zh|s=滿族}}) rulers of the [[Qing dynasty]] ({{zh|s=清朝}}), who required that men in certain positions wear this style. It took more time for the majority of women to adopt the new style of qipao rather than [[hanfu]] ({{zh|漢服}}).

The [[Mandarin Chinese]] word ''changshan'' is cognate with the [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] term 長衫 ''chèuhng sàam.'' This was borrowed into English as "cheongsam." Unlike the Mandarin term, however, ''chèuhngsàam'' can refer to both male and female garments. In [[Hong Kong]] the term is frequently used to refer to the body-hugging female garment rather than the male ''changshan.'' Because of the long British presence in Hong Kong, that local usage has become reflected in the meaning of ''cheongsam'' in English, which refers exclusively to the female garment.

==History==
{{main|Cheongsam#History|l1=Cheongsam History}}

''Changshan,'' along with ''qipao,'' were introduced to China during the [[Qing dynasty]] (17th–20th centuries). The [[Manchu]]s in 1636 ordered that all [[Han Chinese]] should adopt the ''changshan'' style of dress or face harsh punishment. However, after the 1644 fall of the [[Ming dynasty]], the Manchu stopped this order; they required only that Han men who served as court and government officials wear Manchu clothes. Commoner Han men and women were still allowed to wear the ''[[hanfu]].'' Over time, the commoner Han men adopted the ''changshan'' and ''qipao'' as their own dress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rhoads |first=Edward J. M. |title=Manchus &amp; Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861–1928 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |series=Studies on Ethnic Groups in China |isbn=9780295979380 |oclc=43569203 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgq1miGno-4C&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Han women still wore Hanfu. The traditional Chinese [[Han Chinese clothing|Hanfu]] style of clothing for men was gradually replaced. Over time, the Manchu style of male dress gained popularity among Han men.

''Changshan'' was considered formal dress for Chinese men before Western-style [[Suit (clothes)|suits]] were widely adopted in China. The male ''changshan'' could be worn under a western overcoat, and topped with a fedora and scarf. This combination expressed an [[East Asia]]n modernity in the early 20th century.

The 1949 [[Chinese Civil War|Communist Revolution]] ended the wearing of ''changshan'' and other traditional  clothing in [[Shanghai]]. [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] emigrants and refugees carried the fashion to [[Hong Kong]], where it has remained popular. Recently in Shanghai and elsewhere in [[mainland China]], many people have revived wearing the Shanghainese ''changshan.'' It is made of silk.

==Use of changshan==
''Changshan'' are traditionally worn for formal pictures, weddings, and other formal Chinese events.  A black ''changshan,'' along with a rounded black hat, was, and sometimes still is, the burial attire for Chinese men.  ''Changshan'' are not often worn {{As of|2007|alt=today}} in mainland China, except during traditional Chinese celebrations but, with the revival of some traditional clothing in urban mainland China, the Shanghainese style functions as a stylish party dress (''cf.'' [[Mao suit]]).

A '''churl''' (etymologically the same name as [[Carl (name)|Charles / Carl]] and [[Old High German]] ''karal''), in its earliest [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon) meaning, was simply "a man", and more particularly a "husband",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Churl|volume=6|pages=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the word soon came to mean "a non-servile [[peasant]]", still spelled ''ċeorl(e)'', and denoting the lowest rank of freemen. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' it later came to mean the opposite of the [[nobility]] and [[royal family|royalty]], "a [[Common people|common person]]". Says [[Hector Munro Chadwick|Chadwick]]:
{{quote|the distinction between ''[[thegn]]'' and ''ceorl'' is from the time of [[Æthelstan|Aethelstan]], the broad line of demarcation between the classes of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies on Anglo-Saxon Institutions'', Cambridge, 1905, p. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&amp;id=BK08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{wiktionary|churl}}
This meaning held through the 15th century, but by then the word had taken on negative overtones, meaning "a country person" and then "a low fellow".  By the 19th century, a new and [[pejorative]] meaning arose, "one inclined to uncivil or loutish behaviour"—hence "churlish" (cf. the pejorative sense of the term ''boor'', whose original meaning of "country person" or "farmer" is preserved in Dutch and Afrikaans ''boer'' and German ''Bauer'', although the latter has its own pejorative connotations such as those prompting its use as the name for the chess piece known in English as a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]. Also the word [[villain]] - derived  from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] and [[Old French]] and originally meaning  "farmhand"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |editor=Robert K. Barnhart |year=1988 |publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers |location=New York |isbn=0-550-14230-4 |pages=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; - had gone through a similar process to reach its present meaning).
{{Anglo-Saxon status}}

The ''ċeorles'' of Anglo-Saxon times lived in a largely free society, and one in which their [[fealty]] was principally to their [[monarch|king]]. Their low status is shown by their ''[[Wergild|werġild]]'' ("man-price"), which, over a large part of England, was fixed at 200 [[shilling]]s (one-sixth that of a ''theġn''). Agriculture was largely community-based and communal in open-field systems. This freedom was eventually eroded by the increase in power of [[feudalism|feudal lords]] and the [[manorialism|manorial system]]. Some scholars argue, however, that anterior to the encroachment of the manorial system the ''ċeorles'' owed various services and rents to local lords and powers.

In the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic (Scandinavian) languages]], the word ''Karl'' has the same root as ''churl'' and meant originally a "free man". As "[[housecarl]]", it came back to England. In [[German language|German]], ''Kerl'' is used to describe a somewhat rough and common man and is no longer in use as a synonym for a common soldier (''[[Potsdam Giants|die langen Kerls]]''&lt;ref&gt;The correct (modern) plural of ''Kerl'' being ''Kerle''&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]]). [[Ríg (Norse god)|''Rígsþula'']], a poem in the [[Poetic Edda]], explains the [[social class]]es as originating from the three sons of Ríg: [[Thrall]], Karl and [[Earl]] (''Þræl'', ''Karl'' and ''Jarl''). This story has been interpreted in the context of the proposed [[trifunctional hypothesis]] of [[Proto-Indo-European society]].

Cognates to the word ''ceorle'' are frequently found in place names, throughout the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world, in towns such as [[Carlton (disambiguation)#Places|Carlton]] and [[Charlton (disambiguation)#Places|Charlton]], meaning "the farm of the churls"{{dubious|date=November 2011}}. Names such as [[Carl (name)|Carl]] and [[Charles]] are derived from [[cognates]] of ''churl'' or ''ċeorle''.

While the word ''churl'' went down in the social scale, the first name derived from the same etymological source ("Karl" in German, "Charles" in French and English, "[[Carlos (given name)|Carlos]]" in Spanish etc.) remained prestigious enough to be used frequently by many European royal families - owing originally to the fame of [[Charlemagne]], to which was added that of later illustrious kings and emperors of the same name. ''Król'', the [[Polish language|Polish]] word for "king", is also derived from the same origin.

==Current use==
In most [[Germanic languages]] this word did not take on the English meaning of "lowly peasant" and retains its original meaning of "fellow, guy"; cf. [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''kearel'', archaic ''tsjerl'', ''tsjirl'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''kerel'', [[Low German]] ''Kerl'' (also borrowed into [[German language|German]]), [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''karl'', and so on.

The '''Convocations of Canterbury and York''' are the [[synod|synodical assemblies]] of the bishops and clergy of each of the two [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] which comprise the [[Church of England]]. Their origins go back to the ecclesiastical reorganisation carried out under [[Theodore of Tarsus|Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury (668-90)]] and the establishment of a separate northern province in 733.  Until 1225 the synods were composed entirely of bishops, but during the thirteenth century more and more clergy were cited until by 1283 the membership was established as the bishops, deans, archdeacons and abbots of each province together with one '''proctor''' (representative) from each cathedral chapter and two proctors elected by the clergy of each [[diocese]]. The main purpose of the convocations was to take counsel for the well-being of the church and to approve canonical legislation, but in practice much time was spent in discussing the amount of tax to be paid to the Crown since the clergy were a separate [[estate of the realm]] and refused to be taxed in or through Parliament. Before the end of the nineteenth century, the Convocation of Canterbury, which was numerically very much larger, played the major role and the activity of the Convocation of York was often little more than giving formal approval to the decisions taken by the southern province.

In 1534 the convocations were subjected to the control of the Crown since they were a focus of resistance to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] policies at the time of the [[Reformation]] and they continued to function in a restricted way under the supervision of the Crown. In 1603/4 they approved the updating and consolidation into one text of much of the [[Canon law of the Church of England]] and in 1661 after the restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] they approved the text of the revised [[Book of Common Prayer]] before it was submitted to Parliament. Four years later, [[Gilbert Sheldon|Archbishop Sheldon]] agreed to surrender the right of the clergy to tax themselves and as a result the convocations ceased to be licensed for business on a regular basis.  Between 1688 and 1717 political tensions ran high between the lower houses which was predominately [[high church]] in theology and often [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] politically and the bishops who were mainly [[Whig (political party)|Whigs]] and [[latitudinarians]] and after 1717 their meetings were limited to the formal sessions required at the beginning of a new parliament.

Pressure for the reactivation of the convocations began to mount in the 1840s as people began to realise that the Church of England and the state were no longer coterminous and that the Church of England needed to find some means of expressing its mind and will. In 1852 the Lower House of Canterbury acted on its own initiative and held a proper debate and from then on, despite strong opposition,{{clarify|date=February 2017}} many doubts and much debate, on both houses of Canterbury gradually increased the range of their activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} York followed suit in 1861 after the death of Archbishop Musgrave.

In 1919 the two convocations approved a constitution for the proposed [[Church Assembly|National Assembly of the Church of England]] in which the laity of each province would have full participation along with the four houses of the convocations themselves. They also petitioned Parliament that the new assembly might have the right to transmit legal measures to Parliament where they would either be approved as they stood and then receive the royal assent (and so become part of the law of the land) or be rejected. This was granted at the end of the same year. The convocations lost none of their rights and the assembly could neither issue doctrinal statements nor purport to define the doctrine of the Church of England. However, by the Synodical Government Measure 1969&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=Church+of+England+Measure&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=2172961&amp;PageNumber=2&amp;SortAlpha=0 Synodical Government Measure 1969]&lt;/ref&gt; the overlapping functions of the assembly and the convocations were virtually eliminated by the establishment of the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] to which almost all their functions and powers were transferred. The convocations still exist, in part because their approval is required for certain legislative proposals and in part because the House of Bishops and the House of Clergy of the General Synod are constituted by the members of the corresponding houses of the convocations.

==Structure==
When clergy other than bishops began to take part in the convocations they sat together with the bishops in one single assembly and technically even today the members still constitute one single body.&lt;ref name=ODCC1&gt;Cross, F.L. &amp; Livingstone, E.A. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' OUP (1974) art. "Convocations of Canterbury and York"&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since the fifteenth century each convocation has sat as two houses: an [[upper house]] of [[Anglican ministry#Bishops|bishops]] and a [[lower house]] of other [[Anglican ministry|clergy]].&lt;ref name=ODCC1/&gt;  The division into houses has led to claims from time to time that the lower house is independent from the upper one in the same way as the House of Commons is from the Lords.  Business is normally started in the House of Bishops and sent to the House of Clergy for approval which may be refused. There are procedures by which the lower house may raise matters and submit their opinions and suggestions to the bishops.&lt;ref name=ODCC1/&gt;

The president of each convocation as a whole and of the upper house is the archbishop of its province; each lower house elects for itself a president known as the '''prolocutor''' who is responsible for communication with the upper house.&lt;ref name=ODCC1/&gt;

Until 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Pelican (1960) p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; the upper houses had consisted of the diocesan bishops of the province and the lower houses were mainly composed of church dignitaries, the deans and archdeacons and one proctor representing each cathedral chapters and to these ''ex officio'' members were added in the case of Canterbury two representatives elected by the clergy of each diocese and in York two representatives from each archdeaconry.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Eric Waldram. ''Counsel and Consent'' SPCK (1961) p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;   Today all [[diocesan bishops]] have a seat in their province's convocation; the [[suffragan bishops]] of a province elect a few from among themselves to join them.  Most of the members of the lower house are elected by the clergy of each [[diocese]] by proportional representation from among their number,&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, Peter &amp; Buchanan, Colin. ''Proportional Representation in Church Elections'' CPAS (1969) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; although a handful serve ''ex officio'' or are elected by special constituencies (such as universities or [[cathedral]] [[Dean (religion)|dean]]eries).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/churchlawlegis/canons/section-h.aspx] Text of relevant canonical legislation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;For a convenient detailed listing see [[General Synod of the Church of England#Membership|Membership of General Synod]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By virtue of their membership of convocation bishops and clergy are members of General Synod; thus the members of the convocations now all attend sessions of General Synod and can always conveniently meet during recesses of that body (which is, indeed, the only time they do meet nowadays).

==History==

===Before 1295===
Prior to 1295, the Church in England had assembled in diocesan and provincial synods to regulate disciplinary and other matters interesting the body of the clergy. Moreover, the [[archbishop]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s and [[prior]]s used to take their place in the national council on account of the estates they held in chief (in'' capite'') of the [[English Crown]]. But the beneficed clergy took no part in it.
 
The increasing frequency of royal appeals for money grants and the unwillingness of the bishops to be responsible for allowing them had brought [[Stephen Langton]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], as early as 1225, to summon [[proctor]]s of cathedral, collegiate and conventual churches to attend his provincial synod, and gradually that representative principle became part of the system of Convocation. The failure of the irregular attempt of [[Edward I Plantagenet]] to convoke the clergy at [[Northampton]] led him to issue (1283) a writ to the Archbishop with a view to Convocation meeting in London in that same year, and at that meeting a "benevolence" was duly voted.&lt;ref name="encycl"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Convocation of the English Clergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1295===
&lt;!--:This section is based on [http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3335 Convocation of the English Clergy]--&gt;
In addition to the [[Baronage]] and Commons of the realm, after 1295 a representative body of the beneficed clergy summoned to attend personally in Parliament, the summons being conveyed by the insertion, in the bishop's writ of summons to Parliament, of the proemunientes clause. That summons was the beginning of a new phase in the long struggle waged by the Crown on the subject of the taxation of the clergy. It was to facilitate the obtaining of money grants that Edward I endeavoured once more to unite representatives of the clergy and laity in one deliberative assembly, composed on the basis of temporal property. To have countenanced the attempt would have been to recognize the Crown's claim to tax church property, and the clergy insisted upon their constitutional right of making their money grants in Convocation. The struggle between the Crown and the clergy continued until 1337, when the Crown gave way, though retaining the ''proemunientes'' clause in the bishop's writ of summons. Authorities differ as to whether the Parliamentary proctors of the clergy sat in the Lower House or in the Upper House; most probably they sat and voted in the Lower House.&lt;ref name=cenclop&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3335 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913) art. Convocation of the English Clergy''']&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the exact relation of Convocation to the newer Parliamentary representatives of the clergy is obscure; nor is the obscurity lessened by the fact that the proctors of the clergy for Convocation were frequently the same persons as the proctors of the clergy for Parliament. Two opinions have found defenders: one that the older ecclesiastical council fused with the Parliamentary representatives of the clergy; the other, that by the process of gradual decay of Parliamentary representation of the clergy, part of their rights passed to the ecclesiastical councils, thus giving rise to the historical connection between the Convocations and Parliament. The latter view, ably advocated by Stubbs, holds the field.&lt;ref name=cenclop/&gt;

The division of Convocation into an Upper - and a Lower House came about gradually, and was not formed, as is sometimes supposed, on the model of the two Houses of Parliament. In 1296 the members of Convocation resolved themselves for deliberative purposes into four groups: bishops, monastic representatives, dignitaries and proctors of the clergy. Eventually Convocation came to open with a joint session presided over by the archbishop, after which the bishops and abbots remained to deliberate as the Upper House, while the rest withdrew to deliberate as the Lower House.

The objection of the clergy to sitting in Parliament lessened their influence over that body; at the same time they secured the right of meeting when Parliament met, and that right of meeting involved the right of petitioning and to some extent of legislating for themselves. That idea of Convocation as the clerical parliament had important consequences; the right to tax church property was successfully maintained; but the clergy could neither elect nor be elected to the House of Commons, making a person in [[Holy orders]] ineligible for Westminster Parliament. At the same time the legislation of Convocation was binding on the clergy only and not upon the laity.

===The Reformation period===
&lt;!--This section is based on [http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3335 Convocation of the English Clergy]--&gt;
Convocation lost its independence and saw its powers curtailed by the [[Act of Submission]],&lt;ref&gt;25 Hen. VIII (1533-4), c. 19&lt;/ref&gt; which enacts that Convocation can only meet by royal command, and that without royal leave and licence no new [[canon law|canon]]s, constitutions or ordinances may be made. This act was repealed in [[Queen Mary I Tudor]]'s reign, but revived by Elizabeth I (in 1558-9), and still remains in full force.
 
The climax of Convocation's degradation was reached when, after the [[Act of Supremacy]] (1534), [[Thomas Cromwell]], the representative of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], though a layman, asserted his right to preside, a right never subsequently exercised.

===Post-Reformation period===
The Act of Submission of Henry VIII was stringently interpreted by the judges at a committee before the Lords in Parliament&lt;ref&gt;in 8 Jac., 1&lt;/ref&gt; as forbidding, even after obtaining royal assent, any canon either against the prerogative of the king, against common law, against any statute law or  against any custom of the realm. The loss of legislative independence paved the way for the loss of taxing powers, which were finally renounced in 1665, the right of voting at Parliamentary elections being obtained in return. The power of Convocation of dealing with cases of [[heresy]] has been exercised but rarely, and then to no purpose.
 
It continued to be convoked at the beginning of each Parliament, but its sittings were interrupted from 1640 to 1660 (being largely replaced by the puritan [[Westminster Assembly]] of Divines), to be resumed after the [[Stuart Restoration]]. In 1689, in view of the opposition of the clergy to the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], no summons was issued to Convocation. The Commons, however, protested against the innovation, and their petition had its effect; at the same time Archbishop [[John Tillotson|Tillotson]], and to some extent his successor [[Thomas Tenison|Tenison]], met the difficulties of the situation by refusing to allow any deliberations. Convocation was summoned, met and was prorogued. Parties were formed and claims were made, insisting upon the independence of the Lower House on the analogy of the House of Commons. [[Francis Atterbury|Atterbury]] led the malcontents; [[William Wake|Wake]], afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, Kennet, [[Benjamin Hoadly|Hoadly]] and [[Edmund Gibson|Gibson]] led the defence. The question was really a political one. [[Toryism]] dominated the Lower House; Liberalism, alike in politics and theology, pervaded the Upper House. Permission to deliberate led to trouble in 1701, and prorogation followed.
 
The [[Bangorian Controversy]] arising out of Hoadly's sermon led to similar results in 1717. The opposition of the Lower House was worn out by repeated prorogations immediately following the opening session, and with the exception of the discussions allowed in 1741 and 1742, Convocation ceased to be a deliberative body until 1854.

===Modern times===
The old organization having survived, many earnest Anglicans of the early nineteenth century, anxious to revive the synodal life of the Anglican Church, sought and obtained the relaxation of the customary immediate prorogation. A brief session was authorized in 1854. (The example was followed by York in 1859.) The action of Convocation as a deliberative body began in 1861, when, at its own request, the Crown licensed it to amend the twenty-ninth of the canons of 1603 on the subject of sponsors, and although no result followed, new canons were passed in 1865, 1887 and 1892.

Apart from such general authorizations the Crown also possesses the right to submit definite business to the consideration of Convocation. This is done by "Special Letters of Business", a method used in 1872 and in 1907, in submitting the reports of the ritual commissioners to its consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=3335 Convocation of the English Clergy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Featherstone Marshall]] wrote a trenchant parody of the Church of England's Convocation debates in his pseudonymous [http://anglicanhistory.org/rc/afmarshall1868/ ''The Comedy of Convocation of the English Church''] (1868). Its characters include Deans Blunt, Pliable, Primitive, Pompous and Critical; Archdeacons Jolly, Theory and Chasuble; and Doctors Easy, Viewy and Candour.

Lay representation developed from the House of Laymen, which first met in connection with the Convocation of Canterbury in 1886 (York, 1892), and formally in legislation in the Church Assembly (1919) and General Synod (1970).

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Egypt.svg|150 px]]}}
'''"Corruption''' was one of the primary reasons that pushed the masses to rally in 2011"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fayed|first=Ahmed Alaa|date=2017-10-02|title=The current status of corruption in Egypt|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17550912.2017.1399641?journalCode=rcaa20|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=510–521|doi=10.1080/17550912.2017.1399641|issn=1755-0912}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Corruption defines [[Egypt]]'s economy in more ways than one. While popular businesses receive privileged treatment, the average business must embrace a culture of lying, extortion, [[embezzlement]], and [[bribery]]. This favoritism forces businesses to have strong networks in order to survive. Although laws exist to [[criminalize]] these actions, they are poorly enforced.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-investment-law/egypts-cabinet-approves-long-awaited-investment-law-idUSKBN0M00W120150304|title=Egypt's cabinet approves long-awaited investment law|first=Stephen|last=Kalin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eturbonews.com/164895/top-10-countries-invest-africa-egypt-number-one|title=Top 10 countries to invest in Africa: Egypt number one - eTurboNews (eTN)|first=Juergen T|last=Steinmetz|date=18 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Corruption in the Economy==
Businesses with more informal connections within the government receive [[preferential]] treatment navigating through [[Egypt]]'s complex regulatory framework, providing a [[disincentive]] for competition. An inefficient and sporadically enforced legal system and a widespread culture of corruption leave businesses reliant on the use of [[intermediary|middlemen]] known as "wasta", to operate, and well-connected businesses enjoy privileged treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt/snapshot.aspx|title=Egypt Corruption Report|website=www.business-anti-corruption.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facilitation payment]]s are an established part of 'getting things done', despite irregular payments and gifts being criminalized. Facilitation payments are regarded as bribery in many countries, which prevents many foreign entities from financial involvement with Egypt since they are a required part of doing business. Corruption makes the costs of both local goods as well as imports higher, decreasing the purchasing power of individuals which magnifies poverty.
However, with the new 2016 Investment Law &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; signed on March 2016 under the Minister of investment and international cooperation Sahar Nasr (government of [[Sherif Ismail]]) under the presidency of [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], the business scene has seen more flexibility. The law aims to reduce stifling bureaucracy in order to attract more investors, which has seen long-awaited growth in investment in Egypt. With this law, Egypt is becoming the most attractive investment destination in Africa.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Attempts at Reform==

Historically, the gap between legislation and enforcement has hampered the government's efforts to fight corruption.

===Mubarak===
Prior to the 2011 revolution, critics agreed that corruption in Egypt was widespread and that anti-corruption measures were perceived to be mere cosmetic changes serving Mubarak's political agenda. However in the last year of president [[Mubarak]]'s 30 years presidency, on 2010, the "National coordination committee for combatting Corruption"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncccc.gov.eg/Pages_en/Home.aspx|title=NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR COMBATING CORRUPTION|website=NCCCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created but been amended by a Prime Minister decree (No 493) signed by PM [[Ibrahim Mahlab]] on 2014 to provide justice and equality and equal opportunities.

===Morsi===
The uprisings spurred a whirlwind of official corruption cases as well as the trials of several ministers and businessmen with ties to the former regime.The government under the [[Morsi]] administration claimed to focus its efforts on the fight against corruption and included several anti-corruption initiatives into the new 2012 constitution. But soon after the constitutional amendment in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=09122012&amp;id=ac870987-0412-4dd8-ace9-a21b83213115|title=نص الإعلان الدستوري الجديد الذي أصدره الرئيس مرسي - بوابة الشروق||location=القاهرة|work=الشروق|accessdate=May 30, 2018|date=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, initiatives started to develop slowly resulting in complete neglection before the [[Egyptian revolution of 2013|2013 revolution]] erupted on June 30. The [[Constitution of Egypt (2012-present)|Constitution]] stipulated, among other provisions, the public's right to information, data, and documents. It also required an annual financial disclosure from Parliament members. Furthermore, the government created an anti-corruption commission designed to deal with standards of integrity and transparency in government and address conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What's new in Egypt's draft constitution?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25204313|work=BBC||date=December 3, 2014|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Sisi===
In terms of enforcement, more happened under the Sisi regime with one highly publicized case of a judge who was accused of corruption and arrested the moment he resigned from his position. The judge committed suicide very soon thereafter. Under the presidency of [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], many attempts to arrest public figures accused of different forms of corruption have erupted, including ones against main [[Governorates of Egypt|governorate]]s' governors, as well as hospital directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youm7.com/story/2018/1/14/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D9%84%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D9%88%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%88%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%B9/3601570|title=مصدر: غلق مكتب محافظ المنوفية المتهم فى قضايا فساد ووضع حراسة أمنية عليه - اليوم السابع|date=January 14, 2018|publisher=اليوم السابع}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2014, as the first move for the president, a council of combating corruption was created and headed by the [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]], during which high-profile officials get to review developments in the area of reducing corrupt practices. 
&lt;ref name="judge hangs self Jan 2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptian judge facing corruption charge hangs himself: lawyer|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-corruption-idUSKBN14M0NJ|publisher=Reuters|date=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4718">'''Deep history''' is a term for the distant past of the [[human]] species.&lt;ref name=twsNYT18&gt;PATRICIA COHEN, September 26, 2011, The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/arts/deep-history-takes-humanity-back-to-its-origins.html?_r=0 History That’s Written in Beads as Well as in Words], Accessed January 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  As an intellectual discipline, deep history encourages scholars in [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[primatology]], [[genetics]] and [[linguistics]] to work together to write a common narrative about the beginnings of humans,&lt;ref name=twsNYT18/&gt;  and to redress what they see as an imbalance among historians, who mostly concentrate on more recent periods.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/arts/deep-history-takes-humanity-back-to-its-origins.html History That’s Written in Beads as Well as in Words]''&lt;/ref&gt; Deep history forms the earlier part of [[Big History]], and looks at the portion of [[deep time]] when humans existed, going further back than [[prehistory]], mainly based on [[archaeology]], usually ventures, and using a wider range of approaches.

Proponents of deep history argue for a definition of [[history]] that rests not upon the invention of [[writing]], but upon the evolution of [[anatomically modern humans]]. According to [[Daniel Lord Smail]], perhaps the most prominent advocate of Deep History, the concept of prehistory is recast as an arbitrary boundary that limits the ''[[longue durée]]'' perspective of historians, and which rests upon assumptions that history follows a teleological path beginning with the origins of [[civilization]] in [[Ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lord Smail, ''On Deep History and the Brain'' (University of California Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smail suggests that advances in disciplines such as [[neurobiology]] and [[neurophysiology]] and [[genetics]] mean that there are more possibilities for understanding the distant past, and offer opportunities to explain how events such as biological evolution, global environmental change, and patterns of the spread of disease have affected humanity today.&lt;ref name=twsMedHistory&gt;Stephen T Casper (reviewer); Med Hist. 2009 Apr; 53(2): 318–319; {{PMC|2668893}}; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2668893/ Book Reviews -- On deep history and the brain]; Review of book by: Daniel Lord Smail, ''On deep history and the brain'' published by Berkeley and London,  University of California Press,  2008, pp. xiv, 271, 978-0-520-25289-9, Accessed January 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of Deep History generally do not acknowledge what they claim to be the traditional barrier between conventional history, generally based on written documentation such as ancient scrolls or hieroglyphs on pyramids, and unwritten prehistory, based on archaeology, in the human past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History Manifesto|last = Guldi, Armitage|first = Jo, David|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-107-43243-7|location = Cambridge|pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of Smail's book by [[Steven Mithen]], professor of [[Archaeology]] at the [[University of Reading]], is sympathethic to some parts of his thesis, but says  "Smail may not be as closely acquainted with the ongoing debates in prehistoric archaeology as he might be", and on Smail's critical description of historians: "I have to take Smail’s word for it that such historians still exist, as after more than a century of prehistoric archaeology they would be an astonishing throwback to another age".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mithen, Steven|Steven Mithen]], [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n02/steven-mithen/when-we-were-nicer "When We Were Nicer"], a review of ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, ''[[London Review of Books]]'', Vol. 30 No. 2, 24 January 2008, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|Demographic history of Serbia}}
Censuses in Serbia ordinarily take place every 10 years, organized by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. The [[Principality of Serbia]] had conducted the first population census in 1834; the subsequent censuses were conducted in 1841, 1843, 1846, 1850, 1854, 1859, 1863 and 1866 and 1874. During the era [[Kingdom of Serbia]], six censuses were conducted in 1884, 1890, 1895, 1900, 1905 and the last one being in 1910. During the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], censuses were conducted in 1931 and 1921; the census in 1941 was never conducted due to the outbreak of World War II. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]] conducted censuses in 1948, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1981, and 1991. The two most recent censuses were held in 2002 and 2011.

The years since the first 1834 Census saw frequent border changes of Serbia, first amidst the disintegration of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], then subsequent formation and later disintegration of [[Yugoslavia]] and, finally, recent self-proclaimed independence of Kosovo which affected territorial scope in which all these censuse have been conducted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6949">'''English Language Evenings (ELE) ''' is an independent, public, English-language lecture forum established in 1998 by [[Stephen Lapeyrouse]] in Moscow, Russia.

==History==
ELE was founded in 1998 by American [[Stephen Lapeyrouse]] – author, essayist, editor, private English language tutor. In the first three seasons, 1998–2000, the forum was called “English Language Discussion Club” – ELDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/riddle-wrapped-in-english-debate/264961.html|title= Riddle Wrapped in English Debate|work= The Moscow Times|date= March 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Lapeyrouse remained a permanent ELE host and moderator for 17 years. In 2015 he stepped back and devolved this position on John Harrison, editor of the magazine ''Moscow Expat Life'', artist, radio program host of “Brave New World”. John Harrison has retired as a host of ELE II at the end of the 20th season (2017/2018). Now the hosts of ELE III are Oksana Danchevskaya, a Cultural Studies specialist and an Associate Professor at [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]], and Oksana Konstantinova, a translator, an English teacher and an avid traveller to English-speaking countries.

By its 21st season (2018/2019) ELE had hosted more than 300 meetings with more than 230 different speakers from some 12 different countries: from astronauts to adventurers; from ambassadors to attaches of various embassies; visiting and resident professors; [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholars]]; writers and poets; well-known Moscow journalists (from e.g. ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', ''[[The Moscow News]]'', ''[[Russian Journal (website)|Russian Journal]]'') and international TV and radio correspondents (from the [[BBC]], [[Voice of America|VOA]], [[Sky News]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], et al.); social activists; heads of institutions ([[American Chamber of Commerce in Russia|AmCham]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Moscow Center]], [[Amnesty International]], et al.) and just interesting individuals, on a very wide variety of lecture topics.

The list of ELE speakers includes Australian poet and artist David Wansbrough, American diplomat and scholar David Firestein, journalist and blogger [[John Helmer (journalist)|John Helmer]], philosopher [[William Lane Craig]], US diplomat [[James B. Warlick, Jr.|James Warlick]], journalist and editor [[Lynn Berry (Associated Press news personality)|Lynn Berry]], American scholar of public diplomacy [[John H. Brown (scholar)|John H. Brown]], Irish ambassador [[Justin Harman]], US diplomat Tobias Bradford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/intellectual-stimulation-at-english-evenings/205255.html|title=Intellectual Stimulation at English Evenings|work= The Moscow Times|date= May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand diplomat Rowena Hume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/article/english-language-evenings/302393.html|title=English Language Evenings|work= The Moscow Times|date= February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA astronaut [[Alvin Drew|Benjamin Alvin Drew]], Australian ambassador [[Margaret Twomey]], American writer [[Jeff Parker (writer)|Jeff Parker]], Hollywood producer [[Bob Van Ronkel]], humanitarian aid worker [[Carl Wilkens]], British historian [[Geoffrey Roberts]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]’s son Yermolai Solzhenitsyn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/1487/|title=Solzhenitsyn Lecture|work= Passport Moscow|date= March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writer Deidre Dare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/1770/|title=Deidre Dare Passes Judgement on Russian Men|work= Passport Moscow|date= January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. The well-advertised forum is attended both by English-speaking Russians and the members of Moscow’s permanent and changing expat community.

==Purposes==
The purpose of ELE is to provide intelligent, interesting evenings in Moscow in English of ideas, stories and people, in an informal, friendly atmosphere, where the speakers and the public audience are able to interact over a wide variety of topics, allowing for personal contacts and relations between the mostly expat speakers and Russians in Moscow.
In the context of Moscow, ELE is a distant descendent of the [[Lyceum movement]] started in 19th century America, and a direct relative to the “Penny University” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.santacruzpl.org/history/articles/375/|title= Penny University}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], California, founded in 1974 by American historian [[Page Smith]], artist and art historian Mary Holmes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jan/28/local/me-holmes28|title= Mary Holmes, 91; Taught Eccentric Theories of Art|work= Los Angeles Times|date= January 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Paul Lee, philosopher and author,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://ecotopia.org/about/paul-lee-cv/|title= Dr Paul A. Lee – Resume and Curriculum Vita}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, and is still ongoing. The host of ELE participated in the Penny University for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.americanreflections.net/interviews/interview_moscow_news_03_2006_en.html|title= "Penny University" Moscow Style|work= The Moscow News|date= January 27 – February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Meetings are usually held on Fridays twice a month from September to late May at the Chekhov Cultural Center ([[Strastnoy Boulevard]], 6/2, near [[Pushkin Square]]) with lectures by (mostly) native English speakers giving lectures on topics of their own choice. Lectures usually start at 19:00, followed by questions and answers, discussion and comments, ending about 21:00.

Since the 21st season (2018/2019) ELE is absolutely free due to new library rules. For many years the attendance fee was only 200 [[ruble]]s (~$3), as the host tried to limit the influence of money on ELE topics, attendance, attitudes, atmosphere. A modest ''[[honorarium]]'' was offered to speakers, though some had donated theirs to more than a dozen Russian charities over the years (e.g. Russian Orphan Opportunity Fund, Action for Russia’s Children, Moscow Animals, [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers, Big Sisters]], Nastenka, Sofia Foundation, [[United Way Worldwide|United Way]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2782">[[File:Lanterns from below.JPG|thumb|upright|Fanous Ramadan decorations in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]

'''Fanous''' ({{lang-ar|فانوس}} {{IPA-arz|fæˈnuːs|IPA}}, ''pl.'' {{lang|ar|فوانيس}} {{IPA-arz|fæwæˈniːs|}}), meaning lamp or light, is widely associated with '''Fanous Ramadan''' or '''Fanoos Ramdan'''.({{lang-ar| فانوس رمضان}})&lt;ref name="Fanous"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/961/special.htm Fanous]; 2009 article; [[Al-Ahram Weekly Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now commonly known as the '''Ramadan lantern'''.

==Etymology==
The word "Fanous" (''Fanos'', ''Phanos'' and ''Fanoos'' in [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] dialects) is a term of Greek origin transliterated to "candle".  It means 'light' or 'lantern'.  It was historically used in its meaning of "the light of the world," and is a symbol of hope, as in "light in the darkness".

==History==
[[File:Fanous Ramadan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Old Fanous Ramadan from Egypt]]
The traditional use of fanous as decorations associated with Ramadan is believed to have originated during the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], primarily centered in [[Egypt]], where tradition holds that the Caliph [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah]] was greeted by the [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] people holding lanterns to celebrate his arrival at [[Cairo]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]].  Its use has now spread to almost all [[Muslim]] countries. 

[[Image:Fanous.jpg|thumb|250px|rt|Fanous]]
In Ancient times it was similar to a lamp, and would have incorporated either candles or oil.  The fanous originally developed from the torches used in the [[Pharaonic]] festivals celebrating the rising of the star [[Sirius]].  For five days, the [[Ancient Egyptians]] celebrated the birthdays of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], [[Isis]], [[Seth]] and [[Nephtys]]—one on each day—by lighting the streets with the fanous (torches).&lt;ref name="Fanous"/&gt; Torches or candles were also used in early [[Christianity]].  This is recorded by Egyptian historian [[Al-Maqrizi]] (1364 - 1442), who noted in his book, "Al Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar", that these torches or candles were used at [[Christmas]]time for celebration.

==Today==
Fanous is widely used all over the world – especially in Asian regions and the Arab world – not just for a specific religion purposes, but for names of people or decorative purposes.  They can be found in houses, restaurants, hotels, malls, etc.  Often arranged as a grouping of lights arranged in different designs and shapes. Metal and glass are mostly used for their construction.

{{History of Fiji}}
The first three-quarters of the 19th century were marked by tribal warfare, incursions from neighbouring [[Tonga]], and the increasing encroachment of foreign powers.  This period also saw the rise of a warlord by the name of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], who forged the first nation-state covering all of modern Fiji (except the island of [[Rotuma]]) in 1871, before ceding it to the United Kingdom in 1874.

== Tribal warfare and Tongan intrusions ==
[[Image:Urville-Viti-Lebouka2.jpg|thumb|left|Levuka, 1842]]
[[Image:Urville-Viti-interior.jpg|thumb|Fiji 1842]]

In the early 1820s, [[Levuka]] was established as the first modern town in Fiji, on the island of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]].  The intervention of European traders and missionaries, of whom the first arrived from [[Tahiti]] in 1830, led to increasingly serious wars among the native Fijian [[House of Chiefs (Fiji)|confederacies]].  Supplied with weapons by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mercenary]] [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charlie Savage]], [[Ratu]] [[Tanoa Visawaqa]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau|Vunivalu]] (a chiefly title meaning ''Warlord,'' often translated also as ''Paramount Chief'') of [[Bau Island (Fiji)|Bau Island]], defeated the much larger [[Burebasaga|Burebasaga Confederacy]] and succeeded in subduing much of western Fiji.  

His successor, [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], fought to consolidate Bauan domination throughout the 1850s and 1860s, and started calling himself the ''[[Monarchy of Fiji|Tui Viti]],'' or King of Fiji.  He faced opposition from local chiefs who saw him at best as [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]], and also from the Tongan Prince [[Enele Ma'afu]], who had established himself on the Island of [[Lakeba]] in the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] archipelago in 1848.  

A Christian, Ma'afu brought Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga, and the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]] gained its first foothold in Fiji.  Most chiefs in the west regarded the Wesleyan missionaries, aligned as they were seen to be with Ma'afu, as a threat to their power, refused conversion, and resisted missionary attempts to set up outposts in their villages.

== Trouble with the United States ==

Cakobau's claimed position was also undermined by international developments.  The United States threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul, [[John Brown Williams]].  His trading store had been looted by Fijian natives following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a Fourth of July celebration in 1849.  When his [[Nukulau|Nukulau Island]] house was subjected to an arson attack in 1855, the commander of the [[United States Navy|United States naval frigate]] ''[[USS John Adams (1799)|USS John Adams]]'' demanded compensation amounting to 5000 pounds for Williams from Cakobau, as the ''Tui Viti.'' 

This initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling 45,000 pounds.  Cakobau was faced with a dilemma.  To disclaim responsibility for the debt, he would have to deny his self-proclaimed and still far-from-universally accepted sovereignty.  To admit responsibility, he would have to undertake to pay the debt, or else face punishment from the United States Navy. He chose the latter course, hoping that the United States was only bluffing.

Reality began to catch up with Cakobau in 1858, when the [[USS Vandalia (1828)|USS ''Vandalia'']] sailed into Levuka.  Unable to pay his debt, and faced with increasing encroachments onto Viti Levu's south coast from Ma'afu, Cakobau approached the British consul with an offer to cede the islands to the United Kingdom, if only they would assume responsibility for his debt in return for 5,000 square kilometres of land.  

His insistence on being allowed to retain his questionable title of ''Tui Viti'' proved unacceptable to the British government, which turned his offer down after four years of consideration in 1862.  This followed a report from Colonel [[W.J. Smythe]], who had come to the conclusion, after interviewing every Paramount Chief in Fiji, that Cakobau's title was self-assumed and by no means universally accepted by his fellow chiefs, and that he did not have the authority to cede the islands.

== The Kingdom of Fiji ==
{{main|Kingdom of Fiji}}
Cakobau next turned to the Australian-based Polynesia Company.  The rising price of cotton in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) had interested the Polynesia Company in acquiring land in Fiji for planting.  In return for 5,000&amp;nbsp;km², the company agreed to pay Cakobau's debt.  Australian settlers landed on {{convert|575|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in Viti Levu, near what was then a Fijian village called [[Suva]], in 1868.

The Polynesia Company settlers were joined by a further several thousand planters throughout the 1860s and 1870s.  Often fraudulently, they obtained Fijian land, often in exchange for weapons or alcohol.  Competing land claims followed, with no unified government to settle the disputes.  Frustrations peaked following the collapse of cotton prices and the destruction of the crop by hurricanes in 1870.  

In June 1871, [[John Bates Thurston]], the British honorary consul, forged a "marriage of convenience" between Cakobau and the settlers, and persuaded the Fijian chiefs to accept a [[constitutional monarchy]] with Cakobau as king, but with real power in the hands of a [[cabinet (politics)|cabinet]] and [[Legislative Assembly (Fiji)|Legislature]] dominated by settlers.  The Legislative Assembly met for the first time in Levuka in November 1871.

== Cession to the United Kingdom ==
{{See|Colony of Fiji}}
The new arrangements proved no more workable than the old.  Within months, government overspending had led to the accumulation of another unmanageable debt.  In 1872, following continuing economic and social unrest, Thurston approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands.  The British were much more sympathetic to annexing Fiji this time than they had been almost two decades earlier.

The murder of Bishop [[John Coleridge Patteson]] of the [[Melanesian Mission]] at [[Nukapu]] in the [[Reef Islands]] had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 Fijians on board the brig ''Carl.''  Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation.  The question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]], with both men vacillating for many months.

On 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the British accepted.  On 23 September, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], soon to be appointed the British [[Governor of Fiji]], arrived on [[HMS Dido (1869)|HMS ''Dido'']] and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his ''[[Tui Viti]]'' title.

The formal cession took place on 10 October 1874, when Cakobau, Ma'afu, and some of the senior Chiefs of Fiji signed two copies of the [[Deed of Cession (Fiji)|Deed of Cession]].  Thus the [[Colony of Fiji]] was founded; 96 years of British rule followed.

[[Gender inequality]] can be found in various areas of Salvadoran life such as employment, health, education, political participation, and family life.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Combined third and fourth periodic reports of States Parties, El Salvador, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;UNDP, Human Development Report, United Nations, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?q%3DHDI%26id%3D273 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612085300/http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?q=HDI&amp;id=273 |archivedate=June 12, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although '''women in [[El Salvador]]''' enjoy equal protection under the law, they are often at a disadvantage relative to their male counterparts.
In the area of politics, women have the same rights as men, but the percentage of women in office compared to men is low. Though much progress has been made since the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] ended in 1992, women in El Salvador still face gender inequality.

==Background==
[[File:Woman_and_girl_in_el_salvador_making_bread.png|thumb|A woman and a girl in El Salvador making bread, 1910s.]]
El Salvador is a country in Central America. Most of its population is [[Mestizo]], but there are also white and indigenous (Amerindian) Salvadorans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/es.html |title=The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency |website=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was the scene of a brutal civil war, the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], between 1979 –  1992, which subjected women to extreme violence. More than half of Salvadorans are [[Roman Catholic]], with the next group being that of [[Protestants]] (see [[Religion in El Salvador]]).

==Ratification of CEDAW==
On August 19, 1981, El Salvador ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]), which defines discrimination and establishes an agenda for national action to end such discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en#1 |title=UNTC |website=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627142720/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=June 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing, El Salvador made one reservation to article 29 paragraph 1. The paragraph states that any dispute between states that is not resolved through negotiation shall go to arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved through arbitration within 6 months, the case shall then go to the International Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;CEDAW, El Salvador, Article 29:1&lt;/ref&gt; 

In reviewing the combined third and fourth, and fifth and sixth periodic reports submitted by El Salvador in 2003, the CEDAW committee expressed concern that the laws and policies against inequality had not been effectively implemented; the Salvadoran Constitution did not specifically prohibit [[gender discrimination]] and did not include the definition of discrimination included in the Convention; and the Penal Code only sanctioned "serious" discrimination. In the seventh periodic report in 2007, the government of El Salvador responded to the Committee that the Salvadoran Constitution does address the issues of concern, citing articles 32, 37, 53, 65, 71, 72, and 101 of the country's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/335/44/PDF/N0733544.pdf?OpenElement] {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although CEDAW may be correct in referring to El Salvador's lack of implementation, the Salvadoran Constitution does address the issue of discrimination.

In 1996, prior to the Committee's review of El Salvador's compliance with CEDAW, the government of El Salvador established the Institute for Development of Women. The Institute seeks to ensure that action plans created by the government to protect women are implemented effectively.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, CEDAW, Combined Third and Fourth Period Report of States Parties, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2011, the General Assembly passed the Law of Equality, Fairness, and the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which improves the judicial framework for protecting [[women's rights]] by implementing a set of regulations. The law mandates equality in pay between men and women and recognizes the value of [[domestic labor]]. In addition, it helps protect the rights of rural women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/2011/12/a-salvadoran-law-to-achieve-equality-between-men-and-women/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822201849/http://www.unwomen.org/2011/12/a-salvadoran-law-to-achieve-equality-between-men-and-women/ |archivedate=August 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health and rights==
[[File:US Navy 070728-N-7088A-224 Senior Chief Operations Specialist Gene Demers, attached to the Military Sealift Command hospital ship USNS Comfort (T-AH 20), hands out teddy bears to children at Unidad de Salud Health Center in Aca.jpg|thumb|300 px|Mothers with children]]
In 2015, the [[maternal mortality]] ratio in El Salvador was 54 deaths/100,000 live births and the [[total fertility rate]] was 1.91 children born/woman.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

During the 2005–2009 period, 94 percent of Salvadoran pregnant women received at least one antenatal visit, which is above the 84.1 percent average for their Human Development group. In addition, 96 percent of all births were attended by skilled health personnel, compared to the 78.1 percent average for their respective group, signifying stronger [[reproductive health]] status among women.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;

[[Reproductive rights]] of women in El Salvador are highly restricted. The [[abortion in El Salvador|abortion policy in El Salvador]] is one of the most restrictive in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/ |title=United Nations Population Division Home Page |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is illegal in all cases, even when the mother's life is endangered. Currently both major political parties, ARENA on the right and FMLN on the left, have anti-abortion platforms. Prior to 1999, the FMLN had a moderate stance on abortion. They were against it except when the health of the mother is in danger, but after strong opposition and not winning an election since its founding, the FMLN switched its stance and allowed their representatives to "vote their conscience". In 1999, a constitutional amendment was passed, putting in place the current policy, with 72 favorable votes in a legislative assembly of 84 members. There were 12 abstentions, and no negative votes.&lt;ref name="Left and Life"&gt;Viterna, Jocelyn, 2012. ''The Left and "Life" in El Salvador''. Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; 

The penalty for getting an abortion can range from two to eight years if convicted and abortion practitioners can receive prison terms of six to 12 years. If a judge rules that the [[fetus]] is viable, then the ruling can be switched to aggravated [[homicide]], which can result in the woman receiving 30–50 years of prison.&lt;ref name="Left and Life"/&gt; During the abortion debate, dialogue between opposing sides brought to light the state of gender inequality in the country. Some politicians and activists suggested that women should not sleep with men if they did not want to become pregnant. In "The Left and Life in El Salvador," Jocelyn Viterna points out that such views powerfully ignore the reality for many Salvadoran women, given that many of them have little control over their own sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="Left and Life"/&gt; In 2017 Maria Teresa Rivera became the first woman in the world granted asylum because of being wrongly jailed for disregarding a ban on abortion; she disregarded the ban in El Salvador and was given asylum in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moloney |first=Anastasia |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-abortion-idUSKBN1771QP |title=Sweden welcomes Salvadoran woman wrongly jailed for abortion in asylum first |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As in other Latin American countries, [[cohabitation]] is very common, with formal marriage being practised by the upper classes. In the 1990s, 73% of births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/DYBNat/NatStatTab13.pdf |format=PDF |title=13. Live births by legitimacy status, and percent illegitimate: 1990 – 1998 |website=Unstats.un.org |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other countries of the region, formal marriage is a marker of status and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/Mesa_46_Castro%20Mart%C3%ADn%20et%20al.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091547/http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/Mesa_46_Castro%20Mart%C3%ADn%20et%20al.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Apopa_1990_28.jpg|thumb|Salvadoran school girls in 1990.]]
Although primary school participation rates are similar for both men and women, secondary education rates differ significantly. In 2011, 47.5 percent of men 25 and older had a secondary education and only 40.5 percent of women 25 and older obtained the same level. Both of these are below the average for El Salvador's Human Development group, which reports 57.7 percent for men and 41.2 percent for women.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt; 

The low percentage of the population with a secondary education reflect a history of limited educational resources, especially in rural areas, where 70% of schools only offered schooling until grade 5 in the 1970s. In those that did offer secondary education, there was a high rate of attrition among women, who left school to help with domestic work, including caring for younger siblings, working in the fields, or tending animals.&lt;ref name="mongabay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/history/el_salvador/el_salvador-education.html |title=El Salvador-Education |website=Mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, about 5 percent of rural school-aged children reached grade 9.&lt;ref name="mongabay" /&gt; As of 2015, [[literacy]] rates are still higher for men than women: 90.4% for males and 86% for females (aged 15 and over).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Employment==
Women in El Salvador are employed at lower rates than men, and on average make less in wages compared to their male counterparts. Nevertheless, as of 2014, women made 42.2% of the labor force. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS |title=Labor force, female (% of total labor force) &amp;#124; Data |website=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employed, women on average make 11.5 percent less than employed men. This disparity only increases as years of schooling increases. According to the USAID, "In 2006, women with 10–12 years of education earned 15 percent less than men with the same level of education; women with 13 years or more of education earned 24 percent less than men with similar education levels; and women with 1–3 years of education earned 6 percent less than men with 1–3 years of education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/wid/pubs/El_Salvador_Gender_Assessment_Mar-2010_508.pdf |title=U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Transition.usaid.gov |date=August 10, 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-17 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; USAID attributes these differences to gender discrimination in both occupation and wages.

[[Maquiladora]] employment is one area of debate among scholars of women's export sector employment. Maquiladoras are foreign-owned factories that employ mostly women in the production of textiles for export. In 2008, women maquila workers made up 80 percent of total employed women in the country, and about 50 percent of them were single mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/maq427.pdf |title=Am Lat Maquilas 427-3esp WIP.qxd |website=Fidh.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/impact-central-america-free-trade-agreement-central-american-textile-maquila-industry?print |title=The impact of the Central America Free Trade Agreement on the Central American textile maquila industry |publisher=IFPRI |date=January 1, 2005 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 report, the CEDAW Committee reported that the maquiladora industry was responsible for a widespread denial of women's labor rights. The report cites some of the violations as lack of access to social security and maternity benefits, poor working conditions, and exposure to violence and [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130616115514/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,CEDAW,,SLV,,494ba8d20,0.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall effect of these factories on [[gender inequality]] is contested. Scholars such as Linda Lim and [[Naila Kabeer]] argue that the maquila sector has not had a negative effect on women.  In 1990, Lim argued that maquiladoras offer women a good alternative and an opportunity to work in the formal sector.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Linda (1990). "Women's Work in Export Factories: the Politics of a Cause" in Irene Tinker (ed.) 'Persistent Inequalities, New York: Oxford University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Kabeer argued that the factory work can build women’s self-esteem and independence.&lt;ref&gt;Kabeer, Naila. 2004. ‘‘Globalization, Labor Standards, and Women’s Rights: Dilemmas of Collective (In)Action in an Interdependent World.’’ Feminist Economics 10(1): 3–35&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, however, Edme Dominguez et al. argued against the positive portrayal made by Lim and Kabeer. They make the point that [[gender]] relations have changed very little since the proliferation of maquiladoras.&lt;ref name="Dominguez pp. 186-189"&gt;Dominguez et al., 2010, Women Workers in the Maquiladoras and the Debate on Global Labor Standards, Feminist Economics, 16(4) pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt; They say that the low levels of income earned by female workers acts as only a means of survival and does not allow them to "question the [[patriarchal]] gender order".&lt;ref name="Dominguez pp. 186-189"/&gt;

==Conditional cash transfers==
[[Conditional cash transfer]] programs (CCTs) are government-led initiatives that seek to reduce poverty by making welfare programs conditional upon certain criteria. The recipient of government aid must meet the specified criteria in order for the aid to be disbursed. In El Salvador, conditional cash transfers are one component of ''Red Solidaria'', the main welfare program aimed at helping the country's poorest population. Upon its enactment in 2005, ''Red Solidaria'' brought into effect conditional cash transfers targeted to families with pregnant women and children under 15 years old who had not received education beyond the 6th grade. The aid was conditional on basic health activities and school attendance. It also included lifelong learning sessions for beneficiary families. The use of the cash transfers was stipulated for food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Britto, Tatiana (2007). [http://www.ipc-undp.org/pub/IPCCountryStudy9.pdf The Challenges of El Salvador's Conditional Cash Transfer Programme], Red Solidaria. International Poverty Center (9)&lt;/ref&gt; The program positively affected poverty reduction and reduced income inequality, as well as outcomes at time of birth, such as skilled attendance of health professionals and live births in a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Brauw, Alan and Peterman, Amber (2011). [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01080.pdf Can Conditional Cash Transfers Improve Maternal Health and Birth Outcomes?] International Food Policy Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Juliana Franzoni and Koen Voorend acknowledge the positive effects that CCTs had on poverty reduction and enhanced income inequality, they argue that the transfers did little to impact unequal gender relations. While the CCTs helped women in some positive ways, Franzoni and Voorend argue that the CCTs did little to change the "patriarchal maternalism", or the viewing of women primarily as mothers instead of workers or citizens, which shapes Latin American social policy.&lt;ref&gt;Franzoni, Juliana and Voorend, Koen (2012).

==Political involvement==
[[File:Marisol Argueta de Barillas, World Economic Forum on Latin America 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Marisol Argueta de Barillas]], Foreign Minister of El Salvador 2008–2009.]]
Men and women in El Salvador have the same rights to vote, run for office, organize, etc., but actual participation among women is considerably lower than men. Although the involvent of women in politics has traditionally been low,&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt; it has increased in recent years: according to a 2007 CEDAW report, the Government of El Salvador had pushed for increased involvement in municipalities, resulting in increased participation at this level.&lt;ref&gt;CEDAW (2007), Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 18 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: El Salvador, Seventh Periodic Report of States Parties, CEDAW/C/SLV/7, CEDAW, New York, NY, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, women made 32.10% of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archivedate=March 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to improve overall participation among women, the Association of Salvadoran Women Parliamentarians and ex-Parliamentarians (ASPARLEXSAL) was formed in 2003. With support from the United Nations Democracy Fund, the Association offers training and resources to women looking to get involved in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/democracyfund/XNewsSalvadorasparlexsal.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623165639/http://www.un.org/democracyfund/XNewsSalvadorasparlexsal.htm |archivedate=June 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes against women==
Crimes against women in El Salvador are prevalent even though violence and discrimination are illegal in the country. The [[US State Department]] addressed the issue of sexual harassment in its 2010 Human Rights Report. The law defines sexual harassment as any unwanted physical contact; it does not address non-physical contact such as verbal harassment. The report says that estimation of the exact prevalence of the problem is difficult because of how much it is underreported, but there were 367 complaints of sexual harassment through July 2010, which resulted in 138 trials, and only 11 convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154505.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: El Salvador |website=State.gov |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penal code in El Salvador prohibits [[sex trafficking]], as well as all forms of human trafficking, with conviction resulting in four to eight years of prison.&lt;ref name="State Dept p. 149"/&gt; Compared to other offenses, the punishment for trafficking is not commensurate. Rape for example, carries a punishment of six to 20 years imprisonment for those convicted. In 2011, Salvadoran officials reported investigating 76 potential cases of human trafficking, with 15 traffickers being convicted.&lt;ref name="State Dept p. 149"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/192595.pdf |format=PDF |title=Denmark |page=149 |website=2.paho.org |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prison sentence for those convicted ranged from four to nine years imprisonment. Fifteen convictions was five times that of the previous year, which had only three convictions. The U.S. State Department identified corruption as one main obstacle to conviction of sex traffickers, citing a 2011 case where the charges of nine suspected traffickers were dismissed because the judge said that the underage victims should have been prosecuted for having false identity documents.&lt;ref name="State Dept p. 149"/&gt;

[[Femicide]]s, or the killing of women because they are women, have become more frequent in recent years, with 2011 having the highest number to date – 628.&lt;ref name="ORMUSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observatoriodeviolencia.ormusa.org/feminicidios.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209010658/http://observatoriodeviolencia.ormusa.org/feminicidios.php |archivedate=February 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the number decreased to 320 in 2012, it is of particular interest when looking at gender inequality as it is the most serious form of [[gender discrimination]]. In "No More Killings! Women Respond to Femicides in Central America," Marina Prieto Carron et al., argue that femicide is one manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality, discrimination, economic disempowerment, and [[machismo]] that exists in Latin America. They argue that femicide represents a backlash against women who are empowered and have moved away from traditional female roles.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Prieto-Carrón, Marilyn Thomson and Mandy Macdonald (2007). "No More Killings! Women Respond to Femicides in Central America" Gender and Development, Vol. 15, No. 1. Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual crimes in El Salvador are disproportionately women. Of the total 3,436 sexual abuse convictions in 2011, 88% of the victims were female. In 2011, there were 224 rape convictions, though many incidents are not reported due to social and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="ORMUSA"/&gt;

===Domestic abuse===
Under national law, women have the same rights as men do in a marriage relationship. The minimum age for marriage is 18, but marriage can be legally entered into at the age of 14 if the couple has reached puberty, if the woman is pregnant, or if they have had a child together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,CRC,,SLV,,42d3c19c4,0.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Constitution speaks out against inequality in marriage. Under Article 36 of the Constitution, "Spouses have equal rights and duties, and since they have decided to share their lives, they must live together, be faithful to one another and assist each other in all circumstances and situations."&lt;ref name="CEDAW p. 34"&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/589/77/PDF/N0158977.pdf] {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also makes clear that, "Housework and child care shall be the responsibility of both spouses."&lt;ref name="CEDAW p. 34"/&gt; However, these principles do not always hold true in practice.

[[Domestic abuse]] in El Salvador is prohibited under the law and sentencing can result in one to three years in prison, but the law is not always well enforced.  In 2010, the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women reported that they had received 4,732 reports of domestic violence. The Office of the Attorney General investigated only 661 cases of domestic violence during the same year. The investigations led to only 3 convictions, with 71 cases resolved through [[mediation]].&lt;ref name="State Dept p. 17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154505.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: El Salvador |website=State.gov |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though the number of official reports appears high, in reality cases are underreported to government entities. In a study done by the Pan-American Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2012, 26.3% of women in El Salvador reported that they had experienced some sort of physical or sexual violence from their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/violence-against-women-lac.pdf |format=PDF |title=Violence Against Women in Latin American and the Caribbean |website=2.paho.org |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underreporting of incidents may be due to the fact that in 2010 domestic violence was considered socially acceptable by a large portion of the population.&lt;ref name="State Dept p. 17"/&gt; One cultural challenge that El Salvador faces in moving towards gender equality in the home is that of [[machismo]], which is strong, or aggressive masculine pride. The practice can take the form of husbands being overbearing or controlling and even extend to physical or verbal abuse.

The 2011 Law for a Life Free of Violence against Women (Ley Especial Integral para una
Vida Libre de Violencia para las Mujeres) contains 61 articles that criminalize various forms of [[violence against women]], such as domestic violence, including [[marital rape]], psychological abuse, and economical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgr.gob.sv/genero/descargas/ley%20especial%20integral%20para%20una%20vida%20libre%20de%20violencia%20para%20las%20mujeres_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ley Especial Inbegral para una Vida Libre de Violencia para las Mujeres |website=Pgr.gob.sdv |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7158">The '''Global Interdependence Center''' (GIC) is a [[Philadelphia]]-based [[non-profit organization]] that holds conferences and programming to increase global dialogue and promote [[free trade]], in order to improve cooperation and understanding among nation states, with the goal of reducing international conflicts and improving worldwide living standards.&lt;ref name="GIC" /&gt;  

== History ==

The GIC was founded in 1976 during Philadelphia's Bicentennial Celebration at convocation of leading United Nations and U.S. officials.&lt;ref name="GIC"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=http://www.interdependence.org/About.Us.php |publisher=Global Interdependence Center |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vision was affirmed in a Declaration of Interdependence, which was crafted by historian [[Henry Steele Commager]] and signed by international dignitaries. Early leaders in the organization included Nobel Laureate Dr. [[Lawrence Klein]], Benjamin Franklin Professor of Economics and Finance at the University of Pennsylvania.

== Notable Programming ==

GIC hosts and sponsors many programs throughout the year, both in Philadelphia, where it is based, and abroad. Programming comprises international trips, domestic conferences and roundtable discussions.  Included among these programs are:

'''Annual Monetary and Trade Conference:'''  This gathering together of global leaders has been held since 1979.   Past speakers include [[Paul Volcker]], chair of the International Accounting Standards Board and former chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, [[Lawrence Kudlow]] and [[Robert Hormats]], noted [[free-market]] economists, as well as chief economists for the [[International Monetary Fund]] and representatives from global finance and trade organizations.

'''The Central Banking Series:'''  This series assembles well-known bankers to speak on their countries' monetary policies, their views on U.S. economics and the business ramifications of monetary systems.  Recent speakers have included [[Christian Noyer]], governor of the Banque de France and [[Richard W. Fisher|Richard Fisher]], president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 17, 2008 |title=Challenges for Monetary Policy in a Globalized Economy |url=http://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2008/fs080117.cfm |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GIC Abroad:''' Delegations have visited France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 26, 2012 |title= Should Central Banks Help Governments Run Bigger Deficits? |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/03/26/should-central-banks-help-governments-run-bigger-deficits/?KEYWORDS=global+society+of+fellows |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 11, 2007|title=Is Price Stability Attainable? |url=http://www.clevelandfed.org/For_the_Public/News_and_Media/Speeches/2007/Pianalto_20070611.cfm |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia, Chile, South Africa and Israel. Delegations generally include business leaders from the United States as well as representatives from central banks of various nations.

'''Celebration of Interdependence:''' Formerly the Annual Black Tie Gala, the annual Celebration in Philadelphia sees the presentation of the Global Citizen Award to individuals who demonstrate exceptional service to the increasingly global community. Recent honorees include Anthony Santomero, former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 14, 2005 |title=Santomero receives Global Citizen Award |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2005/07/11/daily41.html |publisher=''Philadelphia Business Journal'' |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Heavener, executive vice president and head of Wachovia Bank's Global Financial Institution and Trade Division, in 2006, Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], president of Drexel University, in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=November 18, 2008 |title=Dr. Constantine Papadakis Biography |url=http://www.drexel.edu/papadakis/biography3.asp |publisher=Drexel University |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024131110/http://www.drexel.edu/papadakis/biography3.asp |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward G.

'''Homeless dumping''' or '''patient dumping''' is the practice of [[hospital]]s and [[emergency service]]s inappropriately releasing [[homeless]] or indigent patients to public hospitals or on the streets instead of placing them with a [[homeless shelter]] or retaining them, especially when they may require expensive medical care with minimal government reimbursement from [[Medicaid]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dumped On Skid Row |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/17/60minutes/main2823079.shtml |work= |publisher=[[60 Minutes]] |date= May 17, 2007|access-date=2007-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=L.A. charges hospital in dumping of homeless |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15752013 |work= |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=November 16, 2006 |access-date=2007-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rice MF, Jones W | title = The uninsured and patient dumping: recent policy responses in indigent care | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 83 | issue = 10 | pages = 874–80 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1800761 | pmc = 2571592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term homeless dumping has been used since the late 19th century and has resurfaced throughout the 20th century alongside legislation and policy changes aimed at addressing the issue.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; Different research studies have had mixed results as to the effectiveness of the United States' policy interventions and have propose varying ideas to remedy the issue.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Hylton, Maria|date=1992|title=The Economics and Politics of Emergency Health Care for the Poor: The Patient Dumping Dilemma|url=https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/lawreview/vol1992/iss4/14|journal=BYU Law Review|language=en|volume=1992|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The term "patient dumping" was first mentioned in several [[The New York Times|New York Times]] articles published in late 1870's, which described the practice of private New York hospitals transporting poor and sickly patients by horse drawn ambulance to [[NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue|Bellevue Hospital]], the city's preeminent public facility.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abel E | title = Patient dumping in New York City, 1877-1917 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 101 | issue = 5 | pages = 789–95 | date = May 2011 | pmid =  | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2010.300005 | access-date =  | pmc = 3076414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jarring ride and lack of stabilized care typically resulted in death of the patient and outrage of the public.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; Scholars report that private hospital administrations were motivated by a desire to keep mortality rates and costs down when they advised ambulance drivers to send poor patients in critical condition directly to the public hospitals like Bellevue even if a private hospital was closer.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; After the deaths associated with patient dumping or inappropriate patient transfer added up, the first attempt at legislative reform in the United States was pushed through the New York Senate around 1907, largely by [[Julius Harburger]].&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; The legislation penalized private hospitals when they sent ill patients away or obligated staff to transfer them to another hospital.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; Notwithstanding the passage of city ordinances prohibiting the practice, it continued.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; The practice of patient dumping continued for several decades, and in the 1960s it was brought back into the public eye by the media, but not much was done to resolve the issue.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; Many [[Homelessness and mental health|homeless people who have mental health problems]] can no longer find a place in a [[psychiatric hospital]] because of the trend towards mental health [[deinstitutionalization]] from the 1960s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scherl DJ, Macht LB | title = Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus | journal = Hospital &amp; Community Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 9 | pages = 599–604 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 223959 | doi = 10.1176/ps.30.9.599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rochefort DA | title = Origins of the "Third psychiatric revolution": the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 | journal = Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 | date = Spring 1984 | pmid = 6736594 | doi = 10.1215/03616878-9-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980's resurface in the public eye and policy interventions  ===
"Patient dumping" resurfaced in the 1980s, nationwide, with private hospitals refusing to examine or treat the poor and uninsured in the emergency departments (ED) and transferring them to public hospitals for further care and treatment.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiff RL, Ansell DA, Schlosser JE, Idris AH, Morrison A, Whitman S | title = Transfers to a public hospital.

=== Early 21st century policy ===
Homeless dumping continued to be an issue in the United States into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; University of California Los Angeles professor, Abel (2011) claimed that these policy interventions have not been effective because the United States' health care system is too heavily influenced by the patients ability to pay.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt;  In the early 21st century, immigrant groups were vulnerable to patient dumping by being deported or repatriated which in many cases led to their death.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; Research articles also describe dumping of homeless individuals or mentally ill individuals by police as another form of inappropriately shifting people from one area of a city to another instead of taking them to adequate care facilities like shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=William R.|last2=Dunn|first2=Thomas M.|title=Dumping: Police-Initiated Transjurisdictional Transport of Troublesome Persons|journal=Police Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=339–358|doi=10.1177/1098611102250586}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September of 2014, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report entitled "Patient Dumping."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, [https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/docs/2014PATDUMPOSD_9282014-1.pdf Patient Dumping] (September 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
A report published in 2001 by the Public Citizen's Health Research Group stated that there were widespread violations of EMTALA throughout the United States in 527 hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizen.org/our-work/health-and-safety/questionable-hospitals-2001-patient-dumping-hospital-emergency|title=Questionable Hospitals 2001: Patient Dumping by Hospital Emergency Rooms|last=|first=|date=|website=Public Citizen|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005 and 2014 another study reported 43% of the US hospitals studied had been under EMTALA investigation which resulted citations for 27% of the hospitals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terp|first=Sophie|last2=Seabury|first2=Seth A.|last3=Arora|first3=Sanjay|last4=Eads|first4=Andrew|last5=Lam|first5=Chun Nok|last6=Menchine|first6=Michael|date=February 2017|title=Enforcement of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, 2005 to 2014|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=69|issue=2|pages=155–162.e1|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2016.05.021|issn=1097-6760|pmid=27496388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other findings of this study were that the number of EMTALA violations have been decreasing for the period between 2005 and 2014,  and that the majority of the citations were given to hospitals for issues with policy enforcement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, there is not a consensus among researchers about how to effectively measure the effects of EMTALA at reducing patient dumping or improving patient care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Associated factors ==
Patients living in poverty or in homelessness are often seen as less than ideal patients for hospital administrations because they are unlikely to be able to pay for their healthcare and tend to be hospitalized with severe illness.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt; Other factors associated with patient dumping are being a part of minority group and being uninsured.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt; Historically, hospitals have been reported to compete against each other to maintain low mortality rates at the expense of low-income patients.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt; Competition within hospitals to see more patients and faster also increases the rate of inappropriate patient discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kellermann AL, Hackman BB | title = Patient 'dumping' post-COBRA | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 80 | issue = 7 | pages = 864–7 | date = July 1990 | pmid = 2356913 | pmc = 1404974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers and scholars trace the issue of homeless dumping to the issue of homelessness and claim that addressing the issues of homelessness will prevent patient dumping.&lt;ref name="Cohen_1992" /&gt; The increase of homelessness and poverty rates increases the number of people who are unable to pay for consistent healthcare which leads to emergency hospitalization of patients with exacerbated medical conditions.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fader HC, Phillips CN | title = Frequent-user patients: reducing costs while making appropriate discharges | journal = Healthcare Financial Management | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 98–100, 102, 104 passim | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22420142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors have allowed homelessness and poverty rates to further increase, and deinstitutionalization has led to psychiatric patients to lose access to services and be dumped on the streets.&lt;ref name="Cohen_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen CI, Thompson KC | title = Psychiatry and the homeless | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 383–6 | date = September 1992 | pmid = 1486144 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3223(92)90126-k }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention strategies ==
The introduction of Medicaid and Medicare had helped hospitals shoulder the burden of providing care to poverty-level and elderly patients, but the many people in United States without health insurance were still vulnerable to inappropriate patient transfer or dumping.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt; Scholars and researchers point to these patients' lack of access to preventative and consistent healthcare treatment as well as inappropriate discharge procedures and follow-up protocols as the causes behind the frequent rehospitalization.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt;

In 1985 Illinois developed the Illinois Competitive Access and Reimbursement Equity (ICARE) program, but it had adverse effects like disrupting indigent patient's continuity of care, losing patients, and creating 2 hospital systems: one for uninsured lower-income patients and one for insured higher-income patients.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brider_1987" /&gt; The ICARE policy had a negative impact on the quality of healthcare that low-income and homeless patients received because it created disjointed treatment experiences when hospitals met their allocated funding quota and transferred patients to (or dumped patients on) other hospitals that still had funding and public hospitals.&lt;ref name="Brider_1987" /&gt; Proponents of the ICARE policy cited the reduction in Illinois' Medicare expenditure as evidence of the policy's success.&lt;ref name="Brider_1987" /&gt;

The 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) was meant to regulate Medicare-participating hospitals and ensure that patients received appropriate medical treatment regardless of their ability to pay.&lt;ref name="Kahntroff_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahntroff J, Watson R | title = Refusal of emergency care and patient dumping | journal = The Virtual Mentor | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–53 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 23190486 | doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2009.11.1.hlaw1-0901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars described how EMTALA provided a means to take legal action against healthcare providers and hospitals that did not comply, and provided examples of cases in Florida, California, and North Carolina.&lt;ref name="Kahntroff_2009" /&gt; Even though hospitals have had to pay penalties, patient dumping remained an issue throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Kahntroff_2009" /&gt; Legal scholars, Kahntroff and Watson (2009) also reported that the implementation of the policy has been flawed with issues of lack of adherence and confusion on what is compliance.&lt;ref name="Kahntroff_2009" /&gt; A study that looked at 5,594 hospitals in the United States between 2005 and 2014 reported that the number of EMTALA investigations has decreased through that period which may be an indication that hospitals and physicians are improving their adherence to EMTALA protocols.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The decrease in EMTALA investigations might also indicate that patient access to emergency care  and treatment is improving.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers also interviewed doctors who reported that EMTALA citation fines were a disincentive to violate EMTALA protocols.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1988 the COBRA Act was meant to be a series of revised regulations which required hospital emergency rooms to treat every patient that walked through the door and doubled the fine for violations.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt; News Editor for the American Journal of Nursing, Brider (1987) reported that public hospital staff in Illinois were under a lot of pressure due to the influx of patients that were being sent to them from other hospitals, and that the incidence of patient transfers or patient dumping increased through a loop whole in COBRA.&lt;ref name="Brider_1987" /&gt;

The incentives offered to doctors in terms of payment for their services have an effect with patient care outcomes and can minimize the chance of patient dumping or shifting patients to other providers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Jessica|last2=Kurtzman|first2=Ellen T.|last3=Hibbard|first3=Judith H.|last4=Overton|first4=Valerie|date=2015-05-01|title=Working Under a Clinic-Level Quality Incentive: Primary Care Clinicians’ Perceptions|url=http://www.annfammed.org/content/13/3/235|journal=The Annals of Family Medicine|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=235–241|doi=10.1370/afm.1779|issn=1544-1709|pmid=25964401|pmc=4427418}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted on doctors at the Fairview Health Services hospital in Minnesota reported that grouping doctors into teams to incentivize collaboration between the doctors to ensure the average of the team provided high quality health care for the patient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But doctors who out performed other doctors on their teams did not like the program because the other doctors who were underperforming did not have the incentive to improve. Some of the doctors interviewed in the study claimed that underperforming doctors would only start providing better care if their pay was affected by their lower quality services.

=== Discussion of intervention strategies ===
Some researchers and scholars have concluded that despite the policy interventions of the 1980s, the practice of patient dumping continued to be a problem in the United States and that a solution required a reformation of the entire healthcare system.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt; These researchers shared the opinion that the most effective solution to address the health care needs of people living in poverty and those who are homeless is to provide universal healthcare because that would eliminate hospitals incentives to turn patients away based on their ability to pay for services.&lt;ref name="Abel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahntroff_2009" /&gt; Other researchers emphasize that better developed protocols and procedures for patient discharge are one of the most important strategies to reduce rehospitalization rates because patients living in homelessness and poverty lack appropriate dwelling to continue the recuperation process.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochron_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hochron | first = Jean L. | last2 = Brown | first2 = Ellen M. | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 2013 | title = Ensuring Appropriate Discharge Practices for Hospitalized Homeless Patients | journal = World Medical &amp; Health Policy | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–181 | doi = 10.1002/wmh3.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another strategy to minimize rehospitalization rates proposed by researchers was to create recuperation programs for patient who lack access to one after they are discharge.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt;  Respite programs can be especially helpful for homeless patients to have safe places to recuperate and stop the cycle of chronic re-admittance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doran|first=Kelly M.|last2=Greysen|first2=S. Ryan|last3=Cunningham|first3=Alison|last4=Tynan-McKiernan|first4=Kathleen|last5=Lucas|first5=Georgina I.|last6=Rosenthal|first6=Marjorie S.|title=Improving post-hospital care for people who are homeless: Community-based participatory research to community-based action|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2015.07.006|journal=Healthcare|volume=3|issue=4|pages=238–244|doi=10.1016/j.hjdsi.2015.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted using information about homeless patients in New Haven, Connecticut reported that homeless patients had a 22% higher hospital readmittance rate than patients with insurance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regional or community wide programs to oversee under-resourced patient recuperation or respite care seem to be the most sustainable because they pool resources from multiple hospitals and a larger population to provide appropriate recuperation facilities and minimize the risk of any one hospital or healthcare facility from having to provide the majority of the resources and cost associated with the increase of patients from the area's underserved patient population.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt; Researchers say that the cost of rehospitalizing patients for more critical conditions is higher than the cost of providing appropriate healthcare and following careful patient discharge procedures, which in some cases are beyond the requirements outlined by policies like the EMTALA.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt;

However, there are studies that have indicated that hospitals sometimes face delays when discharging a homeless patient because they also have the responsibility of finding appropriate housing and care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Patients can also face adverse effects if they are hospitalized for longer than what is necessary because it increases their chance of transmitting an infectious disease in the hospital or it draws resources from other patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendy|first=P.|last2=Patel|first2=J.

== Global perspective ==

=== Canada ===
A study conducted on physicians in Ontario investigated how different payment systems impacted patient care in terms of the number of cost shifts and dumping incidences and reported that other factors like altruism or ethics of the doctors and patient behavior played a role in how doctors shifted costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kantarevic|first=Jasmin|last2=Kralj|first2=Boris|title=Risk selection and cost shifting in a prospective physician payment system: Evidence from Ontario|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.10.002|journal=Health Policy|volume=115|issue=2-3|pages=249–257|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers hold the view that the [[Healthcare in Canada|Canadian healthcare system]] is better designed to minimize the occurrences of patient dumping.&lt;ref name="Rice_1992" /&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
A study published in 2006 that used voluntary surveys in its methods claimed that the results of the surveys indicated patient dumping was a problem within [[Taiwan]]'s healthcare system.&lt;ref name="Lin_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin HC, Kao S, Tang CH, Yang MC, Lee HS | title = Factors contributing to patient dumping in Taiwan | journal = Health Policy | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–12 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16150511 | doi = 10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.07.009 | url = http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw//bitstream/246246/158857/1/37.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers report that funding issues with government budgets and pressure that hospitals felt to stay competitive were among of the contributing factors to patient dumping.&lt;ref name="Lin_2006" /&gt; A previous study published in 2003 also supported the claim that Taiwan's healthcare system is negatively impacted by patient dumping in terms of healthcare quality and increased costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin HC, Yang MC, Chen CC, Tang CH | title = Opinions of hospital administrators toward the prevalence of patient dumping in Taiwan | journal = Chang Gung Medical Journal | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–43 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 15074888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the a study conducted in the [[United Kingdom]] the issue of inappropriately discharging a patient has more to do with delaying the discharge than expediting the discharge.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2004 a report was published in the UK that claimed that prisons were overcrowded and that one of the populations at risk of living in adverse conditions were mentally ill incarcerated individuals who were dumped in prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Rachael|title=Deaths in UK prisons are due to overcrowding, says report|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15481-0|journal=The Lancet|volume=363|issue=9406|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(04)15481-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

=== Other associated names or terms ===
Other terms used in related to the practice of patient dumping are frequent-user patient, revolving-door, and bed block-blockers.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt; These terms were contrived by some hospital staff who noted how these patients had reoccurring hospitalizations.&lt;ref name="Fader_2012" /&gt; Other ways homeless dumping is described is with phrases like inappropriate patient discharges and economically motivated transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schlesinger M, Dorwart R, Hoover C, Epstein S | title = The determinants of dumping: a national study of economically motivated transfers involving mental health care | journal = Health Services Research | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 561–90 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9402901 | pmc = 1070215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage in the media and press ===
*[[Associated Press]]; February 9, 2007; [[Los Angeles]].

A '''housewife''' (also known as a '''homekeeper''') is a woman whose work is running or managing her family's home—caring for her [[children]]; buying, [[cooking]], and [[Food preservation|storing]] food for the family; buying [[Good (economics)|goods]] that the family needs in everyday life; [[housekeeping]] and maintaining the home; and [[Sewing|making]] clothes for the family—and who is not employed outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/housewife|website= Macmillan Dictionary |title=Housewife}}&lt;/ref&gt; A housewife may also be called a '''stay-at-home mother'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stayathomemum.com.au|website=StayAtHomeMum|title=Home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a househusband may be called a "male homemaker" or [[stay-at-home dad|stay-at-home father]].

''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' describes a housewife as a married woman who is in charge of her [[household]]. The British ''Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1901) defined a housewife as: "the mistress of a household; a female domestic manager; a pocket sewing kit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davidson, Thomas (ed.)|title=Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language|location=London|publisher= W. &amp; R. Chambers|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small sewing kit is sometimes called a "housewife" or "'''hussif'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|housewife|id=88947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, women have usually worked for pay, either by contributing to farming and other family-owned businesses or working for other employers.  Housewives were common in developed countries only for a few decades during the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Housewives work many unpaid hours a week, often depending on income from their husband's employment for financial support.

===Traditional societies===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-45.jpg|thumb|A housewife in Yendi, [[Kumasi]], Ghana, pours water into a meal and her children play; 1957]]
In societies of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] like the traditional society of the Australian aboriginal people, the men hunt animals for meat, and the women gather other foods such as [[grain]], [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s. One of the reasons for this division of labor was that it is much easier to look after a baby while gathering fruit than while hunting a fast-moving animal. Even when homes were very simple and there were few possessions, men and women did different jobs.

In rural societies, where the main work is [[farming]], women have also taken care of gardens and animals around the house, generally helping men with heavy work when a job needed to be done quickly, usually because of the season.

Examples of the heavy work that a traditional housewife (homemaker) in a ''rural society'' would do are:
* Picking fruit when it was ripe for market
* Planting rice in a [[rice|paddy field]]
* Harvesting and stacking grain
* Cutting hay

In rural studies, the word ''housewife'' is occasionally used for a woman who does the majority of the chores within a farm's [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] as opposed to field and livestock work{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

===Modern society===
A career woman may follow a "[[mommy track]]", or a [[shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Regarding [[Family#Size|family size]], a study of three [[Mexico|Mexican]] cities came to the result that there was no significant difference in the number of children in housewife families compared to those where women worked outside of the home part or full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chant | first=Sylvia | title=Women and Survival in Mexican Cities: perspectives on gender, labour markets, and low-income households | publisher=Manchester University Press Distributed in the USA and Canada by St. Martin's Press | location=Manchester, UK; New York, NY, USA | year=1991 | isbn=0-7190-3443-4 | ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bPTPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Page 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become more commonplace for the husband and wife to both be employed outside of the home and for both to share in the "housework" and caring for the children.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Full-time homemakers usually share in the income produced by members of the household who are employed; wage-earners working full-time benefit from the unpaid work provided by the housewife; otherwise, the performance of such work (child care, cooking, housecleaning, teaching, transporting, etc.) could be a household expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/whats-a-wife-worth/Content?oid=871934|title=What's a Wife Worth?|date=17 March 1988|accessdate=17 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Community property]] states recognize joint ownership of marital property and income, and unless a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement is followed, most marital households in the US operate as a joint financial team and file [[taxes]] jointly.

===Education===
The method, necessity and extent of education of house wives has been debated since at least the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dement|first1=Alice L.|title=Higher Education of the Housewife: Wanted or Wasted?|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1960|volume=31|issue=1 (January)|doi=10.2307/1977571|jstor=1977571|publisher=Ohio State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mummy, I want to be a housewife|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/mummy-i-want-to-be-a-housewife/93431.article|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Times Higher Education|date=26 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1114896.files/Najmabadi%201998.pdf|title=Crafting an Educated Housewife in Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3485879.ece|title=Highly educated housewives: what an economic waste|date=25 July 2012|work=The Times|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs about the housewife's lot==
The housewife's tasks have often been the subject of songs. Examples include: "The Housewife's Lament" (from the diary of Sarah Price, Ottawa, Illinois, mid 19th century);&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on: ''The Female Frolic'', Argo ZDA 82 &amp; [[Peggy Seeger|Seeger, P.]] ''Penelope isn't Waiting any More'' Blackthorne BR 1050&lt;/ref&gt; "Nine Hours a Day" (1871 English song, anonymous); "A Woman's Work is Never Done"&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on [[Sam Richards (writer)|Staverton Bridge]] SADISC SDL 266&lt;/ref&gt; or "A Woman Never Knows When her Day's Work is Done"; "The Labouring Woman"; "How Five and Twenty Shillings were Expended in a Week" (English popular songs); "A Woman's Work" (London music hall song by Sue Pay, 1934).&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Henderson et al., comp. (1979) ''My Song is My Own: 100 women's songs''. London: Pluto; pp. 126-28, 142-43&lt;/ref&gt; "The Housewife's Alphabet", by [[Peggy Seeger]], was issued as a Blackthorne Records single with "My Son".&lt;ref&gt;''New City Songster''; vol. 13, Oct. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]] (excluding periods of the [[Tang dynasty]]), women were bound to homemaking by the doctrines of [[Confucianism]] and cultural norms. Generally, girls did not attend school and, therefore, spent the day doing household chores with their mothers and female relatives (for example, [[cooking]] and [[Housekeeping|cleaning]]). In most cases, the husband was alive and able to work, so the wife was almost always forbidden to take a job and mainly spent her days at home or doing other domestic tasks. As Confucianism spread across [[East Asia]], this social norm was also observed in [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]]. As [[foot binding]] became common after the [[Song Dynasty]], many women lost the ability to work outside.

After the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911, these norms were gradually loosened and many women were able to enter the workforce. Shortly thereafter, a growing number of females began to be permitted to attend schools. Starting with the rule of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, all women were freed from compulsory family roles. During the [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Cultural Revolution]], some women even worked in fields that were traditionally reserved for males.

In modern China, housewives are no longer as common, especially in the largest cities and other urban areas.  Many modern women work simply because one person's income is insufficient to support the family, a decision made easier by the fact that it is common for Chinese grandparents to watch after their grandchildren until they are old enough to go to school. Nonetheless, the number of Chinese housewives has been steadily rising in recent years as China's economy expands.{{dubious|date=February 2017}}

===In India===

In a traditional [[Hindu]] family, the head of the family is the ''Griha Swami'' (Lord of the House) and his wife is the ''Griha Swamini'' (Lady of the House). The [[Sanskrit]] words ''Grihast'' and ''Grihasta'' perhaps come closest to describing the entire gamut of activities and roles undertaken by the homemaker. ''Grih'' is the Sanskrit root for house or home; Grihasta and Grihast are derivatives of this root, as is [[Grihastya]]. The couple lives in the state called ''Grihastashram'' or family system and together they nurture the family and help its members (both young and old) through the travails of life. The woman who increments the family tree (bears children) and protects those children is described as the ''Grihalakshmi'' (the wealth of the house) and ''Grihashoba'' (the glory of the house). The elders of the family are known as ''Grihshreshta''. The husband or wife may engage in countless other activities which may be social, religious, political or economic in nature for the ultimate welfare of the family and society. However, their unified status as joint householders is the nucleus from within which they operate in society. The traditional status of a woman as a homemaker anchors them in society and provides meaning to their activities within the social, religious, political and economic framework of their world. However, as India undergoes modernisation, many women are in employment, particularly in the larger cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]] where most women will work. The role of the male homemaker is not traditional in [[India]], but it is socially accepted in [[urban area|urban]] areas. According to one sociologist's study in 2006, twelve percent of unmarried Indian men would consider being a homemaker according to a survey conducted by ''[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]''.&lt;ref name="life&amp;times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/indianmensurvey/Unmarried_Man_partner.php|title=Life &amp; Times of Indian Men|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=Business Today|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sociologist, Sushma Tulzhapurkar, called this a shift in Indian society, saying that a decade ago, "it was an unheard concept and not to mention socially unacceptable for men to give up their jobs and remain at home."&lt;ref name="dias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/City/Bombay-Times/Now-papas-do-what-mamas-did-best-/articleshow/1682154.cms|title=Now papas do what mamas did best!|last=Dias|first=Raul|date=June 26, 2006|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 22.7 percent of Indian women are part of the [[labor force]], compared to 51.6 percent of men; thus, women are more likely to be caregivers because most do not work outside the home.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm|title=Asia's women in agriculture, environment and rural production|accessdate=2009-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630002611/http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Korea===

====North Korea====
Until around 1990, the [[North Korea]]n state required every able-bodied male to be employed by some [[state enterprise]]. However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed to stay at home as full-time housewives (less than in some countries in the same region like South Korea, Japan and [[Taiwan]]; more than in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Mainland China]] and Nordic countries like Sweden, and about the same as in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.yeeyan.org/view/91830/133129 a Chinese-English translation web (译言网）:Will Chinese women rule the world?]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the early 1990s, after an estimated 900,000-3,500,000 people perished in the [[North Korean famine]], the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling homemade food or household items they could do without. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women. A joke making the rounds in [[Pyongyang]] goes: 'What do a [[husband]] and a pet dog have in common?' Answer: 'Neither works nor earns money, but both are cute, stay at home and can scare away burglars.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuyoo.com/html/guoji/2010/0422/14322.html |author=Andrei Lankov (a professor in South Korea National University)|work= cuyoo.com (Chinese-English Translate Web|title= Pyongyang’s Women Wear the Pants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"On a Tired Housewife" is an anonymous poem about the housewife's lot:

&lt;poem&gt;
Here lies a poor woman who was always tired,
She lived in a house where help wasn't hired:
Her last words on earth were: "Dear friends, I am going
To where there's no cooking, or washing, or sewing,
For everything there is exact to my wishes,
For where they don't eat there's no washing of dishes.
I'll be where loud anthems will always be ringing,
But having no voice I'll be quit of the singing.
Don't mourn for me now, don't mourn for me never,
I am going to do nothing for ever and ever."&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse'', ed. J. M. Cohen. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1952; p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

About 50% of married US women in 1978 continued to work after giving birth, while in 1997, the number was 61%. The number of housewives increased in the 2000s. With the [[2008 financial crisis]], a decrease in average income made two incomes more attractive, and the percentage of married US women who kept working after they giving birth increased to 69% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/famee.nr0.htm Employment Characteristics of Families Summary". U.S. Department of Labor.

Housewives in America were typical in the middle of the 20th century among middle-class and upper-class white families.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://longreads.com/2018/03/21/seeking-a-roadmap-for-the-new-american-middle-class/|title=Seeking a Roadmap for the New American Middle Class|last=Gershon|first=Livia|date=2018-03-21|work=Longreads|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black families, recent immigrants, and other minority groups tended not to benefit from the union wages, government policies, and other factors that led to white wives being able to stay at home during these decades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2005 study estimated that 31 percent of working mothers leave the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. &amp; Southwell, S. (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women’s careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives time to concentrate full-time on child-rearing and to avoid the high cost of child care, particularly through the early years (before school begins at age five). There is considerable variability within the stay-at-home mother population with regard to their intent to return to the paid workforce. Some plan to work from their homes, some will do part-time work, some intend to return to part or full-time work when their children have reached school age, some may increase their skill sets by returning to higher education, and others may find it financially feasible to refrain from entering (or re-entering) the paid workforce. Research has linked feelings of "maternal guilt and separation anxiety" to returning to the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Stacey E., and H. Ray Wooten. "Highly educated stay-at-home mothers: A study of commitment and conflict." ''The Family Journal'' 15.4 (2007): 336-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there is considerable variation in the stay-at-home mother's attitude towards domestic work not related to caring for children. Some may embrace a traditional role of housewife, cooking and cleaning in addition to caring for children. Others see their primary role as that of child-care providers, supporting their children's physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development while sharing or outsourcing other aspects of home care.

==History==
Although men have generally been thought of as the primary [[breadwinner]]s for families in recent history, the division of labor between men and women in traditional societies required both genders to take an active role in obtaining resources outside the domestic sphere. Prior to discovering agriculture and animal husbandry, predictable food sources were a scarce commodity. To achieve optimal nutrition during this time, it was imperative that both men and women focus their energies on hunting and gathering as many different edible foods as possible to sustain themselves on a daily basis. Lacking the technologies necessary to store and preserve food, it was critical for men and women to seek out and obtain fresh food sources almost continuously. These nomadic tribes used gender differences to their advantage, allowing men and women to use their complementary adaptations and survival strategies to find the most diverse and nutritionally complete foods available. For example, in the context of daily foraging, childcare itself was not a hindrance to women's productivity; rather, performing this task with her children both increased the overall efficiency of the activity (more people participating equals a greater yield of edible roots, berries, nuts and plants), and functioned as an important hands-on lesson in survival skills for each child. By sharing the burden of daily sustenance – and developing specialized gender niches – humans not only ensured their continued survival, but also paved the way for later technologies to evolve and grow through experience.

In the 19th century, more and more women in industrialising countries stopped being homemakers and farm wives and began to undertake paid work in various industries outside the home and away from the family farm, in addition to the work they did at home. At this time many big [[factory|factories]] were set up, first in England then in other European countries and the United States. Many thousands of young women went to work in factories; most factories employed women in roles different from those occupied by men. There were also women who worked at home for low wages while caring for their children at the same time.

Being a housewife was only realistic among middle-class and upper-class families.  In working-class families, it was typical for women to work.  In the 19th century, a third to half of married women in England were recorded in the census as working for outside pay, and some historians believe this to be an undercount.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/working-women-stay-at-home-wives-myths|title=So wives didn't work in the 'good old days'?

Women were often very proud to be a good homemaker and have their house and children respectably taken care of.  Other women, like [[Florence Nightingale]], pursued non-factory professions even though they were wealthy enough that they did not need the income. Some professions open to women were also restricted to unmarried women, e.g., teaching.

In the early 20th century, both world wars ([[World War I]], 1914–18, and [[World War II]], 1939-45) were fought by men from many countries. (There were also special roles in the armed forces carried out by women, e.g. nursing, transport, etc. and in some countries women soldiers also.) While the men were at war, many of their womenfolk went to work to keep the countries running. Women, who were also homemakers, worked in factories, businesses and farms. At the end of both wars, many men had died, and others had returned injured. Some men were able to return to their previous positions, but some women stayed in the workforce as well. In addition to this surge in women entering the workforce, convenience food and technology were also rising in popularity, both of which saved women time that they may have spent performing domestic tasks, and enabled them to instead pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Maurer | first = Elizabeth | title = "How Highly Processed Foods Liberated 1950s Housewives" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2017 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/how-highly-processed-foods-liberated-1950s-housewives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of [[Communist]] countries in the early and middle 20th century such as the Soviet Union and China encouraged married women to keep working after giving birth. There were very few housewives in Communist countries until [[Post-communism|free market economic reform]] in the 1990s, which led to a resurgence in the number of housewives. Conversely, in the [[Western World]] of the 1950s, many women quit their jobs to be housewives after giving birth. Only 11% of married women in the US kept working after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-57886790766.html In the kitchen debate in 1959: Nixon said American housewives are happier than the Soviet Union working women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s in western countries, it was becoming more accepted for a woman to work until she got married, when it was widely held that she should stop work and be a housewife. Many women believed that this was not treating men and women [[gender equality|equally]] and that women should do whatever jobs they were able to do, whether they were married or not. ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', a 1963 book by [[Betty Friedan]] which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States, discussed among other things the lives of housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/feminine-mystique/summary |title=The Feminine Mystique Summary |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/national/05friedan.html Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85] - ''The New York Times,'' February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, many women were becoming more educated. As a result of this increased education, some women were able to earn more than their husbands. In very rare cases, the husband would remain at home to raise their young children while the wife worked. In 1964 a US stamp was issued honoring homemakers for the 50th anniversary of the [[Smith-Lever Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/homemakers.html|title=Leaving Their Stamp on History|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906064904/https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/homemakers.html|archivedate=2015-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arago.si.edu/category_2034154.html|title=Arago: Homemakers Issue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, in many countries it became harder for a family to live on a single wage. Subsequently, many women were required to return to work following the birth of their children.

'''Immigration to Canada''' is the process by which people [[human migration|migrate]] to [[Canada]] to reside in that country. The majority of these individuals become [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian nationality law|citizens]]. After 1947, domestic immigration law and policy went through major changes, most notably with the [[Immigration Act, 1976]], and the current [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]] from 2002.

In Canada there are four categories of immigrants: family class (closely related persons of Canadian residents living in Canada), economic immigrants (skilled workers and business people), refugees (people who are escaping persecution, torture or cruel and unusual punishment), and the humanitarian and other category (people accepted as immigrants for humanitarian or compassionate reasons). In 2016, Canada admitted 296,346 permanent residents, vs. 271,845 admitted the previous year — the highest admissions levels since 2010.&lt;ref name="Hussen2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hussen |first1=Ahmed D |title=2017 Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/annual-report-parliament-immigration-2017.html#sec1_1 |website=[[Canada.ca]] |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=23 June 2018|date=November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those admitted, 53% were economic immigrants and their accompanying immediate families; 26% were family class; 20% were either resettled refugees or protected persons; and 1% were in the humanitarian and other category.&lt;ref name="Hussen2017"/&gt;

According to data from the 2016 census by [[Statistics Canada]], 21.9% of the Canadian population reported they were or had ever been a landed immigrant or permanent resident in Canada — very nearly the 22.3% recorded during the 1921 Census, which was the highest level since the 1867 [[Confederation of Canada]].&lt;ref name="StatCanCultDivers2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Immigration and ethnocultural diversity: Key results from the 2016 Census |url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.htm |website=[[Statistics Canada]] |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than one in five Canadians were born abroad, and 22.3% of the population belonged to [[visible minorities]], of whom 3 in 10 were born in Canada.&lt;ref name="StatCanCultDivers2017"/&gt;

In 2013–2014, most of the Canadian public, as well as the major political parties, supported either sustaining or increasing the current level of immigration.&lt;ref name="HollifieldMartin2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hollifield|author2=Philip Martin|author3=Pia Orrenius|title=Controlling Immigration: A Global Perspective, Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys9jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2014|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-8627-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FreemanHansen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary P.

Canadian immigration policies are still evolving. In 2008, Citizenship and Immigration Canada made significant changes to streamline the steady flow of immigrants, such as changes reducing professional categories for skilled immigration as well as caps for immigrants in various categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-welcomed-320000-immigrants-in-past-year-highest-number-since-1971/article32102991/|title=320,000 newcomers came to Canada in past year, highest number since 1971|last=Grant|first=Tavia|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=28 September 2016|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Canada introduced the [[Express Entry|Express Entry system]], providing a streamlined application process for many economic immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/express-entry-year-end-report-2015.html|title=Express Entry Year-End Report 2015 - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10|date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional changes were made in April and May 2017.&lt;ref name="Hussen2017"/&gt; In November 2017, Immigration Minister [[Ahmed Hussen]] announced that Canada would admit nearly 1 million permanent residents to Canada over the following three years, rising from 0.7% to 1% of its population by 2020.&lt;ref name="Bascaramurty2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bascaramurty |first1=Dakshana |title=Canada aims for immigration boost to buttress economy as population ages |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-to-admit-40000-more-immigrants-a-year-by-2020-under-liberals-new-three-year-plan/article36800775/ |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase was motivated by the economic needs of the country facing an aging demographic, with the number of senior citizens expected to double by 2036 alongside a decline in the proportion of working-age adults.&lt;ref name="Bascaramurty2017"/&gt;

[[File:Come To Stay.png|thumb|250px|''Come to Stay'', printed in 1880 in the [[Canadian Illustrated News]], which refers to immigration to the "[[Canada's Name#Adoption of Dominion|Dominion]]".]]
After the initial period of [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[New France|French colonization]], four major waves (or peaks) of [[immigration]] and settlement of non-aboriginal peoples took place over a period of almost two centuries. The fifth wave is currently occurring.

===First wave===
The first wave of significant, non-aboriginal immigration to Canada occurred over almost two centuries with slow but progressive [[French people|French]] settlement of [[Quebec]] and [[Acadia]] with smaller numbers of American and European entrepreneurs in addition to British military personnel. This wave culminated with the influx of 46–50,000 [[British Loyalist]]s fleeing the American Revolution, chiefly from the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] mostly into what is today Southern Ontario, the [[Eastern Townships]] of Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia of whom 36,000 went to the Maritimes. Some of these later made their way to Ontario. A second wave of 30,000 Americans settled in Ontario and the Eastern Townships between the late 1780s and 1812 with promises of land. Some several thousands of Gaelic-speaking [[Scottish Highlanders]] from forced land clearances in Scotland migrated to [[Cape Breton]], Nova Scotia and parts of Eastern Ontario during this period. It marked a new age for Canada and its people.

===Second wave===
The second wave, mainly consisting of  British and Irish immigrants or the [[The Great Migration of Canada|Great Migration]], encouraged immigrants to settle in Canada after the [[War of 1812]], and included [[British army]] regulars who had served in that war. In 1815, 80% of the English-speakers in Canada who numbered 250,000 were either American colonists, or their descendants. By 1851 their percentage had dropped to 30%. The colonial governors of Canada, who were worried about another American invasion attempt and to counter the French-speaking influence of Quebec, rushed to promote settlement in back country areas along newly constructed plank roads within organized land tracts, mostly in [[Upper Canada]] (present-day Ontario), much of the settlements were organized by large companies to promote clearing, and thus farming of land lots. With the second wave [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] immigration to Canada had been increasing, small numbers to organized land settlements but many more arriving to work on canals, timber, railroads and then peaked when the [[Irish Potato Famine]] occurred from 1846 to 1849 resulting in hundreds of thousands more Irish arriving on Canada's shores, although a portion migrated on to the [[United States]], either in the short-term or over the subsequent decades. At least 800,000 immigrants arrived between 1815 and 1850, 60% of them British (English and Scottish) and the remainder mostly Irish. This movement of people is known as the Great Migration boosted Canada's population from approximately 500,000 in 1812 to 2.5 million by 1851.  Ontario (Upper Canada): 952,000; Quebec (Lower Canada): 890,000 – about a quarter of whom spoke English as a first language; the Maritime provinces: 550,000. The French-speaking population was roughly 300,000 in 1812 and had increased to approx. 700,000 by the 1851 census. Demographically it had swung to a majority English-speaking country.

The [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1872 copied the American system by offering ownership of 160 acres of land free (except for a small registration fee) to any man over 18 or any woman heading a household. They did not need to be citizens, but had to live on the plot and improve it.

Also during this period, Canada became a port of entry for many Europeans seeking to gain entry into the U.S. Canadian transportation companies advertised Canadian ports as a hassle-free way to enter the U.S. especially as the U.S. began barring entry to certain ethnicities. The U.S. and Canada mitigated this situation in 1894 with the [[Canadian Agreement]] which allowed for U.S. immigration officials to inspect ships landing at Canadian ports for immigrants excluded from the U.S. If found, the transporting companies were responsible for shipping the persons back.&lt;ref name=Smith_2000&gt;Marina L. Smith, "The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at the U.S.–Canadian Border, 1893–1993: An Overview of Issues and Topics", ''Michigan Historical Review'' 26, No. 2 (Fall 2000), 127–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clifford Sifton]], minister of the Interior in Ottawa, 1896–1905, argued that the free western lands were ideal for growing wheat and would attract large numbers of hard-working farmers. He removed obstacles that included control of the lands by companies or organizations that did little to encourage settlement. Land companies, the Hudson's Bay Company, and school lands all accounted for large tracts of excellent land. The railways kept closed even larger tracts because they were reluctant to take legal title to the even-numbered lands they were due, thus blocking sale of odd-numbered tracts. Sifton broke the legal log jam, and set up aggressive advertising campaigns in the U.S. and Europe, with a host of agents promoting the Canadian west. He also brokered deals with ethnic groups that wanted large tracts for homogeneous settlement. His goal was to maximize immigration from Britain, eastern Canada and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, "Clifford Sifton: Immigration and Settlement Policy, 1896–1905".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wave (1890–1920) and fourth wave (1940s–1960s)===
[[File:Ad to attract Immigrants to wheat belt in 1898.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The government promoted cheap wheat lands in the Prairies. 1898]]
The third wave of immigration coming mostly from continental Europe peaked prior to [[World War I]], between 1911–1913 (over 400,000 in 1912), many from Eastern or Southern Europe. The fourth wave came from Europe after the Second World War, peaking at 282,000 in 1957. Many were from Italy and Portugal. [[Pier 21]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] was an influential port for European immigration; Pier 21 received 471,940 Italians between 1928 until it ceased operations in 1971, making [[Italian Canadians|Italians]] the third largest ethnic group to immigrate to Canada during that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816000332/https://www.pier21.ca/wp-content/uploads/files/First_75_Years/research_italians.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they made Canada a more multi-ethnic country with substantial non-British or non-French European elements. For example, [[Ukrainian Canadians]] accounted for the largest Ukrainian population outside Ukraine and Russia. The Church of England took up the role of introducing British values to farmers newly arrived on the prairies. In practice, they clung to their traditional religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;David Smith, ''Instilling British Values in the Prairie Provinces", ''Prairie Forum'' 6#2 (1981): pp. 129–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periods of low immigration have also occurred: international movement was very difficult during the world wars, and there was a lack of jobs "pulling" workers to Canada during the [[Great Depression in Canada]].

Canadianization was a high priority for new arrivals lacking a British cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Fedorowich, "Restocking the British World: Empire Migration and Anglo-Canadian Relations, 1919–30," ''Britain and the World'' (Aug 2016) 9#2 pp 236-269, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.3366/brw.2016.0239 open access&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants from Britain were given highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Cavell, "The Imperial Race and the Immigration Sieve: The Canadian Debate on Assisted British Migration and Empire Settlement, 1900–30", ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 34#3 (2006): pp. 345–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no special effort to attract Francophone immigrants.  In terms of economic opportunity, Canada was most attractive to farmers headed to the Prairies, who typically came from eastern and central Europe.  Immigrants from Britain preferred urban life.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Korneski, "Britishness, Canadianness, Class, and Race: Winnipeg and the British World, 1880s–1910s", ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 41#2 (2007): pp. 161–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth wave (1970s–present)===
[[File:Canadian Children Immigration.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth wave Canadian children celebrating Canada Day, Vancouver, 1 July 1999]]
Immigration since the 1970s has overwhelmingly been of [[visible minorities]] from the developing world. This was largely influenced in 1976 when the Immigration Act was revised and this continued to be official government policy. During the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] government, immigration levels were increased. By the late 1980s, the '''fifth wave''' of immigration has maintained with slight fluctuations since (225,000–275,000 annually). Currently, most immigrants come from South Asia, China and Caribbean and this trend is expected to continue.

=== 2017 border crossings ===
In August 2017, the border between Quebec and New York, saw an influx of up to 500 illegal crossings each day, by people seeking asylum in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/08/17/number-of-asylum-seekers-at-quebec-border-quadrupled-in-july-of_a_23080807/|title=Number Of Asylum Seekers At Quebec Border Nearly Quadrupled In July: Officials|date=2017-08-17|work=HuffPost Canada|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada increased border patrol and immigration staffing in the area, and reiterated that crossing the border illegally had no effect on one's asylum status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/08/23/canada-is-not-a-safe-haven-for-asylum-seekers-trudeau-warns.html|title=Canada is not a safe haven for asylum seekers, Trudeau warns|last=Woods|first=Allan|date=2017-08-23|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-CA|issn=0319-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/asylum-seekers-border-crossing-1.4258928|title=Trudeau says steps to tackle spike in asylum-seekers yielding 'positive results'|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese===
[[File:Demand-oriental-exclusion-1907-Vancouver.jpg|thumb|300px|Exclusionist cartoon in ''Saturday Sunset'' magazine by N. H. Hawkins, Vancouver, 24 August 1907]]
{{further|Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)}}
Prior to 1885, restrictions on immigration were imposed mostly in response to large waves of immigration rather than planned policy decisions, but not specifically targeted at one group or ethnicity, at least as official policy. Then came the introduction of the first [[Head tax (Canada)|Chinese Head Tax]] legislation passed in 1885, which was in response to a growing number of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] working on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. Subsequent increases in the head tax in 1900 and 1903 limited Chinese entrants to Canada. [[Anti-Oriental Riots (Vancouver)|In 1907 a major riot against Asians took place in Vancouver, BC.]] In 1923 the government passed the Chinese Immigration Act which excluded Chinese from entering Canada altogether between 1923 and 1947. For discriminating against [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] immigrants in past periods, an official government apology and compensations were announced on 22 June 2006.

===Citizenship===
{{main|History of British nationality law}}

The term Canadian as a term of nationalism or citizenship was first used under the Immigration Act, 1910, to designate those British subjects who were domiciled in Canada. All other British subjects required permission to land. A separate status of "Canadian national" was created under the Canadian Nationals Act, 1921, which was defined as being a Canadian as defined above, their wives, and any children (fathered by such citizens) that had not yet landed in Canada. After the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the monarchy ceased to be an exclusively British institution. Because of this Canadians, and others living in countries that became known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s, were known as ''subjects of the Crown''. However, in legal documents the term "British subject" continued to be used and "Canadians" were officially British Subjects born or regularly domiciled in Canada.

Canada was the first nation in the then [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] to establish its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]]. This took effect on January 1, 1947. In order to be deemed a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947, one generally had to be a British subject on that date, or had been admitted to Canada as landed immigrants before that date. First Nations people were later included by amendment in 1956. The phrase ''British subject'' refers in general to anyone from the United Kingdom, its colonies at the time, or a Commonwealth country. Acquisition and loss of British subject status before 1947 was determined by United Kingdom law.

Canada offers Canadian citizenship through naturalization. In 2006 the Canadian government reduced the landing fee per immigrant by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1159 Promoting opportunity for new Canadians - Prime Minister of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914141044/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1159 |date=2006-09-14 }}. Pm.gc.ca (2006-05-12). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2017 the implementation of the first of a series of important reforms to the Citizenship Act took effect. These reforms restored many of the previous requirements that were in place for more than 3 decades in Canada before they were removed and replaced with more stringent criteria by the former Conservative government in 2015. The most important changes include permanent residence is now a requirement for 3 years out of 5 years during the period immediately prior to filing the application. There is no longer a physical presence rule. Persons aged 14 to 54 years must pass knowledge of Canada test and demonstrate a basic ability in either of English or French, Canada’s official languages.  Revocation of citizenship must follow a more formal and balanced process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/404800/general+immigration/Canada+Citizenship+Reform+A+Comparative+Analysis|title=Canada: Canada Citizenship Reform: A Comparative Analysis|date= June 15, 2015|author=Colin Singer|publisher=CCIRC (Canadian Citizenship &amp; Immigration Resource Center) |accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/634656/work+visas/Canadian+Citizenship+Second+Wave+Of+Changes+Take+Effect+October+11+2017+Includes+Audio|title=Canadian Citizenship: Second Wave Of Changes Take Effect October 11, 2017 (Includes Audio) - Immigration - Canada|website=Mondaq.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 1977, Canada removed restrictions on dual citizenship. Many of the provisions to acquire or lose Canadian citizenship that existed under the 1946 legislation were repealed. Canadian citizens are in general no longer subject to involuntary loss of citizenship, barring revocation on the grounds of immigration fraud.

[[Statistics Canada]] has tabulated the effect of immigration on population growth in Canada from 1851 to 2001.&lt;ref name=statcan_table&gt;[http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo03.htm?sdi=immigration Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108010629/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo03.htm?sdi=immigration |date=2008-01-08 }} – immigration from 1851 to 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
Emigration from Canada to the United States has historically exceeded immigration, but there were short periods where the reverse was true; for example, the Loyalist refugees; during the various [[British Columbia gold rushes]] and later the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] which saw many American prospectors inhabiting [[British Columbia]] and the [[Yukon]]; land settlers moving from the Northern Plains to the Prairies in the early 20th century and also during periods of political turmoil and/or during wars, for example the [[Vietnam War]]. There are over 1 million Canadians living in the US (many millions more descendants of Canadian immigrants to the USA – New England alone is 20–25% of Canadian descent) and 1 million Americans living in Canada.

It should be noted that immigration has always been offset by emigration: at times this was of great concerns of governments intent on filling up the country, particularly the western provinces. The United States was overall the primary destination followed by reverse migration. As a result the population of Canada at Confederation (1867) was 3.75 million, or 10% of the US population, this average was maintained from about 1830 to 1870. It dropped to 6% by 1900 due to large emigration to the US and in spite of large-scale immigration to Canada. Emigration to the US was only 370,000 in the 1870s; averaged a million a decade from 1880 to 1910; almost 750,000 from 1911 to 1920 and 1.25 million from 1921 to 1930.They consisted of both native born Canadians and recent immigrants from various, mostly European nations.  Between 1945 and 1965 emigration to the US averaged 40–45,000 annually. It was not until 1960 that the population of Canada reached the 10% mark again, or 18 million. Today (2017) with over 35 million people, Canada has 10.8% the population of its southern neighbour. In times of economic difficulty, Canadian governments frequently resorted to deportation and coerced "voluntary" deportation to thin out ranks of unemployed workers; however, by the time of the Mackenzie-King government it was realized that this was an improvident short-term solution resulting in future labor shortages (that immigration was initially intended to overcome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mackenzie-king-and-the-war-effort/|title=Mackenzie King and the War Effort|last=Cook|first=Tim|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration rate==
{{main|Economic impact of immigration to Canada}}

In 2001, 250,640 people immigrated to Canada, relative to a total population of 30,007,094 people per the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 Census]]. Since 2001, immigration has ranged between 221,352 and 262,236 immigrants per annum.&lt;ref name=CIC1&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp Annual Immigration by Category], [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]. Retrieved July 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2017 the Liberal government announced Canada will welcome nearly one million immigrants over the next three years. The number of migrants will climb to 310,000 in 2018, up from 300,000 this year. That number will rise to 330,000 in 2019 then 340,000 in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/immigration-canada-2018-1.4371146|title=Canada to admit nearly 1 million immigrants over next 3 years - CBC News|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/punjabi/en/article/2017/11/10/canada-take-1-million-immigrants-2020|title=Canada to take 1 million immigrants by 2020|website=Sbs.com.au|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/canada-to-admit-980-000-new-permanent-residents-over-three-years|title=Canada to Admit Almost a Million Immigrants Over Next Three Years|date=2 November 2017|accessdate=27 May 2018|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main official reasons given for the level of immigration are:

[[File:COB data Canada.PNG|thumb|400px|{{Col-begin}}{{Col-4}}{{Legend|#7B1113|'''100,000 +'''}}{{Col-4}}{{Legend|#FF2400|'''50,000-99,999'''}}{{Col-4}}{{Legend|#E9692C|'''20,000-49,999'''}}{{Col-4}}{{Legend|#FFA07A|'''10,000-19,999'''}}{{Col-end}}]]&lt;!-- 400px dependent on list margin below --&gt;

*The social component&amp;nbsp;– Canada facilitates [[family reunification]].
*The humanitarian component&amp;nbsp;– Relating to refugees.
*The economic component&amp;nbsp;– Attracting immigrants who will contribute economically and fill labour market needs.

The level of immigration peaked in 1993 in the last year of the Progressive Conservative government and was maintained by Liberal Party of Canada. Ambitious targets of an annual 1% per capita immigration rate were hampered by financial constraints. The Liberals committed to raising actual immigration levels further in 2005. All political parties are now cautious about criticizing the high level of immigration. Consequently, immigration levels to Canada (roughly 0.7% per year) are considerably higher per capita than to the [[Immigration to the United States|United States]] (about a million, or 0.3%, per year). Further, much of the immigration to the United States is from Latin America, with relatively less from Asia; the United States only admits about twice as many immigrants from Asian countries like China, India, the Philippines, and Pakistan as Canada, despite having nine times the population. Due to this, the largest minority in the United States is the [[Hispanic or Latino Americans|Latin American]] population, while Canada's largest minority is its [[Asian Canadian|Asian]] population.

Immigrant population growth is concentrated in or near large cities (particularly [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], and [[Montreal]]). These cities are experiencing increased services demands that accompany strong population growth, causing concern about the capability of infrastructure in those cities to handle the influx. For example, a ''[[Toronto Star]]'' article published on 14 July 2006 authored by Daniel Stoffman noted that 43% of immigrants move to the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and said "unless Canada cuts immigrant numbers, our major cities will not be able to maintain their social and physical infrastructures".&lt;ref name=Star&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/Canada2020/article/106702 When immigration goes awry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116060741/http://www.thestar.com/Canada2020/article/106702 |date=2013-01-16 }}, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 14 July 2006. Retrieved 5 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the provinces that do not have one of those destination cities have implemented strategies to try to boost their share of immigration. While cities are a popular destination for new immigrants, some small towns have seen an influx of immigration due to economic reasons and local schools districts are working to adjust to the change &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

According to [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]], under the [[Canada–Quebec Accord]] of 1991, [[Quebec]] has sole responsibility for selecting most immigrants destined to the province. Of course, once immigrants are granted permanent residency or citizenship they are free to move between and reside in any provinces under [[Section Six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 6]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==Immigration categories==
There are three main categories to Canadian immigration:

===Economic immigrants===
Citizenship and Immigration Canada uses seven sub-categories of economic immigrants, and includes skilled workers under these classes: [[Quebec]] skilled worker class,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/quebec-skilled-workers.html|title=Immigrate as a Quebec-selected skilled worker - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=Canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19|date=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; federal skilled trades, the federal skilled worker program, the provincial nominee class and the Canadian experience class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/become-candidate/eligibility/canadian-experience-class.html|title=Who can apply – Canadian Experience Class (Express Entry) - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=Canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19|date=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process is done by submitting an online profile to the [[Express Entry]] pool, under one of 3 federal [[Canada]] immigration programs or a provincial immigration program. The highest ranked candidates are getting invited to apply for permanent residence.

The business immigration programs that offer permanent admission to Canada:
* Quebec Immigrant Investor Program (QIIP)&lt;ref name="CIC1" /&gt;
* Quebec [[Entrepreneurship|Entrepreneur]] program
* Quebec Self Employed
* Federal Start-UP Visa program
Individuals with a certain net worth can also apply for permanent residence via certain programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/immigrant-investor-venture-capital.html|title=Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Pilot Program - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=Canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-profile ''Skilled worker principal applicants'' group comprised 19.8% of all immigration in 2005. Canada has also created a VIP Business Immigration Program which allows immigrants with sufficient business experience or management experience to receive the Permanent Residency in a shorter period than other types of immigration.

As of May 1, 2014, the Federal Skilled Worker Class opened once again accepting 25,000 applicants with intake caps at 1,000 per category. A New Economic Action Plan 2015 took effect in January 2015 in which the skilled worker program will be more of an employer based program. The current list of accepted occupations for 2014 includes many occupations such as senior managers, accountants, physicians and medical professionals, professionals in marketing and advertising, real estate professionals and many more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=836509 Offering "Express Entry" to Qualified Economic Immigrants - Actively Recruiting Talented Newcomers For the Benefit of Canada’s Economy.

The new system is called "[[Express Entry]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://moving2canada.com/immigration-to-canada/express-entry-canada/ Moving2Canada Express Entry guide] January 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  In Alberta in particular, an Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alberta.ca/ainp.aspx|title=Alberta Immigrant Nominee Program (AINP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows skilled workers, along with their families, to make application for permanent residency, and several large Alberta employers with operations in rural areas actively recruit employees from abroad and support them and their families in seeking permanent residency &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Effective August 2, 2016, all home buyers who are not Canadian citizens nor have landed immigrant status are obliged to pay a 15% [[Property Transfer Tax Act|Property Transfer Tax]] when purchasing residential property in the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=4f2cf07f-5424-41b4-8560-b14d99bccfe7|title=BC Government Targets Foreign Buyers with Massive Tax Hike - Lexology|first1=McMillan LLP-Damon|last1=Chisholm|first2=Scott|last2=Kuehn|website=Lexology.com|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family class===
Under a government program, both citizens and [[Permanent resident (Canada)|permanent residents]] can sponsor family members to immigrate to Canada.

===Refugees===
{{main|Canadian Immigration and Refugee Law}}

In 2010, Canada accepted 280,681 immigrants (permanent and temporary) of which 186,913 (67%) were Economic immigrants; 60,220 (22%) were Family class; 24,696 (9%) were Refugees; and 8,845 (2%) were others through working holidays, internships, and studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/facts2010/permanent/01.asp Citizenship &amp; Immigration Canada: "Facts and figures 2010 – Immigration overview: Permanent and temporary residents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122052956/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/facts2010/permanent/01.asp |date=2011-11-22 }} Cic.gc.ca, retrieved November 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://moving2canada.com/immigration-to-canada/working-holiday-visa-in-canada/ Moving2Canada Working Holiday Visa in Canada guide] retrieved March 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Canadian nationality law]] an immigrant can apply for citizenship after living in Canada for 1095 days (3 years) in any 5-year period provided that they lived in Canada as a permanent resident for at least two of those years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eservicesak.cic.gc.ca/rescalc/resCalcStartNew.do?&amp;lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103232452/https://eservicesak.cic.gc.ca/rescalc/resCalcStartNew.do?&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2012-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition parties have been advocating providing one-year free residency visa for refugees as a chance to increase their living standards until they’re ready to migrate back to their home countries, rather than uprooting them from their heritage and culture in forms of relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-refugee-system-is-in-chaos/|title=Canada’s failing refugee system is leaving thousands in limbo|last=Markusoff|first=Jason|date=Jan 10, 2018|work=Maclean's|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/deportation-cbsa-refugee-assistance-1.4493727|title=Less than half the people deported from Canada in 2017 paid their own way home|author=Harris, K|work=[[CBC News]]|date=21 January 2018|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2018}}

==== Claiming Asylum in Canada ====
A person who is seeking asylum in Canada must be first considered eligible by the [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]](IRB).&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/claim-protection-inside-canada/eligibility.html|title=Find out if you're eligible – Refugee status from inside Canada - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=Canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04|date=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRB classifies eligible refugees into two separate categories:

*'''''Convention Refugees''''': Someone who is outside and unable to return to their home country due to a fear of persecution based on several factors including race, religion, and political opinion.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;
*'''''A person in need of protection''''': Claims for asylum under this category are usually made at a point of entry into Canada. Those claiming to be a person in need of protection must be unable to return to their home country safely because they would be subjected to a danger of torture, risk for their life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

After entry and eligibility interview the asylum seeker is either allowed or declined admission. Those who are admitted submits in writing their reasons of admissibility. The refugee board hears their case after 60 days and in favorable terms the claimants are accepted as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/asylum-seekers-refugee-claims-delays-1.4261881 | title=How asylum seekers make refugee claims, and why they take so long |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the claims are not seen appropriate by the interviewers, the asylum seekers may be deported, and there are many instances that make a persons claim ineligible for referral to the IRB. Notably those who seek entry into Canada through the U.S, were the [[Canada–United States Safe Third Country Agreement|Canada-U. S Safe Third Country Agreement]] (STCA) is applied.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; The STCA is responsible for limiting refugee eligibility to enter Canada and the rejection of several hundred claims a year since its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arbel|first=Efrat|date=2013-03-01|title=Shifting Borders and the Boundaries of Rights: Examining the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the United States|url=https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article/25/1/65/1549489|journal=International Journal of Refugee Law|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=65–86|doi=10.1093/ijrl/eet002|issn=0953-8186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canada Border Services Agency|Canadian Border Services Agency(]]CBSA) reported a drop in the number of claims from 6,000-14,000 before its implementation to an average of 4,000 claims per year after its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marwah|first=Sonal|last2=Ball|first2=Michelle|date=Autumn 2017|title=Is the Safe Third Country Agreement putting refugee claimants at risk?|url=|journal=Ploughshares Monitor|volume=38|issue=3|pages=5–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asylum claimants have been subjected to "[[Refoulment|indirect-refoulment]]", a consequence of a persons claim in Canada being refused under the STCA, subjecting them to deportation to the destination in which the person was originally seeking asylum from, due to more conservative [[Immigration to the United States|immigration and refugee policies in the U.S]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Michelle|date=Fall 2008|title=Responsibility Sharing or Shifting? "Safe" Third Countries and International Law|journal=Refuge|volume=25|issue=2|pages=64–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Refugees in Detention ====
Asylum seekers arriving at a point of entry on the Canadian border have been subject to incarceration and detention, due to the passing of [[Protecting Canada's Immigration System Act|Bill C-31]] in December, 2012.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Carrie|title=Refugee Hotels: The Discourse of Hospitality and the Rise of Immigration Detention in Canada|journal=University of Toronto Quarterly|language=en|volume=83|issue=4|pages=826–846|doi=10.3138/utq.83.4.826|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, claimants are subject to detention for failing to provide insufficient identification documents, which is in violation with the [[United Nations Refugees Convention|United Nations Refugee Convention]], to which Canada is a signatory.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In 2010-2011, Canada detained 8,838 people, of which 4,151 of them were asylum seekers or rejected refugee claimants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Stephanie J.|last2=Molnar|first2=Petra|date=2016-03-01|title=Everyday Injustices: Barriers to Access to Justice for Immigration Detainees in Canada|url=https://academic.oup.com/rsq/article/35/1/109/2362561|journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=109–127|doi=10.1093/rsq/hdv016|issn=1020-4067}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a requirement to the maximum time limit spent in detention upon being released, a situation which has been subject to criticism held in contrast to areas in Europe: Ireland (30 days), France (32 days), Spain (40 days), and Italy (60 days).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Temporary Foreign Worker Program==
{{See also|Temporary resident (Canada)|l1=Temporary Labour Migration}}

In 2012 more than 200,000 people were admitted to Canada under the [[Temporary foreign worker program in Canada|Temporary Foreign Worker Program]], three times the number in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2013/05/07/pol-cp-temporary-foreign-workers.html | work=CBC News|title=Harper says foreign worker program is being fixed - PM defends recent changes to EI and foreign worker program|date=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual that come to Canada through Temporary Foreign Worker Program can only stay on work permit for 3 years.

== Settlement workers ==

Settlement workers help immigrants into Canada understand their rights and responsibilities and find them programs and services they need to integrate with the new culture and the prospects of a livelihood. They motivate organizations to hire immigrants and support immigration through recruiting new members/ employees. They work with government agencies, school boards, libraries and other community organizations with networks of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://settlement.org/alternative-jobs/social-worker/settlement-worker/|title=Settlement Worker - Alternative Jobs|website=settlement.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These working relationships also help to provide families with the tools necessary to manage the changing identities of new immigrant families to Canada &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Disabilities and accommodation==
{{POV section|date=December 2016}}
In 2011 and 2012, several families were denied immigration to Canada because members of their family have an [[autism spectrum]] diagnosis and Citizenship and Immigration Canada felt the potential cost of care for those family members would place an excessive demand on health or social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/american-uvic-prof-forced-leave-canada-immigration-rules-175808035.html|title=American UVic prof forced to leave Canada after immigration rules son's autism too big a taxpayer burden|work=Daily Brew|date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1005102--family-faces-deportation-over-son-s-autism|title=Family faces deportation over son's autism|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with autism disorders can be accepted if they are able to depend on themselves.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;

The federal government were asked by businesses to expand programs for professional immigrants to get Canadian qualifications in their fields. In response, the Canadian Council on Learning was created by the federal government to promote best practices in workplace learning. Additionally the credentials of the immigrant workers are assessed through Canadian agencies by the [[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] for immigration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=681&amp;top=29&lt;/ref&gt; This ideally reduces the gap of education and suitable jobs. However, strains of discrimination within the society leads to a systemic process of rejecting and discouraging immigrants, this sort of [[Statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimnation]] is prevalent in the anti-oppressive culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-immigration-skilled-workers-election-1.4833739&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec in 2017 stated that the province prohibit offering or receiving a public service to people covering their faces like wearing chador, niqab or burka. The reasoning behind the bill was to ensure protection of Quebeckers, but the discriminatory strain of the political ideology was reported to be aimed at articles of certain religious faiths. It is common in the Quebec winters for everyone to cover their faces, while getting in a bus or standing in queue for other outdoor public services. Hence the bill itself is under question of Canadian policy in regards tolerance for accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-to-prohibit-government-employees-from-wearing-muslim-chador-niqab-and-burka-1.4148056&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-bans-face-covering-in-public-services-raising-worries-among-muslims/article36638544/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-62-identity-politics-muslim-burqa-1.4250417&lt;/ref&gt; A qualitative study found that [[taste-based discrimination]] is more prevalent in cities rather than semi-urban areas. The major factors that contributed to less hostility were regional differences in industrial composition and attendant labour demand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/new-figures-show-just-how-big-canadas-immigrant-wage-gap-is/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quebeckers have been urging to the province to charge additional fees from the immigrants before landing Quebec for French language training, so  that the new comers can start training in the language and culture of the community for better integration. The earnings differential between immigrants and Canadian-born individuals in Quebec is at a narrow by about 20 percent due to the lack of same average literacy scores. This is close to dysfunction when the Canadian Council on Learning in 2008 reported that almost half of Canadian adults are below the internationally accepted literacy standard for coping in a modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Reading the Future: Planning to Meet Canada’s Future Literacy Needs (Ottawa, ON: Canadian Council on Learning, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Across Canada, businesses have proposed to allow unpaid or basic pay internships, which are currently considered illegal in many provinces (both in government and private) and posses as a major obstacle to integrate immigrants into the working sector. The lack of policy leadership in this sector has resulted in a "catch-22” situation were employers want experience, but potential employees cannot get experience without a job/ internships.

==Illegal immigration in Canada==
Estimates of [[Illegal immigration to Canada|illegal immigrants in Canada]] range between 35,000 and 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=f86690ed-a2ed-447c-8be8-21ba5a3dd922|title=Canadians want illegal immigrants deported: poll|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.|date=20 October 2007|accessdate=2010-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020005655/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=f86690ed-a2ed-447c-8be8-21ba5a3dd922|archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Byron Bissett|James Bissett]], a former head of the Canadian Immigration Service, has suggested that the lack of any credible refugee screening process, combined with a high likelihood of ignoring any deportation orders, has resulted in tens of thousands of outstanding warrants for the arrest of rejected refugee claimants, with little attempt at enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=4e443e18-dc44-4128-bf17-ba209ba470f3|title=James Bissett: Stop bogus refugees before they get in|publisher=National Post|date=27 September 2007|accessdate=2015-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924122946/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=4e443e18-dc44-4128-bf17-ba209ba470f3|archivedate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report by the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] [[Sheila Fraser]] stated that Canada has lost track of as many as 41,000 illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CTV News Staff|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada-has-lost-track-of-41-000-illegals-fraser-1.293851|title=Canada has lost track of 41,000 illegals: Fraser|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=2008-05-06|accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200805_07_e_30703.html |title=Chapter 7—Detention and Removal of Individuals—Canada Border Services Agency |work=2008 May Report of the Auditor General of Canada |date=May 2008 |publisher=Office of the Auditor General of Canada |access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Canadian attitudes towards immigration==
An October 2016 study of Canadian values by pollster  [[Angus Reid (market research)|Angus Reid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angusreid.org/canada-values/|title=What makes us Canadian? A study of values, beliefs, priorities and identity|publisher=The Angus Reid Institute|date=3 October 2016|accessdate=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a conflicting picture that about 68% of those polled said they wanted minorities to do more to fit into the mainstream, the same number also said they were nonetheless happy with how the immigrants were integrating themselves into the community. Further, 79% of Canadians believe immigration policy should be based on the country's economic and labour needs, rather than on the needs of foreigners to escape crises in their home countries. In an analysis of the survey, Reid wrote that although Canadians' commitment to multiculturalism is not increasing, and in the wake of North American and European nationalist movements have affected the Canadian attitudes and have started to develop a preference to [[Discrimination based on skin color|colorism]] in certain provinces. Reid also express' his uncomfortableness in the increasing illiterate refugee immigrants that can affect the Canadian society. However, he found that the majority of newcomers and refugees feel that they are treated fairly and welcomed as a "Canadian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/angus-reid-poll-canadian-values-immigration-1.3789223|title=Canadians aren't as accepting as we think — and we can't ignore it, writes Angus Reid|website=Cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 Poll found 32% of Canadians said too many refugees were coming to Canada, up from 30% in 2016. The 2017 poll also asked respondents about their comfort levels with surface diversity, like around people of different races and religions, a question that was also asked in 2005-06. This year, 89% said they were comfortable around people of a different race, down from 94% in 2005-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/11/07/canadian-attitudes-towards-immigration-hardening-poll-suggests.html|title=Canadian attitudes towards immigration hardening, poll suggests - The Star|website=Thestar.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite the number of refugees entering Canada, certain groups of immigrants enter Canada with the express purpose to do jobs that Canadian born workers have shown they do not wish to do &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These immigrants are thankful for the opportunity to work and live in Canada and their children work hard to be successful in school &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticisms ==

In ''L'Express'', the French news magazine, Canadian academic and [[environmentalism|environmental activist]] [[David Suzuki]] called Canada's immigration policy "disgusting" (We "plunder southern countries to deprive them of their future leaders, and wish to increase our population to support our economic growth") and insisted that "Canada is full" ("Our useful area is reduced").&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">'''Irving Charles Velson''' (June 3, 1913 - 1976) was an American who had a long career in the [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) [[History of Soviet espionage in the United States#Secret apparatus|secret apparatus]] and who allegedly worked for Soviet Military Intelligence ([[GRU]]).  He was the son of [[Clara Lemlich|Clara Lemlich Shavelson]] and changed his name to Velson by 1938.  Velson worked as a machinist at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] from 1931 to 1938.

According to Congressional investigators, Velson worked closely with [[J. Peters]], head of the CPUSA's secret apparatus, and supported Cpl. [[Robert Osman]] in espionage activities on behalf of the GRU in the Panama Canal Zone. Robert Gladnick, a former CPUSA functionary and a member of the [[Lincoln Brigade]] supported this version.  Gladnick stated that [[Bernard Schuster]] (aka Bernard Chester) then director of the CPUSA's antimilitarist operations, was replaced in the mid-1930s by Velson, in a program to develop secret Communist groups among American military personnel.  [[Venona]] decrypts show Velson reporting on weapons technology and other agent handling tasks.  

Velson's code name with the GRU, and as deciphered by the [[Venona project]] is "Nick".

Velson is referenced in the following [[Venona names|Venona]] decryptions:

{{Israel-Palestinian peace process |Proposals}}
{{use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}

The '''Lieberman Plan''', also known in [[Israel]] as the "Populated-Area Exchange Plan", was proposed in May 2004 by [[Avigdor Lieberman]], the leader of the Israeli political party [[Yisrael Beiteinu]]. The plan suggests an exchange of ''populated territories''{{spaced ndash}}territories populated by both [[Arabs]] and [[Jews]]{{spaced ndash}}between Israel and the [[Palestinian Authority]].

Lieberman maintains that everywhere in the world where there are two peoples with two religions a conflict exists and notes that in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the situation is worse as there is not only a religious conflict but also a [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] one. Therefore, the proposition is based on 'reduction of conflict' and maintains that the two peoples could live together but it would make no sense to have one living inside the other. On top of this, Lieberman maintains that it makes no sense to create a Palestinian state that has no Jewish people while Israel is turned into a dual-population state with more than 20% of minorities.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|title=Avigdor Lieberman Q&amp;A |language=he |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=2008-07-13 |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/QAHeb.jhtml?qaNo=135 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001192050/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/QAHeb.jhtml?qaNo=135 |archivedate=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[Arab Israelis]] are opposed to the plan and many believe it constitutes [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sharon Roffe-Ofir |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=7 April 2006 |title=Arab fury: Lieberman stain on democracy |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3237363,00.html |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israeli Arabs and the Vote"&gt;{{cite news |author=Uri Dromi |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/23/opinion/eddromi.php |title=Israeli Arabs and the Vote |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=24 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127141313/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/23/opinion/eddromi.php |archivedate=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bibi Backs Away From Lieberman Plan |newspaper=[[The Jewish Week]] |date=29 September 2010 |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/brief/bibi_backs_away_lieberman_plan |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli left opposes the plan. Legal experts have cast doubt on the legality of such a move under Israeli and [[international law]].

== The plan ==
The Lieberman Plan suggests a territorial exchange whereby Israel would annex almost all [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[West Bank]] which are situated in major settlement blocs close to the border, and withdraw from the remaining few deep inside the Palestinian territories. At the same time, it would transfer Arab-Israeli areas to the Palestinian state.&lt;ref name=haaretz /&gt; While there are three major Arab regions in Israel, all contiguous with the West Bank (southern and central [[Galilee]], the central region known as "[[Triangle (Israel)|the Triangle]]", and the [[Bedouin]] region in the northern part of the [[Negev]] desert), the Lieberman Plan only advocates ceding the Triangle.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} All Arab residents of the Triangle would lose their Israeli citizenship. The [[Druze]] community, whose leaders are mainly pro-Israel, would remain part of Israel. All remaining citizens, whether Jews or Arabs would have to pledge an oath of allegiance to the state in order to keep their Israeli citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2009/feb/04/1 |title=Israel's hardline party widens its appeal |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014}} Video including Lieberman's position on Arabs in Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan would reduce both the Arab population of Israel and the Jewish population of the West Bank, creating more ethnically homogeneous states without anyone moving.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |date=January 2008 |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/lehr.2008.2.1/lehr.2008.2.1.1021/lehr.2008.2.1.1021.xml |volume=2 |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |pages=221–85 |doi=10.2202/1938-2545.1021|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various estimates as to the number of Arab-Israelis affected by the plan vary from a high of 90% of current Arab Israelis in Lieberman's own estimate to as little as 11.8% of Arab citizens being affected (2.3% of Israel's population overall) according to a study by the [[Stephen Floersheimer|Floersheimer]] Institute for Policy Studies.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters" /&gt;

=== Lieberman's argument for the plan ===
Lieberman's main argument for the plan is that it is not a [[population transfer]], since the plan does not call for any forcible removal of anyone from their home. The plan, instead, simply redraws the border between Palestinian and Israeli communities to make them more homogeneous (i.e., nearby Arab communities are redrawn to be included in the Palestinian Territory, while nearby Jewish territories are redrawn to be included in Israel).

In an open Q&amp;A with ''[[Haaretz]]'', Lieberman noted that it is of great importance to have a partner in the Arab side and stated that he communicated his plan to the Palestinians and the Arab states prior to making it public in Israel. Lieberman stated his belief that the Arab world understands that his plan would be in the benefit of the region and cited that there were no denunciations from either the Palestinians or the Arab world to this plan.&lt;ref name="haaretz" /&gt;

A 2000 poll conducted by the Arab-language weekly ''[[Kul Al-Arab]]'' in Um Al-Fahm found that an 83% majority opposed having their town transferred to Palestinian rule, with only 11% in favor.&lt;ref name="AlArab"&gt;{{cite news|title=Um Al-Fahm Prefers Israel |author=Joseph Algazy |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=1 August 2000 |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/358.htm |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140522/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/358.htm |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views of the Islamic Movement ==
The deputy leader of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel|Islamic Movement]]'s northern branch, Sheikh Kamel Khatib, said of the Lieberman plan that the only acceptable population exchange for him would be for the Russian-born Lieberman to: "return to his country while refugees in Syria and Lebanon return to their homeland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Islamic Movement: Israeli Arabs will reject peace achieved by current PA leaders |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=25 September 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/islamic-movement-israeli-arabs-will-reject-peace-achieved-by-current-pa-leaders-1.315626 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feasibility ==
According to Waters, "objections about feasibility ... are really not based on a belief that transfer is impossible, but a conviction that it is undesirable".&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters" /&gt;

The Plan conforms with generalized support both inside and outside of Israel for a [[two-state solution]]. Supporters within Israel seek a state that is both democratic and Jewish, the Lieberman Plan would achieve this goal. For those that believe that the ideal solution to the Israel-Arab conflict would be greater separation between Jews and Arabs, this plan would certainly achieve such a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan also minimizes the population of the minority in each state, which can be viewed (in the case of either minority) as "untrustworthy, unwanted, destabilizing, disruptive or simply different".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographically the plan creates two States which are more ethnically homogeneous, and likely would achieve the political goals of both the Palestinian and Israeli leadership. In sum, according to Waters: "It is entirely plausible that the Plan could contribute to peace, if peace could be achieved through a greater separation of Jews and Palestinians. That is, after all, the assumption underlying all two-state solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most assumptions about feasibility, including Waters', assume that the Plan would result from a multi-lateral agreement. At the present, there does not seem to be support for it from a willing Palestinian partner, thus decreasing the likelihood that it would be successful in achieving peace.

== Legality ==
Several issues of legality arise under the Lieberman Plan: the transfer of territory, revoking the citizenship of a people (i.e., the Arabs) – either through transfer of territory or a loyalty oath, and the gaining of new territory (settlement blocs in the West Bank). Timothy Waters writes that the plan can be creatively imagined as a [[secession]] – as if Israel was seceding from its present borders to smaller borders where the Jews have a larger majority.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters 2008 p.33"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfer of territory ===
Generally speaking, land transfer, as opposed to population transfer, is legal under both [[International law|International]] and [[Israeli law]]. The Israeli precedent was exemplified in 1979 when Israel agreed to transfer the Sinai Desert in exchange for [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace with Egypt]]. The issue that arises with this plan is the transfer of populated territories and the revocation of citizenship for those in the transferred areas.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters" /&gt; Even this, in principle, seems to be legal under international law.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters 2008 p.33" /&gt;

=== Revocation of citizenship through transfer of territory ===
A number of legal experts questioned by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' in 2006 argued that stripping Israeli Arabs of citizenship as part of a population and territorial swap with the [[Palestinian Authority]] would "run counter to Israeli and international law".&lt;ref name=jpost_legal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Liebermans-land-swap-plan-illegal |title=Lieberman's land swap plan illegal |first=Tovah |last=Lazaroff |date=2006-03-06 |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that Israel could decide that the "Triangle", which is populated mostly by Israeli Arabs, is no longer part of Israel but that she could not revoke the citizenship of the people living there. However, others questioned in the same report, including parliamentary and constitutional law teacher, [[Suzie Navot]], argued that the legality of the plan was unclear, and would likely need a ruling from the High Court of Justice to determine its legality.&lt;ref name=jpost_legal /&gt; ''Yisrael Beiteinu''{{'}}s legal adviser Yoav Many believes the plan is legal and "would be accepted not just in Israel but also within the international community".&lt;ref name=jpost_legal /&gt;

Timothy Waters writes that the plan, contrary to many arguments, is not an example of [[ethnic cleansing]] nor [[apartheid]] since it does not move any Arab from their land. He writes that states have the right to transfer (or withdraw from) territory, even against the wishes of the population, or to revoke the citizenship of inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters 2008 p.21"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lieberman Plan advocates the affected Arab Israelis to become citizens of Palestine, not stateless, and hence doesn't violate [[1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]].&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters 2008 p.21" /&gt; Waters also argues that while a state cannot strip an entire ethnic group of their citizenship, it may practice some forms of ethnic discrimination "because ethnicity plays an accepted role in constructing citizenship". He points to the expulsion of black Senegalese from Mauritania, the stripping of northern Muslims of their citizenship by [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and the [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|denationalization of Germans from Czechoslovakia]] (whose legality, he says, was later upheld in courts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters also argues that while the transfer of Israeli Arabs to a Palestinian state would harm their interests (e.g. reduction in standard of life) it doesn't violate any of their human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are international precedents for the idea of populated land exchange, and international law seems to be favorable, there is no such precedent under Israeli law. Scholars tend to agree that the plan is, at best, questionable under Israeli law. Currently, there is no Israeli law which would deal with this issue.&lt;ref name="jpost_legal" /&gt; In order for it to be implemented, the Knesset would have to enact legislation, and the High Court of Justice would rule on its legality. It is unlikely that either International or Israeli law would allow revocation of citizenship without a bilateral agreement with the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arieli Shaul |author2=Schwartz Doubi |author3=Tagari Hadas |publisher=Floersheimer Institute for Policy Studies |year=2006 |title=Injustice and Folly: On the Proposals to cede Arab Localities from Israel to Palestine |url=http://www.fips.org.il/Site/p_publications/item_en.asp?doc=&amp;iss=&amp;iid=751 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721143342/http://www.fips.org.il/Site/p_publications/item_en.asp?doc=&amp;iss=&amp;iid=751 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revocation of citizenship through a citizenship oath ===
Individuals who would prefer to remain in Israel instead of becoming citizens of a Palestinian state would be able to move to Israel. All citizens of Israel would be required to swear a loyalty oath to retain citizenship. Those who refuse could remain in Israel as permanent residents. The loyalty oath would apply to all citizens regardless of ethnicity. According to Timothy Waters "the loyalty oath almost certainly violates international law." The rationale behind this is that international law sees citizenship as an automatic right. Furthermore, those who refused to take the oath would be stateless, unlike those transferred under the population exchange part of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Timothy Waters |title=The Blessing of Departure: Acceptable and Unacceptable State Support for Demographic Transformation: The Lieberman Plan to Exchange Populated Territories in Cisjordan |journal=Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annexation of West Bank settlements ===
Timothy Waters writes that while Israel does have the right to unilaterally withdraw its borders from Arab territory, it cannot unilaterally take territory in the West Bank (in particular the Israeli settlements there). While it would be legitimate for a sovereign Palestine to transfer territory to Israeli control, Palestine would be under no obligation to do so. Waters bases this on the argument that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, constitute occupied territory.&lt;ref name="Timothy Waters 2008 p.21" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Moral arguments ===
Most criticisms of the plan focus on the undesirability of separation as opposed to its infeasibility. Many Arab citizens of Israel have criticized the plan as being racist and are, in general, opposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Myre |authorlink=Greg Myre |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=6 November 2006 |title=Hard-line Israeli Minister Avigdor Lieberman courts controversy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/world/africa/06iht-mideast.3808258.html |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the plan would not require them to leave their homes, Arabs in Israel argue that they are native to the region and insist that as Israeli citizens, they deserve equal rights within the state, and should not be singled out by ethnic or religious background. Various polls show that Arabs in Israel in general do not wish to move to the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] if a Palestinian state is created there.&lt;ref name="Israeli Arabs and the Vote" /&gt;

Several Israeli left-wing commentators have argued against the plan as well. Jewish critics sympathetic to the idea of exchanging populated territories have argued that it would be preferable to do this as part of a comprehensive peace agreement. They point out that while Arabs under the plan would still be allowed to retain Israeli citizenship if they take an oath of allegiance, no reciprocal possibility exists.

[[Akiva Eldar]] of ''Haaretz'' has said that the plan undermines the moral high ground of Israel.&lt;ref name="Eldar"&gt;{{cite news |first=Akiva |last=Eldar |authorlink=Akiva Eldar |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=30 October 2006 |title=Let's hear it for the Haiders |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/let-s-hear-it-for-the-haiders-1.203725 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haaretz'' has argued that the plan "is nothing but polite packaging that does not succeed in concealing its real aspiration: delegitimizing all the Arab citizens of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=4 February 2009 |title=Reject Lieberman |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/reject-lieberman-1.269363 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Gordis]] wrote that the plan's implementation would be highly demoralizing to those Arabs who would not be removed and might give them the sense that Israel does not want them. Gordis argued that this could set back any attempt to build better relations with the Israeli-Arab community. However, he acknowledged that they may already believe that Israel doesn't want them and are unlikely to embrace Israel as a Jewish state, and that nothing Israel does will convince them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordis |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Gordis |title=Saving Israel: How the Jewish people can win a war that may never end |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-64390-7}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic arguments ===
Other pro-Arab commentators have expressed skepticism that such a land-and-population transfer would result in the withdrawal of Israeli settlers and, hence, IDF soldiers, from areas of Israeli residence in the Lieberman-envisioned Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palestinemonitor.org/spip/spip.php?article726 |title=Land and Population Transfer |date=16 December 2008 |work=Palestine Monitor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528122308/http://www.palestinemonitor.org/spip/spip.php?article726 |archivedate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that Israeli zones within the West Bank will be subject to a security threat, putting the IDF at high risk to defend them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5357">[[UNICEF]] launched the '''MONEE Project''' ('''MONitoring Eastern Europe''', officially called “'''Public Policies and Social Conditions: Monitoring the Transition in Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States'''") in 1992 to secure evidence-based feedback on the social impact of [[market reforms]], and to advise countries undergoing rapid political, economic and social change on financial policy. Eight Regional Monitoring Reports (RMRs) were produced by the Innocenti Research Centre between 1993 and 2001, targeting decision-makers, their advisers, academics, professionals and the general audience.

==Reports produced==
Each Report provides a summary review of the social impact of the economic, political and [[demographic changes]] since 1989 and an in-depth analysis of some key thematic issues: family support policies; [[nutrition]], [[death|mortality]] and [[health]]; and [[poverty]]. RMR 4 offers a framework for assessing and supporting children at risk and those left without parental care, RMR 5 focuses on education, RMR 6 on women, RMR 7 on youth. RMR 8 looks at the turbulent first ten years of the transition. The [[tradition]], facilities, networks, and expectations created by the project have been used since 2002 to produce Innocenti’s new annual ‘Social Monitor’ series, which follows up how the benefits of [[economic recovery]] are being shared in the region.

==Budget==
The Project had an annual budget of US$0.7 million (including also staff posts) covering 27 CEE/CIS countries. The Reports were written by a core staff of 3-5 people at Innocenti, using input and data from a network of focal points in each central statistical office in the region and from other policy consultants; altogether about 40-50 people.

==Results==
The Project had many results and a variety of outputs (including a stand-alone database, additional research papers, technical support for conferences, website summaries of focus group discussions with young people etc.) The key results were:

*Use by and involvement of top level decision-makers (e.g. the President of Russia making a radio speech, the Duma asking for copies for each parliamentarian, the President of Romania at a conference) 
*Exceptional media coverage, citations by academic papers, books, long shelf-life, demand for reprint (RMR 4 had the greatest ever media coverage of any UNICEF publications in Germany)
*Impact on the World Bank and UN sister agencies (e.g. MONEE staff invited to give presentations in Washington, wide-scale use of MONEE data and publications by Bank economists, demonstrated influence on Bank initiatives) 
*Use by UNICEF as advocacy tool in and outside the region: for raising awareness on the social impact of economic policies and on emerging threats for children, such as HIV, or for assessing policies and strategies that effectively reduce risks associated with economic shocks, social upheavals and poor family and child support structures and prevent [[child neglect]] and [[institutionalisation]].

==Factors contributing to success==
*Unfailing support from, and involvement of, UNICEF senior management (e.g. the Executive Director, the Regional Director and country Representatives launching MONEE Reports)
*Long project life helping to accumulate capacities, knowledge, networks and fame 
*Sufficient funding and stability in core positions
*Professionals with substantive research capacity and ability to create intellectual interest directing the project
*Collaboration with a well-established and well-maintained network including a great number of local and a smaller number of international professionals
*Stakeholders and a focal point for distribution within the World Bank
*Focus on statistical evidence and on producing original, new analysis; at times even pioneering work 
*Multi-country coverage, multi-language versions 
*Rigorous analyses presented in accessible style
*Strong advocacy involving project staff, media experts and senior UNICEF officials

==Constraints==
Difficulties included establishing direct contact with statistical agencies in a very few countries; these were overcome with UNICEF field support. While many offices were using project outcomes and networks for advocacy and for programme planning in optimal ways, some others were showing less interest, which hindered project outreach. In several countries no UNICEF offices existed in the field (e.g. Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, and Bulgaria); in these countries National Committees were involved in advocacy, often with excellent results. In some countries (e.g. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) UNICEF offices were established only after 1997, when the Regional Office for CEE/CIS/Baltics was created. 

The MONEE project has demonstrated that by creating a regional monitoring, analytical and advocacy facility, UNICEF can repeatedly and substantially increase awareness on how economic and social policies impact children, women and families and influence how others, including national governments, civil society organizations or the World Bank use their resources and develop their programmes and interventions in a great number of countries.

[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Gerard van Honthorst]], ''The Match-Maker'' (1625)]]
{{Close Relationships}}

'''Matchmaking''' is the process of matching two or more people together, usually for the purpose of [[marriage]], but the word is also used in the context of sporting events such as boxing, in business, in [[Matchmaking (video games)|online video games]] and in pairing organ donors.

==Practice==
[[File:Finding a Match is easier than finding a Parking Space, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for a matchmaking service [[Chennai]], India]]
In some cultures, the role of the matchmaker was and is quite professionalized.  The [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish [[shadchan]], or the [[Hindu astrologer]], were often thought to be essential advisors and also helped in finding right spouses as they had links and a relation of good faith with the families.  In cultures where [[arranged marriage]]s were the rule, the [[astrologer]] often claimed that the stars sanctified matches that both parents approved of, making it quite difficult for the possibly-hesitant children to easily object – and also making it easy for the astrologer to collect his fee.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  [[Tarot divination]] has also been employed by some matchmakers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[Social dance]], especially in frontier North America, the [[contra dance]] and [[square dance]], has also been employed in matchmaking, usually informally.  However, when farming families were widely separated and kept all children on the farm working, marriage-age children could often only meet in church or in such mandated social events.  Matchmakers, acting as formal chaperones or as self-employed 'busybodies' serving less clear social purposes, would attend such events and advise families of any burgeoning romances before they went too far.{{fix|text=tone?}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The influence of such people in a culture that did not arrange marriages, and in which economic relationships (e.g. "being able to support a family", "good prospects") played a larger role in determining if a (male) suitor was acceptable, is difficult to determine.  It may be fair to say only that they were able to speed up, or slow down, relationships that were already forming.  In this sense they were probably not distinguishable from relatives, rivals, or others with an interest.  [[Clergy]] probably played a key role in most Western cultures, as they continue to do in modern ones, especially where they are the most trusted mediators in the society.  Matchmaking was certainly one of the peripheral functions of the village priest in Medieval [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] society, as well as a [[Talmud]]ic duty of [[rabbi]]s in traditional Jewish communities.  Today, the [[shidduch]] is a system of matchmaking in which Jewish singles are introduced to one another in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Matchmakers trade on the belief that [[romantic love]] is something akin to a [[human right]], and the modern [[online dating service]] is just one of many examples of a [[Dating#Matchmaking systems and services|dating system]] where technology is invoked almost as a magic charm with the capacity to bring happiness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} These services often rely on [[personality tests]] (but [[genetics]] has even been proposed&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/22/ok-we-have-our-first-dna-based-dating-site-genepartner/ Ok, We Have Our First DNA-Based Dating Service: GenePartner], by Michael Arrington, TechCrunh, on July 22, 2008
&lt;/ref&gt;), aiming to maximize the identification of the best match.

[[File:Pn-museum-2001-05-visitors.jpg|thumb|Traditional matchmaking is a usual folk program in Russian museums]]

The acceptance of dating systems, however, has created something of a resurgence in the role of the traditional professional matchmaker. Those who find dating systems or services useful but prefer human intelligence and personal touches can choose from a wide range of such services now available. According to Mark Brooks (an online personals and social networking expert), "you can actually find people who are compatible, and this is a major advance that is going to keep the industry alive for the upcoming 50 years".&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/14/MNUKV1KH5.DTL | title=Gay matchmaking sites find a growing market| publisher=SFGate | accessdate=2008-02-14 | first=Anastasia | last=Ustinova | date=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that matchmakers offer "a chance to connect" and "a chance to authenticate" prospects in ways the Web sites can’t.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/fashion/weddings/30FIELD.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=2dc829b24a2e2e75&amp;ex=1191297600 | title=Online Dating Putting You Off? Try a Matchmaker | publisher=The New York Times | accessdate=2007-09-30 | first=Marcelle S. | last=Fischler | date=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Asia===
In [[Singapore]], the [[Social Development Unit]] (SDU), run by the [[city-state]]'s [[government]], offers a combination of professional counsel and dating system technology, like many commercial dating services.  Thus the role of the matchmaker has become institutionalized, as a [[bureaucrat]], and every citizen in Singapore has access to some subset of the matchmaking services that were once reserved for [[royal family|royalty]] or [[upper class]]es.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Methods==
The Matchmaking Institute is the only school for matchmaking in the US, established in 2003 that is accredited by the state of New York, providing certifications to matchmakers from all over the world. The Various academics and practitioners in [[sexology]] and [[marriage counseling]] have developed matchmaking methods with the goal of maximising its success. For example, profiles produced by [[personality test]]s can be evaluated for compatibility. Academics who have written books on this topic include [[Pepper Schwartz]],&lt;ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
The concept of matchmaking is also used in the business world and known as B2B Matchmaking, Investor Matchmaking, Business Speed Dating or Brokerage Events. In contradiction to social networking solutions, real meetings between business people are in focus. Trade fair organisations e.g. find this concept an added value for their exhibitors because it gives them the opportunity of advanced planned meetings. Following the inspiration of dating sites, some online B2B networking platforms developed advanced business matching solutions enabling relevant business partners' identification.

{{Culture of Greece}}
'''Minorities in Greece''' are small in size compared to [[Balkans|Balkan]] regional standards, and the country is largely ethnically homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Clogg ''Concise History of Greece (Second edition)'' Chap.7 page 238 Cambridge 2002, for the Greek edition Katoptro {{ISBN|960-7778-61-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly due to the [[Population transfer|population exchanges]] between [[Greece]] and neighboring [[Turkey]] ([[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations|Convention of Lausanne]]) and [[Bulgaria]] ([[Treaty of Neuilly]]), which removed most Muslims (with the exception of the Muslims of [[Western Thrace]]) and those Christian Slavs who did not identify as Greeks, from Greek territory; the treaty also provided for the resettlement of ethnic Greeks from those countries, later to be followed by refugees. The 2011 census reported a population of 10,816,286 people.&lt;ref name="ELSTAT"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|script-title=el:Απογραφή Πληθυσμού – Κατοικιών 2011. ΜΟΝΙΜΟΣ Πληθυσμός|trans-title=Results of Population-Housing Census 2011 concerning the permanent population of the country|language=el|url=http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/1210503/resident_population_census2011rev.xls/956f8949-513b-45b3-8c02-74f5e8ff0230|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main officially recognized "minority" (μειονότητα, ''meionótita'') is the [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] (μουσουλμανική μειονότητα, ''mousoulmanikí meionótita'') in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Northern Greece]], which numbered 120,000 according to the 2001 census&lt;ref&gt;Dimitris Karantinos, Anna Manoudi ''Country Report 2 2012 Discrimination On The Ground Of Religion Or Belief'' [http://www.antigone.gr/en/library/files/reports_on_greece/2012/religion_descriminations_EN.pdf]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mainly consists of [[Western Thrace Turks]], [[Pomaks]] (both mainly inhabiting  [[Western Thrace]]), and also [[Romani people|Romani]], found particularly in central and [[Northern Greece]]. Other recognized minority groups are the [[Armenians]] numbering approximately 35,000,&lt;ref name=LOCCS /&gt; and the [[Jews]] ([[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] and [[Romaniotes]]) numbering approximately 5,500.&lt;ref&gt;Κεντρικό Ισραηλίτικο Συμβούλιο Ελλάδος: [http://www.kis.gr/home.html Οι Εβραίοι της Ελλάδος] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208144059/http://www.kis.gr/home.html |date=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious minorities==
{{main|Religion in Greece}}

The Greek constitution defines the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as the "prevailing religion" in Greece, and over 95% of the population claim membership in it. Any other religion not explicitly defined by law (e.g. unlike Islam and Judaism, which are explicitly recognized) may acquire the status of a "known religion", a status which allows the religion's adherents to worship freely, and to have constitutional recognition. After a court ruling, the criteria for acquiring the status of a "known religion", were defined as being, a "religion or a dogma whose doctrine is open and not secret, is taught publicly and its rites of worship are also open to the public, irrespective of whether its adherents have religious authorities; such a religion or dogma needs not to be recognized or approved by an act of the State or Church". This covers most religious minorities such as [[Roman Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Evangelical]]s, [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Methodists]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. All known religions to be considered by the Greek state legal entities under private law must establish an association, or foundation, or charitable fund-raising committee pursuant to the Civil Code. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] refuses to be considered a legal person under private or public law and has requested recognition by its own [[canon law]]. In July 1999, following a parliamentary amendment, the legal entity status of all institutions of the Roman Catholic Church established before 1946 was reconfirmed. There is no formal mechanism that exists to gain recognition as a "known religion". There are also around two thousand Greeks who adhere to a [[Neopaganism|reconstruction]] of the [[ancient Greek Religion]].&lt;ref name="Ancient Greek gods' new believers"&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6285397.stm ''Ancient Greek gods' new believers'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YSEE in the media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=mme6|title=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes|website=www.ysee.gr|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A place of worship has been recognized as such by court.&lt;ref name="Greek gods prepare for comeback"&gt;The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1767802,00.html ''Greek gods prepare for comeback'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim===
{{see also|Muslim minority of Greece|Pomaks}}

There is a [[Muslim]] minority who are Greek citizens living in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], concentrated in the [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope]] and [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi regional unit]]s. According to the 1991 census, there were 98,000 Muslims in western Thrace, 50% of them of Turkish ethnic origin, with 35% [[Pomaks]] and the remaining 15% Roma.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greek Helsinki Monitor]]: [http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/bhr/english/organizations/ghm_mrgg_religious_freedom_2002.rtf Religious freedom in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hri"&gt;Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musmingr.htm Muslim minority in Thrace]&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimate the size of the Muslim minority at 0.95% of the population, or approximately 110,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurfedling.org/Greece.htm |title=Demographics of Greece | publisher=European Union National Languages |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the indigenous Muslim minority in Greece, the Muslim immigrant population in the rest of the country was estimated at 200,000 to 300,000, though these are recent migrants and generally not considered a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm US Department of State - Religious Freedom, Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}} Under Greek administration, the Muslim minority of Greece has adopted a moderate, non-political form of Islam.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"/&gt; The [[Lausanne Treaty]], and as a result the Greek government, defines the rights of the Muslim communities in Western Thrace, both Turkish and Pomak, on the basis of religion instead of ethnicity.

====Turks====
{{see also|Turks of the Dodecanese|Turks of Western Thrace}}

A Turkish community currently live in [[Western Thrace]], in the north-eastern part of [[Greece]]. According to the 1991 census, there were approximately 50,000 Turks, out of the approximately 98,000 [[Muslim minority of Greece]]&lt;ref name="hri" /&gt; Other sources estimate the size of the minority between 120,000 and 130,000.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=i"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=i}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levinson|1998|loc=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks of Thrace descend from Turkish populations living in the area during the Ottoman period. Like the Greeks of [[Istanbul]], they were exempted from the [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey|1923 population exchange]]; in contrast [[Greek Muslims]] in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] were not exempt from the exchange and so expatriated to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ejz18.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509050545/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ejz18.htm | archivedate=9 May 2006 | title=Greek and Turkish refugees and deportees 1912-1924 |publisher=University of Leiden | first=Erik-Jan | last=Zürcher |author-link=Erik-Jan Zürcher | date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek government continues to deliver Turkish-language public education, and there are two Islamic theological seminaries, one in [[Komotini]] and one in [[Echinos]]. The Turkish community of Greece enjoys full equality under the law, adopting Turkish names, publishing numerous Turkish-language newspapers, operating Turkish-language radio stations, converse freely in Turkish and use Turkish in Greek courts.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"&gt;Alexis Alexandris, "The Identity Issue of The Minorities In Greece An Turkey", in Hirschon, Renée (ed.), ''Crossing the Aegean: An Appraisal of the 1923 Compulsory Population Exchange Between Greece and Turkey'', Berghahn Books, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jJTge-_444C&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22a+series+of+legal+and+administrative+restrictions+relating+to+minority+education+and+cultural+matters+coupled+with+an+extensive+programme+of+expropriations+forced+the+local+Imbriot%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mpVYTtzaFoH6mAWq_sGeDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20series%20of%20legal%20and%20administrative%20restrictions%20relating%20to%20minority%20education%20and%20cultural%20matters%20coupled%20with%20an%20extensive%20programme%20of%20expropriations%20forced%20the%20local%20Imbriot%22&amp;f=false p. 124]&lt;/ref&gt; They are allowed to maintain their own Turkish-language schools, which catered to about 8,000 students in the 1999-2000 school year.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"/&gt; Since 1920, members of the Turkish minority participate in elections, electing representatives to Parliament.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"/&gt; The great majority of Turkic Muslims in Thrace espouse moderate political views and are ready to work and prosper as citizens of the Greek state, with the exception of a relatively small group of ethnocentric activists.&lt;ref name="Alexandris"/&gt;

In 1922, Turks owned 84% of the land in Western Thrace, but now the minority estimates this figure to be between 20–40%. This stems from various practices of the Greek administration whereby ethnic Greeks are encouraged to purchase Turkish land with soft loans granted by the state.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirschon|2003|loc=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] refers to the Turkish community as ''[[Muslim minority of Greece|Greek Muslims]]'' or ''Hellenic [[Muslims]]'', and does not recognise a Turkish minority in Western Thrace.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=i"/&gt; Greek courts have also outlawed the use of the word 'Turkish' to describe the Turkish community.&lt;ref name="fra2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the Greek High Court affirmed a 1986 decision of the Court of Appeals of Thrace in which the ''Union of Turkish Associations of Western Thrace'' was ordered closed.

Apart from Thrace, a small minority of Turks exists in the [[Dodecanese]] islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Kos]]. They were not included in the [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey|1923 population exchange]] as the Dodecanese were annexed from [[Italy]] in 1947 after [[World War II]]. After annexation of islands, their Muslim inhabitants, Greek and Turkish speakers, were granted Greek citizenship. Today, about 5,000 Turks&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clogg|2002|loc=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  live in the Dodecanese islands of Rhodes numbering 3,000 and Kos numbering 2,000 and use Turkish in everyday life. In Rhodes and Kos, the teaching of the Turkish language was ''de facto'' abolished in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.fa.knaw.nl/mercator/regionale_dossiers/regional_dossier_turkish_in_greece.htm Mercator Education] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016212255/http://www1.fa.knaw.nl/mercator/regionale_dossiers/regional_dossier_turkish_in_greece.htm |date=2005-10-16 }}, The Turkish language in Education in Greece, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pomaks====
{{main|Pomaks}}

The Muslim Bulgarian-speaking minority are known as [[Pomaks]] ({{lang-el|Πομάκοι}}, ''Pomakoi'', {{lang-bg|Помаци}}, ''Pomatsi''), they reside mainly in villages in the [[Rhodope Mountains]] in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], in [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]], [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi]] and [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope]] [[regional units of Greece]]. According to the 2001 Greek census it is estimated that in total there are 36,000 Pomaks, of whom, 23,000 live in [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi regional unit]], 11,000 live in [[Rhodope (regional unit)|Rhodope regional unit]] and 2,000 live in [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros regional unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrides.com/march02/pomaki.htm|title=ΤΟΡΟΝΤΟ|website=www.patrides.com|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language they speak is generally classified as a [[Bulgarian dialects|dialect of]] [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and more specifically is the "Central Rhodope dialect" or [[Smolyan dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promacedonia.org/jchorb/st/st_2_b_izt_3.htm#smoljanski|title=S Stojkov, Rodopian dialect|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their mother language, many Pomaks also self-identify as [[Turkish people|Turks]]&lt;ref name="GHMPomaks"&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/pomaks.html Report on the Pomaks], by the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|Greek Helsinki Monitor]]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Turkification]] has a number of reasons, including the fact that Turks and Pomaks were part of the same [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'']] during the years when their homeland was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Under Greek law, the Muslim minority (including the Pomaks) has a right to education in its own language. In practice however, only [[Turkish language|Turkish]] is used.&lt;ref name="GHMPomaks" /&gt; This is due to the Turkish self-identification of the Pomaks, and the fact that this trend was promoted until recently by the Greek authorities (who from 1968 until the 1980s even officially recognized the Pomaks as Turks)&lt;ref name="GHMPomaksasTurks"&gt;[http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/bhr/english/organizations/ghm_mrgg_religious_freedom_2002.rtf Religious Freedom in Greece], by the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights|Greek Helsinki Monitor]], September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; in order to distance them from the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name="GHMPomaks" /&gt; There have been Greek-Pomak dictionaries published and a language primer in the Bulgarian language (in Greek script) has been published for use in Pomak schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/research/hellenicObservatory/pdf/1st_Symposium/domnaMichail.pdf|title=Migration, tradition and transition among the Pomaks in Xanthi (Western Thrace)|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, news have begun to be broadcast in the native language of the Pomaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=761286|title=Гръцка тв пусна "Хабери на помацки"|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Pomaks are fluent in their Pomak dialects (spoken amongst themselves), Turkish (their language of education, and the main language of the Muslim minority), Greek (the official language of the Greek state), and may know some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (the language of the [[Qur'an]]).&lt;ref name="GHMPomaks" /&gt;

==Other minorities==

The community also manages its own educational institutions. Approximately 95% of Armenians in Greece are [http://www.armenianprelacy.gr/ Armenian Orthodox], with the rest being Armenian Catholics or Evangelicals.&lt;ref name=LOCCS /&gt; Some of these Armenians belong to the Church of Greece, they are called [[Hayhurum]].

The interaction between Greece and the [[Jew]]s dates back to ancient times. [[Alexander the Great]] reached ancient [[Judea]] and was welcomed by the Jews. Following his death, war erupted between the Hellenized Jews and Greeks and the Jewish conservatives [[Maccabees]] that embittered relations between Greeks and Jews for centuries.

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], Jews like all other non-Muslims had a degree of autonomy under the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]] system which classified populations according to religion rather than ethnicity or language. [[Thessaloniki]] in particular had a large Jewish population, mostly consisting of [[Sephardim]], who settled in Ottoman lands after the 1492 [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]]. Sephardim used to speak [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] until well into the 20th century. The [[Romaniotes]], on the other hand, are Jews who lived in the territory of today's Greece and neighboring areas for more than 2,000 years. Their language is Greek (and a Greek dialect called [[Yevanic language]]); they derive their name from the Byzantine name for the Greeks, "[[Rhomaioi]]".

Since independence in 1821, Greece continued to have a significant and active Jewish community with a long and rich cultural heritage.
 
The Jewish population of Greece increased markedly after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]] when Thessaloniki became part of Greek Kingdom, though the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] diluted the Jewish population of Thessaloniki.

During the Holocaust, 86% of Greek Jews, especially those in the areas occupied by Nazi Germany and [[Bulgaria]], were killed, despite efforts by the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] hierarchy, the [[Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo|EAM]] resistance movement and individual Greeks (both Christian and Communist) to shelter Jews.  These efforts were particularly notable in [[Zakynthos]], where not a single local Jew was killed in the Holocaust.

===Macedonians (of Slavic origin)===

The Greek government does not officially recognize a Macedonian minority of Slavic origin in Greece. Nevertheless, the [[Greek Helsinki Monitor]] issued a report in September 1999, with which it claims that there are about 10,000–30,000 ethnic [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], living in [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&amp;serial=1044526702223 GREEK HELSINKI MONITOR (GHM) &amp; MINORITY RIGHTS GROUP – GREECE (MRG-G)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030523145306/http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&amp;serial=1044526702223 |date=2003-05-23 }} - In the report it is stated that: "...those with a Macedonian national identity can be estimated to between 10,000-30,000. Indeed, the political party "Rainbow" which was created in 1994 and has campaigned for the recognition of a national Macedonian minority, received 7,300 votes in 1994 and 5,000 in 1999, two elections it contested alone: these figures correspond to some 7,000-10,000 citizens of all (not just voting) ages. One can estimate that besides this "hard core" there may be other citizens voting for mainstream parties that also espouse this identity, hence the above estimate."&lt;/ref&gt; but because of the absence of an official census it is impossible to determine the exact number. A political party called [[Rainbow (political party)|"Rainbow"]] promotes this line and claims minority rights of what they describe as the "Macedonian minority in Greece". In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Greece)|2014 European Parliament election]], Rainbow tallied a countrywide total of 5,759 votes, or 0.1% percentage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ekloges.ypes.gr/may2014/e/public/index.html?lang=en#{%22cls%22:%22level%22,%22params%22:{%22level%22:%22epik%22,%22id%22:1}} Ministry of the Interior official election returns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528100741/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/may2014/e/public/index.html?lang=en |date=2014-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2.5 million ethnic Greeks identify as [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonian]], unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ FYROM Name Issue], Hellenic Republic - Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a United Nations independent expert on minority issues, Gay McDougall, personally visited Greece to check the current situation regarding the minorities. As the report published on the UN Human Rights Council web site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/49b7b2e52.pdf|title=Report of the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, Gay McDougall : addendum : mission to Greece (8-16 September 2008)|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; says: "The Independent Expert met numerous individuals identifying as ethnic Macedonian." 
Moreover, she urges: "the Government of Greece to withdraw from the dispute over whether there is a Macedonian or a Turkish minority in Greece and focus on protecting the rights to self-identification, freedom of expression and freedom of association of those communities."

==Linguistic and cultural communities==
In addition to the above minorities, there are various ethnolinguistic communities in Greece with a distinct ethnic identity and language, but whose members largely identify nationally as Greeks and do not consider themselves a "minority".
[[File:Greece linguistic minorities.svg|thumb|right|250px|Regions with a traditional presence of languages other than Greek.

===Albanian-speaking===
{{main|Albanian communities in Greece}}
Albanian economic migrants are not to be confused with the [[Greek Orthodox]] [[Arvanites]], a group who traditionally speak a form of [[Tosk Albanian]] in addition to Greek and self-identify as Greeks,&lt;ref&gt;Greek Helsinki Monitor, [http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html The Arvanites.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003100942/http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/english/reports/arvanites.html |date=2016-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having played a significant role in the [[Greek War of Independence]] and Greek culture in general.

The [[Cham Albanians|Chams]] were an ethnic Albanian community that formerly inhabited the area of [[Thesprotia]], part of the Greek region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]. Most of them fled to Albania at the end of [[World War II]] after a large part of them collaborated with the Nazi occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;M.

There are other Albanian speaking communities found across other regions of Greece. In the [[Florina]] region Albanian speakers can be found in the villages of [[Flampouro, Florina|Flampouro]], [[Drosopigi, Florina|Drosopigi]], [[Idroussa]] and [[Tripotamos, Florina|Tripotamos]].

===Romance-speakers===

====Aromanians====
{{main|Aromanians in Greece}}

In Greece, the [[Aromanians]] are called ''[[Vlachs]]'' ({{lang-el|Βλάχοι}}, /[[International Phonetic Alphabet|'Vlaçi]]/). There are numerous festivals celebrating Aromanian culture all over Greece. Their language, [[Aromanian language#Situation in Greece|Aromanian]] (known in Greek as τα βλάχικα /'vlaçika/), is in danger of extinction and mostly spoken by the elderly. There are, however, small numbers of Aromanians in Greece who call for greater recognition of the Aromanian language, such as [[Sotiris Bletsas]]. It is hypothesized that these Vlachs originated from the Roman colonisation of the Balkans and are the descendants of Latinised native peoples and Roman legionaries who had settled in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="KahlArom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PeyfussArom"&gt;Max D.

====Megleno-Romanians====
 {{main|Megleno-Romanians}} [[File:Vlahomeglen-map-en.png|thumb|300px|Map of Megleno-Romanians settlements in Greece and Republic of Macedonia]]
Megleno-Romanians are concentrated in the [[Moglena]] region of [[Greek Macedonia]]. They speak the [[Megleno-Romanian language]] which is known as ''Vlăheşte'' by its speakers. An estimated 4,000 speakers can be found in the region spanning the [[Pella (regional unit)|Pella]] and [[Kilkis (regional unit)|Kilkis]] regional units of [[Central Macedonia]]. The largest Megleno-Romanian settlement is [[Notia]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Franks, "A linguist's linguist: studies in South Slavic linguistics in honor of E. Wayles Browne", University of Michigan Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romani===
{{main|Roma people of Greece}}

The history of [[Romani people|Romani]] in [[Greece]] goes back over 600 years to the 15th century. The name Gypsy sometimes used for the Romani people was first given to them by the [[Greeks]] who supposed them to be Egyptian in origin. Due to their [[nomadic]] nature, they are not concentrated in a specific geographical area, but are dispersed all over the country. The majority of the Greek Romani are [[Orthodox Christians]] who speak the 'Vlachoura-Roma' language in addition to [[Greek language|Greek]]. Most of the Romani who live in [[Western Thrace]] are [[Muslims]] and speak a dialect of the same language.&lt;ref name=NCHR&gt;Hellenic Republic: National Commission for Human Rights: ''[http://www.nchr.gr/category.php?category_id=99 The state of Roma in Greece] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914020127/http://www.nchr.gr/category.php?category_id=99 |date=2007-09-14 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romani in [[Greece]] live scattered on the whole territory of the country, but a large concentration in the bigger cities, mainly in [[Athens]] and [[Thessalonica]]. Notable centres of Romani life in [[Greece]] are [[Agia Varvara]] which has a very successful Romani community and [[Ano Liosia]] where conditions are bad. Romani largely maintain their own customs and traditions. Although a large number of Romani has adopted a sedentary and urban way of living, there are still settlements in some areas. The nomads at the settlements often differentiate themselves from the rest of the population. They number 200,000 according to the Greek government. According to the National Commission for Human Rights that number is closer to 250,000 and according to the Greek Helsinki Watch group to 300,000.&lt;ref name=NCHR/&gt;

As a result of neglect by the state, among other factors, the Romani communities in [[Greece]] face several problems including high instances of child labour and abuse, low school attendance, police discrimination and drug trafficking. The most serious issue is the housing problem since many Romani in [[Greece]] still live in tents, on properties they do not own, making them subject to eviction. In the past decade these issues have received wider attention and some state funding.&lt;ref name=NCHR/&gt;

===Slavic-speaking===
{{main|Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia}}
[[Slavic languages]] have been spoken in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] alongside Greek and others since the invasions of the [[Slavs]] in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia. (2006). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved June 16, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=4411]&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of northern Greece, in the regions of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (Μακεδονία) and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] (Θράκη), Slavonic languages continue to be spoken by people with a wide range of self-identifications. The actual linguistic classification of these dialects is unclear, although most linguists will classify them as either [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] or [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] taking into account numerous factors, including the resemblance and mutual intelligibility of each dialect to the standard languages (''abstand''), and the self-identification of the speakers themselves.

As however the vast majority of these people don't have a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] or [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] national identity, linguists will make their decisions based on ''abstand'' alone. Now, this people mainly identify themselves as ethnic Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Clogg|title=Minorities in Greece: Aspects of a Plural Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=231XALxmFFsC&amp;pg=PA142|date=January 2002|publisher=C.

The Christian portion of Greece's Slavic-speaking minority are commonly referred to as ''Slavophones'' (from the Greek Σλαβόφωνοι ''Slavophōnoi'' - lit. Slavic-speakers) or ''Dopii'', which means "locals" in Greek. The vast majority of them espouse a Greek national identity and are bilingual in Greek. They live mostly in the [[West Macedonia|region of Western Macedonia]] and adhere to the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]]. The fact that the majority of these people self-identify as Greeks makes their numbers uncertain. The second group is made up of those who seem to reject any national identity (Greek or Slav Macedonian) but have distinct ethnic identity, which they may call "indigenous" -dopia-, Slavomacedonian, or Macedonian. The smallest group is made up of those who have a clear Macedonian national identity and consider themselves as part of the same nation with the dominant one in the neighboring Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;''... See: Greek Helsinki Monitor, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention), 18 September 1999, Part I, [http://www.minelres.lv/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=bg&amp;lr=&amp;id=SXGd04cB59EC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=greeks+slavophone+macedonians+greeks++human+rights&amp;ots=56Xz8lupD0&amp;sig=qEtRee6TNAUCQnwzBHmhblwIcvA#PPA101,M1 Macedonia: the politics of identity and difference], Jane K. Cowan, Pluto Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7453-1589-5}}, pp. 102-102.&lt;/ref&gt; A crucial element of that controversy is the very name ''Macedonian'', as it is also used by a much more numerous group of people with a Greek national identity to indicate their regional identity. Slavic speakers also use the term "Macedonians" or "Slavomacedonians", though in a regional rather than an ethnic sense. Until and including the 1951 census the question of mother tongue was asked throughout Greece, so this gives a rough idea as to the size of this group, and later estimates are usually based on this figure.

The national identity of this community has frequently been loaded with political implications. The Politis-Kalfov Protocol signed on September 29, 1925 purported to recognize the Slav-speakers of Greek Macedonia as [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarians]], but this protocol was never ratified. A short lived agreement was signed August 1926, which recognized them as a [[Serbs|Serbian]] minority.&lt;ref&gt;Iakovos D. Michailidis ''[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/downloads/library/Michai01.pdf Minority Rights and Educational Problems in Greek Interwar Macedonia: The Case of the Primer "Abecedar"]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1951 census, 41,017 people claimed to speak the [[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic language]].

The '''Museum of Romani Culture''' (''Muzeum romské kultury'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is an institution dedicated to the history and culture of the [[Romani people]] (Gypsies). It is situated in [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]. 

==History==
The Museum was founded in 1991 by members of the [[Czechs|Czech]] Romani intelligentsia, led by Jana Horváthová, in the period of freedom which followed the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. During its early years, its location moved from one place to another and the institution struggled with financial problems. In December 2000, it moved to its present building on Bratislavská Street in Brno, which is the centre of the local Romani community. The museum is now financed from the state budget.

On December 1, 2005, the first permanent exhibition was opened.

==Exhibitions==

The permanent exhibition [http://www.rommuz.cz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=43] covers 6 rooms with an area of 326&amp;nbsp;m². It is dedicated to the life, culture, and important events of the Romanis during their migration from [[India]] until the present day, with emphasis on the situation in [[Czech lands]] during the period 1945–1989.

Temporary exhibitions, mostly art and photography, are created from time to time.

In addition to the exhibitions, the museum is also a place of Romani research in [[Central Europe]]. With a public library, students and other interested people have a chance to select from more than 3,000 publications (books, magazines, CDs). The museum organizes lectures, concerts, panel debates and [[Romany language]] courses for the public and professionals. In the afternoon the club is opened for Romani children from the neighbourhood.

==Library==
The library sources include important research papers and prints, Romani literature, news articles in Czech and Slovakian (regarding to Roma), news articles about Roma in foreign languages, overview of legislations, printed discussions and debates.

His social history of Indian sport, ''Olympics: The India Story'' co-authored with historian Boria Majumdar, was welcomed as a "pioneering, long awaited"&lt;ref&gt;K.

Mehta and Majumdar joined together again to write ''Sellotape Legacy'', a detailed account of the politics, economics and disaster of the Delhi Commonwealth Games in 2010. Former Indian sport minister [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]] called it a "blazing expose" and a "thorough, well-researched, sober and absorbingly well-written indictment of Everything You wanted to Know about CWG [Commonwealth Games] but were Afraid to Ask.".&lt;ref&gt;Mani Shankar Aiyar, [http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?267208 "A Pratfall, Mr Kalmadi?"], "Outlook", 4 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nambikwara''' (also called '''Nambikuára''') is an [[indigenous people of Brazil]], living in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. Currently about 1,200 Nambikwara live in [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] in the Brazilian state of [[Mato Grosso]] along the [[Guaporé River|Guaporé]] and [[Juruena River|Juruena]] rivers. Their villages are accessible from the Pan-American highway.&lt;ref name="Kroeker, 2001, p.1"&gt;Kroeker, 2001, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The Nambikwara are also known as the Alaketesu, Anunsu, Nambikwara, or Nambiquara people.&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nab "Nambikuára, Southern."] ''Ethnologue.'' Retrieved 9 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Nambikwara speak the [[Southern Nambikuára language]], which is a [[Nambiquaran language]]. A dictionary and grammar have been written for the language, which is written in the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==History==
The Nambikwara were first contacted in 1770 but did not experience prolonged contact with Europeans until the early 20th century, when Brazilian army official Marechal [[Cândido Rondon]] passed through Nambikwara territory to extend the telegraph lines. He estimated that there were around 10,000 Nambikwara. Shortly after contact with European Brazilians [[epidemic]]s of [[measles]] and smallpox decimated the population to only 500 around 1930.&lt;ref name="Kroeker, 2001, p.1"/&gt;

The culture of the Nambikwara was the subject of studies by [[France|French]] [[anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], which were later analyzed by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in his work ''Of Grammatology''.

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}
The '''Narada sting operation''' was a [[sting operation]] carried out by [[Mathew Samuel]] targeting high-ranking officials and politicians of the [[All India Trinamul Congress]] (AITC). It showed several politicians and a high-ranked police officer accepting cash-bribes in exchange for providing unofficial favors to a company.

Performed in 2014 for the Indian news-magazine ''[[Tehelka]]'', it was published on a private website months before the 2016 [[West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, 2016|West Bengal Assembly elections]]. 

{{As of|June 2017}}, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), [[Enforcement Directorate]] (ED) and a parliamentary ethics committee are probing the case. The Trinamool Congress has rejected the allegations and has claimed that the money was received in way of donations.

== Background ==
{{Main|Mathew Samuel}}
[[File:This is the photo of Mathew Samuel.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Mathew Samuel]]
[[Mathew Samuel]] was the former managing editor of ''[[Tehelka]],'' a news magazine known for its [[investigative journalism]] and [[sting operations]]. He was one of the main principals behind the sting operation ''[[Operation West End|West End]]'' which spawned a miniature democratic crisis in 2001 and eventually led to the resignation of Defence Minister [[George Fernandes]] and later, the conviction of [[Bharatiya Janata party|Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)]] President [[Bangaru Laxman]].&lt;ref name=outlook&gt;{{cite web|title=After Eleven Years, It Stings To Say This...|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?280773|publisher=[[Outlook magazine|Outlook]]|last=Samuel|first=Mathew|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2014, the ''Tehelka'' administration floated the idea of a sting operation in an effort "to come back into the market with a good story; with a bang".&lt;ref name=paid/&gt; Samuel and his team initially opted for either [[Madhya Pradesh]] or [[Himachal Pradesh]], but the opportunities never materialized. The ruling government in Madhya Pradesh was led by BJP and Samuel did not wish to be identified as a journalist who solely targeted the BJP governments whilst the political atmosphere of Himachal Pradesh was too quiet to be conducive for a sting operation.

It was around this time the [[Saradha Group financial scandal]] surfaced in [[West Bengal]]. Samuel felt that the corruption unearthed until then was only "the tip of the iceberg" and the team accordingly zeroed in on the politicians of West Bengal as their target.&lt;ref name="paid"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/news/2017/04/29/indian-rupee-80-lakh-for-the-narada-sting-was-paid-by-mp-kd-singh-mathew-samuel-ed-tmc|title=₹ 80 lakh for the Narada sting was paid by MP KD Singh|access-date=2 June 2017|date=29 April 2017|work=[[The National Herald (India)|The National Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
In an interview with ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'', Mathew Samuel said he was inspired by Israeli [[Mossad]] officer [[Michael Harari|Mike Harari]]. He had asked a friend to create a cover for him as a high official of the fictitious Chennai-based firm Impex Consultancy Solutions. An [[Aadhaar]] card in the name of ''Santhosh Shankaran'' was issued for Samuel and social-media profiles were created.&lt;ref name="spy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160403/jsp/7days/story_77941.jsp|title=7 Days: I spy with my little eye...|date=3 April 2016|access-date=2 June 2017|language=en|work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some commentators have noted that it's another reminder to the sad state of affairs that can be easily exploited to generate a fake AADHAR number.}}

While trying to gauge the mood of the public, they chanced upon a taxi-driver who introduced them to a person who was locally known as 'Tiger'.&lt;ref name="paid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spy" /&gt; Samuel claims that 'Tiger' initially introduced him to Iqbal Ahmed, the then deputy mayor of the [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]], and [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer S. M. H. Mirza. They were then supposedly acquainted with Sultan Ahmed (Iqbal’s brother), [[Subrata Mukherjee]], [[Bobby Hakim|Firhad Hakim]] and [[Aparupa Poddar]]. Mirza also introduced him to [[Madan Mitra]] and [[Mukul Roy]]. And, each of these meetings proliferated in the development of further connections. In Samuel's words: "It was almost like a chain reaction".&lt;ref name="paid" /&gt;

In the 52 hours of footage photographed by Samuel and his colleague Angel Abraham around 2014, many prominent politicians resembling [[Member of Parliament (India)|Members of Parliament]] Mukul Roy, [[Saugata Roy]], [[Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar]], [[Prasun Banerjee|Prasun Bannerjee]], [[Suvendu Adhikari]] and Sultan Ahmad, and state ministers Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and Iqbal Ahmed&lt;ref name="spy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160315/jsp/bengal/story_74595.jsp|title=THE STING IN FULL|work=The Telegraph|access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were seen accepting alleged bribes in the form of wads of cash in exchange for doing unofficial favours for Impex Consultancy Solutions floated by Samuel himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160317/jsp/frontpage/story_74983.jsp#.WN3xQvl97IU|title=Narada referred to LS ethics committee|last=|first=|date=17 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=24 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Whilst Samuel initially claimed that [[K. D. Singh (politician)|K. D. Singh]], a [[Rajya Sabha]] MP of the [[Trinamool Congress]] and majority owner of Tehelka, was in the dark about the entire operation and he was a 'lone-wolf',&lt;ref name="spy" /&gt; he later retracted his claims and asserted that Singh knew and funded the entire operation.&lt;ref name="paid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/state/k-d-singh-ordered-me-to-do-the-sting-operation-on-tmc-leaders-says-mathew-samuel-1.582948|title=তৃণমূল সাংসদ কে ডি সিংহের নির্দেশেই স্টিং অপারেশন, বিস্ফোরক ম্যাথু|date=20 March 2017|work=[[Anandabazar Patrika]]|access-date=24 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the budget of the operation was initially set at {{INRConvert|2500000|year=2017}} but was later increased to {{INRConvert|8000000|year=2017}}, as the number of potential targets increased vastly.&lt;ref name="paid" /&gt; The police subsequently filed a criminal case against Singh expecting that a large part of the sum might have been harvested from his [[Alchemist Group|chit fund business]] in West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/w857MuEba6xgj5yd0eZ2vO/Narada-sting-Kolkata-Police-files-criminal-case-against-TMC.html|title=Narada sting: Kolkata Police files criminal case against TMC MP Kanwar Deep Singh|last=Majumdar|first=Arkamoy Dutta|date=23 March 2017|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Singh refuted his involvement with any aspect of the sting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/state/kd-singh-says-he-has-no-relation-with-narada-sting-operation-1.730210|title=নারদে জড়িত নই, দাবি কেডি সিংহের|work=[[Anandabazar Patrika]]|access-date=27 July 2018|language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octavia-Hill-by-Sargent.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|alt=portrait of a Victorian woman of middle age facing the artist, head slightly to the right|Octavia Hill by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1898]]
'''Octavia Hill''' (3 December 1838 – 13 August 1912&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;) was an English social reformer, whose main concern was the welfare of the inhabitants of cities, especially London, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Born into a family with a strong commitment to alleviating  poverty, she herself grew up in straitened circumstances owing to the financial failure of her father. With no formal schooling, she worked from the age of 14 for the welfare of working people.

Hill was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.

Another of Hill's concerns was the availability of open spaces for poor people. She campaigned against development on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save London's [[Hampstead Heath]] and [[Parliament Hill Fields]] from being built on. She was one of the three founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], set up to preserve places of historic interest or natural beauty for the enjoyment of the British public. She was a founder member of the [[Charity Organization Society|Charity Organisation Society]] (now the charity Family Action) which organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. She was a member of the [[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09#The Royal Commission on the Poor Law|Royal Commission on the Poor Laws]] in 1905.

Hill's legacy includes the large holdings of the modern National Trust, several housing projects still run on her lines, a tradition of training for housing managers, and the museum established by the Octavia Hill Society at her birthplace.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Octavia Hill was the daughter of James Hill, corn merchant, follower of Owenism&lt;ref name=Phil&gt;James Hill, father to Octavia Hill, Follower of Owenism and founder of newspaper "The star in the East"[http://www.wisbech-society.co.uk/octavia.html "Octavia Hill: The Wisbech Society and Preservation Trust"]&lt;/ref&gt; and banker, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. He had been widowed twice, and had six children (five daughters and a son) from his previous marriages.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, Mark K., [http://www.infed.org/thinkers/octavia_hill.htm "Octavia Hill: Housing, Space and Social Reform"], The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education, 2008, accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been impressed by the writings on education of Caroline Southwood Smith, the daughter of Dr [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], a pioneer of sanitary reform.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-33873?rskey=rnxST6&amp;result=1 "Hill, Octavia (1838–1912)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He had engaged Caroline as a governess for his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835, three years before Octavia was born in [[Wisbech]], [[Cambridgeshire]], her father's eighth daughter and ninth child.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The family's comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill's financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840 he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill's father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill's paternal role.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of the urban poor. Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], and Southwood Smith's daily experience in his work at the [[London Hospital]] in the [[East End of London|East End]] inspired Octavia Hill's concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
[[File:Ruskin-SouthwoodSmith-Maurice-Mayhew.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=four head and shoulder portraits of Victorian men|Early influences on Octavia Hill – top: [[John Ruskin]] and [[Thomas Southwood Smith]]; below: [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F.D. Maurice]] and [[Henry Mayhew]]]]
The family settled in a small cottage in [[Finchley]], now a north London suburb, but then a village.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Octavia Hill was impressed and moved by [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', a book that portrayed the daily lives of slum dwellers. She was also strongly influenced by the theologian, [[Anglican]] priest and social reformer [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]], who was a family friend. She began her work on behalf of London's poor by helping to make toys for [[Ragged school]] children, and serving as secretary of the women's classes at the Working Men's College in [[Bloomsbury]] in central London.&lt;ref name=wohl&gt;Wohl, A. S., "Octavia Hill and the Homes of the London Poor", ''The Journal of British Studies'', University of Chicago Press, Vol. 10, No. 2 (May, 1971), pp. 105–31 {{DOI|10.1086/385612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-operative guild providing employment for "distressed gentlewomen" accepted Hill for training in glass-painting when she was 13. When the work of the guild was expanded to provide work in toy-making for Ragged school children, she was invited, at the age of 14, to take charge of the workroom.&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, Peter H., "Octavia Hill: An Appraisal", ''The Town Planning Review'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223–37&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she began working in her spare time from the guild as a copyist for [[John Ruskin]] in [[Dulwich Art Gallery]] and the [[National Gallery]]. She was deeply aware of the dreadful living conditions of the children in her charge at the guild.

Her views on encouraging self-reliance led to her association with the [[Charity Organisation Society]] (COS), described by Hill's [[biographer]] Gillian Darley as "a contentious body which deplored dependence fostered by kindly but unrigorous philanthropy … support to the poor had to be carefully targeted and efficiently supervised. Later in life, however, she began to think the COS line … was over-harsh."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Hill was short, like all her family, and indifferent to fashion. Her friend [[Henrietta Barnett]] wrote: "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but the beauty of her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness."&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt; Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. [[Gertrude Bell]] called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, [[Frederick Temple]], encountered her at a meeting of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, "She spoke for half an hour … I never had such a beating in all my life."&lt;ref&gt;Leak, Adrian, [http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2010/13-august/faith/for-houses-and-green-space "For houses and green space"] ''[[The Church Times]]'', 10 August 2010, accessed 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing for the poor===
[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century]]
Parliament and many concerned reformers had been attempting to improve the housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and the first of many tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself.

John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her.&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; As an [[aesthete]] and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, [[Marylebone]].{{#tag:ref|Now known as Garbutt Place.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;|group= n}}

Ruskin placed these houses, which were "in a dreadful state of dirt and neglect",&lt;ref name=times/&gt; under Hill's management. He told her that investors might be attracted to such schemes if a five percent annual return could be secured.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1866 Ruskin acquired the freehold of five more houses for Hill to manage in Freshwater Place, Marylebone.&lt;ref name=wyatt2&gt;Wyatt, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' recorded, "The houses faced a bit of desolate ground occupied by dilapidated cowsheds and manure heaps. The needful repairs and cleaning were carried out, the waste land was turned into a playground where Mr. Ruskin had some trees planted."&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 15 August 1912, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

After being improved the properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. A return of five per cent on capital was obtained as promised to Ruskin; any excess over the five per cent was reinvested within the properties for the benefit of the tenants. Rent arrears were not tolerated, and bad debts were minimal. As Hill said, "Extreme punctuality, and diligence in collecting rents, and a strict determination that they shall be paid regularly, have accomplished this."&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;  In consequence of her prudent management, Hill was able to attract new backers, and by 1874 she had 15 housing schemes with around 3,000 tenants.&lt;ref  name=smith/&gt;

Hill's system was based on closely managing not only the buildings but the tenants; she insisted, "you cannot deal with the people and their houses separately."&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; She maintained close personal contact with all her tenants, and was strongly opposed to impersonal bureaucratic organisations and to governmental intervention in housing.&lt;ref name=morrell&gt;Morrell, Caroline, "Octavia Hill", ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 52, No. 1 (February 1999), p. 158 {{DOI|10.1111/1468-0289.00122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her view, "municipal socialism and subsidized housing" led to indiscriminate demolition, re-housing schemes, and the destruction of communities.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt;

===Housing management===
At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included [[Emma Cons]] and [[Eva McLaren]]) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; At first Hill believed, "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers."&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.&lt;ref name=wyatt3/&gt;

If any of Hill's assistants had spare time, whether during normal working hours or in frequent voluntary after-hours working, it was used to promote tenants' associations and after-work and children's after-school clubs and societies.&lt;ref name=wyatt3&gt;Wyatt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, Hill created the Southwark detachment of the [[Army Cadet Force]], its first independent unit, which gave training along military lines for local boys.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Hill considered that such an organisation would be more like the "real thing" than such existing outfits as the [[Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade|Church Lads' Brigade]] and therefore more attractive to young men "who had passed the age of make-believe". She invited a serving officer of the [[Derbyshire Regiment]] to set up the company, and such was its popularity that its numbers had to be capped at 160 cadets.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#EEEEEE |salign=center | quote =It would be wrong to assume that Octavia's principle of housing management was guided simply on the question of the payment of rent. Despite being up to date with his rent, a tenant was surprised to receive Notice to Quit, because he would not send his children to school and had overcrowded his rooms. Octavia's response to his complaint that he didn't owe any rent was that it was not the only thing she insisted upon. In her view, she could not allow anything so wrong as the neglect of children and overcrowding to continue where she had the power to prevent it!| source =  R.J. Wyatt &lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;| align=left| width=33%}}
Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: "Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless." She was an outspoken critic of the principles of "[[outdoor relief]]" or the [[Speenhamland system]] of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as "a profligate use of public funds."&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt; Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up on references of prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;

In 1884, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners recognised her enlightened approach and turned to her to manage and reform their slum properties in South London, which were notorious for poverty and petty crime. Hill turned these estates into model properties, which still paid a return on investment. These estates continued to be let to tenants at affordable rents throughout much of the twentieth century, even when rent control was relaxed and open market rents substantially increased.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas2018"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Octavia Hill (1838-1912) | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = Owen Spencer-Thomas | date = 2018 | accessdate = 2018-02-06 | url = http://sayitstraight.co.uk/local-history/biographies/octavia-hill-1838-1912/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American admirer described her as "ruling over a little kingdom of three thousand loving subjects with an iron scepter twined with roses."&lt;ref&gt;Bremner, Robert H. "'An Iron Scepter Twined with Roses': The Octavia Hill System of Housing Management", ''The Social Service Review'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (June 1965), The University of Chicago Press, pp. 222–31 {{JSTOR|30017593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hill drove her associates hard, she drove herself harder. In 1877, she collapsed and had to take a break of several months from her work. Darley ascribes a number of contributory causes: "chronic overwork, a lack of delegation, the death of her close friend Jane Senior, the failure of a brief engagement",{{#tag:ref|Hill's fiancé was one of her helpers, the barrister and later M.P. [[Edward Bond (politician)|Edward Bond]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;|group= n}} as well as an attack on her by John Ruskin.{{#tag:ref|Ruskin, by now mentally unstable, had reacted fiercely when Hill opposed his plans to sell his properties to the St. George's Company, an organisation that she regarded as financially dubious.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darley (2004) ''quoted'' by Smith&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The Hill family found a companion for her, Harriot Yorke (1843–1930). Yorke took on a great amount of the everyday work that had caused Hill's collapse. She remained her companion until Hill's death.  A further palliative was the building of a cottage, at [[Crockham Hill]] near [[Sevenoaks]] in Kent, where they could take breaks from their work in London.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

===Open spaces===
[[File:Wicken Lode1.JPG|thumb|alt=photograph of countryside scene, with water bounded by grass|[[Wicken Fen]] acquired by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1899]]
[[File:Footpath on Hampstead Heath - geograph.org.uk - 53758.jpg|thumb|right|alt=outdoor photograph of a large, grassed open space, with trees|[[Hampstead Heath]] – saved by Octavia Hill and others]] Among Hill's concerns was that her tenants, and all urban workers, should have access to open spaces.  She believed in "the life-enhancing virtues of pure earth, clean air and blue sky."&lt;ref&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/conservation.html "Conservation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401202153/http://octaviahill.org/conservation.html |date=1 April 2010 }} The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 she wrote:
{{quote|There is perhaps no need of the poor of London which more prominently forces itself on the notice of anyone working among them than that of space. ... How can it best be given? And what is it precisely which should be given? I think we want four things. Places to sit in, places to play in, places to stroll in, and places to spend a day in. The preservation of [[Wimbledon and Putney Commons|Wimbledon]] and [[Epping Forest|Epping]] shows that the need is increasingly recognised. But a visit to Wimbledon, Epping, or [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor]] means for the workman not only the cost of the journey but the loss of a whole day's wages; we want, besides, places where the long summer evenings or the Saturday afternoon may be enjoyed without effort or expense.&lt;ref&gt;Hill 1883, VII. Space for the People, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

She campaigned hard against building on existing suburban woodlands, and helped to save [[Hampstead Heath]] and [[Parliament Hill Fields]] from development.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; She was the first to use the term "Green Belt" for the protected rural areas surrounding London. Three hills in Kent (Mariners Hill, [[Toys Hill]] and [[Ide Hill]]) which she helped to protect from development form part of the belt.&lt;ref name=hillsocwho&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/who-was-octavia-hill.html "Who Was Octavia Hill?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601102028/http://octaviahill.org/who-was-octavia-hill.html |date=1 June 2010 }} The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 Hill became the treasurer of the Kyrle Society, founded in that year by her eldest sister, [[Miranda Hill|Miranda]], as a "Society for the Diffusion of Beauty". Under the slogan "Bring Beauty Home to the Poor" it aimed to bring art, books, music and open spaces into the lives of the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Octavia, "Oratorios for the People", ''The Musical Times'', December 1884, p. 717 {{JSTOR|3356074}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period it flourished and expanded, and although it declined after a few years, it was a template for the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], 20 years later.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Before that, however, Hill was engaged in a campaign in 1883 to stop the construction of railways from the quarries in the fells overlooking [[Buttermere]], in the English [[Lake District]], with damaging effect on the unspoilt scenery. The campaign was led by Canon [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], who secured the support of Ruskin, Hill, and [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], solicitor to the [[Commons Preservation Society]].&lt;ref name=rawnsleydnb&gt;Murphy, Graham. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37884 "Rawnsley, Hardwicke Drummond (1851–1920)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 15 November 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1875 onwards, Hunter had been Hill's legal adviser on the protection of open spaces in London. Both he and Rawnsley, building on an idea put forward by Ruskin, conceived of a trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation.&lt;ref name=hunterdnb&gt;Chubb L.W., rev.

On 16 November 1893, Hill, Hunter and Rawnsley met in the offices of the Commons Preservation Society and agreed to launch such a trust. Hill suggested that it should be called "The Commons and Gardens Trust", but the three agreed to adopt Hunter's suggested title, the "National Trust".&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Under its full formal title, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty was inaugurated the following year.&lt;ref name=hunterdnb/&gt; The trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and endangered buildings of historic interest; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-trust/w-thecharity/w-thecharity_our-past/w-history_trust-timeline.htm "Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204142224/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-trust/w-thecharity/w-thecharity_our-past/w-history_trust-timeline.htm |date=4 February 2011 }}, The National Trust, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
The number of homes managed by Hill continued to grow. Although Ruskin had turned against her in a bout of mental instability, she found a new supporter, the [[Church Commissioners|Ecclesiastical Commissioners]], who handed over to her the management of their housing estates in several poor areas of south London.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; By the end of the nineteenth century, Hill's women workers were no longer unpaid volunteers but trained professionals. Hill's influence spread beyond the properties under her own control. Her ideas were taken up and copied, with her enthusiastic support, in continental Europe and the United States of America.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; [[Beatrice Webb]] said that she "first became aware of the meaning of the poverty of the poor," while staying with her sister, who was a rent collector for Octavia Hill in the East End.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s daughter, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice of Hesse-Darmstadt]], was taken incognito on a tour of some of Hill's properties, and she translated Hill's ''Homes of the London Poor'' into German.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1662917|year=1990|author1=Lowry|first1=S|title=Much from little|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=300|issue=6733|pages=1207–1208|doi=10.1136/bmj.300.6733.1207}} (free access)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those whom Hill trained was her assistant and secretary, Maud Jeffery, who was later engaged by the [[Commissioners of Crown Lands]] to run new housing estates in London on Octavia Hill's lines.&lt;ref&gt;"The Housing Business Group", ''Housing News'', Autumn 2004, [[The Crown Estate]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Even some local authorities, despite Hill's distrust, followed her model:  some of the earliest examples of municipal council housing, at [[Kensington]] and [[Camberwell]], were run on her lines, with the acquisition of working class houses, and their gradual improvement, without evictions or demolitions.&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt;

[[File:Octavia hill.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hill in 1881]]

Despite her opposition to interference by national or local government in the provision of housing, Hill had to cope with the newly created [[London County Council]] and the involvement of the council and other local authorities in providing housing for the poor. In 1884 a royal commission on the housing of the working classes was set up, but the prime minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone|W.E. Gladstone]], and his ministerial colleagues vetoed a proposal to include Hill among the members of the commission.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Gladstone approved of Hill's principles but thought her difficult as a person. Had Hill's appointment not been vetoed, she would have been the first woman member of a royal commission. In the event she was one of the commission's key witnesses. She served as a member of a later royal commission, on the Poor Laws, in 1905.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U187121 "Hill, Miss Octavia",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007,   accessed 11 Oct 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}  The municipal authorities quickly surpassed her in the number of properties under their management.

A.S. Wohl notes that in the 1880s Hill had about £70,000 worth of property under her management, and at the end of her career she was managing the dwellings of "perhaps three or four thousand people at the most."&lt;ref name=wohl/&gt; The London County Council, by contrast, had a budget of £1,500,000 for its programme of rehousing London's poor in 1901–02.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Octavia, [http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TT19010427.2.24 "Housing of the Poor"], ''The Times'', 4 March 1901, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill was opposed to other reforms that came about in the early part of the twentieth century. She was against female suffrage on the grounds that "men and women help one another because they are different, have different gifts and different spheres."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 15 July 1910, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; She also believed that provision of social services and old-age pensions by the government did more harm than good, sapping people's self-reliance.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Hill died from [[cancer]] on 13 August 1912 at her home in [[Marylebone]], at the age of 73.

==Legacy and memorials==
[[File:Octavia_Hill_(plaque).jpg|thumb|right|alt=photograph of a memorial blue plaque|Plaque at Redcross Way in South London]]
When [[John Singer Sargent]]'s portrait of her was presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, "When I am gone, I hope my friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, and it is the spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. ... We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces..." But, she said, more important would be "the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and better days to come  – greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sydney Cockerell|Cockerell, Sir Sydney]], "Octavia Hill", ''The Times'', 28 February 1935, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horace Street Trust, founded by Hill, became a model for many subsequent housing associations and developed into the present trust that bears her name, Octavia Housing. Today it owns several of the homes, including Gable Cottages, designed by Elijah Hoole, who worked with Hill for many years.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/octavia-s-legacy.html  "Legacy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528084208/http://octaviahill.org/octavia-s-legacy.html |date=28 May 2010 }}, Octavia Hill Society, accessed 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill's determination to provide community space can still be seen in the shape of the Red Cross site in Southwark (1888), among others. The Octavia Hill Society website states that with  a community hall, and soundly maintained attractive houses, Hill here anticipated the fundamental ingredients of town planning by some 15 years.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

The [[Settlement movement|Settlement Movement]] (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Hill's work. Her colleagues [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and Henrietta Barnett, founded [[Toynbee Hall]], the first university-sponsored settlement, which together with the Women's University Settlement (later called the Blackfriars Settlement) continues to serve local communities.&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt; Overseas, Hill's name is perpetuated in the Octavia Hill Association in [[Philadelphia]], a small property company founded in 1896 to provide affordable housing to low and middle-income city residents.&lt;ref name="davis/"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Allen|last2=Sutherland|first2=John F.|title=Reform and Uplift Among the Philadelphia Negroes: the Diary of Helen Parrish, 1888|journal=Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|date=October 1970|volume=94|issue=4|pages=496–99|url=https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/42674/42395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=legacy/&gt;

Women who had trained under Hill formed the Association of Women Housing Workers in 1916. This later changed its name to the Society of Housing Managers in 1948. After merging with the Institute of Housing Managers in 1965, the society became the present day [[Chartered Institute of Housing]] in 1994. The CIH is a professional body for those working in the housing profession in the UK and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cih.org/about/history.htm "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062420/http://www.cih.org/about/history.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}, Chartered Institute of Housing, accessed 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The training that Hill gave to Charity Organisation Society volunteers contributed to the development of modern social work, and COS continued to be instrumental in developing social work as a profession during the twentieth century. COS is still in operation today as the charity [[Family Action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 "1880s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |date=18 July 2011 }}, Family Action, accessed 15 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Parliament passed the first National Trust Act, enshrining the trust's permanent purpose and giving it powers to protect property for the benefit of the nation. The trust now looks after a wide range of coast, countryside and historic buildings. According to the trust's website, "Staff, volunteers and tenants are engaged daily in providing access to open spaces for people's enjoyment, providing habitats for wildlife and in improving our environment – 'for ever, for everyone'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment.htm "For ever for everyone"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122121035/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment.htm |date=22 November 2010 }}, The National Trust, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemorations of Hill herself include a monument to her at a [[Surrey]] beauty spot, on the summit of a hill called [[Hydon Ball]] (now owned by the National Trust). Shortly after her death, the family erected a stone seat there, from which walkers can enjoy views over the Surrey countryside. The Octavia Hill Society was set up in 1992 "to promote awareness of the ideas and ideals of Octavia Hill, her family, fellow workers and their relevance in today's society nationally and internationally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://octaviahill.org/the-octavia-hill-society.html "Octavia Hill Society"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609155157/http://octaviahill.org/the-octavia-hill-society.html |date=9 June 2010 }}, The Octavia Hill Society, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under the society's auspices her birthplace at Wisbech has been turned into the Octavia Hill Birthplace Museum.  In 1995, to mark the centenary of the National Trust, a new variety of rose, "Octavia Hill", was named in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosesuk.com/rose_locator/roses/repeat_flowering_shrub/1231_octavia_hill.php "Octavia Hill"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129114809/http://rosesuk.com/rose_locator/roses/repeat_flowering_shrub/1231_octavia_hill.php |date=29 November 2010 }}, Roses UK, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--WP:CITEVAR There is a carved monument to Hill in Holy Trinity Church at [[Crockham Hill]], Kent: she is represented as "a little old lady in a shawl".&lt;ref name="Newman242"&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|1969|p=242.}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The '''Pende people''' (singular: '''Mupende'''; plural: '''Bapende'''), also known as the '''Phende people''', are an [[ethnic group]] in the south-western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Pende are divided into two [[cultural group]]s: the Eastern Pende and the Western Pende who are distinct but consider themselves part of the same ethnic group. The number of people who consider themselves to be ethnically Pende is estimated at over 250,000.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt;

The Pende speak their own language ([[Pende language|Kipende]]) and are particularly known for their artistic works. They are considered to be culturally similar to the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and [[Suku people]]s who live in neighboring areas.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt;

==History==
The Pende are divided into two distinct cultural groups: the Western Pende and the Eastern Pende.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt; However, both groups see themselves as part of the same ethnic group.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt; There is no centralised political authority and Pende society is organised around extended family groups rather than through [[traditional authority|chiefly authority]].&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt;

Much like the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and [[Suku people]]s, the Pende originally lived in the strip between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Cuanza River]], in modern-day [[Angola]]. They migrated to their current region of the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo in around 1620 as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Lunda]].&lt;ref name=UIowa&gt;{{cite web|title=Pende|url=https://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/peoples/show/Pende|work=Art &amp; Life in Africa|publisher=University of Iowa|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In around 1885, the powerful [[Chokwe people|Chokwe ethnic group]] began expanding and gained control over the Eastern Pende but this period was brought to an end by the arrival of [[Western European colonialism and colonization|European colonists]] and the creation of the [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt;

Between May and September 1931, the Pende revolted against [[Belgian Congo|Belgian colonial rule]] in Kwilu. The revolt was quickly suppressed by the colonial authorities but was one of the largest revolts in the Congo during the [[Interwar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgian Congo (1908-1960)|url=http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/belgian-congo-1908-1960/|publisher=University of Central Arkansas|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The origins of the revolt began with recruitment efforts on behalf of the [[Huileries du Congo Belge]] (HCB), a subsidiary of [[Lever Brothers|Lever]] Brothers, ancestor of the acutal [[Unilever]]. A territorial agent named Edouard Burnotte was working with a company recruiter, Alphonse Vanhombeek, as well as some messengers. They began their efforts on the 14th of May. Burnotte and Vanhombeek had little success at first, because the men hid in the bush. In response, Burnotte ordered messengers accompanying him to arrest the women and shut them up in a barn. Also on 14th May, 47 men were lashed in Kilamba for having failed to deliver their palm fruit quota to a Compagnie du Kasi (CK) oil mill in Bangi. Bangi was in Kwkwit territoire, 20 minutes away from Kilamba. On the evening of 14th May, Vanhombeek and Burnotte became drunk, and had some of the women shut in the barn brought to them. They then had a long orgy, presumably without the consent of the women. Collignon, one of the men also present at the orgy, later went to Kilamba. There he was jostled by Africans who were upset that he had not provided compensation to a woman named Kafushi, whom he had dallied with and presumably raped, and also because he had taken chickens without paying for them. Matemo attempted to claim the payment owed to his wife, Kafushi, in accordance to African custom. Collignon slapped Matemo and had him beaten by servants and workers at the oil mill. Colignon lodged a complaint against Matemo, and the territorial administrator, Leonard Vaninthout, sent territorial agent Maximilien Balot to investigate. Balot, accompanied by a soldier and four messengers, encountered a hostile crowd lead by Matem on 8th June. Balot attempted to disperse the crowd by firing a number of shots in the air. When this failed, Balot shot someone in the arm with a hunting rifle. After this Matemo charged at Balot, struck him in the head with a knife, chased him into a bush, and finished him off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

A letter written by administrator Gustave Weekx on 30th May from Pukusu states that, "The openly anti-European movement is characterised by a total cessation of economic activity. For several days now, not a single crate of fruit has been delivered to the [Portuguese] firm of Madail de Banza." Weekx also tells about an armed conflict he was part of the day before in Kisenzele. Weekx was accompanied by four soldiers and a driver. He noticed a large group of around 200 men, who were intoning battle cries. When he came within 75 metres, Weekx and his escorts were attacked with arrows. Weekx ordered his troops to open fire, and after some of the natives had been wounded, they fled. Weekx recommended the whole of the southern region of the Lutshima to be placed under military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

On 3rd June District Commissioner Vanderhallen dispatched two platoons (75 men) to carry out the requested occupation. On 6th June Commissioner General Constant Wauters telegraphed Vanderhallen, asking him to turn the military occupation into a police operation. Wauters also asked the district commissioner in Kasai to prevent the rebels from traveling to his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

A letter written on 9th June by Vaninthout, administrator of Kandale, states that, "From Kobo onwards all the blacks take flight when I approach; they are armed with bows and shoot arrows at any messengers sent to summon them," and requests military occupation of the Kandale chefferies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

On 14th July 1931 a daily newspaper, the Le Soir, published information about Belgian troops opening fire with machine guns on the rebels. The newspaper estimated that the rebels suffered around 100 deaths. The Belgian troops had only two wounded according to the newspaper. In 1932, in a declaration to the Chamber, the Colonial Minister acknowledged that machine guns had been used, and that the use of the machine guns had produced numerous victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

Vanderhallen, acting on orders from Wauters, initially refused to accept attempts to surrender, on the grounds that Balot's remains, and in particular his skull, had not been recovered. For example, the chiefs of Yongo and Bangi attempted to surrender on the 2nd and 4th of September, but were told that their surrenders would only be accepted if Balot's head, as well as other parts of his body, were returned. On 6th September, about four hundred villagers in Kilamba were arrested. On 9th September, Balot's head was recovered from Kilamba, a foot from Kisandale, and a finger from Kasandji. Also on 9th September, fourteen villagers were killed in the Indele region. On the 16th of September, more parts of Balot's body were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

A report by Omer Dewilliamort discusses a number of causes of the revolt. The head tax and the supplementary tax, which were used as legal justification for forced labour in the Congo, had been significantly increased. One of the ways the Congolese were forced to earn money to pay the head tax with was by picking palm fruit, and the price for 30 kilos of fruit had been lowered from 2.5 francs to only one franc. To pay the new supplementary tax, a man with two wives had to cut 2.5 tonnes of fruit. Additionally, the natives often faced difficulties in getting paid at all when they delivered fruit. Industrialists' representatives had been committing various thefts and abuses. Perks customarily paid to chiefs had been suppressed. In the Yongo chefferie, where people were required by the State to grow food crops, the HCB failed to buy up the bulk of these food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

During the revolt, the rebels performed a number of religious rituals. However, according to Deputy Jacquemotte, this does not mean that the revolt broke out for religious reasons. Jacquemotte, like Dewilliamort, considered the reasons to be economic. He pointed out that, the price of palm nuts having fallen, blacks were forced to work for several months to pay their taxes. He declared that, "The oppression weighing upon the tribes of the Congo is growing heavier by the day, and the exploitation of the blacks is every day more intense and more inhumane. The revolt is simply the logical and inevitable consequence of this oppression. It is the outcome towards which all those who, preferring anything, even death itself, to continuing their existence under present conditions, now willingly run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchal|first1=Jules|others=Translated by Martin Thom.

==Culture==
The Pende have a [[matrilineal]] culture and family [[kinship]] plays an important role in structuring social relations.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt; They traditionally practice a form of [[ancestor worship]] in which the ancestors (''Mvumbi'') are believed to affect prospects of success and failure in everyday life.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt;

The Pende traditionally speak their own language, known as [[Pende language|Kipende]], which is part of the [[Central Bantu languages|Central Bantu group]].&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt; The Pende are particularly known for their art, which is complex and includes [[African traditional mask|traditional masks]], associated with initiation rituals.&lt;ref name=UIowa/&gt;

'''Punjabi Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] whose heritage originates wholly or partly in the [[Punjab]], a  region in northern [[South Asia]], which encompasses [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. There are large Punjabi communities in [[British Columbia]], concentrated in [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]], and in [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]], a city in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] of [[Ontario]]. 

{{Punjabis}}

==History==
By 1906, there were 1,500 [[Sikh]] workers living in Canada, almost entirely from the [[Punjab]]. Punjabis avoided the [[Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907]] by staying indoors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sikhs.org/100th/part1a.html Century of Struggle and Success The Sikh Canadian Experience] 13 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Punjabi Canadians began occupying all areas of Vancouver in the 1960s, however two concentrations developed: South Vancouver and Burnaby;&lt;ref name=NayarSikhdiasporap327&gt;Nayar, ''[[The Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver]]'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NShXfaNbRyEC&amp;pg=PA327 327].&lt;/ref&gt; it was at this time that the [[Punjabi Market (Vancouver)|Punjabi Market]], located in South Vancouver, was founded. Later in the 1970s, Punjabi populations began appearing in [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. Vandalism against houses owned by Indo-Canadians and a Sikh [[gurdwara]] occurred in the 1970s, especially in 1974-1975 in Richmond.&lt;ref name=JohnstonHughp7&gt;Johnston, Hugh, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
In [[Metro Vancouver]], 5.5% of residents reported speaking [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] at home, as of 2011. 21.3% of [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]] residents speak it as their primary language at home. In [[Ontario]], Punjabi Canadians are prevalent in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], especially in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Mississauga]], [[Brampton]], and [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/metro/census+punjabi+speaking+population+growing+metro+vancouver/7440097/story.html|title=Census: Punjabi-speaking population growing in Metro Vancouver|publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]]|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Punjabi is the third most spoken language of the [[Parliament of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/oye-hoye-punjabi-is-now-the-third-language-in-parliament-of-canada-2493038.html|title=Oye hoye! Punjabi is now the third language in Parliament of Canada|author=Firstpost|date=3 November 2015|work=Firstpost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
During the early stages of Punjabi immigration to Canada, most pioneers were of the Sikh faith.&lt;ref&gt;Nayar, ''[[The Punjabis in British Columbia]]'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7pO-IZY218C&amp;pg=PA9 9]. "It is interesting to note that, in the BC Lower Mainland (Vancouver and surrounding municipalities, including Burnaby, New Westminster, Richmond, and Surrey), Sikhs raised outside the Punjab refer to themselves as Punjabi and use the term interchangeably with "Sikh," understanding the two as synonymous."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Punjabi Canadians remain mostly Sikh, however also include large numbers of [[Muslims]] and smaller numbers of [[Hindus]] and [[Christians]].

'''''Social Research''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] of the [[social sciences]], published by [[The New School for Social Research]], the graduate social science division of [[The New School]]. The journal has been published continuously since 1934.  It has featured over 2,000 authors, including [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. It is edited by [[Arien Mack]]. The managing editor is [[Cara Schlesinger]]. Guest editors are often invited for thematic issues.

Most issues are theme-driven, combining historical analysis, theoretical explanation, and reportage in rigorous and engaging discussion. Articles cover various fields of the social sciences and the humanities and thus promote the interdisciplinary aims that have characterized The New School for Social Research since its inception.

The themes selected are current, often pressing issues in world society.  The themes often include a political angle, keeping in the tradition of the New School for Social Research's politically conscious history.

Since 1988, the journal publishes the proceedings of a conference series it organizes. The conferences aim to enhance public understanding of critical and contested issues by exploring them in broad historical and cultural contexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4597">'''Systematic trading''' (also known as '''mechanical trading''') is a way of defining trade goals, risk controls and rules that can make investment and trading decisions in a methodical way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Systematic Trading|last = Carver|first = Robert|publisher = Harriman House|year = 2015|isbn = 9780857194459|location = UK|pages = 10|url = http://www.systematictrading.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic trading includes both manual trading of systems, and full or partial automation using computers. Although [[Technical analysis|technical]] systematic systems are more common, there are also systems using fundamental data such as those in [[Hedge fund|equity long:short hedge funds]] and [[Global tactical asset allocation|GTAA]] funds. Systematic trading includes both high frequency trading ([[High-frequency trading|HFT,]] sometimes called [[algorithmic trading]]) and slower types of investment such as systematic trend following. It also includes [[Passive investing|passive index tracking]].

The opposite of systematic trading is discretionary trading. The disadvantage of discretionary trading is that it may be influenced by emotions, isn't easily back tested, and has less rigorous risk control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adaptrade.com/Articles/article-sys-rr.htm Systematic trading, benefits and risks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic trading is related to quantitative trading. [[Quantitative trading]] includes all trading which use quantitative techniques; most quantitative trading involves using techniques to value market assets like [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s but the trading decision may be systematic or discretionary.

== Approach ==
Suppose we need to replicate an index with futures and stocks from other markets with higher liquidity level. An example of systematic approach would be:
# Identify, using [[fundamental analysis]], which stocks and futures should be used for replication.
# Analyze correlations between targeted index and selected stocks and futures, looking for the strategy which provides a better approximation to index.
# Define a coherent strategy to combine dynamically stocks and futures according to market data.
# Simulate the strategy including transaction costs, rollovers, stop-loss orders and all other wanted risk controls.
# Apply the strategy in the real world using algorithmic trading for signal generation and trying to optimize the [[P&amp;L]], controlling continuously the risks.

== Elements ==
Following the ideas of Irene Aldridge's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldridge|first=Irene|title=High Frequency Trading, A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems|year=2010|publisher=Wiley Trading|isbn=978-0-470-56376-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who describes a specific [[High-frequency trading|HFT]] system, a more general systematic trading system should include these elements:

# Data management (in real time and for [[backtesting]] purposes)
# A signal generation system (to create, buy and sell signals according to predefined strategies using quantitative methods)
# A portfolio and P&amp;L tracking system
# A quantitative [[risk management]] system (defining exposure per market, group, or portfolio)
# A routing and execution subsystem (usually containing execution trading algorithms, like [[TWAP]], [[VWAP]]...)

=== Backtesting ===
The key point in systematic trading is the use of backtests to verify (at least
partially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canals|first=L.F.|title=Why HFT cannot be tested|url=http://investions.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-high-frequency-trading-cannot-be.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;) strategies and alternatives. It's a basic point in backtesting to have easy and robust access to trading data.

=== Risk management ===
Systematic trading should take into account the importance of risk management, using a systematic approach to quantify risk, consistent limits and techniques to define how to close excessively risky positions.

Systematic trading, in fact, lends itself to control risk precisely because it allows money managers to define profit targets, loss points, trade size, and system shutdown points objectively and in advance of entering each trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managed Futures Today, Systematic Trading, Systematic Risk Control|url=http://www.managedfuturestodaymag.com/systematic-trading-systematic-risk-control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Superclass List''''' is a creation of [[David Rothkopf]] which his book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and The World They Are Making]]'' (publ. March 2008) is based upon. There are four key elements of success that unite the members of the Superclass, and gives them unparalleled power over world affairs. These elements are: ''geography'', ''pedigree'', ''networking'' and ''luck''.&lt;ref name=global&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/24830-business|title=The New 'Superclass' – Hype -vs- Reality|last=Latif|first=Iqbal|date=2008-01-06|work=Global Politician|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC right}}

==The verified list==
In the book Rothkopf writes that his list from 2008 contains 6,000 individuals. The grouping is, however, only defined roughly and as a statistical reality. Rothkopf also writes that list  (one in a million, [[world population|globally]]), is always in flux. (Note, world population is now 6.9 - 7 billion. so, if published today, the list may contain 7,000 names)

Rothkopf states that his list is not to be shown in public as there will be so much discussion about who does or does not qualify to be on the list. In interviews he mentions individuals that are on the list. This list contain names that he argues he has verified.

[[File:Anthony Pascale by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Pascale, founder of TrekMovie.com.]]
'''TrekMovie.com''' is a news blog website about the ''[[Star Trek]]'' media franchise. It features news reports about the feature films, television and web series, and other related ''Star Trek'' fandom.

== History ==
The site was founded by ''Trek'' fan Anthony Pascale as a site focused on bringing accurate and up-to-date news and information about ''Star Trek''. TrekMovie.com was launched as The Trek XI Report on July 15, 2006, the same day it was announced that [[J. J. Abrams]] would direct [[Paramount Pictures]]{{'}} new ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''. Over time, TrekMovie.com garnered a reputation for scooping ''Star Trek'' news and has been cited as a source by websites like [[Slashdot]], [[Fark]], SciFiWire, [[Yahoo! Movies]] and others. Pascale and his site have also been cited on the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]], various local TV stations and in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.trekmovie.com/about|work=TrekMovie.com|publisher=SciFanatic Network|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TrekMovie.com continued to grow as a range of editors and contributors—respected experts covering different areas of the ''Star Trek'' franchise—were brought on. The site was the highest ranked ''Star Trek'' news site in 2008.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

== Rumored demise and controversy ==

Beginning around May 2013, the site often went weeks or months with no updates. When updates resumed, no explanation was given.  After the release of 2013's ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', the site posted an article about the film's second week of release, and then went for several weeks without any new updates. For a significant period of time Anthony Pascale did not post or write anything for the site.

In September of that same year, the site was a source of controversy following the release of ''Into Darkness''. Guest writer Joseph Dickerson's op-ed "Is ''Star Trek'' Broken?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial: Star Trek is broken - Here are ideas on how to fix it|url=http://trekmovie.com/2013/09/01/star-trek-is-broken-here-are-ideas-on-how-to-fix-it/|first=Joseph|last=Dickerson|work=TrekMovie.com|publisher=SciFanatic Network|date=1 September 2013|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; opined that ''Into Darkness'' had moved too far from the themes that made ''Star Trek'' relevant and popular. The op-ed generated thousands of comments, including harsh reaction by the co-writer of the film [[Roberto Orci]]. Orci's comments—which criticized fans' negative reactions, dismissed the op-ed, and ultimately suggested that detractors "fuck off"—were covered by multiple news sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Orci fires back at Star Trek Into Darkness haters: "F*ck off!"|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/roberto-orci-fires-back-at-star-trek-into-darkness-haters-fck-off/|first=Angie|last=Han|work=[[/Film]]|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Orci blows up at Star Trek fan for not adoring Into Darkness|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/bob-orci-blows-up-at-star-trek-fans-for-not-adoring-into-darkness|first=Emily|last=Asher-Perrin|work=[[Tor.com]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Trek writer responds to slams, tells sequel critics to #@&amp;! off|url=http://www.blastr.com/2013-9-6/star-trek-writer-responds-slams-tells-sequel-critics|first=Nathalie|last=Caron|work=[[Blastr]]|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orci later apologized and briefly stopped commenting on TrekMovie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roberto Orci says he's sorry for telling Star Trek fans to #@&amp;! off|url=http://www.blastr.com/2013-9-9/roberto-orci-says-hes-sorry-telling-star-trek-fans|first=Nathalie|last=Caron|work=[[Blastr]]|date=9 September 2013|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Pascale has since returned to regularly posting articles.

'''[[Uranium]] poisoning in Punjab''' first made news in March 2009, when a South African Board Certified Candidate Clinical Metal Toxicologist, Carin Smit, visiting [[Faridkot, Punjab|Faridkot]] city in [[Punjab, India]], instrumental in having hair and urine samples taken (2008/09) of 149/53 children respectively, who were affected with [[congenital disorder|birth abnormalities]] including physical deformities, neurological and mental disorders. These samples were shipped to Microtrace Mineral Lab, Germany.

At the onset of the action research project, it was expected that [[Heavy metal (chemistry)#Relationship to living organisms|heavy metal toxicity]] might be implicated as reasons why these children were so badly affected.  Surprisingly, high levels of uranium were found in 88% of the samples, and in the case of one child, the levels were more than 60 times the maximum safe limit.&lt;ref name="fa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-02/chandigarh/28017011_1_baba-farid-centre-german-laboratory-uranium|title=Uranium deforms kids in Faridkot|date=2 Apr 2009|work=The Times of India|first1=Priya|last1=Yadav}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7979022.stm|title=Punjab disability 'uranium link'|date=2 April 2009|publisher=BBC News|first=Asit|last=Jolly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study, carried out amongst mentally retarded children in the [[Malwa (Punjab)|Malwa]] region of Punjab, revealed 87% of children below 12 years and 82% beyond that age having uranium levels high enough to cause diseases, also uranium levels in samples of three kids from [[Kotkapura]] and Faridkot were 62, 44 and 27 times higher than normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-14/chandigarh/28284808_1_uranium-traces-baba-farid-centre-special-kids|title=Uranium levels 62 times higher than normal|date=14 Jun 2010 | work=The Times Of India|first1=Balwant|last1=Garg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-15/india/28290766_1_germany-s-microtrace-mineral-lab-malwa-region-uranium-in-hair-samples|title='Anti-pollution laws only on paper in Punjab'|date=15 Jun 2010|work=The Times of India|first1=Balwant|last1=Garg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Baba Farid Centre for Special Children, Faridkot, sent samples of five children from the worst-affected village, Teja Rohela, near [[Fazilka]], which has over 100 children which are congenitally mentally and physically challenged, to the same lab.&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-16/india/28290773_1_neurologically-disabled-children-uranium-content-baba-farid-centre|title=Parts of Raj, Malwa drinking poison?|date=16 Jun 2010|work=The Times of India|first1=IP|last1=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Micro Trace Minerals of Germany has continued testing cancer patients, living in the Malwa Region of Punjab, the area known for having the highest cancer rate in India. Patient evaluation and the collection of nail samples was carried out with the help of Prof. Chander Parkash of the Technical University of Punjab. As with previous studies, high uranium was found in nearly all test persons. The work was published in the British Journal of Medicine and Medical Research in 2015.

==History==

As early as 1995, [[Guru Nanak Dev University]] (GNDU) released a report, showing the presence of uranium and other heavy metals beyond permissible limits in water samples collected from Bathinda and [[Amritsar district]], however there was no response from the government at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-18/india/28302272_1_gndu-guru-nanak-dev-university-uranium|title='  Action on this 1995 study could have played a huge role in preventing the indiscriminate poisoning of Punjab children. |date=18 Jun 2010|work=The Times of India|first1=Yudhvir|last1=Rana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotspot for this increased toxicity, however was the Malwa region of Punjab, which showed extremely high levels of chemical, biological and radioactive toxicity, including uranium contamination. As the region's groundwater and food chain was gradually contaminated by industrial effluents flowing into fresh water sources used both for irrigation and drinking purposes, the region showed a rise in neurological diseases, and a sharp increase in cancer cases and kidney ailments, for example in [[Muktsar district]] between 2001 and 2009, 1,074 people died of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-17/edit-page/28279322_1_industrial-waste-industrial-growth-toxic-hotspot|title=Toxic Troubles|date=17 Jun 2010|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, a case of slow poisoning was suspected by health workers of the Baba Farid Center For Special Children (BFCSC) in [[Bathinda]] and [[Faridkot, Punjab|Faridkot]], when they saw a sharp increase in the number of severely handicapped children, birth defects like [[hydrocephaly]], [[microcephaly]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[Down's syndrome]] and other physical and mental abnormalities, and cancers in children.&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;

In March 2008, Dr Carin Smit, a Candidate Clinical Metal toxicologist, in private practice in South Africa, and Vera Dirr, a teacher of children with cerebral palsy, alarmed after seen a high incidences of abnormalities in local children at the Baba Farid Center For Special Children (BFCSC) in Faridkot, a not-for-profit organization working with kids, ailing from [[autism]], [[cerebral palsy]] and other [[neurological disorder]]s requested help for laboratory tests from Microtarce Mineral Lab, [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="fa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nd"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/children_of_uranium_poisoning.php|title=Children of uranium poisoning?|date=6 September 2009|publisher=NDTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre reported a rise in the number of cases in the last six to seven years. The BFCSC uses [[naturopathic principles]] to treat is patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babafaridcenterforspecialchildren.com/treatments.php |title=Treatment |publisher=Baba Farid Center For Special Children (BFCSC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent tests, carried out on the [[ground water]] displayed levels of uranium as high as 224 micrograms per litre (µg/l).  However, samples taken in the vicinity of the around the coal-fired power plants were up to 15 times above the [[World Health Organization]]'s maximum safe limits.  It was found that the contamination included a large parts of the state of Punjab, home to 24 million people.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/30/india-punjab-children-uranium-pollution|title=India's generation of children crippled by uranium waste|date=30 August 2009|work=The Telegraph | location=London | first=Gethin | last=Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, water samples taken from [[Buddha Nullah]], a highly polluted water canal, which merges into the [[Sutlej River]], showed heavy metal content as quite high and the presence of uranium 1½ times the reference range.,&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Parts-of-Raj-Malwa-drinking-poison/articleshow/6052988.cms|title=Parts of Raj, Malwa drinking poison?|date=16 Jun 2010 | work=The Times Of India|first1=IP|last1=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together with other forms of pollution, like ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and [[chlorpyrifos]] pesticides, the rivulet, is now being termed as "Other [[Bhopal tragedy|Bhopal]]" in the making.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/50yrs/environ1.htm Ludhiana heading for a Bhopal-like tragedy Punjab rivers are now heavily polluted] by A.

==Causes==

An investigation carried out ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, in 2009, revealed the possible that cause of contamination of soil and ground water in [[Malwa (Punjab)|Malwa]] region of Punjab, to be the [[fly ash]] from coal burnt at [[thermal power]] plants, which contains high levels of [[uranium]] and [[Bottom ash|ash]] as the region has state's two biggest coal-fired power stations.&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;

Tests on ground water carried out by Dr Chander Parkash, a wetland ecologist and Dr Surinder Singh, also at [[Guru Nanak Dev University]], Amritsar, found the highest average concentration of uranium 56.95&amp;nbsp;µg/l, in the town of [[Bhucho Mandi]] in [[Bathinda district]], a short distance from the [[ash pond]] of Lehra Mohabat thermal power plant. At village Jai Singh Wala, close to the Batinda ash pond, similar test results showed an average level of 52.79&amp;nbsp;µg/l.&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;

In the last years, more and more researchers came to the conclusion that geological causes are the main source of the uranium contamination in Punjab, as it is long known that in the underlying Siwalik sediments uranium enrichments occur (Phadke et al. 1985, Singh et al. 2009, Patnaik et al. 2015, Raju et al. 2015).

== Response ==

News of these findings sparked a controversy in the media, as the [[Government of Punjab (India)|Government of Punjab]] in April 2009, ordered a probe into the matter, and a series of tests with the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]], [[Trombay]] were conducted.  It was later stated, "..there is no side {{sic|affect}} of uranium and they have studied in the hair parts and the levels are very much below the levels. So that can't cause any mental retardation or any abnormality, " ...The government attributed the abnormalities to genetic disorders.&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt; The local media, however blamed the government for the absence of proper norms to monitor the environmental impact of ash ponds, and lack of proper study of the prevalent uranium contamination in the region.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090827/punjab.htm#6|title=Govt shuts eyes to fly ash hazards|date=27 August 2009|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of toxicity==

In 2009, under a [[Greenpeace]] Research Laboratories investigation, Dr Reyes Tirado, from the [[University of Exeter]], UK,  conducted a study in 50 villages in [[Muktsar]], [[Bathinda]] and [[Ludhiana district]]s, revealed chemical, radiation and biological toxicity rampant in Punjab.  20% of the sampled wells showed nitrate levels above the safety limit of 50&amp;nbsp;mg/l, established by WHO, the study connected it with high use of synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-15/india/28322067_1_nitrate-hair-samples-punjab-s-malwa|title=Uranium, metals make Punjab toxic hotspot|newspaper=The Times of India|date=15 Jun 2010|first1=Balwant|last1=Garg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing poisoning of the soil, the region once hailed as the home to the [[Green Revolution in India|Green revolution]], now due to excessive use of chemical fertilizer, is being termed the "Other [[Bhopal tragedy|Bhopal]]", and "even credit-takers of the Revolution have begun to admit they had been wrong, now that they see wastelands and lives lost to farmer suicides in this 'granary of India'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/06/09212410/LAWS-TO-TACKLE-OTHER-8216BH.html?atype=tp|title=Laws To Tackle Other ‘Bhopals’|date=10 June 2010|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
