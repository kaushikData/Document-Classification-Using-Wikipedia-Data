'''Alexander Matveyevich Matrosov''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Матве́евич Матро́сов}}, {{lang-ba|Шәкирйән Юныс улы Мөхәмәтйәнов}}, {{lang-uk|Олександр Матвійович Матросов}}; February 5, 1924 &amp;ndash; February 22 or 27, 1943), born in Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]]) was a Soviet infantry soldier during the Second World War, awarded the title of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] for blocking a German machine-gun with his body according soviet propaganda.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=597|title=Матросов Александр Матвеевич|last=|first=|date=|website=www.warheroes.ru|language=ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acts of bravery==
Matrosov was a private in the 2nd Separate Rifle Battalion of the 91st Independent Siberian Volunteer Brigade, later renamed and the 254th Rifle Regiment and reorganized within the 56th Guard Rifle Division of the Soviet Army. He was armed with a light machine-gun.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Calendar 1917-1947, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 1943, in the battle to recapture village of Chernushki, near [[Velikiye Luki]], currently in [[Loknyansky District]], [[Pskov Oblast]], the Soviet forces struggled to take a German heavy machine-gun, housed within a concrete pillbox, which blocked the route to the village. It had already claimed the lives of many of the Russian troops. Matrosov crept up to the pillbox and released a burst of rounds into the slot in the pillbox. One round hit a mine inside, and the machine-gun temporarily fell silent. It restarted a few minutes later. At this point Matrosov physically pulled himself up and jammed his body into the slot, wholly blocking the fire at his comrades but clearly at the cost of his own life. This allowed his unit to advance and capture the pillbox and thereafter retake the village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For his self-sacrifice in battle, Matrosov was posthumously awarded the distinction [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=597 Biography] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin officially renamed his regiment the Matrosov Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Calendar 1917-1947, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar cases===
According to Beijing People's Daily, Matrosov's tale also inspired [[Huang Jiguang]], a famous Chinese [[revolutionary martyr]], to perform a similar feat during the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation| url = http://www.people.com.cn/GB/channel1/10/20001010/265533.html| title = Matrosov Style Hero, Hung Jiguang (马特洛索夫式的英雄黄继光) | date = 1952-12-21 | accessdate = 2012-11-26 | publisher = [[People's Daily]] | location = [[Beijing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Matrosov is the main character of the 1947 [[war film]], ''[[Private Aleksandr Matrosov|Private Alexander Matrosov]]'' (''Рядовой Александр Матросов''), directed by [[Leonid Lukov]].

{{Quran}}
Alexander the Great, according to some historians and scholars, appears in the Quran as [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] ذو القرنين) literally ''"The Two-Horned One"''.

Dhul-Qarnayn was a well-known figure in the [[folklore|lore]] of the [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] dwellers of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The majority of traditional and modern scholars have generally endorsed the identification of Dhul-Qarnayn with Alexander the Great, but some early Muslim scholars saw it as a reference to a pre-Islamic monarch from [[Persia]] or [[south Arabia]].&lt;ref name="EQ"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 1st| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 1| pages = 61–62| last = Renard| first = John| title = Alexander | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]| year = 2001 |isbn = 9004114653}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been a matter of theological controversy amongst Muslim scholars since early times. In more recent times, some Muslim scholars have suggested other alternatives, for example that [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] may be [[Cyrus the Great in the Quran|Cyrus the Great]] instead of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name="motaghin"&gt;[http://www.motaghin.com/ar_Bookspage_4922.aspx?&amp;gid=50#_Toc96691198 Ma'arefat Al-Maad – Ma'ad Shanasi], ''[[موقع المتقين]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many different [[cultural depictions of Alexander the Great]] since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Similarities between the Quran and the ''[[Alexander romance]]'' were also identified in recent research based on the translation of certain [[medieval]] [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts.

==Historical background on religious Alexander legends==
[[File:Alexandria serbskaya.jpg|thumb|200px|17th-century manuscript of an Alexandrine novel (Russia): Alexander exploring the depths of the sea]]
There have been many different [[cultural depictions of Alexander the Great]] since [[ancient history|antiquity]], including references in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in [[1 Maccabees]] and the [[Book of Daniel]]. Alexander the Great was an immensely popular figure in the [[Classical antiquity|classical]] and post-classical cultures of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East]]. Almost immediately after his death in 323 BC a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life which, over the centuries, became increasingly fantastic as well as allegorical. Collectively this tradition is called the ''Alexander romance'' and some [[recension]]s feature such vivid episodes as Alexander ascending through the air to [[Paradise]], journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass bubble, and journeying through the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth).

The earliest [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of the ''Alexander romance'', as they have survived, indicate that it was composed at [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century. The original text was lost but was the source of some eighty different versions written in twenty-four different languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGinn1998|McGinn 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As the ''Alexander romance'' persisted in popularity over the centuries, it was assumed by various neighboring people. Of particular significance was its incorporation into Jewish and later Christian legendary traditions. In the Jewish tradition Alexander was initially a figure of [[satire]], representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual truths. Yet their belief in a just, all-powerful God forced Jewish interpreters of the Alexander tradition to come to terms with Alexander's undeniable temporal success. Why would a just, all-powerful God show such favor to an unrighteous ruler? This [[Problem of evil|theological need]], plus acculturation to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], led to a more positive Jewish interpretation of the Alexander legacy. In its most neutral form this was typified by having Alexander show deference to either the Jewish people or the symbols of their faith. In having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the Jews' religious, intellectual, or ethical traditions, the prestige of Alexander was harnessed to the cause of Jewish [[ethnocentrism]]. Eventually Jewish writers would almost completely co-opt Alexander, depicting him as a [[Righteous among the Nations|righteous gentile]] or even a believing monotheist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jewish Encyclopedia|Broydé 1906]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christianized peoples of the [[Near East]], inheritors of both the Hellenic as well as Judaic strands of the ''Alexander romance'', further theologized Alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a [[saint]]. The Christian legends turned the ancient Greek conqueror Alexander III into Alexander ''"the Believing King"'', implying that he was a believer in monotheism. Eventually elements of the ''Alexander romance'' were combined with [[Biblical]] legends such as [[Gog and Magog]].

During the period of history during which the ''Alexander romance'' was written, little was known about the true [[historical Alexander the Great]] as most of the history of his conquests had been preserved in the form of folklore and legends. It was not until the [[Renaissance]] (1300–1600 AD) that the true history of Alexander III was rediscovered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC there has been no age in history, whether in the West or in the East, in which his name and exploits have not been familiar. And yet not only have all contemporary records been lost but even the work based on those records though written some four and a half centuries after his death, the ''[[Anabasis Alexandri|Anabasis]]'' of [[Arrian]], was totally unknown to the writers of the Middle Ages and became available to Western scholarship only with the Revival of Learning [the Renaissance].  The perpetuation of Alexander's fame through so many ages and amongst so many peoples is due in the main to the innumerable recensions and transmogrifications of a work known as the ''Alexander Romance'' or ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''.&lt;ref name="Boyle 1974"&gt;[[#Boyle1974|Boyle 1974]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dating and origins of the Alexander legends===
[[File:Syriac Sertâ book script.jpg|thumb|250px|An 11th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[manuscript]]. The Syriac language is a dialect of [[Middle Aramaic]] that was once spoken across much of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Classical Syriac  became a major literary language throughout the [[Middle East]] from the 4th to the 8th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beyer|first=Klaus|title=The Aramaic Language: its distribution and subdivisions|author2=John F. Healey (trans.)|year=1986|location=Göttingen|publisher=Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht|page=44|isbn=3-525-53573-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[classical language]] of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], preserved in a large body of [[Syriac literature]]. Syriac  became the vehicle of [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity]] and culture, spreading throughout [[Asia]]. Before [[Arabic]] became the dominant language, Syriac was a major language among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian communities of the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Several Syriac manuscripts of the ''[[Alexander romance]]'' exist, dating from the 7th century. The [[:Category:Greek–Syriac translators|Greek–Syriac translators]] are generally credited with introducing the works of the ancient Greeks to pre-[[Islamic]] [[Arabia]].]]
The legendary Alexander material originated as early as the time of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305 BC to 30 BC)  and its unknown authors are sometimes referred to as the ''[[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]'' (not to be confused with [[Callisthenes of Olynthus]], who was Alexander's official historian). The earliest surviving manuscript of the ''Alexander romance'', called the α ([[alpha]]) [[recension]], can be dated to the 3rd century AD and was written in [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Alexandria]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been many theories regarding the date and sources of this curious work [the ''Alexander romance'']. According to the most recent authority, ... it was compiled by a Greco-Egyptian writing in Alexandria about A.D. 300. The sources on which the anonymous author drew were twofold. On the one hand he made use of a `romanticized history of Alexander of a highly rhetorical type depending on the [[Cleitarchus]] tradition, and with this he amalgamated a collection of imaginary letters derived from an ''Epistolary Romance of Alexander'' written in the first century B.C. He also included two long letters from Alexander to his mother [[Olympias]] and his tutor [[Aristotle]]  describing his marvellous adventures in India and at the end of the World. These are the literary expression of a living popular tradition and as such are the most remarkable and interesting part of the work.&lt;ref name=Brock1970/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Greek language|Greek]] variants of the ''Alexander romance'' continued to evolve until, in the 4th century, the Greek legend was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius]] (where it is called the ''[[Res gestae Alexandri Magni]]'') and from Latin it spread to all major [[vernacular]] languages of [[Europe]] in the Middle Ages. Around the same as its translation into Latin, the Greek text was also translated into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] language and from Syriac it spread to eastern cultures and languages as far afield as China and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;HANAWAY, WILLIAM L.

Encyclopædia Iranica.&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriac legend was the source of an [[Arabic]] variant called the ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'')&lt;ref name=Zuwiyya2001&gt;[[#Zuwiyya2001|Zuwiyya 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Persian language|Persian]] variant  called the ''[[Iskandarnamah]]'' (''Book of Alexander''), as well as [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Ethiopic]] translations.&lt;ref name=Zuwiyya2009&gt;[[#Zuwiyya2009|Zuwiyya 2009]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The version recorded in Syriac is of particular importance because it was current in the [[Middle East]] during the time of the Quran's writing and is regarded as being closely related to the [[literary]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Quran. The Syriac legend, as it has survived, consists of five distinct manuscripts, including a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] religious legend concerning Alexander and a sermon about Alexander attributed to the Syriac poet-theologian [[Jacob of Serugh]] (451–521 AD, also called Mar Jacob). The Syriac Christian legend concentrates on Alexander's journey to the end of the World, where he constructs the ''[[Gates of Alexander]]'' to enclose the evil nations of ''[[Gog and Magog]]'', while the sermon describes his journey to the ''[[Land of Darkness]]'' to discover the ''[[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]'' (Fountain of Youth). These legends concerning Alexander are remarkably similar to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn found in the Quran.&lt;ref name=stoneman2003&gt;[[#Stoneman2003|Stoneman 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the five Syriac manuscripts, dated to the 18th century, has a version of the Syriac legend that has been  generally dated to between 629 AD and 636 AD. There is evidence in the legend of  "''[[ex eventu]]'' knowledge of the [[Khazar]] invasion of [[Armenia]] in A.D. 629,"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Czegledy1954|Czeglédy 1954]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Czegledy1957|Czeglédy 1957]].&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the legend must have been burdened with additions by a [[redaction|redactor]] sometime around 629 AD.  The legend   appears to have been composed as [[propaganda]] in support of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575–641 AD) shortly after he defeated the Persians in the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628]]. It is notable that this manuscript fails to mention the Islamic conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 636 AD by [[Muhammad]]'s (570–632 AD) successor, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] (590–644 AD). This fact means that the legend might have been recorded before the "cataclysmic event"`that was the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] and the resulting [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|surrender of Jerusalem]] in November 636 AD. That the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars]] would have been referenced in the legend, had it been written after 636 AD, is supported by the fact that in 692 AD a Syriac Christian adaption of the ''Alexander romance'' called the ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' was indeed written as a response to the Muslim invasions and was [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to [[Methodius of Olympus|St Methodius]] (?–311 AD); this ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' equated the evil nations of ''Gog and Magog'' with the Muslim invaders and shaped the [[eschatology|eschatological]] imagination of [[Christendom]] for centuries.&lt;ref name=stoneman2003/&gt;

The manuscripts also contain evidence of lost texts. For example, there is some evidence of a lost pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] version of the translation that is thought to have been an intermediary between the Syriac Christian and the [[Ethiopic]] Christian translations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Doufikar2003|Doufikar-Aerts 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the Syriac translation was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) intermediary.&lt;ref name=Brock1970&gt;[[#Brock1970|Brock 1970]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theological controversy ===
The identity of Dhul-Qarnayn has been a matter of [[theological]] controversy amongst Muslim scholars for centuries. Dhul-Qarnayn was equated with Alexander by the majority of classical Islamic scholars during a period when Christians and [[Jews]] had themselves co-opted Alexander the Great as a religious figure. However, it is clear that the [[historical Alexander the Great]] was a Greek [[pagan]] (for example, Alexander's mother [[Olympias]] is said to have been a devout member of the [[orgy|orgiastic]] snake-worshiping [[Greek mythology|cult]] of [[Dionysus]], and may have slept with snakes&lt;ref&gt;"The nonsense about the snakes" is from [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Alexander'' (2.6), according to Robin Lane Lox, ''Alexander the Great'' 1973:26 and note p. 504; Fox suggests that the snake-handling was the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stuprum|stuprum]]'' referred to by Justin9.5.9.&lt;/ref&gt;). Such historical facts about Alexander the Great became well known only after the [[Renaissance]] period (1300–1600 AD) when the ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' of [[Arrian]] (AD 86–160) was rediscovered. In light of the modern view of Alexander the Great, his identity as Dhul-Qarnayn has become a matter of great controversy for Muslims. In reaction, alternative theories about the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn have been advanced by some Muslim scholars. For example, it has been suggested that Dhul-Qarnayn could be [[Cyrus the Great]] (see [[Cyrus the Great in the Quran]]). The Muslim sentiment against Alexander is reflected in Islamic textbooks (e.g. "Some [Muslim Scholars] say it was Alexander the Great, who lived from 356 BCE to 323 BCE, but that is highly unlikely, given that Alexander was an idol-worshipper."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noorart.com/ Lesson 47, page 217, Paragraph 3 of the main lesson, sentence 2, in the published textbook: What Islam is all About, published by Noorart Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;), often with references to his [[polytheistic]] religious beliefs and (more recently) his [[personal relationships of Alexander the Great|personal relationships]].

==Dhul-Qarnayn in Islamic literature==

===Quran===
"[[Dhul-Qarnayn]]" (the "Two-Horned One" in English) is a person described in the [[Quran]], the sacred scripture believed by Muslims to have been revealed by [[God in Islam|Allah]] to [[Muhammad]]. The story of Dhul-Qarnayn appears in seventeen short verses of the Quran, specifically verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)|18:83–99]] of ''[[Sura]]h [[Al-Kahf]].'' Dhul-Qarnayn is mentioned in only one place in the Quran, unlike the more familiar stories that are repeated throughout the text (for example, [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] is mentioned in 93 verses in 15 different ''[[surahs]]'' of the Quran). The Quranic story describes a man called Dhul-Qarnayn (meaning "the Two-Horned"), who was already familiar to the inhabitants of the region, to whom Allah gave great power, and who traveled to a place, where he saw the sun setting in a murky sea. At this place, Dhul-Qarnayn [[Alexander's wall|builds a wall]] in order to enclose the nations of [[Gog and Magog]]. It is thought that Gog and Magog will breach Dhul-Qarnayn's wall before [[Islamic eschatology|Yaum al-Qiyāmah]] (the Day of Judgement) and will wreak havoc in the world (Islamic [[Armageddon]]):

===Sira===
[[File:Al-Idrisi's world map.JPG|thumb|180px|right|12th century map by the Muslim [[geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Al-Idrisi]] (south up). "Yajooj" and "Majooj" (Gog and Magog) appear in Arabic script on the bottom-left edge of the Eurasian landmass, enclosed within dark mountains, at a location corresponding roughly to Mongolia. This is a reference to the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Quran.]]

The earliest mention of Dhul-Qarnayn outside the Quran is found in the works of the earliest Muslim historian and [[Hagiography|hagiographer]], [[Ibn Ishaq]] (?–761 AD), which form the main corpus of the ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|Sira]]'' (religious biography) literature. Ibn Ishaq's Sira reports that the eighteenth chapter of the Quran (which includes the story of Dhul-Qarnayn) was revealed to Muhammad by [[God]] on account of some questions posed to [[Muhammad]] by the [[rabbis]]. The verse was revealed during the [[Muhammad in Mecca|Meccan period]] of Muhammad's life. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad's tribe, the powerful [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], were greatly concerned about their tribesman who had started claiming prophethood and wished to consult the [[Judaism|Jewish]] rabbis' superior knowledge of the scriptures and about the prophets of God. The two Quraysh men described their tribesman, Muhammad, to the Jewish scholars. The rabbis told the men to ask Muhammad three questions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They (the rabbis) said, 'Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask and if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story? For theirs is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who travelled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story? And ask him about the [[Ruh]] (soul or spirit) &amp;mdash;what is it? If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.'&lt;ref name=ibn_kathir_surah_al_kahaf&gt;[http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=18&amp;tid=29908 Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Kahf, Reason why this Surah was revealed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928012021/http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=18&amp;tid=29908 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The famous story in the Sira relates that when Muhammad was informed of the three questions from the Rabbis, he declared that he would have the answers in the morning. However, Muhammad did not give the answer in the morning. For fifteen days, Muhammad did not answer the question. Doubt in Muhammad began to grow amongst the people of [[Mecca]]. Then, after fifteen days, Muhammad received the revelation that is ''[[Sura]] [[Al-Kahf]]'' ("The Cave"), the eighteenth chapter of the Quran. ''Surah Al-Kahf'' mentions the "People of the Cave," a strange story about some young men in ancient times who slept in a cave for many years (which is identical to the Syriac Christian myth of the [[Seven Sleepers|Seven Sleepers Ephesus]]). Surah Al-Kahf also mentions the winds (related to the word for spirit, verse 45). Finally, the surah also mentions "a man who travelled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth"&amp;mdash;namely, Dhul-Qarnayn. Though Ibn Ishaq himself does not explicitly mention the name Alexander, he relates that a storyteller told him that Dhul-Qarnayn was a Greco-Egyptian (an accurate description of Alexander):

&lt;blockquote&gt;A man who used to purvey stories of the foreigners, which were handed down among them, told me that Dhul-Qarnayn was an Egyptian whose name was Marzuban bin Mardhaba, the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guillaume|Guillaume]] p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ibn Ishaq's original work is lost, but it has been almost completely incorporated in [[Ibn Hisham]] (?–833 AD), another early Muslim historian. Ibn Hisham collected Ibn Ishaq's Sira and added his notes to it; in regards to Dhul-Qarnayn, Ibn Hisham noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dhu al-Qarnain is Alexander the Greek, the king of Persia and Greece, or the king of the east and the west, for because of this he was called Dhul-Qarnayn [meaning, 'the two-horned one']...{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theme, amongst Islamic scholars, of identifying Dhul-Qarnayn with Alexander the Great appears to have originated here. Why Ibn Hisham made this identification is not entirely clear.

===Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry===

[[Ibn Ishaq]] recorded many pre-Islamic Arabic poems in the [[Sirah Rasul Allah|Sira]], including a poem about Dhul-Qarnayn that he claims was composed by a pre-Islamic king of ancient [[Yemen]] named [[Tub'a Abu Kariba As'ad]] (Tub'a is commonly cited as the first of several kings of Arabia to convert to Judaism):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dhu’l-Qarnayn before me was a Muslim
&lt;br&gt;Conquered kings thronged his court,
&lt;br&gt;East and west he ruled, yet he sought
&lt;br&gt;Knowledge true from a learned sage.
&lt;br&gt;He saw where the sun sinks from view
&lt;br&gt;In a pool of mud and fetid slime
&lt;br&gt;Before him [[Bilqis]] [Queen of Sheba] my father's sister
&lt;br&gt;Ruled them until the [[Islamic view of the Queen of Sheba|hoopoe]] came to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guillaume|Guillaume]] p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem's reference to "a learned sage" from whom Dhul-Qarnayn sought knowledge from may be a reference to the story of [[Alexander the Great in the Quran#Al-Khidir|Dhul-Qarnayn and Al-Khidir]]. Other pre-Islamic Arab poems about Dhul-Qarnayn are also reported in the Sira literature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The pre-Islamic poet Al-`Asha and the contemporary of Muhammad [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] (?-674 AD) both composed verses referring to the conquest of Gog and Magog and furthest east by Dhu`l-qarnain.&lt;ref name=stoneman2003/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One poem by [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ours the realm of Dhu 'l-Qarnayn the glorious
&lt;br&gt;Realm like his was never won by mortal king.
&lt;br&gt;Followed he the Sun to view its setting
&lt;br&gt;When it sank into the somber ocean-spring;
&lt;br&gt;Up he clomb to see it rise at morning,
&lt;br&gt;From within its Mansions when the East it fired;
&lt;br&gt;All day long the horizons led him onward,
&lt;br&gt;All night through he watched the stars and never tired.
&lt;br&gt;Then of iron and of liquid metal
&lt;br&gt;He prepared a rampart not to be o'erpassed,
&lt;br&gt;Gog and Magog there he threw in prison
&lt;br&gt;Till on Judgement Day they shall awake at last&lt;ref&gt;Hāssan b. Thābit cited in R. A. Nicholson (transl.), ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', p. 18, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1962.
For the Arabic text on which the translation is based, see Von Kremer, Alfred, ''Altarabische Gedichte ueber die Volkssage von Jemen, als Textbelege zur Abhandlung “Ueber die südarabische Sage.”'', p.15 (No. viii,1.6 sqq), 1867. Both can be read online as Google books previews.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Tafsir ===
Alexander is mentioned in the ''[[tafsir]]'', the [[exegesis]] or commentaries of the Quran that were written by prominent early Islamic scholars. Significantly, Alexander the Great is mentioned in [[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]], a well-known [[Sunni]] ''tafsir'' of the Quran from the 15th century. The ''tafsir'' notes that Dhul-Qarnayn's name was Alexander and also indicates that Dhul-Qarnayn was ''not'' a prophet:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And they, the Jews, question you concerning Dhū’l-Qarnayn, ''whose name was Alexander''; he was not a prophet. Say: ‘I shall recite, relate, to you a mention, an account, of him’, of his affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commentators of the Quran debated on whether or not Dhul-Qarnayn was a [[prophet of Islam]]; some concluded that he was not a prophet but was a holy man or a "friend of God" since he is mentioned favorably in the Quran. In Islam it is ambiguous as to whether or not Dhul-Qarnayn is a full-fledged prophet.

[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (1149-1209 AD), in ''[[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]]'' also comments that Dhul-Qarnayn is Alexander the Macedonian. He provides a vague  justification, saying that the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Quran traveled to the east and the west achieving victories and so he must be Alexander:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While a survey in the history we do not find anybody other than Macedonian Alexander, ''therefore, the Dhul Qarnayn is the same Macedonian Alexander''.&lt;ref&gt;Razi, [[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Tafsir al-Kabir]], commenting on Q. 18:83–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other Islamic literature ===
[[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] Muslim philosophers, such as [[al-Kindi]] (801–873 AD), [[al-Farabi]] (872–950 AD), and [[Avicenna]] (980–1037 AD), enthusiastically embraced the concept of Dhul-Qarnayn being an [[ancient Greek]] king. They stylized Dhul-Qarnayn as a Greek [[philosopher king]]. [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263–1328 AD) objected to the identification on the basis that Alexander was a pagan idolater, and he accused the Aristotelian Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna of making the "mistaken" identification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Thus, the sages of the Persian [[Zoroastrians]] are all [[kafir]] [infidels], as well as the sages of Greece such as Aristotle and those like him. They were associationists, worshipping idols and the planets. Aristotle was before 'Isa (Jesus) by three hundred years, and was a minister for Alexander son of Phillip the Macedonian, who is mentioned in the histories of Rome and Greece, as well as the histories of the Christians and the Jews. He is not, however, the same as the man named ''Dhu-l-Qarnain'' who Allah mentioned in His book, as some imagined. Some people mistakenly thought that Aristotle was a minister for ''dhu-l-qarnain'', when they saw that (the one found in the Western histories) was named Alexander, and the names are similar, they thought that they were one and the same man. This mistaken view has been promulgated by Ibn Seena [Avicenna]  and some others with him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morgan|Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Egyptian historian [[Al-Maqrizi]] (1364–1442 AD) claimed in his book ''Al-Khotatt'' that Dhul-Qarnayn was a [[Yemen]]ite king named Sa'b and wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who claim that he [Dhul-Qarnayn] was Iranian, Roman, or that he was Alexander of Macedon, are wrong.{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mystic [[Ibn Arabi]] (d. 638⁄1240) allegorically interpreted the figure of Dhul-Qarnayn as the heart which controls the left and right sides of the body.&lt;ref name=EQ /&gt;

In recent times, [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] (1872–1953 AD) supported the notion of Dhul-Qarnayn being Alexander the Great and he indicated an extensive knowledge of the legends concerning Alexander:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another suggestion was made that, Quranic Zul-qarnain was an ancient king of Persia. A king of Persia is referred to as a Ram with two horns in the Book of Daniel (viii. 3) in the Old Testament. But in the same Book, the Ram with the two horns was smitten, cast down to the ground, and stamped upon by a he-goat with one horn (8:7–8). But there is nothing in our literature to suggest that Zul-qarnain came to any such ignominious end. ... If it is argued that it was some old prehistoric Persian king who built the Iron Gates (18:96) to keep out the Gog and Magog tribes (18:94), this is no identification at all. ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Another suggestion made is that it was some old prehistoric [[Himyarite]] king from [[Yemen]], about whom nothing else is known. This, again, is no identification at all. ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Personally, I have not the least doubt that Zul-Qarnain is meant to be Alexander the Great, the historic Alexander, and not the legendary Alexander...&lt;ref name=yusuf_ali&gt;The Holy Quran, Translation and Commentary by Yusuf Ali, Appendix 7, page 763 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his commentary of the Quran, [[Abul Ala Maududi]] (1903–1979 AD) noted that historically most Muslim scholars had endorsed the identification of Dhul-Qarnayn with Alexander the Great, but recent commentators have forwarded an alternative theory that Dhul-Qarnayn is [[Cyrus the Great]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of Zul-Qarnain has been a controversial matter from the earliest times. In general the commentators have been of the opinion that he was Alexander the Great but the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain described in the Quran are not applicable to him. However, now the commentators are inclined to believe that Zul-Qarnain was [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], an ancient king of [[Iran]]. We are also of the opinion that probably Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus, but the historical facts, which have come to light up to this time, are not sufficient to make any categorical assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philological evidence==
[[Philologists]], studying ancient Christian legends about Alexander the Great, have come to conclude that the Quran's stories about Dhul-Qarnayn closely parallel certain legends about Alexander the Great found in ancient Hellenistic and Christian writings. There is some [[numismatic]] evidence, in the form of ancient coins, to identify the Arabic epithet "Dhul-Qarnayn" with Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name=coin/&gt;  Finally, ancient Christian [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Ethiopic]] manuscripts of the ''Alexander romance'' from the [[Middle East]] have been found which closely resemble the story in the Quran. This leads to the theologically controversial conclusion that Quran refers to Alexander in the mention of Dhul-Qarnayn.

===The two-horned one===
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|Silver [[Drachma|tetradrachmon]] ([[ancient Greek]] coin) issued in the name of [[Alexander the Great]], depicting Alexander with the horns of [[Ammon-Ra]] (242/241 BC, posthumous issue). Displayed at the [[British Museum]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The literal translation of the Arabic phrase ''"Dhul-Qarnayn,"'' as written in the Quran, is "the Two-Horned." Alexander the Great was portrayed with two horns in ancient Greek depictions of Alexander:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well known that already in his own time Alexander was portrayed with horns according to the [[iconography]] of the Egyptian god [[Amun|Ammon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Griffith2008|Griffith 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Ammon-Ra]] was depicted with [[Sheep|ram]] horns. Rams were considered a symbol of [[virility]] due to their [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior. The horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of [[Amun|Ammon]] was "the two-horned." Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of [[ancient Egypt]] in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with [[Zeus]], the [[King of the Gods]]. The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle]] of Ammon at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.&lt;ref name=coin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plutarch&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the [[Sparta]]n decree read, '' 'Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.' ''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Alexander III, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ancient Greek coinage|Ancient Greek coins]], such as the coins minted by Alexander's successor [[Lysimachus]] (360–281 BC), depict the ruler with the distinctive horns of [[Ammon]] on his head. [[Archaeologists]] have found a large number of different types of ancients coins depicting Alexander the Great with two horns.&lt;ref name=coin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rg.ancients.info/alexander/ Alexander the Great coins gallaery]&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th century BC silver ''[[Drachma|tetradrachmon]]'' ("four ''[[drachma]]''") coin, depicting a [[Imperial cult|deified]] Alexander with two horns, replaced the 5th century BC [[Athens|Athenian]] silver ''tetradrachmon'' (which depicted the goddess [[Athena]]) as the most widely used coin in the Greek world. After Alexander's conquests, the ''drachma'' was used in many of the [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms in the [[Middle East]], including the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] kingdom in [[Alexandria]]. The [[Arabia|Arabic]] unit of currency known as the ''[[dirham]]'', known from pre-Islamic times up to the present day, inherited its name from the ''drachma''. In the late 2nd century BC, silver coins depicting Alexander with [[Sheep|ram]] horns were used as a principal coinage in [[Arabia]] and were issued by an [[Arab]] ruler by the name of Abi'el who ruled in the south-eastern region of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040603181636/http://www.culture.gr/nm/presveis/Pages/museum/13/p1302.html#Anchor1  ''The Impact of Alexander the Great’s Coinage in East Arabia''], Hellenic Ministry of Culture, description of the exhibit "Presveis," displayed at the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] archeologist B.M. Mozolevskii discovered an ancient [[Scythians|Scythian]] [[kurgan]] (burial mound) containing many treasures. The burial site was constructed in the 4th century BC near the city of [[Pokrov, Ukraine|Pokrov]] and is given the name ''[[Tovsta Mohyla]]'' (another name is ''Babyna Mogila''). Amongst the artifacts excavated at this site were four silver gilded [[phalera (military decoration)|phalera]] (ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military medals). Two of the four medals are identical and depict the head of a bearded man with two horns, while the other two medals are also identical and depict the head of a clean-shaven man with two horns. According to a recent theory, the bearded figure with horns is actually Zeus-Ammon and the clean-shaved figure is none other than Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, Jeffrey H. (2005) [http Alexander the Great and Zeus Ammon: A New Interpretation of the Phalerae from Babyna Mogila]. Ancient West &amp; East. Volume 4, Number 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander has also been identified, since ancient times, with the horned figure in the [[Old Testament]] in the prophecy of [[Daniel 8]] who overthrows the kings of Media and Persia. In the prophecy, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] has a vision of a ram with two long horns and verse 20 explains that ''"The ram which thou sawest having two horns is the kings of [[Medes|Media]] and [[Persia]]."'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Josephus]] [37–100 AD], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' xi, 8, 5 tells of a visit that Alexander is purported to have made to [[Jerusalem]], where he met the high priest Jaddua and the assembled Jews, and was shown the book of Daniel in which it was prophesied that some one of the Greeks would overthrow the empire of Persia. Alexander believed himself to be the one indicated, and was pleased. The pertinent passage in Daniel would seem to be VIII. 3–8 which tells of the overthrow of the two-horned ram by the one-horned goat, the one horn of the goat being broken in the encounter ...The interpretation of this is given further ...  "The ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece." This identification is accepted by the church fathers ...&lt;ref name="Anderson 1927"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Christian [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version of the ''Alexander romance,'' in the sermon by [[Jacob of Serugh]], describes Alexander as having been given two horns of iron by God. The legend describes Alexander (as a Christian king) bowing himself in prayer, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O God ... I know in my mind that thou hast exalted me above all kings, and ''thou hast made me horns upon my head, wherewith I might thrust down the kingdoms of the world''...I will magnify thy name, O Lord, forever ... And if the Messiah, who is the Son of God [Jesus], comes in my days, I and my troops will worship Him...&lt;ref name="Anderson 1927"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Christian Alexander legends written in [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] (an ancient [[South Semitic]] language) between the 14th and the 16th century, Alexander the Great is always explicitly referred to using the [[epithet]] the "Two Horned." A passage from the Ethiopic Christian legend describes the [[Angel of the Lord]] calling Alexander by this name:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then God, may He be blessed and exalted! put it into the heart of the Angel to call ''Alexander 'Two-horned,' '' ... And Alexander said unto him, ' ''Thou didst call me by the name Two-horned,'' but my name is Alexander ... and I thought that thou hadst cursed me by calling me by this name.' The angel spake unto him, saying, 'O man, I did not curse thee by ''the name by which thou and the works that thou doest are known.'' Thou hast come unto me, and I praise thee because, from the east to the west, the whole earth hath been given unto thee ...'&lt;ref name="Anderson 1927"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

References to Alexander's supposed horns are found in literature ranging many different languages, regions and centuries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The horns of Alexander ... have had a varied symbolism. They represent him as a god, as a son of a god, as a prophet and propagandist of the Most High, as something approaching the role of a messiah, and also as the champion of Allah. They represent him as a world conqueror, who subjugated the two horns or ends of the world, the lands of the rising and of the setting sun ...&lt;ref name="Anderson 1927"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For these reasons, among others, the Quran's Arabic epithet "Dhul-Qarnayn," literally meaning "the two-horned one," is interpreted as a reference to Alexander the Great.

===Alexander's Wall===
[[File:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Iranian art|Persian]] painting from the 16th century illustrating the building of the wall with the help of the [[jinn]]]]
The Quran's story describes Dhul-Qarnayn building a great barrier in order to enclose the nations of [[Gog and Magog]] who "do great mischief in the earth." A similar story about Alexander is found in the ''Alexander romance'' and the origins of the story can be dated as far back as 329 BC.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Early accounts of Alexander's Wall====
The  building of gates in the [[Caucasus Mountains]] by Alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with Gog and Magog has ancient provenance and the wall is  known as the [[Gates of Alexander]] or the [[Caspian Gates]]. The name Caspian Gates originally applied to the narrow region at the southeast corner of the [[Caspian Sea]], through which Alexander actually marched in the pursuit of [[Bessus]] in 329 BC, although he did not stop to fortify it. It was transferred to the passes through the Caucasus, on the other side of the Caspian, by the more fanciful historians of Alexander. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] (37–100 AD) mentions that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a nation of the Alans, whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being [[Scythians]] ... travelled through a passage which King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wars of the Jews]]'', VII, vii, Flavius Josephus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Josephus also records that the people of Magog, the Magogites, were synonymous with the Scythians.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I, vi, Flavius Josephus&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andrew Runni Anderson,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson1932|Anderson 1932]].&lt;/ref&gt; this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the Quran's revelation, not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the Quranic account. Similarly, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] (347–420 AD), in his ''Letter 77'', mentions that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from [[Sea of Azov|Maeotis]] (they had their haunts between the icy [[Tanais]] and the rude [[Massagetae]], ''where the [[gates of Alexander]] keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus'').&lt;ref&gt;Letter 77 "To Oceanus", 8, Saint Jerome&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his Commentary on [[Ezekiel]] (38:2), Jerome identifies the nations located beyond the [[Caucasus mountains]] and near [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]] as Gog and Magog.  Thus the [[Gates of Alexander]] legend  was combined with the legend of [[Gog and Magog]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. It has been suggested that the incorporation of the Gog and Magog legend into the ''Alexander romance'' was prompted by the [[Hunnic Empire#Early campaigns|invasion of the Huns]] across the [[Caucasus]] mountains in 395 AD into [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gog and Magog : Ezekiel 38-39 as pre-text for Revelation 19,17 and 20,7–10'', Sverre Bøe, Mohr Siebec, 2001 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=vettpBoVOX4C&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=huns+caucasus+barrier+395&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OzcMrWCevB&amp;sig=YF72Rf6ypxYmGIySA3wsAbzftBc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eq_SSsG8C5PIlAex5_SoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=huns%20caucasus%20barrier%20395&amp;f=false see excerpt]) ({{ISBN|978-3-16-147520-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alexander's Wall in Christian legends====
{{Main|Gates of Alexander}}
Christian legends speak of the Caspian Gates (Gates of Alexander), also known as Alexander's wall, built by Alexander the Great in the [[Caucasus mountains]]. Several variations of the legend can be found. In the story, Alexander the Great built a gate of iron between two mountains, at the end of the [[flat Earth|Earth]], to prevent the armies of [[Gog and Magog]] from ravaging the plains. The Christian legend was written in [[Syria]] shortly before the Quran's writing and closely parallels the story of Dhul-Qarnayn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Southgate1978|Southgate 1978]].&lt;/ref&gt; The legend describes an [[apocryphal]] letter from Alexander to his mother, wherein he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I petitioned the exalted Deity, and he heard my prayer. And the exalted Deity commanded the two mountains and they moved and approached each other to a distance of twelve [[ell]]s, and there I made ... copper gates 12 ells broad, and 60 ells high, and smeared them over within and without with copper ... so that neither fire nor iron, nor any other means should be able to loosen the copper; ... Within these gates, I made another construction of stones ... And having done this I finished the construction by putting mixed tin and lead over the stones, and smearing .... over the whole, so that no one might be able to do anything against the gates. I called them the Caspian Gates. Twenty and two Kings did I shut up therein.&lt;ref name=budge1889/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These [[pseudepigraphic]] letters from Alexander to his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, describing his marvellous adventures at the end of the World, date back to the original Greek [[Alexander romance|recension α]] written in the 4th century in Alexandria. The letters are "the literary expression of a living popular tradition" that had been evolving for at least three centuries before the Quran was written.&lt;ref name="Boyle 1974"/&gt;

====Medieval accounts of Alexander's Wall====
[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The wall of the citadel in [[Derbent]], Russia. Built by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] kings, it was often identified with the "[[Gates of Alexander]]". The [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], as well as later Caliphs, sent expeditions to Derbent to seek out this wall.]]

Several historical figures, both Muslim and Christian, searched for Alexander's Gate and several different identifications were made with actual walls. During the [[Middle Ages]], the Gates of Alexander story was included in travel literature such as the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'' (1254–1324 AD) and the ''[[Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]''. The ''Alexander romance'' identified the Gates of Alexander, variously, with the [[Pass of Dariel]], the [[Derbent|Pass of Derbent]], the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]] and even the [[Great Wall of China]]. In the legend's original form, Alexander's Gates are located at the Pass of Dariel. In later versions of the Christian legends,  dated to around the time of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575–641 AD), the Gates are instead located in [[Derbent]], a city  situated on a narrow strip of land between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains, where an ancient [[Sassanid]] fortification was mistakenly identified with the wall built by Alexander. In the ''[[Travels of Marco Polo]]'', the wall in Derbent is identified with the Gates of Alexander. The [[Gates of Alexander]] are most commonly identified with the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]] whose thirty north-looking towers used to stretch for forty kilometers between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]], effectively blocking the passage across the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Bretschneider1876|Bretschneider 1876]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians would regard these legends as false:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gate itself had wandered from the Caspian Gates to the pass of Dariel, from the pass of Dariel to the pass of Derbend [Derbent], as well as to the far north; nay, it had travelled even as far as remote eastern or north-eastern Asia, gathering in strength and increasing in size as it went, and actually carrying the mountains of Caspia with it. Then, as the full light of modern day come on, the ''Alexander Romance'' ceased to be regarded as history, and with it Alexander's Gate passed into the realm of [[fairy]]land.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Andrew Runni |editor1-last= Anderson |title= Alexander's Gate, Gog and Magog, and the enclosed nations |date=January 1932  |publisher= [[Medieval Academy of America]] |location= [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0-910956-07-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Muslim world, several expeditions were undertaken to try to find and study Alexanders's wall, specifically the [[Caspian Gates of Derbent]]. An early expedition to  Derbent was ordered by the Caliph [[Umar]] (586–644 AD) himself, during the [[Arab conquest of Armenia]] where they heard about Alexander's Wall in Derbent from the conquered Christian Armenians. Umar's expedition was recorded by the renowned [[tafsir|exegetes of the Quran]], [[Al-Tabarani]] (873–970 AD) and [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1373 AD), and by the Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179–1229 AD):

&lt;blockquote&gt;... [[Umar]] sent ... in 22 A.H. [643 AD] ... an expedition to Derbent [Russia] ... `Abdur Rahman bin Rabi`ah [was appointed] as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered [[Eastern Armenia|Armenia]], the ruler Shehrbaz surrendered without fighting. Then when `Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbaz [ruler of Armenia] informed him that he had already gathered full information about the wall built by Dhul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the necessary details ...&lt;ref name="Tabari"&gt;[[Tafsir al-Tabari]], Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235–239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two hundred years later, the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Wathiq]] (?–847 AD) dispatched an expedition to study the wall of Dhul-Qarnain in Derbent, Russia. The expedition was led by [[Sallam-ul-Tarjuman]], whose observations were recorded by [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and by [[Ibn Kathir]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...this expedition reached ... the Caspian territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall [of Dhul-Qarnayn].&lt;ref name="al-Hamawi"&gt;Mu'jam-ul-Buldan, Yaqut al-Hamawi&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muslim geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] further confirmed the same view in a number of places in his book on geography; for instance under the heading "Khazar" (Caspian) he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This territory adjoins the Wall of Dhul-Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.&lt;ref name="al-Hamawi"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (763 – 809 AD) even spent some time living in Derbent.  Not all Muslim travelers and scholars, however, associated Dhul-Qarnayn's wall with the Caspian Gates of Derbent. For example, the Muslim explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304–1369 AD) traveled to China on order of the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] and he comments in his travel log that "Between it [the city of [[Quanzhou|Zaitun]] in [[Fujian]]] and the rampart of Yajuj and Majuj [Gog and Magog] is sixty days' travel."&lt;ref name="F. Beckingham p. 896"&gt;[[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|H. A. R. Gibb]] and C. F. Beckingham, trans. ''The Travels of Ibn Battuta, A.D. 1325–1354'' (Vol. IV). London: Hakluyt Society, 1994 ({{ISBN|0-904180-37-9}}), p. 896&lt;/ref&gt; The translator of the travel log notes that Ibn Battuta confused the Great Wall of China with that supposedly built by Dhul-Qarnayn.&lt;ref name="Gibb, p. 896, footnote #30"&gt;Gibb, p. 896, footnote #30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gog and Magog===
In the Quran, it is none other than the [[Gog and Magog]] people whom Dhul-Qarnayn has enclosed behind a wall, preventing them from invading the Earth. In Islamic [[eschatology]], before the Day of Judgement Gog and Magog will destroy this gate, allowing them to ravage the Earth, as it is described in the Quran:

:Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose [from their barrier], and they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise [Day of Resurrection] shall draw near [of fulfillment]. Then [when mankind is resurrected from their graves], you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror.  [They will say,] ‘Woe to us!  We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were wrongdoers.’ (Quran 21:96–97. Note that the phrases in square brackets are not in the Arabic original.)

====Gog and Magog in Christian legends====
[[File:Radkarte MKL1888.png|thumb|200px|Example of a [[T and O map|T-O map]] appearing in a German encyclopedia published by [[Joseph Meyer (publisher)|Joseph Meyer]] (1796-1856 AD). The T-O map was the first printed map in Europe. The map shows a disc shaped Earth surrounded by [[Oceanus]], with the location [[Gog and Magog]] to the north, and [[Paropamisadae]] mountains ([[Hindu Kush]]) to the east in Asia. In the Christian legends, Alexander built the wall against Gog and Magog in the north, near the Caspian sea, and then went to the ends of the earth at the Paropamisadae, where it was supposed that the sun rises.]]

In the Syriac Christian legends, Alexander the Great encloses the Gog and Magog horde behind a mighty gate between two mountains, preventing Gog and Magog from invading the Earth. In addition, it is written in the Christian legend that in the [[end time]]s God will cause the Gate of Gog and Magog to be destroyed, allowing the Gog and Magog horde to ravage the Earth;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Lord spake by the hand of the angel, [saying] ...The gate of the north shall be opened on the day of the end of the world, and on that day shall evil go forth on the wicked ... The earth shall quake and this door [gate] which thou [Alexander] hast made be opened ... and anger with fierce wrath shall rise up on mankind and the earth ... shall be laid waste ... And the nations that is within this gate shall be roused up, and also the host of Agog and the peoples of Magog [Gog and Magog] shall be gathered together. These peoples, the fiercest of all creatures.&lt;ref name=budge1889/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Christian Syriac legend describes a [[flat Earth]] orbited by the [[sun]] and surrounded by the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) mountains. The Paropamisadae mountains are  in turn surrounded by a narrow tract of land which is followed by a treacherous Ocean sea called [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]]. It is within this tract of land between the [[Paropamisadae]] mountains and [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] that Alexander encloses Gog and Magog, so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the Earth. The legend describes "the old wise men" explaining this [[geography]] and [[cosmology]] of the Earth to Alexander, and then Alexander setting out to enclose Gog and Magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat Earth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The old men say, "Look, my lord the king, and see a wonder, this mountain which God has set as a great boundary." King Alexander the son of Philip said, "How far is the extent of this mountain?" The old men say, "Beyond India it extends in its appearance." The king said, "How far does this side come?" The old men say, "Unto all the end of the earth." And wonder seized the great king at the council of the old men ... And he had it in his mind to make there a great gate. His mind was full of spiritual thoughts, while taking advice from the old men, the dwellers in the land. He looked at the mountain which encircled the whole world ... The king said, "Where have the hosts [of Gog and Magog] come forth to plunder the land and all the world from of old?" They show him a place in the middle of the mountains, a narrow pass which had been constructed by God ...&lt;ref name=budge1889/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Flat Earth#Early Christian Church|Flat Earth beliefs in the Early Christian Church]] varied and the Fathers of the Church shared different approaches. Those of them who were more close to [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s visions, like [[Origen]], shared peacefully the belief in a [[spherical Earth]]. A second tradition, including [[St Basil]] and [[St Augustine]], accepted the idea of the round Earth and the radial gravity, but in a critical way. In particular they pointed out a number of doubts about the [[antipodes]] and the physical reasons of the radial gravity. However, a flat Earth approach was more or less shared by all the Fathers coming from the Syriac area, who were more inclined to follow the letter of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Diodore of Tarsus]] (?–390 AD), [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] (6th century), and [[Chrysostom]] (347–407 AD) belonged to this flat Earth tradition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leone Montagnini, "La questione della forma della Terra. Dalle origini alla tarda Antichità," in Studi sull'Oriente Cristiano, 13/II: 31–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flammarion1877|Flammarion 1877]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medieval accounts of Gog and Magog ====
In the Christian ''Alexander romance'' literature, Gog and Magog were sometimes associated with the [[Khazars]], a Turkic people who lived near the [[Caspian Sea]]. In his 9th century work ''[[Expositio in Matthaeum Evangelistam]]'', the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Christian of Stavelot]]  refers to the Khazars as [[Huns|Hunnic]] descendants of Gog and Magog, and says they are ''"circumcised and observing all [the laws of] Judaism"'';&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Alan Brook. ''The Jews of Khazaria.'' 2nd ed. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the Khazars were a [[Central Asia]]n people with a long association with [[Judaism]]. A [[Georgian people|Georgian]] tradition, echoed in a chronicle, also identifies the Khazars with Gog and Magog, stating they are ''"wild men with hideous faces and the manners of wild beasts, eaters of blood."''&lt;ref&gt;Schultze (1905), p. 23.{{Verify source|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Muslim scholars writing about Dhul-Qarnayn also associated Gog and Magog with the Khazars. [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1373 CE), the famous commentator of the Quran, identified Gog and Magog with the Khazars who lived between the Black and [[Caspian Sea]] in his work ''[[Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah]]'' (''The Beginning and the End'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Kathir]], ''Al-Bidayah wa'l-Nihayah (The Beginning and the End)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir, "Stories of the Prophets", page 54. Riyadh, SA Maktaba Dar-us-Salam, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim explorer [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], in his travelogue regarding his diplomatic mission in 921 AD to [[Volga Bulgars]] (a [[vassal]] of the [[khazaria|Khazarian Empire]]), noted the beliefs about Gog and Magog being the ancestors of the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;''Collection of Geographical Works by Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Fadlan, Abu Dulaf Al-Khazraji'', ed. Fuat Sezgin, Frankfurt am Main, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Muslim scholars associated the Khazars with Dhul-Qarnayn just as the Christian legends associated the Khazars with Alexander the Great.

===The rising place of the Sun===
{{Primary sources|section|date=April 2013}}
A peculiar aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, in the Quran, is that it describes Dhul-Qarnayn travelling to "the rising place of the Sun" and the "setting place of the Sun," where he saw the Sun sets into a murky (or boiling) spring of water (or mud). Dhul-Qarnayn also finds a people living by the "rising place of the Sun," and finds that these people somehow have "no shelter."

In his commentary of the Quran, [[Ibn Kathir]]  (1301–1373 CE) explains that verse 18:89 is referring to the furthest point that could be travelled west:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Until, when he reached the setting place of the sun,) means, he followed a route until ''he reached the furthest point that could be reached in the direction of the sun's setting, which is the west of the earth.'' As for the idea of his reaching the place in the sky where the sun sets, this is something impossible, and the tales told by storytellers that he traveled so far to the west that the sun set behind him are not true at all. Most of these stories come from the myths of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] and the fabrications and lies of their heretics.&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah Al-Kahf 18:89, ''His traveling and reaching the Place where the Sun sets (the West)'' ([http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/7823/2/ link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this commentary Ibn Kathir differentiates between the end of the (presumably flat) Earth and the supposed "place in the sky" where the sun sets (the "resting place" of the sun. Ibn Kathir contends that Dhul-Qarnayn did reach the farthest place that could be travelled west but not the "resting place" of the sun and he goes on to mention that the [[People of the Book]] (Jews and Christians) tell myths about Dhul-Qarnayn travelling so far beyond the end of the Earth that the sun was "behind him." This shows that Ibn Kathir was aware of the Christian legends and it suggests that Ibn Kathir considered Christian myths about Alexander to be referring to the same figure as the Dhul-Qarnayn mentioned in the Qu'an.

A similar theme is elaborated upon in several places in the Islamic [[hadith]] literature, in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is narrated ... that the Messenger of Allah one day said: Do you know where the sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne [of Allah]. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place...&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim 1:297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The setting place of the sun is also commented on by [[Al-Tabari]] (838-923 AD) and [[Al-Qurtubi]] (1214–1273 AD) and, like [[Ibn Kathir]], they showed some reservations towards the literal idea of the sun setting in a muddy spring but held to the basic theme of Dhul-Qarnayn reaching the ends of the Earth. The later Islamic scholar [[Imam al-Suyuti]] (1445–1505 AD) also maintained that the Earth is flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hockney|first1=Mike|title=World, Underworld, Overworld, Dreamworld|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc.|isbn=9781326016579}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=June 2018}}

That the Earth must be spherical was known since at least the time of [[Pythagoras]] (570–495 BC), but this knowledge did not reach ancient folklore such as the ''Alexander romance'' where Alexander travels to the ends of a flat Earth. It is notable that, unlike the Babylonians, Greeks, and Indians, the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabs]] had no scientific astronomy. Their knowledge of astronomy was limited to measuring time based on empirical observations of the "rising and setting" of the sun, moon, and particular stars. This area of astronomical study was known as ''anwa'' and continued to be developed after [[Islamization]] by the Arabs.&lt;ref name="Dallal"&gt;Dallal, Ahmad (1999), "Science, Medicine and Technology", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York, pg. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] began in the 8th century and the first major Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' written in 830 by [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwarizmi]].  The work is significant as it introduced the [[Ptolemaic system]] into Islamic sciences (the Ptolemaic system was ultimately replaced by the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in Europe).

|File:Map homer world.jpg|Rendition of [[Homer]]'s view of the world (prior to 900 BC). The Homeric conception of the world involved a flat, circular Earth, surrounded by mountains and by [[Oceanus]],  the world-ocean of [[classical antiquity]], considered to be an enormous river encircling the world. The Sun emerges from underneath the Earth, traveling along the fixed dome of the sky, and is shown rising from Oceanus.
}}&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The place of his [the Sun's] rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of heaven to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and as soon as they see the Sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves ... And when the Sun enters the window of heaven, he [it] straight away bows down and makes obeisance before God his Creator; and he travels and descends the whole night through the heavens, until at length he finds himself where he [the Sun] rises ... So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea to the place where the Sun enters the window of heaven; for the Sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling.&lt;ref name=budge1889/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Christian legend is much more detailed than the Quran's version and elaborates at length about the [[cosmology]] of the Earth that is implied by the story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Alexander] said to them [the nobles]:  "This thought has arisen in my mind, and I am wondering what is the extent of the earth, and how high the heavens are ... and upon what the heavens are fixed ... Now this I desire to go and see, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds all creation." The nobles answered and said to the king, ... "As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heaveans rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles there is the foetid sea, [[Oceanus|Okeyanos]] (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. Men are not able to come near to this foetid sea ... Its waters are like poison and if men swim therein, they die at once."&lt;ref name=budge1889/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ancient [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] of a legendary figure traveling to the end of Earth is also found in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which can be dated to c. 2000 BC, making it one of the earliest known works of literary writing.&lt;ref name=Markaz/&gt; In the [[epic poem]], in tablet nine, Gilgamesh sets out on a quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] to seek immortality. Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth where he grapples and slays monstrous mountain lions, bears and others. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises from the other world, the gate of which is guarded by two terrible scorpion-beings. They allow him to proceed through the gate after Gilgamesh convinces them to let him pass, stating his divinity and desperation, and he travels through the dark tunnel where the sun travels every night. Just before the sun is about to catch up with him, and with the North Wind and ice lashing him, he reaches the end. The world at the end of the tunnel is a bright wonderland full of trees with leaves of jewels. The 17th chapter of the apocryphal [[Book of Enoch]] describes a journey to the far west where the fire of the west receives every setting of the sun and a river of fire empties into the great western sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe020.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters 72–80 describe the risings and settings of the sun through 12 portals of heaven in the east and west.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/boe075.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The myth of a flat Earth surrounded by an Ocean into which the sun sets is also found in the [[Iliad]], the famous epic poem written by [[Homer]] and dated to c. 900 BC. The story of creation in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:10, (dated c. 900–550 BC) is also considered by scholars to be describing a flat Earth surrounded by a sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Seely1997|Seely 1997]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BC) also gave an account of the eastern "end of the Earth," in his descriptions of India. He reported that in India the sun's heat is extremely intense in the morning, instead of noon being the hottest time of day. It has been argued that he based this on his belief that since India is located at the extreme east of a flat Earth, it would only be logical if the morning were unbearably hot due to the sun's proximity.&lt;ref&gt;How, Walter W. and Wells, J. A Commentary on Herodotus. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1912. vol 1. p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander's travels===
[[File:Map-alexander-empire.png|thumb|right|Map of Alexander's travels. Alexander never marched far west of his native [[Macedon]] and his advances eastward ended at the fringes of India.]]

The Quran and the ''Alexander romance'' both have it that Dhul-Qarnayn (or Alexander) travelled a great deal. In the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn, "God gave him unto every thing a road" (or more literally, "We gave him the means of everything" 18:84) He travels as far as the ends of the Earth, to the place on the Earth where the Sun sets (the west) and the place on the Earth where the Sun rises (the east). The Quran portrays him traveling to the "setting of the sun." Muslim interpretations of these verses are varied, but classical Muslim scholars seemed to have been of the opinion that Dhul-Qarnayn's journey was real, not [[allegorical]], and that Dhul-Qarnayn's wall is also a real, physical wall somewhere on Earth.

In the Christian legends, Alexander travels to the places of the setting and rising of the Sun and this is meant to say that he traveled to the ends of the [[flat Earth]] and thus he had traversed the entire world. This legendary account served to convey the theme of Alexander's exploits as a great conqueror. Alexander was indeed a great conqueror, having ruled the largest empire in [[ancient history]] by the time he was 25 years old. However, the true historical extent of Alexander's travels are known to be greatly exaggerated in legends. For example, legend has it that upon reaching India,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... said Alexander 'Truly, then, all the inhabited world is mine. West, north, east, south, there is nothing more for me to conquer.' Then he sat down and wept because there were not other worlds for him to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&amp;book=thirty&amp;story=alexander Thirty Most Famous Stories Retold], James Baldwin (1841–1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reality, while Alexander did travel a great deal, he did not travel further west than [[ancient Libya]] and did not travel further east than the fringes of India. According to historians, Alexander invaded India following his desire to reach the "ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea." However, when he reached the [[Hyphasis River]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 326 BC, his army nearly [[mutiny|mutinied]] and refused to march further east, exhausted by years of campaigning. Alexander's desire to reach "the ends of the Earth" was instilled by his tutor [[Aristotle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alexander derived his concept of `Asia' from the teaching of Aristotle, for whom `the inhabited earth' was surrounded by `the Great sea' Ocean, and was divided into three areas – `Europe, Libya and Asia.' Thus the earth was not round but flat, and `Asia' was limited on the west by the [[Tanais]] (Don), the inland sea and the Nile, and on the east by `India' and `the Great Sea' ... he was mistaken in supposing that from the ridge of the [[Paropamisadae]] (Hindu Kush) one would see `the outer sea' and that `India' was a small peninsula running east into that sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hammond1998|Hammond 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view of the world taught by Aristotle and followed by Alexander is apparent in Aristotle's ''[[Meteorologica]]'', a treatise on earth sciences where he discusses the "length" and "width" of "the inhabited earth." However, Aristotle knew that the Earth is spherical and even provided observational proof of this fact. Aristotle's cosmological view was that the Earth is round but he prescribed to the notion of an "inhabited Earth," surrounded by the Ocean, and an "uninhabited Earth" (though exactly how much of this was understood by his student Alexander the Great is not known).

===Al-Khidir===
[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Al-Khidr]] and Dhul-Qarnayn watch the [[Fountain of Youth#Early accounts|Water of Life]] revive a salted fish.  "When Alexander sought he did not find what Khizr found unsought" (Sikandar Nâma LXIX.75).]]

''Surah Al-Kahf'' has also been linked to the ''Alexander romance'' through a second story. The Quran verses 18:60–82, which immediately precede the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, mention the story of [[Al-Khidir]] and a fish that miraculously comes to life. It has been theorized that the Quran's story was influenced by the story of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth) mentioned in Eastern versions of the ''Alexander romance''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Friedlander 1|Friedländer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Islamic traditions, [[Al-Khidir]] (literally "the Green One," an enigmatic figure in Islam) is the cousin or servant of Alexander or Dhul-Qarnayn.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} There are several versions of the Persian ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' in which Al-Khiḍr figures as a servant of Dhul-Qarnayn or Alexander the Great. In one version, Al-Khidr and Dhul-Qarnayn cross the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. Dhul-Qarnayn gets lost looking for the spring, but Khiḍr finds it and gains eternal life. In the ''Iskandarnamah'' by an anonymous author, Khiḍr is asked by Dhul-Qarnayn to lead him and his armies to the Water of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Iskandarnamah|year=1978|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khidr agrees, and eventually stumbles upon the Water of Life on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Iskandarnamah|year=1978|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran's story is about [[Moses]] and [[Al-Khidir]], though the classical Islamic scholars showed some disagreement over whether or not 'Moses' in this story is [[Moses]] of the [[Israelites]]. In the Quran's story, this Moses goes with a servant ( identified as Joshua in Hadith) to the "junction of the two seas". A certain fish (which they presumably had been carrying with them) "in an amazing way" makes its way to the sea. When the servant tells Moses this, they retrace their steps. They then meet one of God's servants (traditionally  called Al-Khidir, although not named in the Quran) who puts Moses to a test of patience in which Moses must travel with Al-Khidir but not ask any questions. Al-Khidir cracks a hole in a vessel endangering its passengers, then he murders a boy, and then rebuilding a wall each time causing Moses to break his silence. Al-Khidir explains how each of his lawless acts was for a greater good and Moses fails the test of patience. The Quranic story is remarkably similar to [[Elijah#Rabbi Joshua ben Levi|Jewish folklore concerning Elijah]]. In the Jewish tale, [[Elijah#Rabbi Joshua ben Levi|Rabbi Joshua ben Levi]] asks to join the prophet [[Elijah]] in his wanderings. Elijah grants the Rabbi's wish on the condition that he refrain from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agrees and they begin their journey. Elijah carries out "lawless" acts, like Al-Khidir in the Quran, and similarly the Rabbi breaks his silence and demands an explanation.

The story in the Quran is summarized in a [[hadith]] of ''[[Sahih Al-Bukhari]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Allah revealed to him [Moses]: 'At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours [Al-Khidir] who is more learned than you. ' Moses asked, 'O my Lord, how can I meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.' So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha' bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.sunnah.org/history/prophets/khidr_in_ahadith.htm  Khidir in the Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 249.])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea that the sources of these verses are found in the ''Alexander romance'' was first proposed by Mark Lidzbarski and Karl Duroff in 1892. In 1913 Israel Friedlander wrote a book on the subject titled`''"The Al-Khidir Legend and the Alexander Romance."'' Early Persian and Ethiopic Muslim legends concerning Alexander made a similar connection between Al-Khidir and Alexander (see figure).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wheeler2002|Wheeler 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One similarity between the Quran story and the ''Alexander romance'' concerns the fish that miraculously comes to life. This [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] is found in the Syriac sermon by [[Jacob of Serugh]], where Alexander travels in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth). A shorter version of the story in also found in the Greek β-recension of the ''Alexander romance''. In the Syriac legend, Alexander finds a wise man who tells Alexander to take a salted fish and wash it in the fountains in the [[Land of Darkness]], and if the fish comes to life then he will have found the Water of Life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The king [Alexander] said, "I have heard that therein [in the [[Land of Darkness]]] is the [[fountain of life]], And I desire greatly to go forth and see if, of a truth, it is [there]. The old man said, ... "Command thy cook take with him a salt fish, and wherever he sees a fountain of water let him wash the fish; And if it be that it comes to life in his hands when he washes it, That is the fountain of the water of life which thou askest for, O King."&lt;ref name=budge1889/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another similarity between the Al-Khidir legends and the ''Alexander romance'' is the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. Though the Quran does not mention the [[Fountain of Youth]], it is alluded to in the [[hadith]] literature. [[Al-Khidr#Reports in the Hadith|Al-Khidir in the hadith literature]] is described as being immortal, having taught every prophet before Muhammad, and having the appearance of a young adult but having a long, white beard, and he is even described as being present at Muhammad's funeral:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... whether Khidr was still alive, was a more contentious issue. In the twelfth century a [[Hanbali]] scholar denied the continued existence of Khidr. The majority of scholars, on the other hand, affirmed Khidr’s [[immortality|eternal life]] and have continued to do so into the twentieth century. New Arabic texts on Khidr have appeared during the last twenty years of the twentieth century, the majority of which have rejected the idea of his eternal life as ‘unislamic’ without enlisting new arguments for their viewpoint though.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khidr.org/franke.khidr.review.htm Al-Khidir The Green Man]. Review by Claudia Liebeskind in the ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 6513 (2002) of Patrick Franke. ''Begegnung mit Khidr: Quellenstudien zum Imaginären im traditionellen Islam.'' Beiruter Texte und Studien 82. Beirut-Stuttgart 2000. XV + 620p, 23 ill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The story of Al-Khidir, in the Quran, does not mention Dhul-Qarnayn, rather only a figure called "Moses" is referred to by name. This would seem to shed doubt on the idea that the story is about Dhul-Qarnayn, as it appears to be a story about [[Moses]] of the [[Israelites]]. However, the early Islamic literature raises questions about whether the Moses mentioned in the story of the fish is the Moses of the  Israelites, or someone entirely different:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Sa'id: Ibn 'Abbas said, "Ask me (any question)" I [Sa'id] said, "O Abu Abbas! ... ''There is a man at [[Kufa]] who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir's companion) is not Moses of [[Israelites|Bani Israel]]'' ... Ibn 'Abbas said, "(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie."&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 60, Number 250. ([http://www.sunnah.org/history/prophets/khidr_in_ahadith.htm link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The story, in the ''Alexander romance''&lt;ref name=Markaz&gt;Sattari J., "A study on the epic of Gilgamesh and the legend of Alexander." Markaz Publications 2001 (In Persian)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Quran, is considered by scholars to have been influenced by the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] (specifically Giglamesh's search for the Water of Life ). Gilgamesh reaches the water but, like Alexander, fails to become immortal. Like Alexander, Giglamesh also comes to the spot at which the sun rises from the Earth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sources of the Khidir-story go back to mythological [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] appearing in the [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] Epic of Gilgamesh, in the Alexander romance and in Jewish legends centered around the mythical figure of [[Elijah]]. The story as it is told by the Quran interweaves several narrative motifs: the test of patience, the quest for the spring of life, and so on. The identification of the servant of god with al-Khidir is attested to in traditions from the Prophet, which may be the reason why it is rarely contested by Muslim commentators. There is less [[exegetical]] unanimity about whether the Moses mentioned here is the Egyptian Moses or not.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Olver. ed. (2006). ''Al-Khidir'' in ''The Quran: an encyclopedia'' p.344&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A peculiar aspect of the story in the Quran is that Al-Khidir is found at a distant place called the "junction of the two seas." This is believed by secular scholars to be a reference to the end of the World, where the sun rises from the outer Ocean sea. The "junction of the two seas" is mentioned in several places in the Quran:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Allah] is the one who has let free the two bodies of flowing water, one sweet and palatable, and the other salty and bitter. And He has made between them a barrier and a forbidding partition. (Quran 25:53)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been compared to the ancient [[Akkadian mythology|Akkadian myth]] of the ''[[Abzu]]'', the name for a fresh water underground sea that was given a religious quality in [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian mythology]].  Lakes, springs, rivers, wells, and other sources of fresh water were thought to draw their water from the ''[[Abzu]]'' underground sea, while the Ocean that surrounded the world was a saltwater sea. This underground sea is called [[Tehom]] in the Hebrew Bible. For example, Genesis 49:25 says, "blessings of the heavens above, and Tehom lying beneath".&lt;ref&gt;Wensinck (1918), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Wensinck explains, "Thus it appears that the idea of there being a sea of sweet water under our earth, the ancient Tehom, which is the source of springs and rivers, is common to the Western Semites".&lt;ref&gt;Wensinck (1918), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  These two bodies of water are also depicted as [[deity|deities]] in the [[Babylonian deity|Babylonian]] [[creation myth]], the ''[[Enûma Elish]]'', where ''Abzu'' is deity of the freshwater ocean and ''[[Tiamat]]'' is the deity of the salt water ocean. The ''Enuma Elish'' begins:&lt;blockquote&gt;When above the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below, [[Abzu|Apsu]] the freshwater ocean was there, the first, the begetter, and [[Tiamat]], the saltwater sea, she who bore them all; they were still mixing their waters, and no pasture land had yet been formed, nor even a reed marsh...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly in [[Greek mythology]], the world was surrounded by [[Oceanus]],  the world-ocean of [[classical antiquity]]. Oceanus was [[personified]] as the god [[Helios|Titan]], whose consort was the [[Greek sea gods|aquatic]] sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert|Burkert, Walter]] ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early archaic Age'' (Harvard University Press) 1992, pp 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also thought that [[rainfall]] was due a third ocean above the "[[Firmament|Firmament of the Sky]]" (a vast reservoir above the firmament of the sky is also described in the [[Genesis creation narrative]]). A comprehensive understanding of the Earth's [[water cycle]] did not exist until the "Origins of Springs" was written by [[Pierre Perrault (scientist)|Pierre Perrault]] in 1674 AD.

==Islamic depictions of Alexander the Great==

===Arabic traditions===
[[File:secret of secrets a.jpg|thumb|174px|right|Manuscript of the 9th-century Arabic work ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' ("Secret of Secrets"), an encyclopedic treatise on a wide range of topics including [[physiognomy]], [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[medicine]]. This work includes a series of supposed letters from [[Aristotle]], addressed to Alexander. The Arabic manuscript was translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th century and was influential in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]] ]]

Alexander the Great features prominently in early Arabic literature. There are many surviving versions of the ''Alexander romance'' in Arabic that were written after the conquest of Islam. It is also thought that pre-Islamic [[Arabic]] versions of the ''Alexander romance'' may have existed.&lt;ref name=doufikar-aertis&gt;Doufikar-Aerts, Faustina (2003). ''The Last Days of Alexander in an Arabic Popular Romance of Al-Iskandar.'' in ''The Ancient Novel and Beyond'' by Panayotakis, Zimmerman and Keulen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving Arabic narrative of the Alexander romance was composed by [[Umara ibn Zayd]] (767–815 AD). In the tale, Alexander travels a great deal, builds the Wall against Gog and Magog, searches for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] (Fountain of Youth), and encounters angels who give him a   "wonder-stone" that both weighs more than any other stone but is also as light as dust. This wonder-stone is meant to admonish Alexander for his ambitions and indicate that his lust for conquest and eternal life will not end until his death. The story of the wonder-stone is not found in the Syriac Christian legend, but is found in Jewish [[Talmudic]] traditions about Alexander as well as in Persian traditions.&lt;ref name=stoneman2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southgate, Minoo. S. ''[http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cmedst/gmap/uploaded/Portrait%20of%20Alexander%20in%20Persian%20Alexander%20Romances%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Era.pdf Portrait of Alexander in Persian Alexander-Romances of the Islamic Era]''. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 97, No. 3, (July – September, 1977), pp. 278-–284&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Arabian peninsula|South Arabian]] Alexander legend was written by the [[Yemen]]ite traditionist [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (?–732 AD) and this legend was later incorporated in a book by [[Ibn Hisham]] (?–833 AD) regarding the history of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in ancient Yemen. In the Yemenite variation, Dhul-Qarnayn is identified with an ancient king of Yemen named [[Tubba']], rather than Alexander the Great, but the Arabic story still describes the story of Alexander's Wall against Gog and Magog and his quest for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]]. The story also mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn (Tubba') visited a castle with glass walls and visited the [[Brahmins]] of India. The South Arabian legend was composed within the context of the division between the South Arabs and North Arabs that began with the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]] in 684 AD and consolidated over two centuries.&lt;ref name=stoneman2003/&gt;

The ''Alexander romance'' also had an important influence on Arabic [[wisdom literature]]. In ''[[Secretum Secretorum]]'' ("Secret of Secrets", in Arabic ''Kitab sirr al-asrar''), an encyclopedic Arabic treatise on a wide range of topics such as [[Public administration|statecraft]], [[ethics]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[medicine]], Alexander appears as a speaker and subject of wise sayings and as a correspondent with figures such as [[Aristotle]]. The origins of the treatise are uncertain. No [[Greek language|Greek]] original exists, though there are claims in the Arabic treatise that it was translated from the Greek into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and from Syriac into Arabic by a well-known 9th century translator, [[Yahya ibn al-Bitriq]] (?–815 AD). It appears, however, that the treatise was actually composed originally in Arabic.

In another example of Arabic wisdom literature relating to Alexander, [[Ibn al-Nadim]] (?–997 AD) refers to a work on [[divination]] titled ''The Drawing of Lots by Dhul-Qarnain'' and to a second work on divination by arrows titled ''The gift of Alexander'', but only the titles of these works have survived.

Notably, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mu'tasim]] (794–842 AD) had ordered the translation of the ''[[Thesaurus Alexandri]]'', a work on [[elixirs]] and [[amulets]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] into Arabic. The Greek work ''Thesaurus Alexandri'' was attributed to [[Hermes]] (the great messenger of the gods in [[Greek mythology]]) and similarly contained supposed letters from Aristotle addressed to Alexander.&lt;ref name=stoneman2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yucesoy, Hayrettin. ''Messianic Beliefs &amp; Imperial Politics in Medieval Islam: The Abbasid Caliphate in the Early Ninth Century''. 2009. University of South Carolina. pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

A more direct Arabic translation of the ''Alexander romance,'' called ''Sirat Al-Iskandar'', was discovered in [[Constantinople]], at the [[Hagia Sophia]], and is dated to the 13th century. This version includes the letter from Alexander to his mother about his travels in India and at the end of the World. It also includes features which occur exclusively in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version. The Arabic legend also retains certain [[pagan]] elements of the story, which are sometimes modified to suit the Islamic message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite remarkable that some characteristics belonging to a pre-Islamic 'pagan' entourage, have survived in the text ... For example, Alexander orders an offering of sacrificial animals at the temple of [[Hercules]]. In the Arabic letter the name of the deity has been replaced by ''[[Allah]]'' ... Another passage in the account of the palace of Shoshan or Sus, gives a description of the large silver jars, which were alleged to have capacity of three hundred and sixty measures of wine. Alexander puts this assertion to the test, having one of the jars filled with wine and poured out for his soldiers during a banquet. This exact specification has been maintained, heedless of the Islamic ban on the use of wine ... These retouched borrowings are highly significant in this text, because the Arabic Alexander figure is portrayed as a propagator of Islamic monotheism.&lt;ref name=doufikar-aertis/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another piece of Arabic Alexander literature is the ''Laments (or Sayings) of the Philosophers''. These are a collection of remarks supposedly made by some philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander after his death. This legend was originally written in the 6th century in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and was later translated into [[Arabic]] and expanded upon. The ''Laments of the Philosophers'' eventually gained enormous popularity in Europe:&lt;ref name=Brock1970/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The 'Sayings of the Philosophers' are] remarks of the philosophers gathered at the tomb of Alexander, who utter a series of [[Apophthegmata Patrum|apophthegms]] on the theme of the brevity of life and the transience of human achievement ... a work entitled 'Sayings of the Philosophers' was first composed in Syriac in the sixth century; a longer Arabic version was composed by [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq|Hunayan Ibn Ishaq]] (809-973) the distinguished scholar-translator, and a still longer one by al-Mubashshir ibn Fatiq (who also wrote a book about Alexander) around 1053. Hunayan's version was translated into Spanish ... in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, Heinz. ''Latin fiction: the Latin novel in context.'' Routledge, 1999. p.245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Arabic ''Alexander romance'' also had an influence on a wider range of Arabic literature. It has been noted that some features of the Arabic Alexander legends found their way into ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]'', a medieval story-cycle of Arabic origin. Sinbad, the hero of the epic, is a fictional [[sailor]] from [[Basrah]], living during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures going to magical places, meeting monsters, and encountering supernatural phenomena. As a separate example of this influence on Arabic literature, the legend of Alexander's search for the [[Fountain of Youth|Water of Life]] is found in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of [[Middle East]]ern and [[South Asia]]n stories and [[Folklore|folktales]] compiled in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref name=stoneman2003/&gt;

===Andalusian traditions===
[[File:Poema de Yusuf.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of a 14th-century poem (''Poema de Yuçuf'') written in [[Aljamiado]] (Spanish and [[Mozarabic]] language [[transliterated]] in [[Arabic alphabet]]).]]

After the [[Umayyad]] Muslim conquest of [[Al-Andalus]] (Spain) in 711 AD, Muslim literature flourished under the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] (929 to 1031 AD). An  [[Arabic]] derivative of the ''Alexander romance'' was produced, called ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' (''Tales of Dhul-Qarnayn'').&lt;ref name=Zuwiyya2001/&gt; The material was later incorporated into ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (''Tales of the Prophets''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the turn of the first millennium C.E., the romance of Alexander in Arabic had a core centered on the Greek legendary material ... Interwoven later into this narrative in the ''Tales of the Prophets'' literature were episodes of an apparent Arab-Islamic elaboration: the construction of a great barrier to keep the people of Gog and Magog from harassing the people of the civilized world until Judgement Day, the voyage to the end of the Earth to witness the sun set in a pool of boiling mud, and Dhu al-Qarnayn's expedition into the [[Land of Darkness]] in search of the [[Fountain of Youth|Fountain of Life]] accompanied by his companion [[Al-Khidir|Khidir]] ("the Green-One").&lt;ref name=Zuwiyya2009/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1236 AD, the [[Reconquista]] was essentially completed and Europeans had retaken the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the Muslims, but the [[Emirate of Granada]], a small Muslim vassal of the Christian [[Kingdom of Castile]], remained in Spain until 1492 AD. During the Reconquista, Muslims were forced to either convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the peninsula. The descendants of Muslims who converted to Christianity were called the [[Morisco]]s (meaning "[[Moors|Moor]]-like") and were suspecting of secretly practicing Islam. The Moriscos used a language called [[Aljamiado]], which was a dialect of the Spanish language ([[Mozarabic]]) but was written using the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Aljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos; prayers and the sayings of Muhammad were translated into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all Quranic verses in the original Arabic. During this period, a version of the Alexander legend was written in the Aljamaido language, building on the Arabic ''Qisas Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as well as [[Romance language]] versions of the ''Alexander romance''.&lt;ref&gt;Zuwiyya, David Z. "Translation and the Arat of Recreation: The legend of Alexander the Great from the ''Pseudo-Callisthenes'' to the Aljamiado-Morisco ''Rrekontamiento del rrey Alisandre''" in ''Sensus de sensu: Estudios filológicos de traducción''.  Ed. Vicente López Folgado.  Córdoba: Universidad de Córdoba (2002).  Pp. 243–263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuwiyya, David Z. "The Hero of the Hispano-Arabic Alexander Romance ''Qissat Dhulqarnayn'': Between ''al-Askander'' and ''Dhulqarnayn''," Kalamazoo, Michigan, 34th International Congress on Medieval Studies, Spring 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Persian traditions===
[[File:Iskandar.JPG|thumb|175px|15th century [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Portrait miniatures|miniature painting]] from [[Herat]] depicting Iskander, the Persian name for [[Alexander the Great]]]]

With the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest of Persia]] in 644 AD, the ''Alexander romance'' found its way into [[Persian literature]]&amp;mdash;an ironic outcome considering [[Achaemenid Empire|pre-Islamic Persia's]] hostility towards the national enemy who conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and was directly responsible for centuries of Persian domination by [[Seleucid Empire|Hellenistic]] foreign rulers. However, he is not depicted as a warrior and conqueror, but as a seeker of truth who eventually finds the ''[[Fountain of Youth|Ab-i Hayat]]'' (Water of Life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Algar|first1=Hamid|title=Mīrzā Malkum Khān: A Study in the History of Iranian Modernism|date=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520022171|page=292, ft. 26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuSK1054j54C&amp;lpg=PA292&amp;pg=PA292|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic Persian accounts of the Alexander legend, known as the ''Iskandarnamah'', combined the ''[[Alexander romance|Pseudo-Callisthenes]]'' material about Alexander, some of which is found in the Quran, with indigenous [[Sassanid]] [[Middle Persian]] ideas about Alexander. For example, Pseudo-Callisthenes is the source of many incidents in the ''[[Shahnama]]'' written by [[Ferdowsi]] (935–1020 AD) in [[New Persian]]. Persian sources on the Alexander legend devised a mythical genealogy for him whereby his mother was a concubine of [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], making him the half-brother of the last Achaemenid [[shah]], [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]]. By the 12th century such important writers as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Azerbaijan]]) were making him the subject of their [[Epic poetry|epic poems]]. The Muslim traditions also elaborated the legend that Alexander the Great had been the companion of [[Aristotle]] and the direct student of [[Plato]].

There is also evidence that the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the ''Alexander romance'', dating to the 6th century, was not directly based on the Greek recensions but was based on a lost  [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (pre-Islamic Persian) manuscript.&lt;ref name=doufikar-aertis/&gt;

===Central Asian traditions===

Certain Muslim people of [[Central Asia]], specifically [[Bulgars|Bulgar]], [[Tatar]] and [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] peoples of the [[Volga]]-[[Ural (region)|Ural]] region (within what is today [[Tatarstan]] in the [[Russian Federation]]), carried on a rich tradition of the Alexander legend well into the 19th century. The region was conquered by the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in the early 10th century. In these legends, Alexander is referred to as ''[[Alexander III of Macedon|Iskandar]] Dhul-Qarnayn'' (Alexander the Two Horned), and is "depicted as founder of local cities and an ancestor of local figures." The local folklore about ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' played in an important role in communal identity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The conversion of the [[Volga Bulghars]] to Islam is commonly dated to the first decades of the 10th century, and by the middle of the 12th century, it is apparent that Islamic historical figures and Islamic forms of communal validation had become important factors for Bulghar communal and political cohesion. The [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] traveler Abū Hamid al-Gharnāti who visited Bulghar in the 1150s, noted that Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn passed through Bulghar, that is, the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] region, on his way to build the iron walls that contained Yā'jūj and Mā'jūj [Gog and Magog] within the [[land of darkness]] ... while Najib al-Hamadāni reports that the rulers of Bulghar claimed descent from Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn.&lt;ref name=frank&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=Allen J. |year=2000 |title=Historical Legends of the Volga-Ural Muslims concerning Alexander the Great, the City of Yelabuga, and Bāchmān Khān |journal= Revue des mondes musulmans et de la Méditerranée |volume=89-90 |issue=89–90 |pages=89–107 |url=http://remmm.revues.org/index274.html |doi=10.4000/remmm.274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Iskandar Dhul-Qanryan'' legends played an important role in the conversion narrative of the Volga Bulgar Muslims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are numerous digressions dealing with the founding of the Bulghar conversion narrative, and legends concerning Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn [Alexander Dhul-Qarnayn]  and [[Socrates]]. According to the account, Socrates was born a Christian in [[Samarqand]] and went to Greece to serve Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn (Iskandar Rūmi). Together, they went to the [[Land of Darkness]] (diyār-i zulmat) to seek the [[Fountain of Youth]] (āb-i hayāt). In the northern lands they built a city and called it Bulghar.&lt;ref name=frank/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1577 AD the [[Tsardom of Russia]] annexed control of the region and Bulgar Muslim writings concerning Dhul-Qarnayn do not appear again until the 18th and 19th centuries, which saw a resurgence of local ''Iskandar Dhul-Qarnayn'' legends as a source of Muslim and ethnic identity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was only at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries that we begin to see historical legends concerning Iskandar Dhūl-Qarnayn reemerge among [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga-Kama]] Muslims, at least in written form, and it was not until the 19th century that such legends were recorded from local Muslim oral tradition. In one of his earliest historical works, entitled Ghilālat al-Zamān and written in 1877 the Tatar theologian, Shihāb al-Dīn Marjānī wrote that according to Arabic and other Muslim writings, as well as according to popular legends, the city of Bulghar was founded by Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name=frank/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Orientalist and western views ==

In the 19th century, [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studying the Quran began researching the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn. Theodor Nöldeke, believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was none other than Alexander the Great as mentioned in versions of the ''Alexander romance'' and related literature in Syriac (a dialect of [[Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Noldeke|Nöldeke]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriac manuscripts were translated into English in 1889 by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]].&lt;ref name=budge1889&gt;[[#Budge1889|Budge 1889]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century [[Andrew Runni Anderson]] wrote a series of articles on the question in the ''Transactions of the [[American Philological Association]]''.&lt;ref name="Anderson 1927"&gt;[[#Anderson1927|Anderson 1927]].&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the [[philologists]] imply that the source of the Quran's story of Dhul-Qarnayn is the ''Alexander romance'', a thoroughly embellished compilation of Alexander's exploits from [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and early [[Christian]] sources, which underwent numerous expansions and revisions for two-thousand years, throughout [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Edwards 2002"/&gt;

As can be seen in the following quotation from Edwards, secular [[philologists]] studying ancient [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] [[legend]]s about Alexander the Great also came to the conclusion that Dhul-Qarnayn is an ancient [[epithet]] for Alexander the Great. Edwards says, &lt;blockquote&gt;Alexander's association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]. The denial of Alexander's identity as Dhul-Qarnain is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world—both in the east and the west. The popularity of the legend of Alexander the Great proves that these cultures share a history which suggests that perhaps they are not so different after all.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2002"&gt;[[#Edwards2002|Edwards 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero''' (born 1 February 1951) is a Nicaraguan heir, Colonel and businessman.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero was born on February 1, 1951&lt;ref&gt;Although other sources (''Somoza and the Legacy of U.S. Involvement'' by Bernard Diedrich, page 140) list December 18, 1951 as his birthdate.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;'Somoza and the Legacy of U.S. Involvement'', Bernard Diedrich, 140&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[Somoza Family|Somoza family]], he is a son of former [[Nicaraguan]] president [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] and [[Hope Portocarrero]];&lt;ref name='APWorldstream1'&gt;{{cite news | first=Filadelfo | last=Aleman | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Report of possible visit by son of former dictator causes uproar in Nicaragua | date=2000-03-30 | publisher= | url = | work =Associated Press Worldstream | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is also a grandson of [[Anastasio Somoza García]]. Also known as ''El Chigüín''&amp;mdash;"daddy's kid"&amp;mdash;Somoza Portocarrero had been the heir apparent to the Somoza dynasty prior to the ouster of his father by the [[Sandinistas]] in 1979.&lt;ref name='Herald1'&gt;{{cite news | first=Glenn | last=Garvin | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Somoza family seeking to regain seized Nicaragua property | date=2000-05-07 | publisher= | url =http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/nicaragua/comeback.htm | work =Miami Herald | pages = | accessdate = 2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1978, Somoza Portocarrero had reportedly taken on the appellation "apprentice dictator" and assumed full control of the Somozas' estimated $1 billion business empire,&lt;ref name='NYT2'&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan | last=Riding | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Untitled | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url = | work =The New York Times | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, by mid-1979 the family had fallen from power and would be forced into exile.

He was educated in the United States, including at [[Kent School]] in [[Kent, Connecticut]], [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and in England, at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. His sister, Carolina, is married to James Minskoff Sterling, son of New York real estate developer [[Henry H. Minskoff]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/style/miss-somoza-wed-to-dr-j-m-sterling.html New York Times: "Miss Somoza Wed to Dr. J. M. Sterling"] October 16, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
He became a Colonel in the Nicaraguan military, which was run by his family.&lt;ref name='APWorldstream1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='NYT2' /&gt; He played an active role in the armed forces during the [[History of Nicaragua#Sandinista insurrection .281972 - 1979.29|Sandinista insurrection]], and the [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|National Guard]] unit which he commanded "was accused of widespread human-rights violations in the final days of the civil war."&lt;ref name='Herald1' /&gt;

In early 1980, the new Sandinista government formally accused Somoza Portocarrero of masterminding the 1978 assassination of opposition journalist [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal]],&lt;ref name='AP1'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Young Somoza accused in Chamorro killing | date=1980-01-15 | publisher=Associated Press | url = | work = | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 1981 trial that convicted nine people of the crime implicated him ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''.&lt;ref name='NYT1'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Jury in Nicaragua Convicts Nine in Publisher's Slaying | date=1981-06-11 | publisher= | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/11/world/around-the-world-jury-in-nicaragua-convicts-nine-in-publisher-s-slaying.html | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Sandinista officials also issued a warrant for Somoza Portocarrero's arrest on charges that he embezzled $4 million in governmental funds (via dummy corporations) while his father was still in power.&lt;ref name='UPI1'&gt;{{cite news | first=Oswaldo | last=Bonilla | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Issue arrest warrants for Somoza's son | date=1980-10-14 | publisher= | url = | work =United Press International | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was living in Miami at the time&lt;ref name='UPI1' /&gt; (having been given asylum by the United States), was not extradited, and thus never stood trial.&lt;ref name='UPI2'&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Molinski | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=President Chamorro seeks pardon for killers of husband | date=1990-08-17 | publisher= | url = | work =United Press International | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports that Somoza Portocarrero might return to Nicaragua in 2000 after over twenty years in exile led to an uproar in that country. Former Sandinista President [[Daniel Ortega]] suggested that Somoza Portocarrero "will be able to enter [[Managua]], but I doubt he will be able to leave because the people will confront him with gunshots." Sitting President [[Arnoldo Aleman]]&amp;mdash;whose own [[Constitutionalist Liberal Party (Nicaragua)|political party]] in part grew out of the old Somoza party&amp;mdash;said that Nicaraguans "reject the announced visit of Somoza Portocarrero, whom public opinion considers one of those principally responsible for the destruction, suffering, violations and spilling of blood dramatically suffered by Nicaraguans throughout their history."&lt;ref name='APWorldstream1' /&gt; Somoza Portocarrero had planned to return for a political rally but ultimately canceled the visit.&lt;ref name='Herald1' /&gt;

'''Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich''' ({{lang-de|Anna Katharina Emmerick}}; 8 September 1774 – 9 February 1824) was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Augustinian]] [[Canoness]] Regular of [[Congregation of Windesheim|Windesheim]], [[mysticism|mystic]], [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Marian]] [[visionary]], [[ecstatic]] and [[stigmatist]].&lt;ref name=Vatican &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20041003_emmerick_en.html Vatican Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Christian mysticism}}
She was born in [[Flamschen]], a farming community at [[Coesfeld]], in the [[Diocese of Münster]], [[Westphalia]], Germany, and died at age 49 in [[Dülmen]], where she had been a nun, and later become bedridden. Emmerich is notable for her visions on the life and [[passion of Jesus Christ]], reputed to be revealed to her by the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under [[religious ecstasy]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmerich, Anna Catherine: ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' {{ISBN|978-0-89555-210-5}} page viii&lt;/ref&gt;

During her bedridden years, a number of well-known figures were inspired to visit her.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; The poet [[Clemens Brentano]] interviewed her at length and wrote two books based on his notes of her visions.&lt;ref name=AndrewWeeks /&gt; The authenticity of Brentano's writings has been questioned and critics have characterized the books as "conscious elaborations by a poet" and a "well-intentioned fraud" by Brentano.&lt;ref name=America /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anvil /&gt;

Emmerich was [[beatified]] on 3 October 2004, by [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; However, the Vatican focused on her own personal piety rather than the religious writings associated to her by Clemens Brentano. Her documents of postulation towards canonization are handled by the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]].

==Early life==
She was born as ''Anna Katharina'' into a family of poor farmers and had nine brothers and sisters, her Surname coming from a town where her ancestry stayed. From an early age, she had to help with the house and farm work. Her schooling was rather brief, but all those who knew her noticed that she felt drawn to prayer from an early age.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; At twelve, she started to work at a large farm in the vicinity for three years and later learned to be a seamstress and worked as such for several years.&lt;ref name=CathEnc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05406b.htm Graham, Edward. "Ven. Anne Catherine Emmerich." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 Feb. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

She applied for admission to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a [[dowry]]. Eventually, the [[Poor Clares]] in [[Münster]] agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in [[Coesfeld]] to study music and learn to play the organ, but she never got around to it because the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there to help them, and she sacrificed her small savings for that.&lt;ref name=CathEnc /&gt; Later, one of the Söntgen daughters entered the convent with her.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;

==Religious life==
In 1802, at the age of  28, Anne Catherine and her friend Klara Söntgen finally managed to join the [[Augustinian nun]]s at the convent of Agnetenberg in [[Dülmen]]. The following year, Anne Catherine took her [[Vow#Divine vows|religious vows]].&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; In the convent, she became known for her strict observance of the order's rule; but, from the beginning to 1811, she was often quite ill and had to endure great pain. At times, her zeal and strict adherence to rules disturbed some of the more tepid sisters, who were puzzled by her weak health and religious ecstasies.&lt;ref name=CathEnc /&gt;

When [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], [[Kingdom of Westphalia|King of Westphalia]], [[Religious intolerance|suppressed the convent]] in 1812, she found refuge in a widow's house.

==Stigmata==
[[File:Emmerickhaus.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Anne Catherine Emmerich in Coesfeld-Flamschen]]

In early 1813, marks of the [[stigmata]] were reported on Emmerich's body. The parish priest called in two doctors to examine her. When word of the phenomenon spread three months later, he notified the vicar general. With the news causing considerable talk in the town, the ecclesiastical authorities conducted a lengthy investigation. Many doctors wished to examine the case, and although efforts were made to discourage the curious, there were visitors whose rank or status gained them entry.&lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J789AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA237 Thurston, Herbert. "The Problem of Anne Catherine Emmerich", ''The Month'', Vol. 138, p. 238, Simpkin, Marshall, and Company, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the poet and romanticist Clemens Brentano first visited.

At the end of 1818, the periodic bleeding of Emmerich's hands and feet had stopped and the wounds had closed. While many in the community viewed the stigmata as real, others considered Emmerich an impostor conspiring with her associates to perpetrate a fraud. In August 1819, the civil authorities intervened and moved Emmerich to a different house, where she was kept under observation for three weeks. The members of the commission could find no evidence of fraud and were divided in their opinions.&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;. 

As the cross on her breastbone had the unusual shape of a "Y", similar to a cross in the local church of Coesfeld, English priest [[Herbert Thurston]] surmised that "the subjective impressions of the stigmatic exercise a preponderating influence upon the manifestations which appear exteriorly."&lt;ref name=Thurston/&gt;, same pathway to Stigmata described in the works by blessed [[John of Ruusbroec]].

==Visions and inspirations==
Anne Catherine Emmerich said that as a child she had [[vision (religion)|visions]] in which she talked with Jesus, saw the souls in [[Purgatory]] and witnessed the core of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the form of three concentric interpenetrating full spheres. The largest but dimmest of the spheres represented the Father core, the medium sphere the Son core and the smallest and brightest sphere the Holy Spirit core. Each sphere of omnipresent God is extended toward infinity beyond God's core placed in [[heaven]]. The Brentano compilation tells that during an illness in Emmerich's childhood, she was visited by a child (suggested as being Jesus), who told her of plants she should ingest in order to heal, including Morning Glory flower's juice, known containing [[Ergine]]. Brentano reports Anna Catherine stated that in the Moon terminal, there were streams, plants and animals, but described the rest as seen by XX century visitors and spaceships. 

Based on Emmerich's growing reputation, a number of figures who were influential in the renewal movement of the church early in the 19th century came to visit her, among them [[Clemens August von Droste zu Vischering|Clemens von Droste zu Vischering]], the future [[Archbishop of Cologne]]; [[Johann Michael Sailer]], the [[Bishop of Ratisbon]], since 1803 the sole surviving Elector Spiritual of the Holy Roman Empire;  [[Bernhard Heinrich Overberg|Bernhard Overberg]] and authors [[Luise Hensel]] and [[Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg|Friedrich Stolberg]].&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt; Clemens von Droste, at the time still vicar‑general of the Archdiocese, called Emmerich "a special friend of God" in a letter he wrote to Stolberg.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;

===Clemens Brentano's visits===
[[File:Dülmen Hl. Kreuz Anna-Katharina Emmerick Sterbezimmer.jpg|thumb|The reconstruction of Emmerich's room with the original furniture, at the Holy Cross church in [[Dülmen]], Germany]]
At the time of Emmerich's second examination in 1819, Brentano visited her and she immediately recognized him. He claimed that she told him he was sent to help her fulfill God's command, to express in writing the revelations made to her. Brentano became one of Emmerich's many supporters at the time, believing her to be a "chosen Bride of Christ". Professor Andrew Weeks claims that Brentano's own [[Complex (psychology)|personal complexes]] were a factor in substituting Emmerich as a maternal figure in his own life.&lt;ref name=AndrewWeeks /&gt;

From 1819 until Emmerich's death in 1824, Brentano filled many notebooks with accounts of her visions involving scenes from the [[New Testament]] and the life of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Because Emmerich only spoke the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian dialect]], Brentano could not transcribe her words directly, and often could not even take notes in her presence,&lt;ref name=Corl /&gt; so he would quickly write in [[German language|standard German]] when he returned to his own apartment a set of notes based on what he remembered of the conversations he had with Emmerich.&lt;ref name=Corl /&gt; Brentano edited the notes later, years after the death of Emmerich.&lt;ref name=Corl /&gt;

About ten years after Emmerich had recounted her visions, Brentano completed editing his records for publication.&lt;ref name=Corl /&gt; In 1833, he published his first volume, ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ According to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich''. Brentano then prepared ''The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich'' for publication, but he died in 1842. The book was published posthumously in 1852 in [[Munich]].

Catholic priest Father Karl Schmoger  edited Brentano's manuscripts and from 1858 to 1880 published the three volumes of ''The Life of Our Lord''. In 1881, a large illustrated edition followed. Schmoger also penned a biography of Anne Catherine Emmerich in two volumes that has been republished in English language editions.

The Vatican does not endorse the authenticity of the books written by Brentano.&lt;ref name=CNSFeb2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNSOct2004 /&gt; However, it views their general message as "an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation".&lt;ref&gt;"Her words, which have reached innumerable people in many languages from her modest room in Dülmen through the writings of Clemens Brentano, are an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation right up to the present day". [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20041003_emmerick_en.html Quote from 18th paragraph of Vatican online biography ''Anna Katharina Emmerick (1774-1824'')]&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have been less sympathetic and have characterized the books Brentano produced from his notes as "conscious elaborations of an overwrought romantic poet".&lt;ref name=AndrewWeeks&gt;Andrew Weeks, "Between God and Gibson: German Mystical and Romantic Sources of ''The Passion of the Christ''", ''[[The German Quarterly]]'' Vol. 78, No. 4, Fall, 2005 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/30039448 Link to JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brentano wrote that Emmerich said she believed that [[Noah]]'s son [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] was the progenitor of "the black, idolatrous, stupid nations" of the world. The "Dolorous Passion" is claimed to reveal a "clear antisemitic strain throughout",&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Croteau, ''Apocalyptic Shakespeare: Essays of Vision and Chaos in Recent Film Adaptations'', McFarland, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with Brentano writing that Emmerich believed that "Jews ... strangled Christian children and [[Blood libel|used their blood]] for all sorts of suspicious and diabolical practices"&lt;ref&gt;Paula Frederiksen, ''On the Passion of the Christ'', California, 2006, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of partial fabrication by Brentano===
[[File:Dülmen Hl. Kreuz Grab Anna-Katharina Emmerick.jpg|thumb|The tomb of Anne Catherine at the Holy Cross church in [[Dülmen]], Germany]]
When the case for Anne Catherine's beatification was submitted to the Vatican in 1892, a number of experts in Germany began to compare and analyze Brentano's original notes from his personal library with the books he had written.&lt;ref name=America /&gt; The analysis revealed various apocryphal biblical sources, maps and travel guides among his papers, which could have been used to enhance Emmerich's narrations.&lt;ref name=America /&gt;

In his 1923 theological thesis, German priest Winfried Hümpfner, who had compared Brentano's original notes to the published books, wrote that Brentano had fabricated much of the material he had attributed to Emmerich.&lt;ref name=Anvil &gt;Emmerich, Anne Catherine, and Clemens Brentano. ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''. Anvil Publishers, Georgia, 2005 pages 49-56 (Note: the hard copy of this book has a wrong ISBN printed within its frontmatter, but the text (and the wrong ISBN) show up on Google books as published by Anvil Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=winfrid &gt;Winfried Hümpfner, ''Clemens Brentanos Glaubwürdigkeit in seinen Emmerick-Aufzeichnungen; Untersuchung über die Brentano-Emmerick-frage unter erstmaliger Benutzung der tagebücher Brentanos'' Würzburg, St. Rita-verlag und -druckerei, 1923 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1928, the experts had come to the conclusion that only a small portion of Brentano's books could be safely attributed to Emmerich.&lt;ref name=America&gt;{{cite web |author=John O' Malley |title=A Movie, a Mystic, a Spiritual Tradition |magazine=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] |date=15 March 2004 |url=http://americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3481&amp;comments=1 |accessdate=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005193623/http://americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3481&amp;comments=1 |archivedate=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anvil /&gt;

At the time of the Emmerich's beatification in 2004, the Vatican position on the authenticity of the Brentano books was elucidated by priest Peter Gumpel, who was involved in the study of the issues for the [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]: "It is absolutely not certain that she ever wrote this. There is a serious problem of authenticity".&lt;ref name=Anvil /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNSFeb2004&gt;{{cite web |author=John Thavis |work=Catholic News Service |date=4 February 2004 |title=Vatican confirms papal plans to beatify nun who inspired Gibson film |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/20040616y.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040619064144/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/20040616y.htm |archive-date=2004-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNSOct2004 /&gt; According to Gumpel, the writings attributed to Emmerich were "absolutely discarded" by the Vatican as part of her beatification process.&lt;ref name=America /&gt;

==Death and burial==
Anne Catherine began to grow ever weaker during the summer of 1823. She died on 9 February 1824 in [[Dülmen]] and was buried in the graveyard outside the town, with a large number of people attending her funeral.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;  Her grave was reopened twice in the weeks following the funeral, due to a rumor that her body had been stolen, but the coffin and the body were found to be intact.&lt;ref name=Vatican /&gt;&lt;ref name=CathEnc /&gt; In February 1975, Emmerich's remains were moved to the Holy Cross Church in [[Dülmen]], where they rest today.

==House of the Virgin Mary==
[[File:House of the Virgin Mary.jpg|thumb|right|''[[House of the Virgin Mary]]'' now a chapel in [[Ephesus]], Turkey]]
Neither Brentano nor Emmerich had ever been to [[Ephesus]], and indeed the city had not yet been excavated; but visions contained in ''The Life of The Blessed Virgin Mary'' were used during the discovery of the [[House of the Virgin Mary]], the Blessed Virgin's supposed home before her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], located on a hill near [[Ephesus]], as described in the book ''Mary's House''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary's House by Donald Carroll (20 April 2000) Veritas, {{ISBN|0-9538188-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, a French priest, the Abbé [[Julien Gouyet]] used Emmerich's book to search for the house in Ephesus and found it based on the descriptions. He was not taken seriously at first, but sister [[Marie de Mandat-Grancey]] persisted until two other priests followed the same path and confirmed the finding.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption'' by Stephen J. Shoemaker 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-921074-8}} page 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of the living Christ: the life and ministry of Jesus Christ'' by Robert A. Powell 1996 {{ISBN|0-88010-407-4}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy See]] has taken no official position on the authenticity of the location yet, but in 1896 [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo&amp;nbsp;XIII]] visited it and in 1951 [[Pope Pius XII|Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;XII]] initially declared the house a Holy Place. [[Pope John XXIII|Pope John&amp;nbsp;XXIII]] later made the declaration permanent. [[Pope Paul VI|Pope Paul&amp;nbsp;VI]] in 1967, [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1979 and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]] in 2006 visited the house and treated it as a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=29 November 2006 |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-18317?l=english |title=Where Mary Is Believed to Have Lived |website=Zenit |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927161718/http://www.zenit.org/article-18317?l=english |archive-date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beatification==
[[File:Anna Katharina Emmerick.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.72|An 18th century drawing of Anne Catherine]]
{{cquote|Her example opened the hearts of poor and rich alike, of simple and cultured persons, whom she instructed in loving dedication to Jesus Christ.|30px|30px|[[Pope John Paul II]], [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2004/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20041003_beatifications_en.html ''Homily'', Sunday, 3 October 2004].}}
The process of Anne Catherine's [[beatification]] was started in 1892 by the Bishop of [[Münster]]. However, in 1928 the Vatican suspended the process when it was suspected that Clemens Brentano had fabricated some of the material that appeared in the books he wrote, and had attributed to Ann Catherine.&lt;ref name=EWEM &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/emmerich.htm |work=[[EWTN]] |title=The Passion of The Christ and Anne Catherine Emmerich and Mary of Agreda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]] allowed the case for her beatification to be re-opened, provided it only focused on the issue of her life, without any reference to the possibly doctored material produced by Clemens Brentano.&lt;ref name=EWEM /&gt;

In July 2003 the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints promulgated a decree of a miracle attributed to her, and that paved the way for her beatification.&lt;ref name=EWEM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' N.&amp;nbsp;29, 16 July 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2004 Anne Catherine Emmerich was beatified by Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anna Katharina Emmerick, Who Lived Her Own Passion |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ZANKAEM2.HTM |work=ZENIT Daily Dispatch |publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=3 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the books produced by Brentano were set aside, and her cause adjudicated solely on the basis of her own personal sanctity and virtue.&lt;ref name=Anvil /&gt; Father Peter Gumpel who was involved in the analysis of the matter at the Vatican told Catholic News Service: "Since it was impossible to distinguish what derives from Sister Emmerich and what is embroidery or additions, we could not take these writings as a criteria. Therefore, they were simply discarded completely from all the work for the cause".&lt;ref name=CNSFeb2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNSOct2004&gt;{{cite web |author=John Thavis |work=Catholic News Service |date=4 October 2004 |title=Pope beatifies five, including German nun who inspired Gibson film |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0405425.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041005225405/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0405425.htm |archive-date=2004-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematic portrayals==
In 2003 actor [[Mel Gibson]] brought Anne Catherine Emmerich's vision to prominence as he used her book ''The Dolorous Passion'' as a key source for his movie ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref name=Corl &gt;''Jesus and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ'' by Kathleen E. Corley, Robert Leslie Webb 2004 {{ISBN|0-8264-7781-X}} pages 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia &gt;''Mel Gibson's Passion and philosophy'' by Jorge J. E. Gracia 2004 {{ISBN|0-8126-9571-2}} page 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C. DiMare 2011 {{ISBN|1-59884-296-X}} page 909&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson stated that Scripture and "accepted visions" were the only sources he drew on, and a careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.&lt;ref name=Corl /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; In his review of the movie in the Catholic publication ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', Jesuit priest John O'Malley used the terms "devout fiction" and "well-intentioned fraud" to refer to the writings of Clemens Brentano.&lt;ref name=America /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anvil /&gt;

In 2007 German director Dominik Graf made the movie ''The Pledge'' as a dramatization of the encounters between Anne Catherine (portrayed by actress [[:de:Tanja Schleiff|Tanja Schleiff]]) and [[Clemens Brentano]], based on a novel by Kai Meyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936335?refcatid=31&amp;printerfriendly=true |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=27 Feb 2008 |title=The Pledge |author=Eddie Cockrell |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108200624/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936335?refcatid=31&amp;printerfriendly=true |archive-date=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0965422/ |title=The Vow (2007) |work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anson Jones''' (January 20, 1798&amp;nbsp;– January 9, 1858) was a [[Physician|doctor]], [[businessperson]], [[member of Congress]], and the [[President of the Republic of Texas|fourth and last President]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], sometimes called the "Architect of Annexation".

== Early life ==
Jones was born on January 20, 1798, in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]]. He traveled to Seneca Falls, New York, and opened a one-room school. He taught there from 1812 to 1813. In 1820, Jones was licensed as a doctor by the [[Oneida, New York]], Medical Society, and began medical practice in 1822. However, his practice did not prosper, and he moved several more times before finally being arrested in [[Philadelphia]] by a creditor. He stayed in Philadelphia for a few more years, teaching and practicing medicine, until in 1823, he decided to go to Venezuela.

Later, Jones returned to Philadelphia, earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], and reopened his practice. He never had much success as a doctor, and in 1832, he renounced medicine and headed for [[New Orleans]], where he entered the mercantile trade. Once again, though, Jones's dreams were thwarted. Though he safely weathered two plagues, his business efforts never met with any success, and within a year he had no money.

He was a member and Past Master of the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Harmony Lodge #52 of Philadelphia.

[[Image:Anson Jones House.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Anson Jones House, now in [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas]]]]

In 1832, Jones headed west to [[Texas]], settling eventually in [[Brazoria, Texas|Brazoria]]. Here, at last, he met with success, establishing a medical practice that prospered quickly. In 1835, he began to speak out about the growing tensions between Texas and [[Mexico]], and that year he attended [[Consultation (Texas)|the Consultation]], a meeting held at [[Columbia, Texas|Columbia]], by Texas patriots to discuss the fight with Mexico (the meeting's leadership did not want to call the meeting a "convention", for fear the Mexican government would view it as an independence forum). Jones himself presented a resolution at the Consultation calling for a convention to be held to declare independence, but he himself refused to be nominated to the convention.

During the [[Texas Revolution]], Jones served as a judge advocate and surgeon to the Texas Army, though he insisted on holding the rank of private throughout the conflict. After the war, Jones returned to Brazoria and resumed his medical practice.

Upon his return to Brazoria, Jones found that [[James Collinsworth]], a fellow Texas patriot and signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Brazoria, had set up a law practice in Jones's office. Jones evicted Collinsworth and challenged him to a duel (though the duel never occurred).

Just a few months before the revolution, on March 2, 1834, Jones met with four other Masons at Brazoria and petitioned the Grand Master of Louisiana for a dispensation and a charter to form the first Masonic lodge in Texas. In December, when the lodge was set to labor, Jones was elected its first Master. The charter for [[Holland Lodge|Holland Lodge No. 36]] arrived during the final days of the revolution, and Jones carried it in his saddlebags during the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on April 21, 1836. At the formation of the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas in December 1837, he was elected its first Grand Master. He also became the first Grand Master of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioof-poly148.org/our_history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009011603/http://ioof-poly148.org/our_history.php |archivedate=October 9, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1840, he married [[Mary Smith Jones]]. Together, they had four children.&lt;ref name="UTHouston"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary (Mrs. Anson) Jones Letters|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uhsc/00034/hsc-00034.html|publisher=University of Houston|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones and Collinsworth would spar again. Collinsworth was instrumental in starting the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company, to which Jones was vehemently opposed. Jones was elected to the Second Texas Congress as an opponent of the company; however, his most significant act in Congress was to call for the withdrawal of the Texas proposal for annexation by the [[United States]]. He also helped draw up legislation to regulate medical practice, and called for the establishment of an endowment for a university.

Jones expected to return to his practice at Brazoria after his term in Congress, but Texas President [[Sam Houston]] instead appointed him Minister to the United States, where Jones was to formally withdraw the annexation proposal.

During this time, while many [[Texas|Texans]] hoped to encourage eventual annexation by the United States, some supported waiting for annexation or even remaining independent. The United States, in the late 1830s, was hesitant to annex Texas for fear of provoking a war with Mexico. Jones and others felt  that Texas gaining recognition from European states was important, and began to set up trade relations with them, to make annexation of Texas more attractive to the United States, or failing that, to give Texas the strength to remain independent.

Jones was recalled to Texas by new president [[Mirabeau Lamar]] in 1839. Back at home, he found himself elected to a partial term in the Senate, where he quickly became a critic of Lamar's administration. He retired from the Senate in 1841, declining the opportunity to serve as Vice President in favor of returning to his medical practice. Late in 1841, though, he was named Texas Secretary of State by President Houston, who had been recently been elected president again by opponents of Lamar.

Jones served as Secretary of State until 1844. During his term, the main goal of Texas foreign policy was to get either an offer of annexation from the United States, or a recognition of Texas independence from Mexico, or preferably, both at the same time.

Anson Jones served as the fourth and last President of the Republic of Texas.

== After presidency ==
Jones hoped that the new Texas state legislature would send him to the United States Senate. He was not chosen, and as time went on, he became increasingly bitter about this slight. Although Jones prospered as a planter and eventually amassed an enormous estate, he was never able to get past the fact that [[Sam Houston]] and [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] were chosen over him to represent Texas in [[Washington, DC]].

After the suicide of [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] in 1857, Jones became convinced that the legislature would finally send him to the Senate, but he received no votes.

== Death ==
[[File:President Anson Jones' grave site.png|thumb|Anson Jones' gravesite at [[Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)|Glenwood Cemetery]] in Houston]]
For four days, he had lodged at [[Houston]]'s old [[Rice Lofts|Capitol Hotel]], the former seat of government of the Republic of Texas. His arm permanently injured in a fall, and having received no votes for a vacant seat in the [[U.S. Senate]], he brooded over his career. After dinner on January 9, 1858, he returned to his room and fatally shot himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsl.texas.gov/exhibits/presidents/jones/later.html Anson Jones Left Behind]&lt;/ref&gt; He was 59 years old.

'''Arsenije "Arsen" Dedić''' ({{IPA-hr|ǎrsen děːditɕ|pron}}; 28 July 1938 – 17 August 2015) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] singer-songwriter. Dedić wrote and performed [[chanson]]s as well as film music. He was also an award-winning poet and was one of the best-selling poets of former Yugoslavia.

==Biography==

Arsen Dedić was born in [[Šibenik]], in the [[Littoral Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] as the second child of Jovan Dedić and Veronika (née Mišković).{{sfn|Fuka|Kegelj|2015}}&lt;ref name="MD-INT"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://arhiva.kurir-info.rs/arhiva/2005/maj/24/ST-02-24052005.shtml | language = Serbian | first = Kurir | last = Info | newspaper = [[Kurir Info]] | title = MOJ BRAT ARSENIJE Intimna ispovest beogradskog slikara Milutina Dedića, rođenog brata poznatog zagrebačkog šansonjera srpskog porekla | date = 24 May 2005 | accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lopušina|2008}}&lt;ref name="AD-RET"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jutarnji.hr/nenad-polimac-otkriva-jedinu-tajnu-arsena-dedica-jednom-je-rekao---ja-se-ne-bojim-smrti-/1401380/ | language = Croatian | first = Nenad | last = Polimac | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | title = NENAD POLIMAC PIŠE O JEDINOJ TAJNI ARSENA DEDIĆA Jednom je rekao: 'Ja se smrti ne bojim' | date = 19 August 2015 | accessdate = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Jovan was [[Serbs|ethnic Serb]],{{sfn|Lopušina|2008}} an Orthodox Christian,{{sfn|Fuka|Kegelj|2015}} while his mother Jelka&lt;ref name="AD-RET"/&gt; was [[Croats|Croat]]{{sfn|Fuka|Kegelj|2015}} who converted from Catholicism to Orthodoxy after marrying Jovan.&lt;ref name="MD-INT"/&gt; His father was a [[bricklayer]], volunteer [[firefighter]], and musician, and his mother was an [[illiterate]] housewife, whom Arsen later taught. Arsen was baptized in the Orthodox Church under the name Arsenije, after Archbishop [[Arsenije III Čarnojević]].{{sfn|Lopušina|2008}} He finished music school. He and his older brother Milutin Dedić left Šibenik for [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]], respectively, in 1957.{{sfn|Lopušina|2008}} Arsen studied law at Zagreb but dropped out in 1959, enrolling in the [[Music Academy of Zagreb]], receiving a diploma in 1964.

Arsen became a household name in the 1960s, thanks to pop music festivals and his brand of music, which was at first influenced by [[Dalmatia]]n folklore, but is mostly comparable to the French [[chanson]] genre. Throughout the decades Dedić became one of the most respected musicians in former [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and maintained this reputation to this day. Dedić died 17 August 2015 in Zagreb, Croatia. He was 77 years old.

==Personal life==
Arsen Dedić was married to German-born Croatian pop singer [[Gabi Novak]]. Their son [[Matija Dedić]] is one of the most respected [[jazz]] musicians in Croatia, and has together with Marina a daughter "Lu".&lt;ref&gt;Svet.rs, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100602091232/http://www.svet.rs/clanak/arsen-dedi%C4%87-i-gabi-novak-na-putu-je-jo%C5%A1-jedno-unu%C4%8De Arsen Dedić i Gabi Novak: Na putu je još jedno unuče], Izvor: "Vecernji.hr" Objavljeno: 31 May 2010 – 20:12&lt;/ref&gt; They also had a daughter, Sandra.

'''Charles Alexandre de Calonne''' (20 January 1734{{snd}}30 October 1802), titled '''Count of Hannonville''' in 1759,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=John Nichols |date=April 1795 |title=The superlatively fine collection of ... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38jPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA286 |magazine=The Gentleman's Magazine |publisher=E. Cave}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[France|French]] statesman, best known for his involvement in the [[French Revolution]].

Realizing that the [[Parlement]] of [[Paris]] would never agree to reform, Calonne handpicked an [[Assembly of Notables]] in 1787 to approve new taxes. When they refused, Calonne's reputation plummeted and he was forced to leave the country.

==Origins and rise to prominence==
Born in [[Douai]] of an upper-class family, he entered the legal profession and became a [[lawyer]] to the general council of [[Artois]], procureur to the ''[[parlement]]'' of Douai, ''[[Master of Requests (France)]]'', [[intendant]] of [[Metz]] (1768) and of [[Lille]] (1774). He seems to have been a man with notable business abilities and an entrepreneurial spirit, while generally unscrupulous in his political actions. In the terrible crisis preceding the [[French Revolution]], when successive ministers tried in vain to replenish the exhausted royal [[treasury]], Calonne was summoned as [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finances]], an office he assumed on 3 November 1783.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Calonne, Charles Alexandre de|volume=5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He owed the position to the [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Comte de Vergennes]], who for over three years continued to support him. According to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] ambassador, his public image was extremely poor. Calonne immediately set about remedying the fiscal crisis, and he found in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] enough support to create a vast and ambitious plan of revenue-raising and administrative centralization. Calonne focused on maintaining public confidence through building projects and spending, which was mainly designed to maintain the Crown's capacity to borrow funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Güttner |first=Darius |date=2015 |title=The French Revolution |edition=1st |location=South Melbourne, Victoria |publisher=Nelson Cengage Learning |page=42 |isbn=9780170243995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented the king with his plan on 20 August 1786. At its heart was a new [[land value tax]], which would replace the old vingtieme taxes and finally sweep away the fiscal exemptions of the privileged orders. The new tax would be administered by a system of provincial assemblies elected by the local property owners at parish, district and provincial level. This central proposal was accompanied by a further package of rationalizing reform, including free trade in grain and abolition of France's myriad internal customs barriers. It was in effect one, if not the most, comprehensive attempt at enlightened reform during the reign of Louis XVI.

==Measures==
In taking office he found debts of 110 million [[livres]], debts caused by France's involvement in the American Revolution among other reasons,&lt;ref name="Ford, F page 102"&gt;Ford, F: "Europe 1780&amp;ndash;1830", page 102. Longman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and no means of paying them. At first he attempted to obtain credit, and to support the government by means of loans so as to maintain public confidence in its [[solvency]]. In October 1785 he reissued the [[gold coin]]age, and he developed the ''caisse d'escompte''&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; (dealing in [[Discounts and allowances|cash discounts]]).  Knowing the Parlement of Paris would veto a single land tax payable by all landowners, Calonne persuaded Louis XVI to call an assembly of notables to vote on his referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=72|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calonne's eventual reform package, which was introduced to the Assembly of Notables, consisted of 5 major points:

1) Cut Government Spending

2) Create a revival of free trade methods

3) Authorize the sale of Church property

4) Equalization of salt and tobacco taxes

5) Establish a universal [[land value tax]]&lt;ref name="Ford, F page 102" /&gt;
[[Image:Calonne.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Calonne]]
All these measures failed because of the powerlessness of the crown to impose them.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, M. (2002) ''Revolutionary France'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; As a last resort, he proposed to the king the suppression of [[Customs (tax)|internal customs]] [[Duty (economics)|duties]], and argued in favor of the [[Property tax|taxation of the property]] of [[Estates of the realm|nobles and clergy]]. [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] and [[Jacques Necker]] had attempted these reforms, and Calonne attributed their failure to the opposition of the ''parlements''. Therefore, he called an ''[[Assembly of Notables|Assemblée des notables]]'' in February 1787, to which he presented the deficit in the treasury, and proposed the establishment of a ''subvention territoriale'', which would be levied on all property without distinction.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Deposition and exile==
This suppression of privileges was badly received. Calonne's spendthrift and authoritarian reputation was well-known to the parlements, earning him their enmity. Knowing this, he intentionally submitted his reform programme directly to the king and the hand-picked assembly of notables, not to the sovereign courts or parlements, first. Composed of the old regime's social and political elite, however, the assembly of notables balked at the deficit presented to them when they met at Versailles in February 1787, and despite Calonne's plan for reform and his backing from the king, they suspected that the controller-general was in some way responsible for the enormous financial strains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Calonne, angered, printed his reports and so alienated the court. Louis XVI dismissed him on 8 April 1787 and exiled him to [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. The joy was general in Paris, where Calonne, accused of wishing to raise taxes, was known as ''Monsieur Déficit''. Calonne soon afterwards left for [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and during his residence there kept up a polemical correspondence with Necker.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; After being dismissed, Calonne stated, "The King, who assured me a hundred times that he would support me with unshakable firmness, abandoned me, and I succumbed”.&lt;ref&gt;France 1789, Victory Over History: The French Revolution (Sydney, 2016), {{cite web |url=http://victoryoverhistory.com/the-french-revolution/france-1789/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623195232/http://victoryoverhistory.com/the-french-revolution/france-1789/ |archivedate=2016-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1789, when the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] were about to assemble, he crossed to [[Nord (département)|Flanders]] in the hope of offering himself for election, but he was forbidden to enter France. In revenge he joined the ''[[émigré]]'' group at [[Coblenz]], wrote in their favour, and spent nearly all the fortune brought him by his wife, a wealthy widow.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He was present with the [[Charles X of France|Count of Artois]], the reactionary brother of Louis XVI, at [[Pillnitz]] in August 1791 at the time of the issuance of the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]], an attempt to intimidate the revolutionary government of France that the Count of Artois pressed for.&lt;ref&gt;Calonne's presence in the entourage of the Count of Artois at this time is confirmed in a journal that documents the events surrounding the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] in [[Prague]] in September 1791: the ''Krönungsjournal für Prag'' (Prague, 1791), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, having again settled in London, he received permission from [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] to return to France. He died about a month after his arrival in his native country.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Calonne's negative reputation and assumed responsibility for France's financial crisis in the years leading to the Revolution of 1789 have been judged unfair by historians such as Munro Price. During his position as controller-general, he had genuinely tried to make amends for his previous spendthrift policies. As a contemporary writer, Chamfort, remarked, Calonne was "applauded when he lit the fire, and condemned when he sounded the alarm." Economic historians such as Eugene White,&lt;ref&gt;White, Eugene Nelson, (1989), “Was there a Solution to the Ancien Régime’s Financial Dilemma”, Journal of Economic History, 49, 3, pp. 545-568.&lt;/ref&gt; have however stressed the negative role played by Calonne who continued the restoration of a venal system of financial administration.  His fall had important significance to the fate of the monarchy in France before 1789. The financial strains made apparent through Calonne's attempts at reform revealed the instability of the monarchy as a whole, which up until then had been managed on the basis of traditional monarchical absolutism: secretly, hierarchically, without public scrutiny of accounts or consent to taxation. For centuries, the monarchy had controlled fiscal policy on its own terms, and when knowledge of an unmanageable and growing deficit became more widely known, the image was of a failed and, in many ways, corrupt institution. Louis XVI, who had backed Calonne's reform programme wholehearthedly, saw its refusal by the notables and the parliament as a personal failure. Conscientious in his attempts to alleviate the suffering of the French people, the king, it is clear, genuinely hoped to implement an enlightened policy with the help of Calonne. Crushed by this opposition to Calonne's project, the king withdrew to long hours of hunting and larger meals. Many historians see the ensuing months as the beginning of the king's bouts of depression.

{{Quotation|To be honest, there was never really going to be a volume two—William [Christensen, editor-in-chief/publisher of Avatar] would ask me regularly about the possibility, but apart from one or two vague scenes I pretty soon realised I had no more ''Crossed'' stories in me. I didn't want to force the issue, either, because I'm very pleased with ''Crossed'' and don't want to dilute it with a sequel that I hadn't the ideas to sustain.

That said, it's pretty obvious that what you have with ''Crossed'' is a ready-made [[fictional world]] with a good deal of potential for further development, and the ''Crossed'' themselves seem to be strong enough villains to maintain an audience. So when William suggested other people doing more I said I wasn't averse to it, so long as a) I thought the creative teams were up to scratch, and b) my own story and characters would be left alone. Which means no sequel, no more Stan, Cindy, Thomas or Kitrick (or Horsecock, Face or Stump, come to that)- just fresh stories set in the same world.

As for David, who better? I think you'll see right from his first episode that he knows exactly what he's doing with the ''Crossed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rich |last=Johnson |authorlink=Rich Johnston |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/02/16/interview-garth-ennis-talks-about-crossed/ |title=Interview: Garth Ennis Talks About Crossed |work=[[Bleeding Cool]] |publisher=Avatar Press |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Plot synopsis ==
{{plot | section|date=November 2015}}
The story follows survivors dealing with a [[pandemic]] that causes its victims to [[going postal|carry out]] their most [[Intrusive thoughts|evil thoughts]]. Carriers of the virus are generally known as the "Crossed" due to a large, cross-like rash that appears on their faces – other names include "cross-faces" and "plus-faces". This contagion is primarily spread through bodily fluids, which the Crossed have used to great effect by treating their weapons with their fluids, as well as through other forms of direct fluidic contact such as rape and bites, assuming the victim lives long enough to turn. A major difference between the Crossed and other fictional zombie or insanity-virus epidemics (e.g. in the film ''[[28 Days Later]]'') is that while the Crossed are turned into homicidal violent psychopaths, they still retain a basic human-level of intelligence: thus, they are still capable of using firearms and tools, driving motor vehicles, setting complex traps, and other actions. It is occasionally noted in the series that a Crossed retains any skills they had prior to their infection; most simply lack the patience or sanity to do anything not immediately related to their vicious impulses.

The contagion spread across the entire world, with the Crossed killing, raping, engaging in [[cannibalism]] and maiming for fun, with governments and military overwhelmed; friends and family butchered each other with anything they lay their hands on, and cities were turned into vast [[charnel house]]s. Much of the Middle East was wiped out when Israel deployed nuclear weapons. The last organized act by the US government was to shut down as many nuclear power plants as possible and then kill the nuclear scientists and technicians to prevent them from reactivating the plants.  A few nuclear power plants were not reached in time, however, such as [[Wolf Creek Generating Station|Wolf Creek]] in Kansas and [[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant|Browns Ferry]] in Alabama, detonated by Crossed who removed the control rods.  One by one, the remaining military bases are overrun. Soon human civilization is all but gone, and mankind is an increasingly endangered species.

==Plot Elements==

===Depiction of the Crossed===
The Crossed themselves show considerable variation, as they are still self-aware individuals –  albeit turned into homicidal maniacs. One of the most visible examples is the actual level of insanity demonstrated. Many Crossed are practically feral savages with absolutely no regard for their own self-preservation, to the point that they will gleefully mutilate themselves for the sheer thrill of it, including amputating their own limbs. Others will be so driven to kill that they will carry out suicide attacks, crashing vehicles or causing nuclear meltdowns. Most are capable of basic (albeit deranged) speech, and wield whatever clubs, knives, or sharp objects are at hand to attack anything around them. The more insane Crossed will even attack each other, though they apparently prefer the non-Crossed. Some characters speculate that this preference is due to their need for sadistic gratification: given that the Crossed are so insane that they will mutilate themselves voluntarily, it isn't as fun to torture fellow Crossed as it is to torture uninfected, frightened victims.

As stated by Garth Ennis:

{{quote|"The Crossed are people who – through infection – have given in to the absolute worst instincts that human beings can: murder, rape, torture, cannibalism, all of the most cruel and inventive kind imaginable. They are out of control, really. Their number one urge is to get their hands into normal people and commit every ghastly act they can think of – they can't fight it, and they don't want to."}}

In many cases, the personality and resultant madness of a Crossed individual will be affected by memories and relationships they had prior to infection. Examples of this include several Crossed in ''The Golden Road'' attacking Sanarkand specifically to exact vengeance on Gideon Welles, Eve carrying around the severed head of her boyfriend and sexually taunting Oliver (who betrayed her friends to the Crossed and raped her prior to her infection) in ''The Quisling'', and Hazuki refusing to harm her friends after becoming Crossed in ''Five Bloody Fingers''. It is also implied that certain mind-altering drugs can further influence a Crossed's personality; in ''Gore Angels'', the Crossed known as "Al the Chemist" ate several hallucinogenic mushrooms prior to his infection, later exhibiting a fascination with "enlightenment" and apparently seeing uninfected humans as "purple people".

On rare occasions, pregnant women who have been infected and turned survive long enough to give birth, but their babies are born infected as well – apparently the placental barrier provides no protection against the infection (though it is possible that it does, but unsanitary birth conditions infect them during delivery itself, like neonatal conjunctivitis). Crossed women who have given birth are, however, gleefully willing to needlessly murder their own newborn babies.

The rate at which a person becomes infected ranges from several hours to a matter of minutes, and once infected there is no turning back. In most situations, the rate of infection is incredibly fast, in the range of one to three minutes.  No cure exists for the Crossed, and there is almost no hint that scientists were able to study the infection long enough to do any sort of thorough research on the dilemma. While cover art has shown infected lab monkeys, animals generally seem immune, with predators such as leopards and lions freely mauling and biting Crossed with no sign of infection.

Some survivors have attempted to slip past the Crossed by painting red cross-marks on their faces to simulate the rashes from the infection – the Crossed will attack other Crossed if they're bored or frustrated, but at least some of the time will leave other Crossed alone.  The effectiveness of the ruse varies between stories, but it rarely works for long.  In ''The Fatal Englishman'', the main characters note that they have never seen this trick succeed in the five years they survived since the outbreak; on the other hand, the survivors seen at the beginning of ''The Quisling'' attribute their survival to the "fake cross" tactic, although they admit that they weren't sure if it would've fooled the Crossed for more than a passing glance (it should also be noted that they carried parts of the dismembered corpse whose blood they used for the fake crosses with them, which may or may not have "enhanced" the illusion to the Crossed).

==="Evolution"===

As time goes on in-universe, characters note that the Crossed have apparently been developing new habits. Some Crossed have been shown to be quite capable of complex pre-meditated actions. Not consumed by unthinking bloodlust to the extent that many of the other infected are, they have enough mental wherewithal to plan ambushes and traps, and organize gangs of Crossed to assault survivor enclaves. The more mindless rage-consumed Crossed will still know how to use firearms if they find them, but usually won't think rationally enough to plan out where to acquire more firearms. The more rational and calculating Crossed, in contrast, will actively seek out armories to acquire new firearms. Some of these more rational Crossed will self-consciously coat their weapons in their own bodily fluids, actively trying to turn non-infected survivors into more Crossed.

The series frequently presents Crossed specimens with unusual levels of focus and restraint, allowing them to form gangs of Crossed around them. Major examples of such characters include Horsecock in the original series, Ashley and Ashlynne in ''Homo Superior'', Smokey in ''The Quisling'', the nun Aoileann in ''Wish You Were Here'', and serial killer Beau Salt, whose journal and descendants survive to ''Crossed +100''. In comics by Simon Spurrier, this is attributed to some quality in the infected or their circumstances before infection; it's suggested in one issue that the disease doesn't always take proper hold in a "broken brain". Shaky says that Aoileann is good at "holding back passion" (which is mistaken for control)&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Wish You Were Here'': [http://www.crossedcomic.com/webcomic/volume-4-chapter-16/ Volume 4, Chapter 16]&lt;/ref&gt; and simply passed this on to her group. Russian gangster Mattias had periods of control (followed by violent mania) due to brain damage from long-term [[ketamine]] use,&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #20&lt;/ref&gt; and an Australian was focused on getting revenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed Annual 2014''&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Wish You Were Here'', it is vaguely implied that Aoileann's unusual reaction to the Crossed infection may also be due to her having [[epilepsy]], altering how it affected her brain. Beau Salt, already a prolific serial killer before 'The Surprise', as he called it, was largely unaffected by the infection, retaining all his faculties. He spent decades weeding out feral Crossed in order to build a functioning society of Crossed, passing his legacy down to his children, named after [[The Seven Dwarves]].

Aoileann is capable of having lucid conversations with other people, making complex future plans and traps, and even seems to have retained certain empathetic emotions, as she is actually horrified at the prospect of personally killing other people (though she lets her followers kill uninfected people) and attempts to hold back her followers from killing Shaky (other humans are fair game). Mattias displays not only cognitive thinking but also strong emotional feelings. In his human life he fell in love with his parole officer, Serena; following his infection, he is determined to find and protect her, only to go insane with grief when he finds he came too late. This showed traces of positive emotions such as love and sadness that is almost never observed in other crossed. If and how his [[ketamine]] habit affects this is unknown. Smokey is one of the smartest Crossed ever seen, being able to organize and lead a large group of Crossed. He is even able to strike deals with survivors, protecting them from the other Crossed in exchange for their assistance in luring out other survivors. An exact reason why he is so much smarter is never given; although there were medical reasons behind Aoileann and Mattias, no such conditions are ever stated with him. It is to be noted that he does not display emotions, he is just more intelligent.  The twin sisters Ashley and Ashlynne in the Florida Keys are also intelligent, for unknown reasons, though the fact that they are identical twins may indicate that it is due to some random genetic mutation.  In issue #97, a navy patrol ship captain with access to a long-range communications system (communicating with other survivors across continents) told Smokey that such intelligent "super-Crossed" were exceedingly rare, being more of a scary campfire story that survivors shared with each other.  The captain mentioned that besides Smokey, he had heard rumors of a nun in England (Aoileann), twin sisters in Florida (Ashley and Ashlynne), and an autistic kid in Montreal (similar to epilepsy, apparently his [[Autism]] made his brain structure different enough that the virus didn't take full hold).  

Of all these "super-Crossed", there is one who takes it to another level: Salt, an infamous serial killer (known as the "Phonebook Killer") who was infected on C-Day. Because Salt was already homicidally insane and had no restrictions on his impulses, the Crossed virus did not significantly change him (perhaps because his psychopathic brain structure was already significantly altered from normal). Retaining all of his intellect and long-term planning ability, Salt soon became a dark messiah of sorts to the Crossed. He created the hundred-year plan to ensure the Crossed survive and continue the apocalyptic cycle indefinitely.

The "super-Crossed" tend to appear in comics that take place long after the outbreak first occurred, up to five years later by ''The Fatal Englishman''. As Shaky explained in ''Wish You Were Here'', it is not so much that the Crossed "evolved" during these years, but rather the process of natural selection setting in. Logically, many of the Crossed who were so insane that they didn't care about their own self-preservation have died off, while the far more dangerous rational and calculating ones took steps to survive over a long period of time.  Those Crossed with little sense of preservation, not even the sense to put on warm clothing in colder weather, tended to die off in the winters. The Crossed who survived that long tend to be the more rational and lucid ones who have the wherewithal to preserve themselves, use combat tactics like avoiding gunfire, use guns themselves, and setting complex ambushes.  Meanwhile, the few surviving non-infected are hardened veterans who have been combating the Crossed for years, further increasing the pressure of natural selection as the Crossed are forced to become smarter and more cunning to catch the survivors off-guard.

Most of the completely "anti-social" Crossed die out in the heavy fighting of the initial outbreak.  By the time of ''Crossed: Family Values'', survivors observe that most Crossed usually form up into gangs of about five to fifteen members – any larger than that and they start fighting each other again, bringing the number back down to below about fifteen.  The more coherent Crossed who survived many years, however, are capable of forming into even larger groups of over a hundred without fighting each other (as seen in ''The Fatal Englishman'' and the webcomics).  As seen in ''Family Values'' and the webcomics, when there are no more uninfected around to attack, after a while a group of Crossed will usually fall into a sort of bored stupor, aimlessly wandering in one direction until they find more people to attack. A number of Crossed, however, appear to be naturally smarter or, at least, more capable of patience and planning: deferring immediate pleasure to have a greater atrocity later. These tend to become the leaders of large gangs, numbering in the many dozens or, in ''Crossed +100'', a whole community. These appear more often in stories set months or years after the outbreak.

===Outbreak===
Before ''The Thin Red Line'', the ''Crossed'' stories agreed that the infection was stunningly rapid, so fast that the news media and most world governments had little, if any, time to respond, but the exact specifics of the outbreak differed from writer to writer. Depending on the story, it took anywhere from a week to a mere matter of hours for the infection to spread across the globe.  In the original story, the infection erupts suddenly across the entire [[United States of America|United States]] without warning and later spreads; a survivor says [[Canada]] tried to fortify the border "in the first week" and were unaware the virus had reached them until after that point.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''Badlands'' #14–18, #40–43 and ''Wish You Were Here'' have the infection erupted across the entire planet in the same day, the latter two showing [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] being rapidly overrun; ''Badlands'' #16 has the [[White House]] (and [[Surgeon General]]) and part of the news media still around the next day, reporting on the crisis. ''Badlands'' #10–13 ignores this and has the Crossed tearing through small towns without being noticed, getting more and more numerous over the course of a week; and ''Badlands'' #26, also by Ennis, has a British soldier named Harry (later appearing in ''The Thin Red Line'') say he's been aware of the Crossed for "the past three days" by the time the outbreak is public.

In the ''Crossed : Dead or Alive'' webcomic, the characters discuss a collapsed bridge, and speculate it was detonated by the [[US Army]] in "the first few days", in an effort to cut major road arteries and slow traffic between the eastern and western sections of the United States to slow the spread of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Dead or Alive'' [http://www.crossedcomic.com/webcomic/crossed-doa-part-5/3/ Part 5, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the stories where the infection is sudden, the Crossed are shown overrunning the United States at sunset/night and [[London]] in the afternoon,&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Wish You Were Here'' Volume 1 Part 2&lt;/ref&gt; meaning one nation had to be overrun before the other.  Badlands arc 62–70 shows the initial outbreak in the city of [[San Diego]] and the attempts by the US military to restore order in the city, and, as the epidemic got out of hand, evacuate thousands of surviving civilians from the city to waiting cruise ships and extract them to a supposedly secure island off the California coastline. However, a [[US Navy]] fleet sent from [[Pearl Harbor]] to protect the evacuation ships at San Diego harbor somehow falls victim to the infection and ultimately massacres much of the civilian evacuation vessels still residing in San Diego, killing and maiming hundreds or possibly thousands of survivors.

''Homo Tortor'' by [[Kieron Gillen]] would introduce a fringe scientific theory that a viral pandemic of sociopathy had caused [[Toba catastrophe theory#Genetic bottleneck theory|the mass extinction of prehistoric hominids]]. When the outbreak happened, one man attempted to find the theory's professor in the hope of learning about the origins of the Crossed – there turned out to be no link, with the prehistoric scenes being an in-universe story by the Crossed about the world they were making now.&lt;ref&gt;Badlands #75–80&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Thin Red Line'' (''Badlands'' #50–56) finally established an origin and timeline of the infection as happening in Summer 2008, the time of the first comic. Other stories have gone with this and ''Crossed +100'' gives a specific date of July 27, 2008 for when Americans see the "Surprise" as starting. (This origin clashes with other outbreak stories: London is not overrun for several days, the White House is overrun before most of the US, and the Crossed are public before an outbreak in Japan or most of the US.)

The outbreak began in [[Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]: the [[Index case|patient zero]] was a man who had a psychotic breakdown and murdered his family, and the infection spread rapidly from two local policemen to the entire population of the village of Tethersby.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #50&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days, there were reports of infections in [[France]], [[Chad]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]], and the [[United States]]. During the story, government scientist Dr. Chopra pointed out that the British "patient zero" cannot logically be ''the'' patient zero if the infection is appearing so far abroad, and theorizes if the virus is "something in the D.N.A.... the planet's" that has manifested and this is why it doesn't follow any known scientific laws. "Patient Zero" himself was aware of events he could not possibly have seen or heard and saw visions of atrocities he was unaware of, suggesting a [[paranormal]] angle, and refers to it as something that "cleanses".&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #54, #55, and #56&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, indecisiveness by Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] meant that a [[state of emergency]] wasn't declared until after a [[Sky News]] team found and filmed the villagers committing a mass suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #51&lt;/ref&gt; From this point the infection spread rapidly, and the Prime Minister and his staff were moved into a secure bunker guarded by the [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and [[Protection Command|SO1 police officers]] which also doubled as a medical research centre where "Patient Zero" was placed under quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #52-3&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Crossed had overrun most of [[Yorkshire]] and other parts of northern England and [[Scotland]], with smaller outbreaks appearing further south. Under the belated state of emergency, the UK suspended all public transport, airlifted troops back from [[Afghanistan]], and blockaded the [[M1 motorway|M1]] motorway just north of [[Northampton]]; south of there, cordons held and prevented large-scale refugee migration, which could bring more of the infected south.

As the infection appeared worldwide, Pakistani Crossed dropped a nuclear bomb on [[Delhi]], wiping out most if not all of India's government; India's remaining military at least had the wherewithal not to launch a nuclear counterstrike against Pakistan, realizing it would achieve nothing.  Shortly thereafter, Russian Prime Minister (and Acting President following [[Dmitri Medvedev]]'s incapacitation) [[Vladimir Putin]] requested the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] shoot down 40 Crossed-piloted [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95 bombers]] before [[NORAD]] – unable to launch planes due to similar problems – feel obliged to launch nukes. When Gordon Brown contacts the White House, the person answering (implied to be President [[George W Bush]]) is clearly infected, confirming [[Washington D.C.]] has been overrun. A single [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado GR1]] was launched to intercept the Russians and the crew sacrifice themselves to prevent nuclear war breaking out.

After this, the government is evacuated to bunkers, civil authority is superseded by the Armed Forces and orders go out to shut down all nuclear facilities. However, Brown says in the long term they should "hopefully" regain control and that government scientist Dr. Chopra has a chance of finding an answer to the virus. Unfortunately, Brown's advisor – acting without clearing it with the PM – had ordered two of the SAS to torture "patient zero" for information, which led to their infection and "zero" turning fully Crossed. As the bunker is being sealed, it's revealed Chopra is infected and about to butcher the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #56&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the President declared a national state of emergency with the full backing of [[Congress]] whilst forty two state Governors imposed martial law in their home states. [[FEMA]] and the [[National Disaster Medical System]] were activated, but were late in mobilizing. Within days of the outbreak, the power grid had failed in Atlanta, St Louis, Columbus and Chicago, and likely most other cities. NDMS deployed mobile mortuary teams across the eastern seaboard in an attempt to contain the epidemic and private health care centres were federalised. &lt;ref&gt;''Crossed: Badlands'' #81&lt;/ref&gt;

One hundred years after the initial outbreak, as depicted in ''Crossed: +100'', it is revealed that around 2050 AD, Crossed numbers began to drop significantly and eventually regular humans once again outnumbered the infected, though small family groups of Crossed continued to inhabit some areas, breeding new generations by refraining from killing their young. ''Crossed +100'' shows that in the long run, Crossed will even learn to breed and form dysfunctional family units. Human society has somewhat begun to rebuild in the former United States, but is still socially and technically backwards compared to society before "The Surprise", as C-Day is referred to in 2108.

==Series==

===''Crossed'' (Volume One)===
The first story (''Volume One'' in trade) takes place ten months after the outbreak, with flashbacks to those events, as a small group make their way toward Alaska in the belief that its low population before the outbreak will mean there are fewer Crossed to be avoided, and that the Crossed's gleeful bloodlust hampers their ability to look after themselves. However, they encounter a small group of Crossed who have a degree of self-control and subsequently begin a hunt for the survivors.

===''Crossed: Family Values'' (Volume 2)===
In ''Family Values'', the story centers on a religious family who escapes their North Carolinian ranch to survive in a mountain compound led by the protagonist Adaline's father, who, while being a strong leader against the Crossed, is a sexual predator who has routinely raped his daughters.

===''Crossed: 3D''===

''3D'' was written with the 3D effect in mind and is not available in a 2D format.  The story follows SWAT veteran Lt. Hunt MacAvoy as he leads a rescue mission into the middle of Crossed-infected New York City to rescue a stranded doctor.  At 48 pages, the ''3D'' one-shot is about a quarter of the size of one of the collected "Volumes".

===''Crossed: Psychopath'' (Volume 3)===

In ''Psychopath'', the story follows a group of survivors who pick up an injured man, Harold Lorre, who understands the way the Crossed think, and is tracking a specific group of Crossed. Lorre is the titular psychopath, and is killing members of his group of humans as he deems them problematic, passing the deaths off as the grisly acts of Crossed. The Crossed group they are tracking killed a woman Lorre had stalked prior to the outbreak, and subsequently forced a relationship upon her as they survived. After she was turned into a Crossed and killed, Lorre kept a fragment of her breast in a plastic bag.

The first ''Crossed Annual'' spins off from ''Wish You Were Here'', featuring the lifestyle of the psychotic [[Special Boat Service|SBS marine]] Jackson. He appears to be tracking down the scientist who created the Crossed virus, an earlier version of which drove Jackson mad; this is simply a delusion of his, he'd always been psychotic and the 'weapon' does not exist.

===''Crossed: Badlands'' (Volumes 4–17)===

''Badlands'' features shorter story arcs of varying length, by different authors.

Issues #1–3 (''Of the World and Its Becoming'', by Ennis and Burrows) follow a group of United Kingdom survivors traveling across Scotland. As they struggle to stay ahead of a horde of Crossed – hoping that the harsh conditions of the Scottish mountains will wear down the self-destructive Crossed – the leader of the group, Ian, relates his introspection on the purpose of survival when there is no hope. By the end of the third issue, the entire group is killed and/or turned.

In issues #4-#9 (''Homo Superior'', by [[Jamie Delano]] and Leandro Rizzo), the story follows individual survivors in the Everglades – Steve, a former military woman who has become cruel and sadistic after countless traumas in her past; Greg, a jaded family man who lives off the grid to get away from his dreary home life; Leon, a teenage "swamp rat" living at a fortified "base" with his domineering extended family; and the twins Ashley and Ashlynn, who fled the city after the Crossed outbreak began. The survivors eventually meet and band together, only for their individual psychoses to ultimately cause them all to become Crossed, with Steve infecting herself willingly after realizing that she was barely different from the infected in the first place.

In issues #10–13 (''Yellow Belly'', by [[David Lapham]] and Burrows), a teenage survivor named Edmund (nicknamed Yellow Belly for his cowardice) relates his experience of being at a carnival where the clowns and other workers become infected in the early hours of the outbreak, turning fun times into depraved terror. In issue #13, he crosses paths with Harold Lorre, the main character of ''Crossed: Psychopath,'' who encourages Yellowbelly to use the Crossed-infested world as an opportunity to obtain power by force. Ultimately though, he is killed by a biker woman he fled with, when he confided his cowardice that resulted in the death of her sister-in-arms.
 
Issues #14–18 (''The Golden Road'', written by [[David Hine]]), are set just prior to the outbreak, in the town of Stableford, Wisconsin. The town gained the colloquial nickname of "Stumptown" after its residents participated in a mass insurance fraud by "losing" limbs to collect payouts, only to have their scheme exposed by infamous transgressive writer Gideon Welles, who used the town as inspiration. To add insult to injury, Welles built his massive estate, Samarkand, on the outskirts of the area. The story centers around aspiring writer Clooney and his girlfriend Tabitha, who Welles has invited to Samarkand for a writer's retreat. Unfortunately, Welles is a sadist who psychologically breaks down his guests; worse yet, a horde of Crossed has arrived in town by train. Emasculated and humiliated by Welles' debauched sex orgy with his girlfriend and other guests, Clooney uses the Crossed to turn on his fellow writers, leading to all of them being killed or turned by the horde. The only survivor is Philly, the young niece of town cop Lorna; she escapes by boat after being forced to kill her aunt, who was infected when a dead Crossed fell on her.

Issues #19–20 (''Conquers All'', by [[Si Spurrier]] (''Crossed: Wish You Were Here'') and [[Raulo Caceres]] (''Crossed: Psychopath'')) involve Mattias, a former criminal who was turned into one of the Crossed, but still retains a level of self-control and rationality compared to the other Crossed. A paroled enforcer for a local mobster, Mattias fell in love with his parole officer, Serena, and they had a relationship that ended due to the conflict between their duties and their love. In the present, Mattias travels to the police station to find Serena, only to find she had taken her own life days earlier. After a [[ketamine]]-enhanced rampage, he passes out in a parking lot, reawakening with no memory of his search for Serena and repeating his futile journey.

Issues #21–24 (''The Livers'', by David Lapham and Miguel Garrido) rejoin Amanda, the survivor of [[David Lapham]]'s ''Psychopath'' arc. Having been scarred by her experience with Lorre, she no longer trusts anyone, and uses whatever means at her disposal to survive, while paranoia ultimately causes her to kill anyone who takes her in before they can get her. She falls in with The Livers, three survivors that have formed a close bond despite their mutual insanity and occasional cannibalistic tendencies, and finds a new way to survive.

Issues #25–28 (''The Fatal Englishman'', by Ennis and Caceres) are set five years after C-Day. Four British Army soldiers (representing each nation of the United Kingdom) go on a suicide mission to break into [[Porton Down]] and release the biological weapons, hoping it will wipe out the Crossed but leave enough humans alive for Britain to rebuild and go on an offensive war against the infected. Along the way, they become guardians of a group of children and a Catholic priest, with whom the title character shares his wisdom. Eventually, after ensuring the survival of the priest and his flock, they decide against their genocidal plan, instead blowing up the entrance of Porton Down to stop anyone from using its lethal cargo before setting off to make a final stand against the Crossed. However, the leader of the group realizes that he cannot see his friends suffer a grisly end at the hands of the Crossed; thus, he shoots them dead on the way up before confronting a horde of Crossed with nothing but a half-filled pistol. 

Issues #29–32 (''Quisling'', written by [[Christos Gage]]) follow Oliver, an anthropologist and self-proclaimed "survivor" who studies the Crossed while doing whatever it takes to prolong his life. While hiding out with a group of survivors, he observes an imposing axe-wielding member of the Crossed, dubbed "Smokey" for his fireman's garb, noting that he seems to have much greater intelligence that allows him to lead his fellow infected (paralleling the character Big Daddy from ''[[Land of the Dead]]''). After being cornered by Smokey's  band, Oliver betrays his fellow survivors and strikes a deal with the Crossed, helping them hunt other survivors while hoping for a chance to escape or to find a group capable enough to fight back. As his guilt grows and rumors of other "Super-Crossed" reach him (featuring a cameo of the twins from the ''Homo Superior'' arc), Oliver realizes that Smokey is far too dangerous to leave alive; especially when the Crossed reads his journal and assaults a nuclear base for its weapons. Ultimately, Oliver gives his life to stop Smokey's plans, willingly infecting himself to prevent his "partner" from using him any longer. Enraged, Smokey slaughters his band of Crossed before storming out of the base, setting out for Florida in search of more "Super-Crossed" like him.

Issues #33–36 (''Breakdown'', by Lapham and Miguel Ruiz) pick up with Amanda as she is hunting for the Livers and is forced to hide from a religiously-themed tribe of Crossed pursuing the same prey.  She hides in a crawlspace for days, but is devastated when the Crossed bring in her two Liver companions – one captive, and the other infected – and she loses the strength of the delusions they supported. She attempts to re-integrate with another group of survivors, but her growing insanity (represented by hallucinations of Harold Lorre from ''Psychopath'') drives her to kill them all before returning to the crawlspace, determined to remain until she either dies or overcomes her madness.

Issues #37–39 (''American Quitters'', by Spurrier and Rafael Ortiz) follow the odd couple of a stoned out hippy and a hardcore biker traveling cross-country to San Diego to die by the ultimate overdose and while exacting revenge on a rival biker gang leader, respectively. Along the way, they pick up a pregnant Mexican woman fleeing from the drug lord father, trying to reach an island sanctuary off the Baja California peninsula. Ultimately, 'no lesson is learned' as all three of them die in unexpected ways; the biker is overrun by Crossed while overdosing on the ultimate high, the hippy is killed fulfilling the biker's revenge, and the pregnant woman is torn apart by her infected relatives on the island.

Issues #40–43 (''Gore Angels'', by [[David Hine]]) look into the broken mind of an abused girl during the early days of the Crossed epidemic in rural Japan. After being drugged, gang-raped, and humiliated on the Internet while in America, Emiko channels her anger and shame into ''Gore Angels'', an incredibly violent manga sold under a pseudonym with the help of her friend Satoshi. By chance, one of her few friends from America has come to Japan with the instigator of the incident (and the latter's girlfriend) in hopes of finding a resolution to Emiko's pain, but everything goes off the rails when the Crossed begin to emerge...

Issues #44–49 (''Grave New World'', by Daniel Way and Emiliano Urdinola) follow a group of US Coast Guard personnel who hope to outlast the Crossed by setting out on a boat and finding an island to call home. However, taking on a pair of survivors leads to a whole new array of problems, not the least of which include a horde of Crossed pirates and the increasingly erratic behavior of their own Captain.

Issues #50–56 (''The Thin Red Line'', by Ennis and Christian Zanier) reintroduce the four men from ''The Fatal Englishman'', revealing them to have once been security for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]]. The story shows the very beginning of the Crossed outbreak, focusing on Britain's efforts to contain the madness and discover its source; however, they soon realize that the situation is far worse than they could have ever realized.

Issues #57–61 (by Justin Jordan and Georges Duarte) follow Esperanza and Jane, a pair of young women fleeing from Alejandro, Esperanza's Crossed brother, and the horde of infectees at his command. They eventually find safe haven at a woodland camp commanded by Sutter, a hardened survivalist with plans of his own that have little to do with the survival of his campmates...

Issues #62–70 (by Lapham and Francisco Manna) concern Gavin Edward Land, a former police detective seeking vengeance against the people who raped and murdered his daughter. As he works through his list and the Crossed outbreak in San Diego, US, he learns more than he wanted to know after Welles, his final target, seems to have turned a new leaf in the wake of the apocalypse.

Issues #71–74 (''Five Bloody Fingers'', written by David Hine) focus on Uboshita Satoshi, the friend of Emiko briefly seen in ''Gore Angels''. When C-Day breaks out in Japan, Satoshi sets out to find his blood brothers, the Five Bloody Fingers, and help them survive C-Day.  Finding Hazuki, the girl he loves (and one of his blood brothers) turns to be a harder task than he thought, as her father is a [[yakuza]] boss who is also on the lookout for her. The friends find themselves making a stand against the Crossed at a Japanese cosplay convention, where their blood oath may be tested with the relentless threat of the Crossed...assuming that Boss Yamada doesn't first feed them to Usama, his pet lion.

Issues #75–80 (''Homo Tortor'', written by [[Kieron Gillen]]) show two simultaneous narratives.
* The main story concerns the attempts of a survivor group, led by college student Washington, to find a possible cure to the Crossed from the notes of Professor Nelson, a man who believed that a race of early humans similar to the Crossed nearly wiped out humanity 75,000 years ago (See the [[Toba catastrophe theory]]). Hounded by the Crossed at every turn, Washington's group eventually discover Professor Nelson's bunker, containing information about the early humans, which he has dubbed ''Homo tortor'' ("man who tortures").
* The second narrative goes 75,000 years in the past, where a group of early humans, led by the young hunter Lion, are captured by the "Blood Men" (''Homo tortor'') after their village is wiped out; they are subsequently brought to the Blood Men's "city of cities" to fight in an arena against men and giant beasts that the Blood Men had collected. When the "festivities" are cut short by a Crossed outbreak, Lion and his group must attempt to survive the ensuing carnage.
Ultimately, Washington discovers that everything about ''Homo tortor'' was made up by Professor Nelson, who has become Crossed during the outbreak. Along with his similarly-infected assistant (and Washington's college girlfriend) Amy, he wrote the story not as an attempt to falsify history, but as a vision of the society he intends to create with his band of Crossed.

Issues #81–86 (''The Lesser of Two Evils'', by Mike Wolfor) begins shortly after C-Day, with a group of survivors stranded on a partially-collapsed overpass. Although they are safe from the lingering Crossed, things begin to unravel after they are joined by Morgan and Olivia, a pair of women who claim to have survived the Crossed due to their "bible": ''"Surviving D-Day"'' a best-selling "zombie survival guide" novel (similar to [[The Zombie Survival Guide]]).

Issues #87–90 (''Shrink'', by Max Bemis and Fernando Melek) follow two brothers; the straight-laced psychologist Jack and the hedonistic bully Clancy. As Jack and Tiffany (a close friend of his) prepare themselves for the day the Crossed outbreak finally hits their suburban neighborhood, Clancy crashes by and asks Jack for a favor; after willingly infecting himself with the Crossed plague, he has his brother lock him in the basement and attempt to psychoanalyze his Crossed self, hoping that Jack can learn something of importance about the outbreak and its source.

Issues #91–92 (''Anti-Crossed'', by Bemis and German Erramouspe) follow a group of 5 survivors – 4 men and a female author named Leigha – surviving in a barricaded comic book store as they struggle with their depleting morale and growing boredom. It is soon revealed that the male survivors – all massive comic book fans – had taken Leigha hostage early in the outbreak, and have since been periodically raping her at gun point. Due to their growing boredom, the guys make a deal with Leigha; if she writes them an "Anti-Crossed" comic, they will refrain from maltreating her and give her other "privileges". Leigha reluctantly agrees, making a comic that fulfills all of her captor's twisted fantasies, but things may change when two strangers arrive at the store.

Issues #93–99 (by Gage and Fernando Heinz) begins by following a band of survivors led by Cody, an opportunistic man who designed disaster shelters for the elite before stealing one for himself when C-Day hit. His state-of-the-art bunker serves the group well until it comes afoul of Smokey, the "Super-Crossed" last seen in the ''Quisling'' arc. After being driven out and left at Smokey's mercy, Cody saves himself by offering to help Smokey mold the Crossed into a coherent society, advising him on means of controlling the others' bloodlust and promising them fresh victims by breeding uninfected like cattle. When this inevitably fails (in part due to a remorseful Cody sacrificing himself to undo his own work), Smokey seeks out other Super-Crossed like himself, eventually finding the Crossed twins from the ''Homo Superior'' arc.

Issue #100 (also by Gage and Fernando Heinz) follows Smokey and the twins as they attempt to fulfill the former's dream of ending the self-destructive nature of the Crossed. Although they manage to establish a reasonably-functional homestead with dozens of followers, Smokey remains depressed that it is a far cry from the new society he had hoped to create. The children he fathered with the twins also seem to be no more intelligent than regular Crossed, leading Smokey to believe that their species is doomed to die out  within a generation.  Years later, the aging Smokey is betrayed and left for dead by the twins and his own son, now revealed to be a "Super-Crossed" the entire time; the twins explain that they prefer immediate self-indulgence over long-term planning. Smokey survives the attempted assassination by jumping into a river, emerging later and limping off to fight another day.

The final issue, foreshadows the resurgence of human society a century later in ''Crossed: +100'', with Smokey's homestead receiving news of human colonies beginning to re-establish themselves as the feral Crossed die out.

==''Crossed: Wish You Were Here''==

In the [[webcomic]] ''Crossed: Wish You Were Here'' (written by [[Si Spurrier]] and drawn by Javier Barreno (Vol.1) and [[Fernando Melek]] (Vol.2)), former writer "Shaky" (short for [[Shakespeare]]) writes in his journal of life on the island of [[Cava, Orkney|Cava]] off of the coast of Scotland, where he and a handful of other survivors try to have some semblance of society while desperately trying to keep the wandering Crossed at bay.

In the first volume, Shakespeare must deal with the logistics of living on an Cava with his group, under two men Rab and Don with very different leadership styles. Eventually the leaders decide to send out a sortie compiled of random members of the island, reasoning that anyone who wishes to volunteer is too important to lose. Eventually Shaky blackmails one of the leaders into letting him into the sortie, and decides that if he is going to live the rest of his life in the apocalypse, he won't be bored doing it. He feels that the boredom (or having too much time to think about mysteries and the past) could kill him if he doesn't do something about it.

While the sortie is on the mainlands, Shaky quickly and unintentionally becomes one of the two leaders among the group, the other being a schizophrenic but well-trained former military Scotsman named Jackson (the insane protagonist of the first Annual). During this time Shaky sees that the rest of the group is poorly suited to survival – Tabitha, who has shown some romantic interest in him, is fairly competent, but the two other members consist of a cowardly American woman, Selene, who almost continually wails about the situation, and an absent-minded older man who apparently only survives multiple Crossed attacks by luck. They are all being tracked by a figure wrapped in black who was previously shown with Aoileann; the pursuer finds a note left by Shaky and retrieves it.

Starting with the sortie onwards, the narrative alternates between the main story and Shaky's flashbacks to the events that first led him to Cava. Shaky is shown to have been a writer who was in a London café when the infection first hit. After repeated attempts to contact his parents and his fiancée, he finally finds out that they are all either dead or infected. He decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge and drowning. However, he is rescued by a police patrol on a riverboat, the captain assuring him he is now safe. Shortly after, the boat is attacked, the crew all killed or turned, and Shaky surviving only through the heroic last acts of a female member of the Coast Guard. Shaky ends up back on land, wandering alone for a week before he encounters a Crossed child. He cannot run as his pants are down around his ankles, but a group comes along in time to save him, the leader throwing him a gun and allowing him to come when Shaky kills the Crossed himself. He spends the next eight months with a man called the Gamekeeper and his group of survivors. Though the Gamekeeper is extremely resourceful and intelligent, he is also sadistic and ruthless. The survivors dislike him, but he remains in control because he is needed for survival. The group members are slowly killed over time until only Shaky, a college-aged Pakistani man named Ashoke, and a husband and wife couple are left. It is shown that the Gamekeeper used to work for the husband, and in a form of revenge, he does as he pleases with the wife. At this point, Aoileann joins the group, revealed to be a devout and chaste nun. The Gamekeeper begins regularly raping the wife, much to the husband's anguish. The group can see that the Gamekeeper is taken with the nun, and the wife tries to make her the target of his lust. Shaky manages to spoil her plans. The internal discord culminates when the group finds a cache of guns, and the husband decides to kill the Gamekeeper. However, the leader outwits him and kills him instead. Now without her husband, the wife soon hangs herself. Greatly upset at this turn of events, the Gamekeeper begins to distance himself from his own group, only showing up occasionally with food or when a Crossed needs to be killed. Aoileann has a seizure and it is revealed that she has [[epilepsy]]. The group continues on until one night the Gamekeeper attacks Ashoke in order to rape Aoileann. While Ashoke lies unconscious from being strangled, the Gamekeeper cuts an X into Aoileann's face, demanding that she avert her eyes while he rapes her. Shaky walks in on the scene and shoots the Gamekeeper with a shotgun despite the nun's protests, then ties him to a tree. He sets an alarm to go off once every hour, expecting the Crossed to finish what he started. The group continues on their own, though Ashoke has suffered severe mental retardation from the attack.

Back in the present, the sortie runs into another survivors group led by a brutal but devious man named Jasper, and Shaky tells them of his group's "sanctuary" and how if the other group follows his orders, they may come along when his group goes home. Shaky realizes he can only take two of Jasper's group back with him, and plans to weed them out as time goes on. Jackson, disapproving of Shaky's vileness, leaves the group under Shaky's sole care. As Jasper's group's numbers dwindle down, their leader steals their food and disappears. The remaining survivors from both parties come across a military fortress that is surrounded by Crossed and requests medical supplies in exchange for their weapons. The sortie mulls over how to execute the trade with the sea of Crossed blocking their way. Shaky comes up with an idea that requires a volunteer to take on a high-risk mission. Selene volunteers, finally building the nerve to take action and also to speak of her past, in which she had inadvertently caused the death of her husband and two children. Seemingly in atonement, she happily accepts the task of driving a van into the fortress to get the weapons and bring them back. The group successfully distracts the Crossed (the decoys mostly consisting of members of Jasper's former crew) and gets Selene into the base. However, she doesn't reappear when a day passes and it's time for her to return. The group wait for her and continue luring the Crossed a few more times. They're beginning to believe something has happened to her when they hear the sounds of explosions, followed by prolonged gunfire. The noise frightens them. They wait until there is a long period of silence before moving to investigate the fortress. There they find carnage and only one living thing – a Crossed small child, whom they kill. Expecting Selene has died – Shaky's theory is she did so heroically – they load up on weapons and head home.

When the sortie arrives back on Cava, they are met with Jasper who found the island without Shaky's help. During Shaky's absence Jasper planted seeds of doubt against Shaky, stating that Shaky had been leaving a stunning amount of written evidence behind with the location of Cava. The reveal makes Shaky an outcast, both for his actions on the sortie and his leaving evidence of Cava. Tabitha begins to have sex with Shaky while he is in isolation at the other end of the island, but she and one of Jasper's former followers are his only allies. Jasper then starts assuming a greater role within the hierarchy while pushing out Rab and Don. Eventually things reach a flashpoint when Rab, Don, and Shaky decide to push Jasper out. This leads to a confrontation between Shaky and Jasper, with Jasper's antique gun exploding in his hands. Shaky then uses Jasper's unconscious, injured body as bait attempting to lure the Crossed alerted to Cava's presence, but it is foiled when the group of Crossed is seemingly led by an infected Aoileann, who has seemingly instilled them with some level of self-control.

Jackson returns to the group with interesting news. He is accompanied by Selene, who is alive but mentally broken. He states he found her on an island occupied by Crossed, lying inside a circled of lit candles, alone. She'd been holding an empty envelope. Shaky later questions her about what had happened. She seems to snap out of her trance, in which she repeated the same few words over and over. She tells Shaky of how she'd been taken by someone in black. She then wound up living among Crossed, mostly unmolested but having to watch the infected going about their ghastly business. While she watches all these horrifying scenarios, Aoileann repeats the same phrase to her. After she finishes telling her story, she goes back to repeating her programmed message. Shaky realizes this is information about a meeting place.

Shortly after Jasper's death, Tabitha comes to Shaky with news of being pregnant. Shaky decides he has to come up with an idea to keep her safe, but his thoughts are interrupted by an American drift fleet of cruise ships that arrive near Cava to trade supplies. Rocked with the idea that they no longer have to stay on Cava, many of the group consider leaving and joining the drift fleet. Realizing that they wouldn't be in charge anymore, Rab and Don try to convince people to stay on the island which leads to conflict. Shaky decides that Cava is his home, and he won't leave.

Using his weasel-like personality, he convinces the rest of the group that the drift fleet is planning to attack Cava, while at the same time he tells the drift fleet's captain, Nora, that soon Cava will attack the drift fleet. He tells Nora that he will be among the attackers and wishes to secretly help the drift fleet. All he asks in return for this information is for Tabitha and his child to be looked after. During Cava's attack, events are turned into a stalemate by a warned Nora and Don's secret plan to take the fleet's only surviving child hostage. During the confrontation Don is killed by Jackson who joined and led the drift fleet to Cava in the first place after leaving the sortie. As per the agreement Nora takes Tabitha and doesn't sell out Shaky, with no one but Jackson, who is aware of Shaky's vindictive attitude, the wiser that the entire situation was instigated by Shaky for his own benefit. As Jackson leads the remaining Cava residents back to their territory, they spot Aoileann and the Crossed in the hills. Per Shaky's instructions, Jackson fires his rifle at Aoileann, but the bullet is taken by the Crossed covered in black. The dying Crossed is revealed to be Ashoke. In a rage, Aoileann points in the direction of the fleet. Back on Cava the group sees the drift fleet in flames, overrun by Crossed. Shaky and Jackson head off to quickly find and kill Aoileann, who has for some reason walked inland by herself. During the hunt Jackson is injured by a trap, and decides to kill himself rather than have all of his military knowledge be added to Aoileann's group of infected. Shaky hands him his weapon with only one bullet, in case Jackson believes it would be a good final act to kill Shaky as well.

The flashbacks also continue, with Shaky and Aoileann trying to take care of the handicapped Ashoke, who it turns out is battling a drug addiction. At this point, Shaky has fallen in love with Aoileann, but she remains devoutly chaste despite his advances. Eventually, Shaky decides that he cannot risk keeping Ashoke with them, as his mental retardation is a liability. He leads him off during the night and abandons him, telling the nun that he must have wandered off and they cannot spend time searching for him. Moving on, Aoileann and Shaky find a vicar surviving in a church attic with a group of children, and join him for several days. Shaky continues his advances towards Aoileann.

Back on Cava, the infected drift fleet crashes into Cava spilling infected all across the island. Among their numbers is an infected Tabitha, who finds her way to Shaky's residence and is looking at a picture she drew of him. Shaky himself walks in and they begin to communicate for a moment before she is shot and killed by a Cava resident, whom Shaky kills in turn. Despite losing most of the island and several of their people, Cava is able to fend off the drift fleet's numbers. Unfortunately, however Aoileann's group surrounds Cava shortly after, trapping the few survivors on what's left of the island. Shaky decides there's little choice but to meet with Aoileann per the instructions she brainwashed into Selene.

After Shaky's attempts to talk to Aoileann only result in more losses, the group decides it's best to try and escape at night using a refiner ship from the drift fleet. Rab breaks Shaky's ankles on Cava telling him that he is just too big of a risk to bring along with them, as people tend to die around him. Before they can escape, Rab's group comes face to face with Aoileann's, and see for the first time how truly outnumbered and out-gunned they are. While Rab's group prepares to escape, Shaky speaks to Aoileann over a radio and realizes that they both have questions for one another. Shaky realizes that the situation at Cava has reached a flash point, and he is playing a dangerous game by asking Aoileann questions. If he asks an emotionally charged question or answers a question in a way that could make Aoileann appear weak, her gang will kill her and swarm the island. Suddenly a follower of Aoileann attacks her and forces the Crossed group to attack Cava. Shaky, attempting to use himself as bait to lure the Crossed away from Rab's group, crashes a boat on a small rock, making himself easy prey, but the new Crossed leader sees through the ploy and decides to continue hunting Rab's group. Rab, thinking ahead, had planted explosives on his vessel, and Selene sacrifices herself by detonating the trap, killing most of the infected as the rest of Rab's group escaped on a second hidden vessel.

The final few flashbacks continue with Aoileann  giving in and breaking her vows. The two start having sex in the attic while the vicar is away. Aoileann begins having a seizure which Shaky ignores. The vicar returns to warn of Crossed outside and tries to separate Shaky and Aoileann. Desperate to climax Shaky shoves him away causing him to fall and be knocked out. Shaky yells out in pleasure and is heard by several Crossed. The Crossed enter the church and slaughter the children, who are playing downstairs. Shaky runs down to help, but is too late. He then realizes with horror that some newly-Crossed children have made it into the attic. However, he is too cowardly to help and sits back in tears as he lets the Crossed infect the vicar and Aoileann. He escapes the church, and finds members of Cava who take him to the island. Shaky remarks that the entire situation is his fault.

The next morning Shaky is still stranded on the rock when Aoileann returns. Shaky finishes his diary saying that he realizes that every rule and regulation on Cava was simply an attempt to regulate the madness of the world, and is really no different to what humans do when they write stories. Shaky claims that the stories are only there to make sense of a world of chaos, and that every breath, page, and word are just "doomed islands briefly holding out against the dark". Shaky gives Aoileann his diary which she rips apart page by page and throws it into the wind. Shaky then decides he wants an ending to his story.

From afar, Rab is watching these events and relaying it to the three surviving children of his group. Shaky then allows Aoileann to infect him while making love on the rock. Both then jump into the cold, strong current outside of Cava to die together. As the children plead to see what's happening, Rab states that sometimes it's enough to just be told a story instead of living it. Rab concludes that Cava is no longer safe, and leads the remaining survivors away to start anew elsewhere.

A six issue series called ''Crossed: +100'', written by [[Alan Moore]] and with art by [[Gabriel Andrade]], debuted in December 2014.  It follows a group of humans 100 years after the outbreak.  After running across a group of Crossed, they find that the infected have begun to multiply again after having almost disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/18/alan-moore-takes-cult-horror-comic-crossed-future |title=Alan Moore takes cult horror comic Crossed into the future |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=18 September 2014 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/09/avatar-press-announces-crossed-100-an-ingenious-future-set-series-by-alan-moore-and-gabriel-andrade/ |title=Avatar Press Announces Crossed +100 – An Ingenious Future-Set Series By Alan Moore And Gabriel Andrade |last=Shannon |first=Hannah Means |date=15 September 2014 |website=[[Bleeding Cool]] |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/alan-moore-returns-monthly-comics-732922 |title=Alan Moore Returns to Monthly Comics With 'Crossed: +100' |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |date=15 September 2014 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=55545 |title=Alan Moore to Write "Crossed: +100" For Avatar |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=15 September 2014 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hundred years on from the initial outbreak, it is revealed that around 2050 AD, Crossed numbers began to drop significantly and eventually regular humans once again outnumbered the infected, though small family groups of Crossed continued to inhabit some areas, breeding new generations by refraining from killing their young.  Again, this was simply the result of natural selection:  Crossed populations that attacked their own children died out from old age eventually, while only those that didn't would still survive a hundred years later.  The Crossed started diminishing in numbers by 2050 because by forty years later, any adults infected in the initial outbreak (i.e. 20 or older) were starting to get too old to survive such a violent lifestyle (against both Crossed, the uninfected, and the elements).  Teenagers and children infected in the initial outbreak were not strong enough to compete against adult Crossed at the time, so they didn't tend to survive forty years of constant fighting.  

The Crossed infection is stated to have spread around the planet on July 27, 2008, an event commonly called "the Surprise".  By 2108, human society has somewhat begun to rebuild in the former United States, but is still socially and technically backwards compared to society before the Surprise.  The society of the human survivors has drastically changed after a hundred years, with slang derived from a post-Crossed world.  In the Tennessee region shown in ''Crossed: +100'', major religions such as [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] have died out, and most people are irreligious, though there are a few survivor enclaves that still practice [[Islam]] (the comic creators stated that one of the reasons the story was set in Tennessee is due to the large Muslim population [[Islamic Center of Murfreesboro|in present-day Murfreesboro]]; other large Muslim populations in the United States are concentrated in major metropolitan areas, which thus stood lower chance of surviving the Crossed epidemic). Few survivors living in 2108 have even seen a Crossed person, to the point that many younger people mockingly imitate the Crossed with face paint, and chasing each other pretending to be Crossed is a childhood game.

In 2108, a group of survivors from the rebuilt settlement at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] (called "Chooga") make a horrifying discovery through the diary entries of Beau Salt, an infamous serial killer (known as the "Phonebook Killer") who was infected on C-Day.  Because Salt was already homicidally insane and had no restrictions on his impulses, the Crossed virus did not significantly change him (perhaps because his psychopathic brain structure was already significantly altered from normal). Salt considered the new world of the Crossed to be a paradise, but he also had the foresight to realize that it would be difficult to sustain indefinitely – given that many Crossed will rape and eat their own small children.  Salt therefore began self-consciously conducting conditioning experiments on other Crossed, to weed out the uncontrollable ones and actively select for the ones that could display enough restraint to follow long term plans.  Salt also came to realize that because the Crossed were constantly fighting the uninfected, the survivors were becoming battle-hardened and difficult for the Crossed to fight; therefore, he prepared a plan which would take ''decades'' to reach fruition (an explicit reference to the [[Seldon Plan]] in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation Series]]), in which the Crossed would basically let the uninfected survivor enclaves "lay fallow" for a full generation at a time; over time, the uninfected would get soft, unused to a daily fight for survival against the Crossed. Salt even planned out that the return attacks of the Crossed against survivor enclaves would take place on the exact day of the 100 year anniversary of the Surprise, in July 2108. Chaos unfolds as the uninfected humans seek to protect the remaining settlements in the east coast area of the US, while trying to uncover the conspiracy laid out by Salt a hundred years earlier.

{{Buddhism}}
The '''''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''''' (Pali; Sanskrit: ''Dharmacakrapravartana Sūtra''; English: ''The Setting in Motion of the [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Dharma]] Sutta'' or ''Promulgation of the Law Sutta'') is a [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist text]] that is considered by Buddhists to be a record of the first teaching given by [[Gautama Buddha]] after he attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. The main topic of this sutta is the [[Four Noble Truths]], which refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} in a formulaic expression.{{sfn|Norman|2003}} This sutta also refers to the Buddhist concepts of the [[Middle Way]], [[impermanence]], and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].

== Definitions ==
''Dhamma'' (Pāli) or ''dharma'' (Sanskrit) can mean a variety of things depending on its context;{{refn|group=note|For instance, in the context of the objects of mindfulness, ''dhamma'' refers to "mental objects" (see, [[Satipatthana Sutta]]).}} in this context, it refers to the Buddha's teachings or his "truth" that leads to one's liberation from suffering.  ''Cakka'' (Pāli) or ''cakra'' (Sanskrit) can be translated as "wheel."  The ''[[Dharmacakra|dhammacakka]]'', which can be translated as "Dhamma-Wheel," is a Buddhist symbol referring to  Buddha's teaching of the [[Noble Eightfold Path|path]] to enlightenment.  ''Pavattana'' (Pāli) can be translated as "turning" or "rolling" or "setting in motion."{{refn|group=note|English translations of this sutta's full title include:

==Buddhist understanding of the sutra==
According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' is the first teaching given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha attained enlightenment and liberation while [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditating]] under the [[Bodhi Tree]] by the Nerañjarā river in [[Bodh Gaya]]. Afterwards, he remained silent for forty-nine days. The Buddha then journeyed from Bodhgaya to Sarnath, a small town near the sacred city of [[Varanasi]] in central India. There he met his five former companions, the ascetics with whom he had shared six years of hardship. His former companions were at first suspicious of the Buddha, thinking he had given up his search for the truth when he renounced their ascetic ways. But upon seeing the radiance of the Buddha, they requested him to teach what he had learned. Thereupon the Buddha gave the teaching that was later recorded as the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', which introduces fundamental concepts of Buddhist thought, such as the [[Middle Way]] and the [[Four Noble Truths]].{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=10-12}}{{sfn|Dhamma|1997|pp=22-24}}{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 163-169}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=25}}{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1991|loc=Kindle Locations 1822-1884}}{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=6-8}}

==Development of the sutra==

===Retaining the oldest teachings===
Modern scholars agree that the teachings of the Buddha were passed down in an oral tradition for approximately a few hundred years after the passing of the Buddha; the first written recordings of these teachings were made hundreds of years after the Buddha's passing. According to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}&lt;!--**START OF NOTE**--&gt;{{refn|See:

Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are an important topic in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=}}{{refn|According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished regarding the possibility to retain knowledge of the oldest Buddhism:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# "Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;"{{refn|group=subnote|Well-known proponents of the first position are:&lt;br&gt;* [[A.K. Warder]]. According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out,{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}} namely the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]]. According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}}&lt;br&gt;* [[Richard Gombrich]]: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius. By "the main edifice" I mean the collections of the main body of sermons, the four Nikāyas, and of the main body of monastic rules."{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}}}
# "Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"{{refn|group=subnote|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson: "While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historic Buddha."{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}
# "Cautious optimism in this respect."{{refn|group=subnote|Well-known proponent of the third position are:&lt;br&gt;* J.W. de Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}&lt;br&gt;* Johannes Bronkhorst: "This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek may find, even if no success is guaranteed."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=vii}}&lt;br&gt;* Donald Lopez: "The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct."{{sfn|Lopez|1995|p=4}}}}|group=note}}

===Development of the sutra===
According to Bronkhorst this "first sermon" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}{{refn|group=note|The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' is best-known from the [[Pāli Canon]], [[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyutta Nikāya]] chapter 56, sutta 11. In the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] there are numerous editions of this sutra from a variety of different schools in ancient India, including the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], [[Dharmaguptaka]], and [[Mahīśāsaka]], as well as an edition translated as early as 170 by the early Parthian missionary [[An Shigao]]. Parallel texts can be found in other early Buddhist sources as well, such as the Sarvāstivādin ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'' and the [[Lokottaravāda|Lokottaravādin]] ''[[Mahāvastu]]''.&lt;ref group=web&gt;Anandajoti (2010), "Introduction," retrieved 18 May 2010 from http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Earliest-Discourses/index.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the Vinaya texts, and in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=69}} when the "vision of Dhamma"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=1846}} arises in him: "whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."{{refn|group=note|Translation Bhikkhu Bodhi (2000), ''Samyutta Nikaya'', SN 56.11, p.1846. See also Anderson (2001), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.69.}} Yet, in the ''Ariyapariyesanā Sutta'' ("The Noble Search", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included,{{refn|group=note|MN 26.17 merely says "[']This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for striving.'{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi Majjhima Nikaya 36 then continuous with the extreme ascetic practices, which are omitted in MN 26.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1216, note 403}} In verse 18, the Buddha has attained Nirvana, being secured from bondage by birth, ageing, sickness and death, referring to the truths of dependent origination and "the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259-260}}}} and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the "first sermon" which include the four truths, such as the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', omit this instruction, showing that
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the subsequent destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|According to Cousins, Anderson misunderstands Norman in this respect, but does "not think that this misunderstanding of Norman's position critically affects Anderson's thesis. Even if these arguments do not prove that the four truths are definitely a later insertion in the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, it is certainly possible to take the position that the sutta itself is relatively late."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}}}} According to Bronkhorst, the "twelve insights" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term "prajna" for the more specific "four truths".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=106}}

===The "essence" of Buddhism===
According to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} According to Richard Gombrich,
{{quote|Of course we do not really know what the Buddha said in his first sermon [...] and it has even been convincingly demonstrated{{refn|group=note|Gombrich includes an end note here citing "Norman 1982" (.{{sfn|Norman|1982}}}} that the language of the text as we have it is in the main a set of formulae, expressions which are by no means self-explanatory but ''refer'' to already established doctrines. Nevertheless, the compilers of the [[Pali Canon|Canon]] put in the first sermon what they knew to be the very essence of the Buddha's Enlightenment.{{sfn|Gombrich|2002|p=61}}}}

Yet, the understanding of what exactly constituted this "very essence" also developed over time. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}  "Liberating insight" came to be defined as "insight into the four truths," which is presented as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was "enlightened" and liberated,{{refn|group=note|"Enlightenment" is a typical western term, which bears its own, specific western connotations, meanings and interpretations.{{sfn|Cohen|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}} as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}} The four truths were superseded by ''[[pratityasamutpada]]'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the [[Anatta|non-existence of a substantial self or person]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}}

According to Anderson, a long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an "overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=131}} The sutras form a network or matrix, which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"|Gethin: "The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening. [...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} Within this network, "the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but are a part of "the entire ''dhamma'' matrix."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} The four noble truths are be set and learnt in that network, learning "how the various teachings intersect with each other,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86-87}} and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}} According to Anderson,
{{quote|There is no single way of understanding the teachings: one teaching may be used to explain another in one passage; the relationship may be reversed or altered in other talks.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}}}}

'''Dionis de Lys''' or Lis (born-16th century) was a Flemish conquistador in the service of the [[Spanish monarchy]].

'''Düzdidil Kadın''' ({{lang-ota|دزددل قادین}}; {{circa}} 1825{{snd}}18 August 1845) was the third wife of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early life==
Düzdidil Kadın was born in 1825{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=280}} in [[North Caucasus]]. Born as Ayşe Dişan, she was a member of [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]] family, Dişan. Her father was Şıhım Bey Dişan and her mother was an [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazian]] princess belonging to Shervashidze.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=51}} 

Upon Yahya Bey's decision, Ayşe had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where she entrusted to the imperial harem, along with her nanny Cinan Hanım, and a maid Emine Hanım. Here her name according to the costum of the Ottoman court was changed to Düzdidil.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=51}}

==Marriage==
Düzdidil married Abdulmejid in 1839. She was given the title of "Üçüncü Kadın".{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=206}} She had been presented to him by his mother. She was cited as remarkable for her beauty, and not less for her haughty and wayward disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles White|title=Three years in Constantinople; or, Domestic manners of the Turks in 1844|publisher=London, H. Colburn|year=1846|pages=10|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 1840, she gave birth to the couple's first child, Mevhibe Sultan in the Old Çırağan Palace. The princess died on 9 February 1841.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=217}} On 
13 October 1841, she gave birth to twins, Neyyire Sultan{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=599}} and Münire Sultan in the Old Beşiktaş Palace. The princesses died two years later on 18 December 1843.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=220, 225}} On 17 August 1843, she gave birth to her fourth child, [[Cemile Sultan]] in the Old Beylerbeyi Palace.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=221}}
On 23 February 1845, she gave birth to her fifth child, Samiye Sultan{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=599}} in the Topkapı Palace. The princess died two months later on 18 April 1845.{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=225}}

==Death==
Düzdidil had fallen victim to the epidemic of tuberculosis then raging in Istanbul. A luxuriously decorated prayer book was commissioned around 1844 for her. As was fitting for her position, the prayer book was lavishly ornate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Helga|last=Rebhan|title=Die Wunder der Schöpfung: Handschriften der Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek aus dem islamischen Kulturkreis|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2010|pages=79|isbn=978-3-880-08005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died on 18 August 1845, and was buried in the mausoleum of the imperial ladies at the [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|New Mosque]] [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Uluçay|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=280}} Cemile Sultan was only two years old when Düzdidil died. She was adopted by another of Sultan Abdulmejid's wives, [[Perestu Kadın]],{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2008|p=599}} who was also the adoptive mother one of her half brothers, Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].{{sfn|Brookes|2010|p=279}}

After her death, her nanny, Cinan Hanım, went back to Caucasus,{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=52 n. 23}} while her maid, Emine Hanım, served in the imperial harem for sometime, after which she married and left the palace.{{sfn|Açba|2007|p=51 n. 22}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15257">{{Distinguish|Fernão Pires de Andrade}}
'''Fernán Pérez de Andrade''' or '''Fernán Peres d'Andrade''' (? – 1397) was a Galician knight. His birthdate is unknown but is presumably before 1330.  His death date fell between July 28 and August 21, 1397.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the Archbishop of Santiago to the prior of Caaveiro, where he counts the knight as dead on 21 August&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth son of Ruy Freyre de Andrade and Inés Rodriguez de Sotomayor, he belonged to a family associated with the knights of the [[Orden de la Banda]] (Order of the Sash) since its founding by [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] in 1332. He was married to Sancha Rodríguez,&lt;ref&gt;The author Jose A. Garcia Ledo adds a previous wife, before Sancha, called Tareyga de Guzman, but she doesn't show in any document as such&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of Aras Pardo and Tareyga Affonso, and with whom he was known to have had two daughters, Maria and Inés Fernández, nuns of the [[Order of Saint Clare]], and a son (whose name is unconfirmed, though some sources mention Nuño) who died at an early age, leaving the family without a direct male heir.&lt;ref&gt;His nephew Don Pedro Fernández, son of his brother Don Juan Freyre de Andrade, inherited the notorious family state&lt;/ref&gt;

Pires de Andrade was a knight always ready for battle who enjoyed hunting, poetry and chivalric books, as befitted the tastes of those days. He was a sponsor and protector of the Catholic Church, though it is well documented that he usurped the Church's properties, and abused his power in his domains when it suited him.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He sided with [[Henry II of Castile]] {Enrique de Trastámara} in Henry's confrontation with his half-brother [[Peter of Castile|Peter]] in the last years of the feud, until Henry's assassination in Monteil.

After the king's death, and the accession of Henry II to the throne, Fernán Pérez de Andrade continued to be influential with the monarchy and reached the status of a Lord in [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]].

==Andrade==

"Andrade" seems to be an old toponym of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin, according to D. Isidro Millán, but it is unknown if it referred to a village or a parish. The name of the place was incorporated into the family name, and the name is mentioned in several documents dating from the twelfth century. It is possible that this name was used by unrelated individuals or families residing in the area, as is common today.

The first documented Andrades were vassals of the [[Traba family]], along with some other [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]] family. They remained in the background of the social scene until the fourteenth century, when their influence in the areas of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], [[Vilalba]] and [[Pontedeume]] increased to the point of becoming of the most powerful Galician family of the time.

With Don Fernán Pérez de Andrade o Bóo (o Boo meaning "the Good" in Galician language) - the fourth to have that name - the family achieved greater importance during the reign of Henry II. Their successor descendants continued this increase, being Fernando de Andrade (1477–1540) the one to achieve Count status, as the first Conde de Andrade; the second title of count of Vilalba, [[Count of Andrade]] is currently in possession of the [[House of Alba]].

Most genealogies compiled during the 19th and 20th century connect the Andrades to the most important families as Fróilaz-Traba; these are, however, only weak connections, and are contradictory or obscure connections, as yet unconfirmed. To further muddy the water, there are several legendary stories relating the Andrades to the knights that reached the Iberian Peninsula in the retinue of [[Mendo de Rausona]], brother of the last Lombard king, around the eighth century.

[[File:Castelo-de-Andrade-graf.png|x160px|frame|Castle of Andrade]]

==Fernán Pérez de Andrade, knightly atmosphere and loyalty to Pedro I==

Fernán Perez de Andrade IV descended from a family of hidalgos and knights, vassals of a lord whom they served with arms.
This family environment certainly influenced Fernán Pérez de Andrade; he was always ready for battle, but had a cautious and observing character in tumultuous times, with minimal romanticism. Two of his grandfather's brothers, Pedro and Fernan (the third) Perez de Andrade, were put to death in the [[Castillo de la Rocha]] in 1320; this demonstrated to the young Fernán how those were times in which it might be prudent to put caution aside and move swiftly to align oneself with the stronger parties.

The Andrades were lords of a small estate, and, as most of the lords in the peninsula, aspired to broaden their domains and promote their lineage in the service of their overlord, Don Pedro Fernández de Castro. [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]], an enthusiast of the chivalric code, fostered knights as pillars of his society, considering it necessary to bring order to his realm, and honour (and praise) to his subjects. As a result of this belief, he created the Orden de la Banda—first secular order of the West—and reinstated the practice of investiture of Knights, creating them himself by drawing on the vassals of his kingdom. Pedro Fernández de Castro invested thirteen of his vassals as Knights of the Orden de la Banda on September 10, 1332. Among them were Nuño and Rui Freyre de Andrade, uncle and father of Fernán Pérez de Andrade (IV). (Libro de Ordenamiento de Banda-[[Crónica de Alfonso XI]]).

Fernán Pérez de Andrade, listed as squire in several documents of this time, obtained his first concessions in 1356 from the hands of Henry, by then [[Count of Trastámara]]. He was married to Sancha Rodríguez, only legitimate daughter of Aras Pardo, who was also knight of the Orden de la Banda, which augmented his social status. This served as the beginning of his career, which had been hindered by his partisan support for Henry against Henry's half-brother, Peter I, for the throne.

In the beginning of the war between the brothers, circumstances were confusing and unclear. Many knights sided for the mutinous, and Fernán Pérez seems to be one of them, following the allegiances of his natural overlord, Don Fernando Ruíz de Castro, who sided against Peter since the early stages of the confrontation.

Later, Fernando Ruíz de Castro switched allegiance to King Peter. Fernán Pérez de Andrade's fate is unclear, although Henry's exile between 1356 and 1566 makes it unlikely that Fernán supported Henry wholly. While Fernán Pérez fought beside King Peter in his campaign against Aragon in 1357, some authors cite his support for Henry, although Henry had fled to Asturias from Ferrol in 1356.

During the years leading up to 1362, Fernán Pérez achieved considerable wealth, largely due to inheritances from his family, lands and other mercies received from Henry, Count of Trastámara, and his marriage with Sancha. He also obtained an important privilege&lt;ref&gt;Privilege of Murviedo, thru which he receives the villages of Pontedeume and Vilalba&lt;/ref&gt; from King Peter in 1364, which increased his estates considerably, therefore strengthening his feudal power.

==Change of loyalty and the events of Montiel==

Fernán Pérez later sided with Enrique, Peter seeming to have lost the war. Fernan probably fought by Henry's side previously in the [[Battle of Nájera]] in 1367 but few accounts remain of his achievements or of the battle's aftermath. Two years later, on the night of 22 or 23 March 1369, King Peter died in [[Montiel]], in an act of treachery by his half-brother Henry. Several knights were involved, possibly including Fernán Pérez de Andrade though this cannot be demonstrated.

Henry's troops marched alongside those of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], French knight and leader of the [[free company|free companies]] (''Compañías Blancas'') which arrived from France. The besieged King Henry tried to negotiate his escape with Bertrand du Guesclin, and escorted by two of his men, went to the tent of the Frenchman, where Henry happened to be. It is not certain whether it was Bertrand himself who called Henry, or it was another knight that learned Henry was trying to flee the scene of the siege. Whatever the reason for Henry's presence in Bertrand's tent, Henry and Peter engaged in hand to hand combat. Some authors say one of the knights present helped Henry by restraining Peter, but it seems unlikely that Bertrand du Guesclin was involved in this murder beyond the fact that it happened in his tent, as his reputation for bravery and honour had been proven in the past and assisting in Peter's death would be inconsistent with this.
 
Several say&lt;ref&gt;Bartolome Sagrario Molina y Frey Felipe de Gandara&lt;/ref&gt; that the treacherous restraint of Peter, meant to be involved in one to one fight, inspired the well-known quote in Spain {{lang|es|"Ni quito ni pongo rey, pero ayudo a mi señor"}} ("I'm not deposing nor proposing a King, but I am helping my lord") is more in line with Fernán Pérez's attitude, than with that of Bertrand du Guesclin, whose "my lord" wouldn't help Henry, but rather the King of France. All the copious endowments and benefits enjoyed by Fernán after the death of king Peter, could very well be in payment for the well timed help inside the tent.

Regardless of the lack of irrefutable proof of the level of Fernán's involvement in King Peter's death, documents of the time would seem to indicate his guilty remorse, which might indicate proof of this.

==Social progress and new fights==

Subsequently, Fernán Pérez acted as a great lord, and it is likely that he was a knight at this time, probably having been knighted between 1369 and 1371. He began constructing the [[Castle of Nogueirosa]], confronting the prior of the monastery of Sobrado to whom the lands surrounding the castle belonged. Fernán Pérez acted without scruples, inspiring gear according to the chronicles, and letting his violent character show. He permanently abandoned the pre-existing family castle to rule his domain from the new Castle of Nogueirosa.

The wars had not ended [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. After Henry ([[Henry II of Castile]]) rose to the throne, several "petristas", or knights favouring Peter, offered the throne to [[Fernando de Portugal]]. The old petrista [[Fernando Ruiz de Castro]] is reported as the instigator behind this, as his enmity towards Henry continued even after Peter's death.

Henry, hearing of these maneuvers, returned to Galicia with [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] and other knights, Fernán Pérez de Andrade among them. Together, they forced don Fernando back to Portugal. The brother of Fernán Pérez, [[Nuño Freyre]], who was Master of the  [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] supported the cause of the Portuguese, so on being defeated had to leave Galicia.

The war ended during 1371 and 1373 with several treaties in which Fernando Ruíz de Castro was exhorted to exile in [[Baiona, Pontevedra|Baiona]]. During this period, Fernán Pérez received several more grants of land, and became lord of the villages of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]], [[Pontedeume]] and Vilalba, with rights over those villages that until then only were for the king himself. Fernán Pérez was the right hand man of King Henry in Galicia, to the point that he was appointed to make all the preparations for the wedding of Henry's son, Fadrique with [[Beatrice of Portugal]].

In 1371, he was appointed Governor of [[A Coruña]]. In 1384, he took part in the dynastic clash between [[John I of Castile]] and [[John I of Portugal]]. In 1386 he fought [[John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]] in a new dynastic war in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and he defended A Coruña, although it is unclear whether he defended the city or turned it over to John of Gaunt. The war ended with the marriage of Catalina, daughter of the duke of Lancaster and granddaughter of  [[Peter I of Castile]], Peter the Cruel to Henry (to be [[Henry III of Castile|Henry III]]), and Fernán Pérez regained control of A Coruña.

Fernan reached his "social zenith" around 1391, when after his first wife's death, he had already remarried to [[Constanza Moscoso]], of an important family of Galician knights, which helped bolster his good social standing.

Fernán Pérez de Andrade held several royal commissions in public office until the end of his life, and left behind a bigger patrimony than that received from his ancestors, placing his lineage as one of the most prominent of the Galician landscape.

==Some works==

Don Fernán Pérez de Andrade was an educated man, by the standards of knighthood of the day, and was concerned with his reputation, both at the time and in future. To indicate his power and wealth, he developed several castles in his lands. He also worried about his name being important among the lineages among the others later in time, and so he commissioned civil works and religious buildings that still stand today.

The later public works included seven bridges, of which three still stand, one over the river Tambre, three meters wide and with a single [[ogival arch]], another over the river [[Eume]] which spanned 913 meters and was known to have 79 arches, large enough to contain on its span a hospital with twelve beds and a chapel. Additionally, the [[Castle of Nogueirosa]] survives partially, and the Homage Tower of the old [[castillo de Andrade]] which is 12 meters wide and stands 18 meters tall. Fernan also sponsored several churches, including the {{Interlanguage link multi|Iglesia de San Francisco (Betanzos)|es|3=Iglesia de San Francisco (Betanzos)|lt=Church of San Francisco}} and [[Santa María de Azougue]] in [[Betanzos]], and he sponsored too the foundations of [[San Pantaleon de Cabanas]], [[Santa Maria de Cabanas]] and [[San Paulo de Riobarba]].

==Conclusions==

Fernán Pérez de Andrade was a knight who lived by the standards of his time: he followed the knightly model though adjusting it to his own interests. Even though he was given the nickname of “o Bóo”, Galician for "The good one", we must not overlook his abusive behaviour and lack of scruples, and his talent for siding with the winning party in a way that benefited him. He is remembered nonetheless as a great sponsor and a loyal knight of Enrique, being the first knight of the family to attain Lord status, promoting a lineage that would later reach Count status, as the Counts of Andrade.

'''George Francis Stephens''' (1859–1935), known as '''Frank Stephens''', was an American [[sculptor]], political activist and co-founder of a utopian [[Georgism|single-tax]] community in [[Arden, Delaware]].

==Early life, education and family==
Stephens was born December 28, 1859 in [[Rahway, New Jersey]], to Henry Louis Stephens and Charlotte Ann Wevil.&lt;ref name=genealogy&gt;{{cite web |title=Descendants of Henry Lewis Stephens and Charlotte Ann Wevill |url=http://www.wargs.com/family/0014.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly attended [[Rutgers College]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], and entered the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (PAFA) in 1875,&lt;ref name=Autobiography&gt;{{cite web |title=Arden: the architecture and planning of a Delaware utopia |

where he studied under [[Thomas Eakins]] at various times between 1879 and 1885. He served as Eakins' teaching assistant beginning in 1880, and married Eakins' sister Caroline "Caddie" Eakins on June 14, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Eakins revealed |author=Adams, Henry |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had three children, Margaret, Donald, and Roger.  Caroline died after giving birth in 1889. Stephens' second marriage was to Elenor Getty on November 29, 1905; they had 10 children.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;

==Art career==
Following art school, Stephens formed a [[Philadelphia]] decorative arts business with classmates [[Colin Campbell Cooper|Colin Campbell Cooper, Jr.]], Jesse Godley, and Walter J. Cunningham. He worked for several years on the sculpture of [[Philadelphia City Hall]],&lt;ref name=Autobiography/&gt; and was an instructor in modeling at several art schools, including the [[Drexel Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Philadelphia Sketch Club - Archives &amp; Permanent Collection |url=http://www.sketchclub.org/PSC_ArchColl.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202213533/http://sketchclub.org/PSC_ArchColl.html |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Philadelphia Sketch Club]] from 1881 until his death in 1935.&lt;ref name=Autobiography/&gt;

===Accusations against Eakins===
On February 9, 1886, Stephens accused brother-in-law Thomas Eakins of sexual misconduct with his PAFA students and with his deceased sister Margaret.  The charges ignited [[Art Students' League of Philadelphia#Loincloth incident|such a controversy]] that Eakins was forced to resign from PAFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Revenge of Thomas Eakins |author=Kirkpatrick, Sydney D. |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2006 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens, his cousin Charles Stephens, and [[Thomas Anshutz]], all PAFA instructors, next took their accusations to the Philadelphia Sketch Club: "We hereby charge Mr. Thom&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; Eakins with conduct unworthy of a gentleman &amp; discreditable to this organization &amp; ask his expulsion from the club."&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen A. Foster and Cheryl Leibold, ''Writing About Eakins'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; A committee investigated, concluding that: "Eakins has used his position as an artist and his authority as a teacher to commit certain trespasses on common decency and good morals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sketchclub.org/PSC_ArchColl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202213533/http://sketchclub.org/PSC_ArchColl.html |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His honorary membership in the club was revoked.

The charges of sexual misconduct and incest were unproven,&lt;ref&gt;Henry Adams, ''Eakins Revealed'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; but Eakins's personal reputation was ruined, something from which he never totally recovered.

==Single-tax movement==
Stephens was influenced by the theories of [[Henry George]], who argued in his 1879 publication ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' for a more equitable distribution of wealth, through a [[Georgism|single tax]] levied on the actual value of land irrespective of improvements a person might make. George platformed on this philosophy in his 1886 New York City mayoral bid, and despite losing was successful enough for a subsequent run. Stephens joined his campaign in 1895.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgotten Writings of Arden's Frank Stephens |author=Shields, Jerry |publisher=Collecting Delaware Books |url=http://jnjreid.com/cdb/stephens.html#forgot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens first came to [[Delaware]] along with [[Will Price]], a Philadelphia architect, in 1895-1896 during the single-tax campaign to win political control of the state. The single-taxers hoped that by gaining control of a small political entity they could put their principles into action and prove the legitimacy of Henry George's aims. Although the campaign failed — many activists (including Stephens) were jailed — but Price and Stephens did not give up their dream of creating a utopian community.&lt;ref name=Shields/&gt;

==Founding Arden, Delaware==
With the financial help of [[Joseph Fels]], a wealthy soap manufacturer and single-tax proponent, Stephens purchased the Derrickson property, a {{convert|162|acre|km2}} farm six miles north of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] on June 12, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William L. Price |author=Thomas, George E. and Robert Venturi |year=2000  |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price and Stephens named their newly founded community after the idyllic Forest of Arden from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[As You Like It]]'', and adopted "You are welcome hither" (a line from ''[[King Lear]]'') as the community motto because they wanted the village to be a place open to people of all economic levels and political views.&lt;ref name=Shields/&gt;

Along with their economic philosophy, Price and Stephens shared a belief in the principles of [[William Morris]], [[John Ruskin]], and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Morris, an Englishman, rebelled against modern cities and industry, advocating a return to craft production, good design, and village life. Price designed a town plan that provided communal open space, encouraged people to mingle with their neighbors, and preserved the woodlands along [[Naaman's Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arden: From Theory to Practice |author=Frank, Bill |year=1986 |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/frank_bill_on_arden.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121064651/http://cooperativeindividualism.org/frank_bill_on_arden.html |archivedate=2010-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephens continued to live and lead in Arden for three decades after its founding, earning the nickname "Patro" (a word meaning "Father" in [[Esperanto]]) by the villagers. He died June 16, 1935&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt; at age 75 in [[Gilpin Point, Maryland]] (another Georgian community he had helped start).&lt;ref name=Shields/&gt;

He is one of the two Members of Parliament [[Anglo-Indian reserved seats|appointed]] by the president under Article 331 (Anglo-Indian) of the Indian Constitution. He joined the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140228/jsp/bengal/story_18030087.jsp|title=BJP taps magic and acting|date=27 February 2014|work=[[Telegraph (India)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 and contested and lost the [[Lok Sabha]] elections from the [[Howrah]] constituency during the [[Indian general election, 2014]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Baker was born in [[Tezpur]], [[Assam]], on 28 October 1945 in a [[Greek people|Greek]] family. His initial education was in [[Lucknow]] at [[La Martiniere College]]. He was a National level junior in Boxing and Swimming during this period. He later joined the [[Assam Engineering College]] but had  to leave midway since his father died. He completed a two-year course in [[Permanent Way Engineering]] and joined the [[Northeast Frontier Railway zone]] in the Engineering Department. He served here for two years and then quit to start his own business.

===Acting career (Early 1970s – present)===
Baker made his first foray into [[Assamese cinema]] in 1974. He played the protagonist in the Assamese film ''[[Chameli Memsaab]]'' [http://www.assams.info/movies/chameli-memsaab-1975]. This film went on to win the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Assamese]] at the [[23rd National Film Awards]]. He played the role of Berkeley, a British planter who falls for a native girl, Chameli, (played by Binita Borgohain) and is later accused for her murder. Baker later played the same role in the Bengali version of the same movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070905/asp/guwahati/story_8272863.asp|title=The Telegraph - Calcutta : Guwahati|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to act in numerous [[Bengali language|Bengali]] movies, [[Jatra (theatre)]], television films, serials mostly playing parts of British Expatriates. He has also been part of roving theatre groups.

Over the years he has acted in films of five languages - [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]] &amp; [[Santali language|Santhali]].

More recently he played the role of Sir William Eckhardt in [[Parineeta (2005 film)]]  and Mr. Ramsey in [[Bhooter Bhabishyat]] .

===Political career (2014)===

On 27 February 2014, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] announced Baker as their candidate for the [[Indian general election, 2014]] from the [[Howrah (Lok Sabha constituency)]] [http://www.bjp.org/media-resources/press-releases/press-ist-list-of-candidate-for-lok-sabha-election-2014].

On 23 July 2015, he was appointed to the [[16th Lok Sabha]] as one of the two appointed members representing the Anglo-Indian community along with [[Richard Hay (politician)|Richard Hay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/actor-george-baker-professor-richard-hay-nominated-to-lok-sabha-784576|title=Actor George Baker, Professor Richard Hay Nominated to Lok Sabha|newspaper=NDTV.com|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2017, he was attacked and hospitalised by a mob, allegedly of Trinamool Congress members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/news/agencies/bjp-mp-george-baker-allegedly-attacked-by-trinamool-2267501/|title=BJP MP George Baker allegedly attacked by Trinamool|first=IANS|last=Feeds|date=24 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georges Henry Erasmus''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (born August 8, 1948 in [[Behchoko, Northwest Territories|Behchoko]], [[Northwest Territories]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician.  He was the national chief of the [[Assembly of First Nations]] from 1985 to 1991.

Erasmus was born in a [[Dene]] community of the Northwest Territories to a family of 12 children.  He attended high school in [[Yellowknife]].  In 1967, he was a volunteer with the [[Company of Young Canadians]].

He became president of the [[Dene Nation]] in 1974 and while president fought against the proposed [[Mackenzie Valley Pipeline]].

He was the federal [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] candidate in 1979 for [[Western Arctic]] riding.

Erasmus was national chief of the Assembly of First Nations during the [[Oka Crisis]].  After serving two terms as national chief he co-chaired the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]].

Erasmus has been honoured for his work many times.  He was appointed to the [[Order of Canada]] as a member in 1987, and was promoted to officer in 1999.  He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by seven Canadian universities, including the [[University of Toronto]], [[Queen's University]], and the [[University of Manitoba]]. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Western Ontario in June 2006. In 2009 he was awarded the [[Governor General's Northern Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/awards/01/index_e.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20061009183817/http://www.gg.ca/honours/awards/01/index_e.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-09 |title=Governor General announces the awarding of the Northern Medal to Mr. Georges Henry Erasmus, O.C. |accessdate=2009-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual Contribution to Indigenous Rights==
Georges Erasmus is a committed advocate, political leader, and well-respected spokesperson for Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 1976, Erasmus presented to the ''Berger Inquiry'' the Dene’s position to the proposed pipeline.  This presentation, "We the Dene" gives some initial insight into the intellectual thinking of Erasmus.  However, it is important to stress that Erasmus speaks from his location as a member of the Dene and his intellectual thoughts would be influenced by his relationships with his elders and his position within his community.   Speaking as one of the Dene, Erasmus outlined the Dene’s assertion of sovereignty.

As a distinct Dene nation, Erasmus pointed out that they sought to enter into the confederation of Canada as a "recognized entity" with their own self-government over a specific land base. Erasmus points out in this presentation that the Treaties 8 and 11 were agreements entered into on the understanding that they recognized the right of the Dene to govern themselves and from which the Dene nation could live separately but in peaceful coexistence with the non Dene people.  Erasmus states, "Clearly these agreements have been broken.  Instead of recognition of our national right to self-determination, we have been subjected to over fifty years of colonization, of forced assimilation."    In representing his people on the public stage, Erasmus has pursued the need for negotiation, new agreements, and recognition of Indigenous rights from the Canadian government. At times his frustration towards a noncommittal federal government has shown, and he has had to forewarn the government of potential conflict.

At an early point in his intellectual and political life, Erasmus began to highlight the importance of de-colonization and how this must be based on collective action. In taking this approach he attempted to highlight the collective capacity of resistance, and challenged the power relations embedded within the language and practice of paternalism, asserting his people’s right to define themselves, and their own needs. Beginning with the Dene declaration, the model of nations coexisting together in an ethical relationship while retaining sovereignty, is highlighted as a central tenet of his people’s position.  This was carried on throughout his public interviews and is presented in the RCAP.

In a speech given by Erasmus in 2002, he continued to call for conversation "nation to nation," as the means upon which to build a "common future".   Importantly, Erasmus proposed that the contemporary focus should move from an emphasis on "Aboriginal Rights to relationship between peoples; from crying needs to vigorous capacity; from individual citizenship to nations within the nation state."    He suggests that the pursuit of seeking recognition of Aboriginal Rights through the Canadian courts should change because "Litgation is no way to build a community."  Erasmus reasserts instead, the importance of treaty making as a way forward to build renewed relationships built on "mutual trust" and a bond "like that of brothers who might have different gifts and follow different paths, but who could be counted on to render assistance to one another in times of need."

==Early life and education==
Bismarck grew up primarily in his family's ancestral estate near [[Hamburg]]. He attended school in Germany and [[Switzerland]] and had a brief internship at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] before enrolling at [[Christ Church, Oxford University]], where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) earning a third class honours degree. He was a member of the exclusive [[Piers Gaveston Society]], "noted for its predilection for [[Clothing fetish|rubber wear]] and [[whip]]s, which he embellished with his [[Androgyny|androgynous]] [[Clothing|apparel]] and lipstick", as well as the prohibitively expensive [[Bullingdon Club]], known for its members' wealth and destructive binges, alongside friends like [[Darius Guppy]].&lt;ref name=dtobit&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1556420/Count-Gottfried-von-Bismarck.html | title= Count Gottfried von Bismarck Obituary | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=5 July 2007 | accessdate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confessing that he did not enjoy the typical social life in Oxford, he and his friends would escape to the more wild, fashionable parties in London on the weekends or whenever possible. He reportedly drank heavily at night and took [[amphetamines]] by day to concentrate on his studies.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2330658,00.html | title=The Curse of the Count | work=Sunday Times | author=Stuart Wavell | date=27 August 2006 | accessdate=5 July 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcotics incident at university==
The death of heiress Olivia Channon, the daughter of the English Conservative politician [[Paul Channon]], in Graf von Bismarck's room would disrupt his life.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; She was found dead from a heroin overdose in Bismarck's rooms at Christ Church, Oxford University, in 1986. Bismarck was charged with drug possession and fined £80 at an Oxford Magistrates Court. The shadow of Channon's death haunted him, and he was said to have "wept like a child" at her funeral.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; His father, Prince Ferdinand, recalled him to Germany for treatment at a private clinic, it was said he left Oxford so quickly that a family servant had to settle his bills with [[Pub|public houses]], tailors and restaurants.&lt;ref name=dtobit/&gt;

==Business career==
After completion of his studies at a German university, where he wrote a doctoral thesis on the East German telephone system, Bismarck visited the family estate at [[Schönhausen]], which was lost under communist rule in [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name=dtobit/&gt; This was a powerful personal experience for him. Later, after having spent some time in Los Angeles, he went to work as an executive for the now defunct [[Telemonde]] with the intent to raise capital from the stock market prior to its collapse in 2002. He returned to London soon after and became a promoter of holidays in [[Uzbekistan]]. He was a co-founding executive with [[AIM Partners]], a London-based investment firm.&lt;ref name=dtobit/&gt;

==Narcotics incident 2006==
In August 2006, Anthony Casey, 41, fell 20&amp;nbsp;m (60&amp;nbsp;ft) from Graf von Bismarck's [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] flat and died. Bismarck was not arrested and the police said there were no drugs found in his flat. Nevertheless, the event re-awakened the so-called "curse" from the past, and triggered speculation from the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] press. An article in London's ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed that the incident occurred during a [[cocaine]]-fueled [[orgy]]. The [[coroner]]'s report had found no alcohol in Casey's body, but did find a significant amount of [[cocaine]]. The accusation of a 'gay orgy' was officially denied by von Bismarck, though the coroner, Dr. [[Paul Knapman]], told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that a great deal of sexual [[paraphernalia]] was discovered in the flat, including [[Sex toy|sex toys]] and [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/drugs/Story/0,,1888777,00.html | title=Fatal fall after 'gay orgy' was misadventure | work=The Guardian | author=Fred Attewill | date=6 October 2006 | accessdate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In common parlance, in the early hours of the morning, there was a gay orgy going on", Dr. Knapman told the newspaper. "Nevertheless, this was conducted by consenting males in private."

==Death==
On 2 July 2007 Bismarck was found dead in his almost empty £5&amp;nbsp;million flat, which was in the process of being sold. He was 44 years old. An inquest into the circumstances was opened on 6 July 2007. Sebastien Lucas, the pathologist who carried out the [[Autopsy|postmortem]], said that Bismarck had been injecting [[cocaine]] on an hourly basis on the day before his death, and that Bismarck's body contained the highest level of cocaine that he had ever seen, as well as [[morphine]]; he also had liver damage, [[Hepatitis B]], [[Hepatitis C]], and [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bismarck-died-after-injecting-cocaine-every-hour-for-a-day-394620.html | title=Bismarck died after injecting cocaine 'every hour for a day' | work=The Independent | author=Cahal Milmo | date=11 October 2007 | accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3088">[[File:Haibao en Expo 2008.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Haibao]]
'''Haibao''' ({{zh|s=海宝|t=海寶}}), meaning "jewel of the sea", is the [[mascot]] of [[Expo 2010]], which was held in the city of [[Shanghai]], [[China]] from May 1 to October 31, 2010.

==Meaning==
[[File:人-seal.svg|100px|right|thumb|The [[Chinese character|character]] 人 in [[seal script]]]]
"Hai (海)" means the [[sea]] in Chinese inscribed from the name of the host city, and "Bao (宝,寶)" means the [[treasure]]. Its figure is in the shape of the [[Chinese character]] "Ren (人)" (meaning [[human]]). Haibao was produced by [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[designer]] Wu Yong-jian and adopted as the official mascot of the World Expo on December 18, 2007. He was selected out of 26,655 entries as part of an international competition.

== Similarities ==

Some say that Haibao resembles [[Gumby]], the green [[clay]] [[humanoid]] figure shown on American television from the 1950s–'60s.&lt;ref name="jt20100419"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mainichi.jp/select/world/news/20100424k0000e030038000c.html |title=上海万博：また盗作騒ぎ　マスコット「ガンビーに似てる」 |publisher=The Mainichi Daily News |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427073210/http://mainichi.jp/select/world/news/20100424k0000e030038000c.html |archivedate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mainichi.jp/select/world/news/20100424dde035030059000c.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714091627/http://mainichi.jp/select/world/news/20100424dde035030059000c.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2012 |title=上海万博：マスコットのコピー横行　「そもそも米キャラの盗作」|publisher=The Mainichi Daily News |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010}} (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The expo's secretariat said that it is an original design and they had never heard of Gumby.

It has been noted that, compared to Gumby, Haibao looks far more like a cartoon mascot also named ''Haibao'' from an appliance company, Xinxiang Haibao Electrical Appliance, whose managers are unsure why the Expo would use "almost the same image as our logo", adding that it was "the biggest ever advertising for free."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/none/haibo-gumcy-face/-391841 Haibao vs Gumby: The copycat charade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jWohhdJTE__hZikypszSiP1MEx1AD9FBCOV00 Shanghai Expo designer denies mascot copy of Gumby]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hasanbey Zardabi Natural History Museum''' is a [[natural history museum]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

The museum bears the name of [[Hasan bey Zardabi]], an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] [[journalist]] and intellectual, and [[Organizational founder|founder]] of the first Azeri-language [[newspaper]] [[Akinchi]] ("The Ploughman") in 1875.

The museum has two departments: a [[geology]] department that has samples of metallic and nonmetallic natural resources and minerals and rocks of Azerbaijan and a [[zoology]] department. The general collection of the museum numbers more than 1400 different items. The [[biological]] department exhibits numerous skeletons and fragments of animal bones found during field work and treated by researchers. The oldest [[exhibit (educational)|exhibit]] is the teeth of an ichthyosaur from the Cretaceous period, more than 120 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Museums, reserves, galleries of Baku — National Tourism Promotion Bureau, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The research activities of the Natural History Museum have developed in several directions, focused especially on paleontological sites. The main research focuses on the study of the Binagadi quaternary and the Eldar late Sarmatian hipparion faunas, Pirekishkuli Maykop vertebrate fauna, numerous sites of primitive people, as well as [[Azokh cave]] and others. In the collection of the quaternary fauna of Binagadi, there are 41 species of [[mammal]]s, 110 species of [[bird]]s, 2 [[reptile]]s, 1 [[amphibian]], 107 [[insect]]s and 22 species of [[plant]]s. Among those are near-complete fossilized skeletons of [[horse]]s, [[deer]], [[gazelle]]s and saigas that don’t live in the territory of [[Azerbaijan]] anymore. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icom.azeurotel.com/en/profiles05en.html azeurotel.com], Museums of various profiles and organizations: Natural History Museum named after Hasan Bey Zardabi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eldar fauna consists of 23 representatives of various forms of [[vertebrate]] animals.In addition, the museum also has two types of [[hipparion]]s (mammals of the horse family), the [[Sarmatian]] whale and the lower jaw of a [[mastodon]].

The museum also exhibits the upper jaw, teeth and tusks of the southern [[elephant]] which lived in our country 600000 years ago and was discovered in [[Mingachevir]] in 2001. 

The museum operates under the auspices of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics of Azerbaijan.

Prince '''Jean-Bédel Bokassa, Jr''', or Prince '''Jean-Bédel Bokassa II''' (born 2 November 1973) is a son of [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], head of state of the [[Central African Republic]] and its successor state, the [[Central African Empire]], by his sixth wife Catherine Denguiadé, who became Empress on Bokassa's assumption of the throne. Following his father's decision to become Emperor, Jean-Bédel was named, at the age of 4, as [[heir apparent]] with the title of Crown Prince (''prince héritier de Centrafrique''). He was chosen despite having several older brothers and half-brothers. Bokassa I's eldest son by another wife, Georges, was a cabinet minister but Bokassa considered him weak.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, Brian (1997) ''Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa'', McGill-Queen's University Press, {{ISBN|0-7735-1602-6}}, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Bédel was included in Bokassa I's lavish coronation of 4 December 1977, which [[Pope Paul VI]] refused to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, pp. 92–97&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lajos Pap''' (1883-1941) was a Hungarian [[Carpentry|carpenter]] and spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 132. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gyimesi 2014"&gt;Gyimesi, Júlia. (2014). ''Between Religion and Science: Spiritualism, Science and Early Psychology in Hungary''. International Psychology, Practice and Research 5: 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==

Lajos Pap was originally investigated by the [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]] Chengery Pap in the 1920s in a series of experimental [[séance]]s. He was alleged to have produced [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]] and [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] phenomena. Various dead and living animals were discovered after his séances such as [[frog]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[mice]] and [[snake]]s.&lt;ref name="Gyimesi 2014"/&gt; Chengery Pap stored many of these specimens in a museum. However, it was destroyed during [[World War II]] and only photographs remain. The scientific reception to the experiments was not favourable. In 1928, [[Theodore Besterman]] from the [[Society for Psychical Research]] attended séances and concluded the phenomena was fraudulent.&lt;ref name="Gyimesi 2014"/&gt; 

In 1935, Lajos Pap was investigated by the [[International Institute for Psychical Research]] in London by the psychoanalyst [[Nandor Fodor]]. He reported that the phenomena was fraudulent and not evidence for the paranormal.&lt;ref name="Gyimesi 2014"/&gt; During the séance a dead snake appeared. Pap was searched and was found to be wearing a device under his robe, where he had hidden the snake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nandor Fodor|Fodor, Nandor]]. (1960). ''The Haunted Mind: A Psychoanalyst Looks at the Supernatural''. Helix Press. pp. 100-122&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other psychical researchers such [[Harry Price]] also considered Pap to be a fraud and his mediumship discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1939). ''Mechanics of Spiritualism''. In ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Longmans, Green &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Kelly has written numerous papers and articles relating to violence against women and children, and has been a guest editor on the journal ''[[Child Abuse Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = Liz (guest editor) | last2 = Pringle | first2 = Keith (guest editor) | title = Editorial: Gender and child harm | journal = [[Child Abuse Review]], special issue: Gender and Child Harm | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 367–371 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/car.1097 | date = November 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/car.1097 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her review of why so many alleged rapists go unprosecuted and unconvicted, which she conducted for the [[Crown Prosecution Service#Inspection|Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate]], stated, "that at each stage of the legal process, stereotypes and prejudices play a part in decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Baird | first = Vera | title = You've been raped.

In her book "The Hidden Gender of Law", Kelly argues "there is no clear distinction between consensual sex and rape, but a continuum of pressure, threat, coercion and force". She claims that all women experience sexual violence at some points in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xo0gTQg5oi8C&amp;pg=PA44|title=Masculinities and Crime: Critique and Reconceptualization of Theory|first=James W.|last=Messerschmidt|date=27 September 1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's publication "Surviving Sexual Violence" defines sexual violence as including "any physical, visual, verbal or sexual act that is experienced by the woman or girl, at the time or later, as a threat, invasion or assault, that has the effect of hurting her or degrading her and/or takes away her ability to control". Such a definition was criticised by [[Wendy McElroy]], describing it as "disastrously subjective" also noting "regret is not a benchmark of consent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BiEP-j9rh8AC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Sexual+violence+includes+any+physical,+visual,+verbal+or+sexual+act+that+is+experienced+by+the+woman+or+girl,+at+the+time+or+later&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicrMX7sMbWAhWjJMAKHUwzAM0Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Sexual+violence+includes+any+physical,+visual,+verbal+or+sexual+act+that+is+experienced+by+the+woman+or+girl,+at+the+time+or+later&amp;f=false|title=Sexual Correctness: The Gender-Feminist Attack on Women|first=Wendy|last=McElroy|date=1 January 2001|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Kelly was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[2000 New Year Honours#Commanders (CBE)|2000 New Years Honours]], for services to combating violence against women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=55710|date=30 December 1999|page=10|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lourdino Barreto.jpg|frame|Lourdino Barreto]]
'''Lourdino Barreto''' (born 11 February 1938, in Galgibaga in South Goa) was dubbed "the best musicologist East of Suez" at a World Congress for choir conductors held in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goa-world.com/goa/music/lourdino.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107171149/http://www.goa-world.com/goa/music/lourdino.htm |date=7 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He studied at the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music]] and the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia|National Conservatory]] in Rome and graduated with distinction in Gregorian chant, composition and piano.  He later earned a doctorate for his thesis titled:  'Aesthetic Indian Music as a bridge between Christian and Indian Religious Music'.

==Career==
Back in Goa, he taught music at the Seminary of Saligao-Pilerne and at the [[Rachol Seminary]] of the [[Archdiocese of Goa and Daman]], where he trained future priests in the divine chants. He conducted the [[Santa Cecilia Choir]] of [[Rachol Seminary]], and raised the level of music in the Seminary to a high standard.

He authored more than 100 compositions, some based on Indian '[[Raga]]s', which were performed by various orchestras and musical ensembles in major capitals of the world.  In addition to some of his performances which were beamed worldwide via satellite, he gave live piano, violin and [[organ recital]]s in Italy, Switzerland, Austria, England, and the United States of America.

In February 1977, Maestro [[António Fortunato de Figueiredo]] handed over the directorship of Western Music wing of [[Goa Kala Academy]] and the conductorship of [[Goa Symphony Orchestra]] to Lourdino Barreto.  During his tenure as Director of Western Music for [[Goa Kala Academy]], Barreto formed the Goa Philharmonic Choir.  His choir interpreted western, Indian and Goan choral music, as well as staged a few operettas, Broadway musicals and a full-length opera, Verdi's Il Trovatore.  At his urging, music was for the very first time introduced as a subject at the Higher Secondary Education in Goa.

He died on 24 January 1997, a few months before he would have represented India at the Franz Schubert International Festival organized by Austria to commemorate [[Franz Schubert|Schubert’s]] second birth centenary.

'''Martin Riggs''' is a fictional character from the ''[[Lethal Weapon (franchise)|Lethal Weapon]]'' film series. Riggs was originally played by [[Mel Gibson]] in all four films from 1987 to 1998, and later by [[Clayne Crawford]] in the [[Lethal Weapon (TV series)|Fox television series]] in 2016 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 25 Movie Franchises of All Time: #22|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 27, 2006|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/747/747596p1.html|accessdate=September 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726190321/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/747/747596p1.html|archivedate=July 26, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox TV Pilot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/fox-lethal-weapon-finds-mel-gibson-article-1.2560280|title=Fox's 'Lethal Weapon' finds its Mel Gibson|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/08/clayne-crawford-leaving-lethal-weapon-season-3-controversy-recast/|title=Clayne Crawford Out at Lethal Weapon, Last-Minute Recasting Underway Ahead of Potential Season 3|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=2018-05-08|work=TVLine|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's Narcotics Division, upon being reassigned to the [[Homicide]] Division, Riggs is partnered up with aging [[sergeant]] [[Roger Murtaugh]]. Riggs and Murtaugh remain partners throughout the film series.

== Career ==

=== Military career ===

Riggs joined the [[U.S. Army]] at age 19, eventually becoming a member of the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]], receiving specialized training in weaponry and hand-to-hand combat. These skills would later serve him well when he became a police officer. Most of Riggs's time in special forces was in [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]], where he served as an assassin under the [[CIA]]'s "[[Phoenix Program|Phoenix Project]]". The first time he became a killer when he shot a man to death with a sniper rifle from a distance in [[Laos]]; while his ability as a trained killer would later plague his [[conscience]], he thought of it as "...the only thing I was ever really good at."

=== Family ===

In 1984, Riggs's wife, Victoria Lynn, dies in a car accident, sending him into a deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Driven by grief to the brink of [[suicide]], he regularly puts himself (and anyone else near him) in harm's way, hoping someone will put him out of his misery. This total disregard for his own life makes him literally fearless, turning him into a "Lethal Weapon". By the end of the first movie, however, he has resolved to keep living. In the second film, it is revealed that Victoria was actually murdered during an attempt on Riggs's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Passion of the Mel|publisher= IGN|date= |url= http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/106/1064345p1.html|accessdate= 2010-09-11|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100204154327/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/106/1064345p1.html|archivedate= 2010-02-04|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the films ===

In ''Lethal Weapon'', Riggs is transferred from the [[narcotics]] division to the [[homicide]] division after a shooting incident. He is partnered with Detective Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]] in hopes that the older, more conservative veteran will keep him in line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FILM: 'LETHAL WEAPON,' A THRILLER WITH GIBSON|publisher= The New York Times|date=1987-03-06|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE1DB1230F935A35750C0A961948260&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes|accessdate=2010-09-11|first=Janet|last=Maslin}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a rough start, the two become good friends, even though Riggs always gets on Murtaugh's nerves. By the end of the first film, the two have worked together to rescue Murtaugh's daughter, who had been kidnapped by drug lords and military [[mercenaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : A Lethal 'Weapon 2|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1989-07-07|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-07/entertainment/ca-3330_1_lethal-weapon|accessdate=2011-05-09|first=Michael|last=Wilmington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', Riggs discovers that the [[South Africa]]n crime lord, Arjen Rudd, whom he and Murtaugh are pursuing ordered Riggs's death in 1984. Rudd's enforcer, Pieter Vorstedt, killed Victoria Riggs by mistake and made the murder look like an automobile accident to cover up their involvement. After avenging the deaths of his wife and Rika van den Haas (whom Riggs had become involved with romantically before she, too, was murdered by Rudd and his minions), he is able to move on with his life. Meanwhile, Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect a comical federal witness, Leo Getz (played by [[Joe Pesci]]) whom they ultimately become close friends with.

He meets Sgt. Lorna Cole (played by [[Rene Russo]]), an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] officer, in ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' during an investigation into the disappearance of weapons from L.A.P.D. impound. The two make an immediate connection and work closely together to clear Murtaugh's name after he is forced to kill his son's friend in self-defense. Riggs and Lorna become romantically involved and move in together after the end of the film.

In ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'', Riggs and Lorna are still living together, and Lorna is pregnant with their child, but they have dodged the issue of marriage. Both Riggs and Murtaugh are promoted to [[Police captain|captain]] by the fourth film in order to keep them out of trouble, but are demoted back to sergeants at the end of the film. Leo helps Riggs finally make peace with his wife's death; Riggs marries Lorna while she is giving birth to his son.

== Television series ==
{{main|Lethal Weapon (TV series)}}
In a March 10, 2016 newspaper article, the plot for the television pilot is as follows: "when Texas cop and former Navy SEAL Martin Riggs...suffers the loss of his wife and baby, he moves to Los Angeles to start anew. There, he gets partnered with LAPD detective Roger Murtaugh...who, having recently suffered a "minor" heart attack, must avoid any stress in his life."&lt;ref name="Fox TV Pilot" /&gt;

==Weapons==
In all of the films and television series, Riggs' sidearm is a [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92F]] 9mm pistol. Riggs is also a practitioner of several styles of martial arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">'''Mary Ann Leeper'''  is the founder of the [[Female Health Foundation]] (1994) where she became the chair and board member. She was president and COO for ten plus years before retiring in 2013. Leeper also co-founded another organization called the Business Woman's Initiative against HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Ann Leeper, PhD|url=http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/about/contributors/mary-ann-leeper/}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Leeper's aid, the newest version of the [[female condom]] will be introduced to women in locations with high rates of [[HIV/AIDS]]. The launch of this new female condom is cheaper and will reach more women.  Leeper gives lectures and presentations in colleges and universities across the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her main goal is to “help millions of women
protect themselves against the spread of HIV and AIDS”. She also stated, “It is not a simple goal, but it is one I am determined to do everything possible to achieve.”

== Education ==
Mary Ann Leeper earned her [[Bachelor of Science]] at Drexel University. She received a [[Master of Science]] at Temple University. Leeper later received her master's degree in business at [[Northwestern University]]'s Kellogg Graduate School of Management. She returned to Temple University to study for her doctorate in pharmaceutical chemistry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
Before retirement, Leeper gave lectures to colleges and universities regarding global entrepreneurship, [[Sexism|gender bias]], [[corporate social responsibility]], women’s issues in the developing world, and prevention programs against HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Personal Web Page - Mary Ann Leeper|url = http://faculty.darden.virginia.edu/leeperm/index.htm|website = faculty.darden.virginia.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also an assistant professor at [[Temple University]] Schools of Pharmacy and Medicine along with being a [[biochemist]] and director of Neenah Paper Company. Her main focus and overall works revolve around global entrepreneurship, gender bias, women's issue in the world, and lastly female [[Reproductive health|sexual health]] and protection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hope|first1=Gibbs|title=100 Truly Amazing Women|url=http://trulyamazingwomen.com/the-women/mary-ann-leeper-senior-strategist-female-health-company|website=trulyamazingwomen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female condom ===
Her most recent contribution was the launch of the female condom. She switched from [[polyurethane]] material to [[Synthetic rubber|synthetic latex]], which overall saves manufacturing costs and makes the condom much more affordable. The female condom is an [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] [[Birth control|contraceptive]], which has been [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved for over 20 years. The female condom gives females an option in choosing the best contraceptive, while remaining sexually active. The female condom contains just as high of a success rate as the [[Condom|male condom]]. It has between 93% to 95% [[pregnancy]] prevention success, which is lower than [[Oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], injectables, or the [[Intrauterine device|IUD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Female condoms: Is this the future of safe sex?|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-future-of-sex-the-first-female-condoms-were-derided-mistrusted-and-shunned-but-will-their-modern-9171710.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Gomez''' (born '''Michael Armstrong'''; 21 June 1977) is a former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1995 to 2009. He was born to an [[Irish Traveller]] family in [[Longford]], [[County Longford]], Ireland, spending his early years in [[Dublin]] before moving to London and later [[Manchester]], England, with his family at the age of nine. In boxing he was affectionately known as "The Predator", "The Irish Mexican" and "The Mancunian Mexican".

Despite finishing his career fighting in the [[lightweight]] division, Gomez is more notable for his fights at [[featherweight]] and [[super-featherweight]].&lt;ref name="Boxrec"&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Gomez |publisher=BoxRec |url=http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=9358 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130407204422/http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=9358 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 April 2013 |accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he amassed a number of regional championships, most significantly the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] [[super-featherweight]] title twice, from 1999 to 2004. He also held the [[World Boxing Union|WBU]] super featherweight title from 2004 to 2005.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lonsdale Belt"&gt;{{cite web | first=Eamonn | last=O'Hara | title=Gomez bags belt to make history | work=[[The Irish News]] | url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:09oh-WGwcDAJ:www.irishnews.com/pageacc.asp%3Ftser1%3Dser%26par%3Dben%26sid%3D319522+%22Michael+Gomez%22+%22Gary+Thornhill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=17&amp;gl=uk | date=13 December 2000 | accessdate=3 November 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Gomez suffered a controversial loss to [[Peter McDonagh]] when, in the middle of a round, he dropped his guard and walked out of the ring, later saying he had retired from boxing.&lt;ref name="No Mas"&gt;{{cite web | author=Craig Phillips | title=Gomez returns from No Mas fight | work=[[Eurosport]]| url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/27042007/58/gomez-returns-mas-fight.html| accessdate=13 December 2007 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the ring after a 15-month interval.

Gomez took the surname Gomez after his childhood hero [[Wilfredo Gómez]].&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP Khan"/&gt;

==Background==
Michael Armstrong was born into an [[Irish traveller]] family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his [[partially sighted]] father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a lamp post on the way to the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to [[Ballymun]], Dublin, and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"&gt;{{cite news | first=Derick |last=Allsop | title=Boxing: Born in back seat of crashed car| work=[[Sunday Mirror]] |date=19 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Irish Mexican"&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul |last=Howard | title=Self defence; Michael Gomez endured the loss of his parents| work=[[The Sunday Herald]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19059681.html| date=10 December 2000|accessdate=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (1).JPG|right|thumb|Padwork with Bobby Rimmer]]
Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's eyesight failed further due to [[retinitis pigmentosa]]. By that time, there were ten children in the Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from [[sudden infant death syndrome]], his mother left the family to live with another woman.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Irish Mexican"/&gt; Armstrong subsequently spent much of his youth in various [[orphanage|children's homes]], and was a serial [[truancy|truant]] from school. His mother had taught him to [[shoplifting|shoplift]] as a child, and he was involved in [[Misdemeanor|petty crime]] throughout his youth in Manchester.&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"/&gt; At nine years old, he began [[Boxing training|training]] at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played [[association football|football]] for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring.&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Irish Mexican"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Born in a car"&gt;{{cite web | first=Jerome |last=Reilly | title="Born in a car, dead for 48 seconds, he's a real fighter"| work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/born-in-a-car-dead-for-48-seconds-hes-a-real-fighter-126325.html| date=5 February 2006|accessdate=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOL family"&gt;{{cite news | author=Ron Lewis | title=Michael Gomez: beating Amir Khan is last shot for glory | work=[[The Times]]| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article4159310.ece| accessdate=20 June 2008 | date=18 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early professional career==
Armstrong boxed as an [[amateur boxing|amateur]] before turning professional in June 1995. He chose the professional surname "Gomez" when the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] (BBBoC) required him to select another name at the time of his registration as a professional; there was [[Michael Armstrong (boxer)|another boxer]] in the same weight division using the name "Michael Armstrong". He chose his ring name in honour of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] boxer [[Wilfredo Gómez]], whose videotaped fights Armstrong had studied intently as a youth.&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP Khan"/&gt; The name, combined with Gomez's "[[Boxing#Brawler/slugger|brawl]]ing style",&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web | first=Dan |last=Rafael |title=Rematches don't get any better than Vazquez-Marquez II | work=ESPN.com | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?id=3173659| date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; earned him the nickname of "the Irish Mexican". He developed a ring persona based on this nickname, which has remained popular with fans throughout his career. His ring entrance music is that of a Mexican [[Mariachi]] band, a reference to his [[Spanish language|Hispanic-sounding]] chosen name, and many of his supporters wear [[sombrero]]s to his fights and wave Irish flags.

In his debut fight at the [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|G-Mex Leisure Centre]], Manchester, England, Gomez beat previously undefeated Danny Ruegg on the [[undercard]] of a [[boxingcard|bill]] that included [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] and [[Michael Brodie]]. Despite this initial win, Gomez's early career was littered with losses to journeyman fighters such as Greg Upton and Chris Williams.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jickells"&gt;{{cite web | first=Eamonn | last=O'Hara | title=Gomez in line for title shot | work=[[The Irish News]] | url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:c56rR5ZNZ1QJ:www.irishnews.com/pageacc.asp%3Ftser1%3Dser%26par%3Dben%26sid%3D344853+%22Michael+Gomez%22+Jickells&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=14&amp;gl=uk | date=27 September 2000 | accessdate=3 November 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (2).JPG|right|thumb|Training on bodywork with Bobby Rimmer]]In 1996, Gomez was charged with murder after a [[gang]] fight outside a nightclub in Manchester. Gomez had hit one of his attackers, Sam Parle, who died after his head hit the pavement as a result of the blow. The charge was later reduced to [[manslaughter]] and Gomez was cleared after it was ruled that he had acted in [[self-defense|self-defence]].&lt;ref name="The Irish Mexican"/&gt;

After this shaky beginning in the professional ranks, Gomez had a run of victories from September 1997 to February 1999. During this period Gomez won seven straight fights before challenging for his first title belt, the vacant British Central Area featherweight title against Chris Jickells on 27 February 1999 in [[Oldham]]. Gomez won the title with a fifth-round knockout. He followed his first title win by adding another championship, the [[IBF]] Inter-Continental featherweight title, with a second-round knockout over Nigel Leake.&lt;ref name="Jickells"/&gt;

===Move to super featherweight===
Later that year, Gomez relinquished his championship belts in a bid to move up to the super featherweight division. His first fight in the division, in September 1999, was for the vacant British super featherweight title, against the experienced and much heralded [[Liverpudlian]] fighter [[Gary Thornhill]].&lt;ref name="Boxer of the week"&gt;{{cite web|author=Julian Wilson |title=Boxer of the week – Michael Gomez |work=Britishboxing.net |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_532-Boxer-of-the-week-Michael-Gomez.html |accessdate=13 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222751/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_532-Boxer-of-the-week-Michael-Gomez.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez defeated Thornhill with a second-round knockout.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt; In November 1999, Gomez faced off against [[Mexican people|Mexican]] Jose Manjarrez for the [[WBO]] Inter-Continental super featherweight title, walking away with the title based on the judges' scores after the full twelve rounds. In 1999, Gomez won four title belts, was undefeated during the year and was also named "Young Boxer of the Year" by the British Boxing Writers' Club.&lt;ref name="Lonsdale Belt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jickells"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Thornhill"&gt;{{cite news| title=Stylish Gomez retains title | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/other_sports/825889.stm| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=9 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his winning form into 2000 with another run of six wins, and successfully defended his British super featherweight title against [[Dean Pithie]], Carl Greaves and [[Ian McLeod (boxer)|Ian McLeod]].&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;

==Bognar and Lear fights==
Gomez's first fight in 2001 was on 10 February against [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] boxer [[Laszlo Bognar]] for the WBO Inter-Continental super featherweight title, in [[Widnes]], Cheshire. Gomez had Bognar on the [[boxing ring|canvas]] in the fifth round, but Bognar recovered from this knockdown and used his [[southpaw]] jab to keep Gomez from closing in.  In the ninth round referee Dave Paris stopped the fight following a double left from Bognar, which had Gomez stricken against the ropes. Gomez felt the fight had been stopped prematurely and that he should have been allowed to continue. Gomez later stated that he was suffering from [[influenza|flu]] and should not have taken the fight. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported after the match that the pre-fight weigh-in and medical examination were not carried out in accordance with BBBC regulations: the volunteer inspector left before Bognar and Gomez had weighed in, and the medical examiner had not detected that Gomez was ill.&lt;ref name="Boxer of the week"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fighting for control"&gt;{{cite news | first=Bob |last=Mee | title=Fighting for control| work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/02/14/soboxi15.xml| accessdate=31 May 2008|date=14 February 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Hatton"&gt;{{cite news |  title=Hatton makes devastating defence | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/1427661.stm| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=7 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez sought a rematch against Bognar, and five months later in July 2001 the pair met again, this time in Manchester, resulting in a victory for Gomez. The fight started badly for Gomez when he suffered a [[Knockout#Knockdown|flash knockdown]] in the first round and was down again in the second.  Gomez came back to knock Bognar down near the end of the second round. Gomez came out firing at the start of the third round and finished the fight with a fourth and final knockdown to avenge his earlier defeat.&lt;ref name="BBC Hatton"/&gt; He followed up his victory over Bognar with a second-round knockout of Scottish fighter [[Craig Docherty]] for another British super featherweight title win.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;

His next opponent was unbeaten [[West Ham]]-based fighter [[Kevin Lear]] on 1 June 2002, again in Manchester, on the undercard of the [[Ricky Hatton]] vs. [[Eamonn Magee]] fight.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt; Lear, a former [[Amateur Boxing Association of England|Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA)]] champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp [[jab]] from the outset of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began to bleed heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life Lear"&gt;{{cite web | author=Mark Staniforth | title=Lear Claims Memorable Win | work=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]] | url=http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing/02/06/01/BOXING_Manchester.html | accessdate=13 June 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043634/http://www.sportinglife.com/boxing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=boxing%2F02%2F06%2F01%2FBOXING_Manchester.html | archivedate=30 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat to Lear, and the manner in which the fight ended, prompted Hughes, Gomez's longtime mentor and trainer, to ask Gomez to retire from boxing. This event signalled the end of the relationship between Gomez and Hughes; soon after, Gomez crossed Manchester to join Ricky Hatton and former Collyhurst gym stablemate [[Anthony Farnell]] at the rival Phoenix Gym run by Billy Graham.&lt;ref name="MEN Gomez switch"&gt;{{cite web | author=Stuart Brennan | title=Boxing: Gomez switches camps | work=Manchester Evening News | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/s/10/10562_boxing_gomez_switches_camps.html| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=5 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frenchman"&gt;{{cite news | title=Gomez to fight Frenchman | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3668099.stm| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=28 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez followed the defeat to Lear with a string of three wins, all by knockout.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;

During the period between the first Bognar fight and the loss to Lear, Gomez's life spun out of control. He was "boozing, brawling and womanising",&lt;ref name="Derick Allsop"/&gt; and was convicted of four [[Drunk driving (United Kingdom)|drink-drive]] offenses.&lt;ref name="Back on track"/&gt; During a [[street fighting|street fight]], Gomez was stabbed and badly injured—his heart stopped beating for 148&amp;nbsp;seconds while on the [[Surgery|operating table]].&lt;ref name="Back on track"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fighting for control"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan|last=Hubbard| title="BOXING: 'Wild child' Gomez set to test Arthur's mettle"| work=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|publisher=Find Articles | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20031019/ai_n12748740 |date=19 October 2003|accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamble backfires"&gt;{{cite news | first=Bob |last=Mee | title="Alexander's gamble backfires"| work=[[Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/02/11/soboxx12.xml| accessdate=31 May 2008|date=11 February 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preacher has faith"&gt;{{cite web | first=Stuart |last=Brennan | title="Preacher has faith in Mike" | work=[[Manchester Evening News]] | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/boxing/s/136/136075_preacher_has_faith_in_mike_.html| accessdate=31 May 2008|date=7 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

==Alex Arthur fight==
[[File:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (6).JPG|left|thumb|Gomez [[sparring]] with headgear]]
Following his change in trainer, Gomez was contracted for the highest profile fight of his career against [[Edinburgh]]-based fighter "Amazing" Alex Arthur for the British and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Inter-Continental super featherweight titles. The fight took place in a sold-out [[Meadowbank Stadium]] in October 2003, in what was the first professional boxing card in Edinburgh in almost 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Boxing Monthly Amazing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazing All-Round |work=Boxing Monthly |url=http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0310/two.htm |accessdate=13 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812003358/http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/0310/two.htm |archivedate=12 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the fight, Arthur had opined during interviews that "looking deep into Gomez's eyes at the press conference, I'm not sure even he believes he can win. He'll be so fired up I expect it'll take me eight or nine rounds but, if his resistance has gone as people are saying, it could be a lot sooner."&lt;ref name="Boxing Monthly Amazing"/&gt; With respect to his approach to the fight, Arthur added "I see about 20 ways to beat him. I'm just looking forward to shutting him up."&lt;ref name="BBC Arthur"&gt;{{cite news |  title=Arthur shrugs off trainer blow | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3193606.stm| accessdate=13 June 2007 |date=15 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur, who was looking to retain the [[BBBofC]] [[Lonsdale Belt]], was seen as a rising star in British boxing. He was a strong favourite to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was seen as a stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship.&lt;ref name="Bragging Arthur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boxer of the week"/&gt; However, [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]], Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.&lt;ref name="BBC Arthur"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" BBN Kizza Preview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alex Arthur v Michael Kizza Preview |publisher=BritishBoxing.net |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_598-Alex-Arthur-v-Michael-Kizza-Preview.html |accessdate=31 May 2008 |date=25 March 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221071830/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_598-Alex-Arthur-v-Michael-Kizza-Preview.html |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez proved his critics wrong when he arrived at the fight in prime condition and with aggression, determination and desire.&lt;ref name="Bragging Arthur"/&gt; The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity.&lt;ref name="Bragging Arthur"/&gt; From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.&lt;ref name="Bragging Arthur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez stuns"&gt;{{cite news | title=Gomez stuns Arthur | publisher=[[BBC Sport]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/3214701.stm| accessdate=31 May 2008|date=25 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez knocked down his opponent twice before delivering a jarring left hook to Arthur, knocking Arthur to the canvas for the third time. Referee John Coyle stopped the fight, and Gomez won with the resulting [[knock out|TKO]] in the fifth round.&lt;ref name="Bragging Arthur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez stuns"/&gt; The match was hailed as one of the best fights in Britain for a decade. Boxing promoter [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]] called the fight "the greatest contest seen on these shores since [[Nigel Benn]] beat [[Gerald McClellan]] in 1995".&lt;ref name="Kizza Preview"&gt;{{cite web | author=K MacInnes | title=This England | work=[[New Statesman]] | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311240012| accessdate=13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired Scottish boxer [[Ken Buchanan]] said it was one of the best fights he had ever seen.&lt;ref name="Bragging Arthur"/&gt;

Gomez attended Arthur's next fight against Ugandan Michael Kizza in Meadowbank, Scotland, but Arthur did not appear when Gomez fought Ben Odamattey for the [[WBU]] super featherweight title in Manchester a few weeks later. Gomez pointed this out when being interviewed shortly afterward, adding "Sky Television want a return. Frank Warren, Arthur's manager, wants a re-match. And most of all so do I."&lt;ref name="GOMEZ BOXING CLEVER"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hugh Keevins |title=Gomez Boxing Clever |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tm_objectid=14120854&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=89488&amp;headline=boxing--gomez-boxing-clever-name_page.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040426092850/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/tm_objectid%3D14120854%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D89488%26headline%3Dboxing--gomez-boxing-clever-name_page.html |archivedate=26 April 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |date=6 April 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur responded by saying "the fight (with Gomez) is definitely going to happen. Hopefully I'll get another warm-up fight in June and then take on Gomez in September."&lt;ref name="GOMEZ BOXING CLEVER"/&gt; Despite the rhetoric, the two fighters did not meet each other in the ring again.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;

==WBU world title==
In March 2004, Gomez fought Ghanaian Ben Odamattey for the [[WBU]] super featherweight title at the MEN Arena in Manchester, winning the championship by stopping Odamattey in the third round.&lt;ref name="frenchman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOMEZ BOXING CLEVER"/&gt; He retained his WBU title in his next two fights against [[Justin Juuko]] and Leva Kirakosyan with knockout wins. Gomez then faced [[Argentinian]] boxer "El Vikingo" Javier Osvaldo Alvarez in February 2005, once again fighting at the MEN Arena in Manchester. WBO super middleweight title holder [[Joe Calzaghe]] had been scheduled to top the bill but pulled out of his arranged fight, and Gomez and Alvarez were slotted as the main attraction.&lt;ref name="porter"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Porter |title=Alvarez Stops Brave Gomez in Six |work=BritishBoxing.net |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_163-Alvarez-Stops-Brave-Gomez-in-Six.html |accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=12 February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222610/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_163-Alvarez-Stops-Brave-Gomez-in-Six.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind Bunce"&gt;{{cite news | author=Steve Bunce | title=Alvarez hammer blows put Gomez career on ropes | work=[[The Independent]] | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing-alvarez-hammer-blows-put-gomez-career-on-ropes-1530365.html| date=12 February 2005 |accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair clashed at the weigh in, and this antagonism carried into the ring; from the outset of the fight Gomez tried to draw Alvarez into a [[Boxing#Brawler/slugger|brawl]]. Gomez appeared to win the first two rounds behind stinging jabs, but Alvarez seemed unruffled.  In the third round, Alvarez started to take control of the fight and landed several blows to Gomez's face. Gomez began quickly in the fourth round, attacking Alvarez from behind his jab and working his way through his opponent's defense.&lt;ref name="porter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind Bunce"/&gt; Alvarez appeared content to catch Gomez as he moved forward.  Despite Gomez's strong start, Alvarez dazed Gomez with a stiff right hand shot in the fourth round, after which the Argentinian launched into a furious onslaught.  Gomez steadied in the fifth but was visibly tired. Two minutes into the sixth round, Alvarez floored Gomez with a right hook. Gomez [[Professional boxing#Scoring|beat the count]] and Alvarez then moved in to continue his attack. Referee [[Mickey Vann]] stopped the fight after 2&amp;nbsp;minutes 25&amp;nbsp;seconds of the round with Gomez pinned to the ropes and taking significant punishment.&lt;ref name="porter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind Bunce"/&gt;

==Peter McDonagh controversy==
Gomez was out of the ring for almost a year following the Alvarez fight and was next due to fight [[Willie Limond]] for the WBU lightweight title, but turned down the opportunity for a chance to fight for an Irish title. Gomez then signed up to fight fellow English-based [[Irishman]], [[Peter McDonagh]], for the Irish lightweight title on the undercard of a [[Bernard Dunne]] fight on 28 January 2006 at the [[National Stadium, Dublin]]. After the fight was signed Gomez stated "I just can't wait to get my hands on that Irish title because I've been desperate to fight in Ireland for years."&lt;ref name="Born in a car"&gt;{{cite web | first=Jerome |last=Reilly | title=Born in a car, dead for 48 seconds, he's a real fighter| work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=| url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/born-in-a-car-dead-for-48-seconds-hes-a-real-fighter-126325.html| date=5 February 2006|accessdate=31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernard Dunne Back in Action on Jan 28 in Dublin! |work=Eastside Boxing |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=5585&amp;more=1 |accessdate=13 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804040231/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=5585&amp;more=1 |archivedate=4 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the fight McDonagh was making visits to see [[paranormalist]] [[Uri Geller]] as "mind coach" to help him prepare mentally for the fight, and Geller also travelled with him to Dublin for the fight. Gomez commented that "I'm not sure Uri Geller will be of much use to him though because there won't be any spoons in that ring for him to bend. The only thing I plan on bending is some of McDonagh's ribs with my body punches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  title=Uri Geller in McDonagh's corner for Irish title fight | work=Irish Independent| url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/boxing-uri-geller-in-mcdonaghs-corner-for-irish-title-fight-119275.html| accessdate=9 June 2008 |date=25 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four rounds were relatively close, with Gomez leading according to pundits, but the fight ended in the fifth round under bizarre circumstances when for no apparent reason Gomez stopped fighting and failed to defend himself. He then received a number of unanswered punches from McDonagh before being floored. Gomez rose from the canvas immediately but appeared to ignore the referee and walk towards his corner while the referee continued with his count.  Gomez then left the ring as the referee was waving the fight off. [[RTÉ]] commentator [[Steve Collins]] said "I smell a rat, something's not right here."&lt;ref name="No Mas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Times Foley"&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Foley  | title=Gomez controversy a body blow to boxing | work=[[The Sunday Times]]| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article726946.ece| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=5 February 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC mcdonagh"&gt;{{cite news |  title=Gomez trainer slams fixing slur | work=[[BBC]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/4666246.stm| accessdate=13 July 2007 |date=31 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boxing Union of Ireland]] (BUI) initially suspended both fighters' [[Prize money|purses]], and investigated reports of unusual betting patterns, with large sums of money being placed on McDonagh to win [[Boxing#Rules|inside the distance]] and more specifically in the fifth round.  Odds on McDonagh to win the fight in the fifth round had been cut from 125–1 to 18–1 by the afternoon of the bout.&lt;ref name="BBC mcdonagh"/&gt; Following their investigation, the BUI released the purses to each of the fighters, stating "Michael Gomez and Peter McDonagh confirmed that neither they, their families, nor any person in their camp, as far as they were aware, betted on the fight."&lt;ref name="BUI invest"&gt;{{cite web |  title=Union awards purses to McDonagh and Gomez | work=[[The Irish Examiner]] (archived at Breakingnews.ie)| url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/?c=SPORT&amp;jp=cweyojcwcwmh&amp;d=2006-02-17| accessdate=9 June 2008 |date=17 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BUI did express disappointment that the [[bookmaker]], [[Boylesports]], who had suspended wagering on the bout due to the unusual betting patterns, had chosen not to reply to the investigators' queries.&lt;ref name="BUI invest"/&gt;
Gomez later explained the loss by saying that "it was all very simple, I just came to a decision in there that I need to retire from boxing full stop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Tomas Rohan | title=Gomez – I'm happy with my decision | work=irish-boxing.com |url= http://irish-boxing.com/january06/31_January_2006_Gomez.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070509185818/http://irish-boxing.com/january06/31_January_2006_Gomez.htm |archivedate= 9 May 2007| accessdate=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez further indicated that he planned to pursue a career in bodybuilding. McDonagh, meanwhile, claimed that he had won because of Gellar's assistance leading up to the bout.&lt;ref name="BBC mcdonagh"/&gt;

Gomez sought a second opportunity to fight McDonagh; in April 2007, he offered to fight for only his training costs.&lt;ref name="MEN Gunning"&gt;{{cite web| title=Gomez goes gunning for Amir | work=[[Manchester Evening News]]| url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/boxing/s/1004/1004142__gomez_goes_gunning_for_amir.html|  accessdate=11 April 2008 | date=11 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, their rematch for the Irish lightweight title, to be billed as ''"Redemption"'', was set for 23 May 2008,&lt;ref name="Saddo McDonagh rematch"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jane Warburton | title=Michael Gomez gets rematch with Peter McDonagh | work=Saddo Boxing| url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/7106-michael-gomez-peter-mcdonagh.html| accessdate=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but McDonagh pulled out of the scheduled bout.&lt;ref name="saddochange"&gt;{{cite web|last= Warburton| first =Jane | title = British Boxing: Michael Gomez gets call to face Commonwealth champion Amir Khan June 21 | work = Saddo Boxing  | publisher = saddoboxing.com | url = http://www.saddoboxing.com/7311-amir-khan-vs-michael-gomez.html

==Return to the ring==
[[File:Allan Stevenson - Gomez (3).JPG|right|thumb|Gomez working the pads]]
Gomez found himself once again drawn to boxing after watching a fight between Alex Arthur and [[Carl Johanneson]], and resumed training. In May 2007, fifteen months after his fight with McDonagh, he returned to the ring to face Daniel Thorpe at the Altrincham Leisure Centre, Manchester.&lt;ref name="feeling the fear"&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry Dooley |title=Michael Gomez is feeling the fear but coming back anyway |work=Britishboxing.net |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2551-Michael-Gomez-is-feeling-the-fear-but-coming-back-anyway.html |accessdate=9 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720163122/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2551-Michael-Gomez-is-feeling-the-fear-but-coming-back-anyway.html |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez had left the Phoenix Gym and was now training at Bobby Rimmers' Boxing Academy in [[Stalybridge]], Manchester, and had returned to fight in the [[super featherweight]] division. The fight was billed as ''"The Last Stand"'', and the venue was sold out with fellow fighters Ricky Hatton and his brother [[Matthew Hatton]] cheering him on from ringside. Gomez won the fight with a stoppage in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jane Warburton | title=Ringside boxing report: Michael Gomez—Daniel Thorpe | work=Saddo boxing| url= http://www.saddoboxing.com/5241-michael-gomez-daniel-thorpe.html| accessdate=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month Gomez also beat Youssef Al Hamidi, again with a third round stoppage.&lt;ref name="feeling the fear"/&gt; Following two comeback fights against journeyman opposition Gomez was rumoured to be in line for fights against many of Britain and Ireland's top level super featherweights and lightweights including [[Kevin Mitchell (professional boxer)|Kevin Mitchell]], [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]], and Carl Johanneson; Gomez himself was seeking a rematch against Peter McDonagh.&lt;ref name="feeling the fear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MEN Khan"&gt;{{cite web | first=Stuart |last=Brennan | title=Khan you believe it? | work=[[Manchester Evening News]] | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/boxing/s/1006/1006293_khan_you_believe_it.html| date=5 May 2007|accessdate=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then signed up to face Leeds's Johanneson on 19 October 2007 at the [[Doncaster Dome]], [[Doncaster]], England for the British super featherweight title.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt; Johanneson had just come off his second defeat to Armenian [[Leva Kirakosyan]], whom Gomez had knocked out in October 2004.&lt;ref name="Boxrec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nowhere to hide"&gt;{{cite web | author=Jim Watt | title=Nowhere to hide | work=[[SKY Sports]] | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12067_2807920,00.html | accessdate=19 October 2007|date=19 October 2007 | authorlink=Jim Watt (boxer) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the fight, Gomez was confident, stating "You can't outbox me. I'll jab your head off. If he comes to have a fight with me it is going to be early Christmas for everyone because I don't know who's going to go but someone's going to go and it's not going to be me."&lt;ref name="jab yer head off"&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry Dooley |title=Michael Gomez's considered reflections |work=Britishboxing.net |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2747-Michael-Gomez-s-considered-reflections.html |accessdate=18 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020014911/http://britishboxing.net/news_2747-Michael-Gomez-s-considered-reflections.html |archivedate=20 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the pre-fight press conference in [[Doncaster]] both fighters squared up to each other and promised to knock each other out; during the highly charged face off both fighters had to be kept apart by their promoter and trainers.&lt;ref name="Head To Head"&gt;{{cite web|title=Johanneson And Michael Gomez Clash Head To Head |work=Eastside Boxing |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=12833&amp;more=1 |accessdate=18 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013094001/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=12833&amp;more=1 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many expected, the highly anticipated domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds and threatened to overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the "Irish Mexican" to rise from the canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Johanneson Stops Gomez"&gt;{{cite web |  title="Johanneson Stops Gomez in a Thriller!" | work=Eastside Boxing| url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=12918&amp;more=1| accessdate=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="I deserve"/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthless Johanneson"&gt;{{cite news |  title=Ruthless Johanneson retains title | work=[[BBC Sport]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7053918.stm | accessdate=20 October 2007 | date=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail Johanneson"&gt;{{cite news |  title=Johanneson retains British super-featherweight title | work=[[Daily Mail]]| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-488669/Johanneson-retains-British-super-featherweight-title.html|  accessdate=20 October 2007 | date=19 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.&lt;ref name="I deserve"&gt;{{cite web | author=Thomas Myler | title=Gomez: 'I deserve another title shot'  | work=[[Irish Independent]]| url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/boxing-gomez-i-deserve-another-title-shot-1208649.html |  accessdate=31 October 2007 | date=31 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amir Khan fight==
Gomez fought [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]] for the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] lightweight title at the [[National Indoor Arena]], Birmingham, on 21 June 2008, Gomez's thirty-first birthday.  Khan said that "there is no way he will be as fit as me, so I expect a spectacular stoppage".&lt;ref name="Telegraph Khan"&gt;{{cite news | author=Gareth A Davies | title=Michael Gomez vows to beat Amir Khan | work=[[Daily Telegraph]]| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2299688/Michael-Gomez-vows-to-beat-Amir-Khan.html| accessdate=7 May 2008 | date=7 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez did not attend the scheduled pre-fight press conference, prompting Khan to deride him, and promoter Frank Warren accused Gomez of failing to show respect to Khan and the media.&lt;ref name="Bolton June"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Magilton |title=Khan fuming at Gomez no-show |work=[[The Bolton News]] |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/amirkhan/display.var.2350893.0.khan_fuming_at_gomez_noshow.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130422050339/http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/amirkhan/display.var.2350893.0.khan_fuming_at_gomez_noshow.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2008 |date=18 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fight Khan knocked Gomez to the canvas in the first round with a barrage of hooks and uppercuts. In the second round, Gomez caught Khan with a left hook, knocking down the younger fighter and exposing his defensive weakness; however, Khan steadied himself after the mandatory eight-count, and cut Gomez above the left eye before the round ended.&lt;ref name="TeleKhan"&gt;{{cite news | first=Mike|last=Lewis | title=Amir Khan given a test by Michael Gomez |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2303807/Amir-Khan-given-a-test-by-Michael-Gomez.html | accessdate=2 August 2009|date=22 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez caught Khan in the ribs with a left hook in the fourth round which left Khan unstable for a moment, but Khan responded with a flurry of hooks and jabs. Khan landed a "cracking left hook" in the fifth,&lt;ref name="Doogan Khan"/&gt; but Gomez beat the count. At 2:32 of the fifth round, referee John Keane stopped the fight when Gomez was knocked into the ropes by a Khan left uppercut.&lt;ref name="IndepKhan"&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan|last=Hubbard | title=Khan cuts loose after early blow | work=[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/boxing-khan-cuts-loose-after-early-blow-852093.html | accessdate=22 May 2008|date=22 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fight, Khan said he felt he had moved up a level by "fighting world class fighters like Gomez."&lt;ref name="SkyKhan"&gt;{{cite web | title=Tough test for Khan | publisher= [[Sky Sports]] | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_3720594,00.html | accessdate=22 May 2008|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the fight, sports writers considered Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, with his "knockout punch" and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances,&lt;ref name="Telegraph Davies"/&gt; despite having lost three of his last six fights.&lt;ref name="skynews june"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gomez next up for Amir | work=[[Sky Sports]]| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12183_3529531,00.html| accessdate=20 June 2008 | date=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez saw the fight as an opportunity to reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how "&lt;nowiki&gt;[t]&lt;/nowiki&gt;his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain".&lt;ref name="Telegraph June"&gt;{{cite news | author=Gareth A Davies | title=Amir Khan contest 'surprises' Michael Gomez | work=[[Daily Telegraph]]| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/2303517/Amir-Khan-contest-surprises-Michael-Gomez.html| accessdate=2 August 2009 | date=17 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying  "Boxing kept my feet on the ground and gave me a focus. It's got me through the bad times and calmed me down. If it wasn't for boxing, I wouldn't have my beautiful wife and family".&lt;ref name="TOL family"/&gt; Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.&lt;ref name="TOL family"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MEN Khan"/&gt;

[[File:Philip Spratt.jpg|thumb|Philip Spratt]]

'''Philip Spratt''' (26 September 1902&amp;nbsp;– 8 March 1971) was a British writer and intellectual. Initially a communist sent by the British arm of the [[Communist International]] ([[Comintern]]), based in Moscow, to spread Communism in India, he subsequently became a friend and colleague of [[M.N. Roy]], founder of the Communist parties in [[Mexico]] and India, and along with him became an anti-communist activist.&lt;ref name=main&gt;[http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article285.html M N Roy] Mainstream, Vol XLV, No 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was among the first architects, and a founding-member of the [[Communist Party of India]], and was among the chief accused in the [[Meerut Conspiracy Case]]; he was arrested on 20 March 1929 and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="Working Class Movement Library"&gt;[http://www.wcml.org.uk/Main/en/contents/international/india/meerut/ "Working Class Movement Library" ''Meerut Conspiracy Trial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102125813/http://www.wcml.org.uk/Main/en/contents/international/india/meerut/ |date=2 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pd.cpim.org/2007/0819/08192007_jyoti%20basu.htm ROLE OF THE COMMUNISTS] ''60 Years of Our Independence and the Left: Some Thoughts'' – [[Jyoti Basu]], ''[[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Communist Party of India]]'' official website."We should remember the contribution of communists [[Rajani Palme Dutt]] (RPD), Clemens Dutt, Philip Spratt and Ben Bradley."&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his reading during his time in jail, and also his observation of political developments in Russia and Western Europe at the time, Philip Spratt renounced Communism in the early 1930s. After India gained independence from the [[British Empire|British]], he was among the lone voices – such as [[Sita Ram Goel]] – against the well-intentioned and fashionable leftist policies of [[Nehru]] and the Indian government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUeyUhVGIDMC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=%22Philip+Spratt%22+communist&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vU8K33PaVw&amp;sig=RZiIDb9Az0mO8UqVMXh6xx5vmV4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Renounced communism..] ''Jawaharlal Nehru:A Biography'', by Sankar Ghose, Allied Publishers, 1993, {{ISBN|81-7023-369-0}}. page 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voiceofdharma.com/books/gagon/for.htm Foreword by Philip Spratt of the Sita Ram Goel's ''Genesis and Growth of Nehruism.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the Editor of ''MysIndia'', a pro-American weekly, and later of ''[[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]]'', a newspaper run by [[C. Rajagopalachari]]. He was also a prolific writer of books, articles and pamphlets on a variety of subjects, and translated books in French, German, Tamil, Sanskrit and Hindi, into English.

==Early life==
Philip Spratt was born in [[Camberwell]] on 26 September 1902 to Herbert Spratt, a schoolmaster, and Norah Spratt. He was one of five boys. His elder brother David Spratt, left boarding school to join the [[British army]] during [[World War I]], and was killed at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in 1917. Although raised a [[Baptist]], Herbert Spratt later joined the [[Church of England]]. Philip Spratt's own rejection of religion came early on: {{quote|"By the age of 17 I had a fair knowledge of nineteenth-century physical science, and I read a little on my own in biology. On Sunday evenings after church I used to take a fast walk round the neighbourhood, and for some months on these walks I argued with myself about science and religion. I decided quite definitely that the religious theory of things was unsound. But I remember no 'conflict' or emotion over my rejection of religion. I kept it entirely to myself, and I still attended church, and continued to do so till I went to the university."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Spratt. ''Blowing Up India: Reminiscences and Reflections of a Comintern Emissary.'' Calcutta: Prachi Prakashan, 1955. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==University and early Communist activity==

Philip Spratt got a university scholarship in 1921 for [[Downing College, Cambridge]], to study Mathematics. He writes in his memoirs: "But I was in no mood to devote myself to my proper studies, or to associate with the dull dogs who stuck to theirs. I dabbled in literature and philosophy and psychology and anthropology." &lt;ref&gt;Philip Spratt. ''Blowing Up India: Reminiscences and Reflections of a Comintern Emissary.'' Calcutta: Prachi Prakashan, 1955. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a First-class degree on completing the Mathematics tripos. He joined the [[Cambridge Union Society|Union Society]], the [[Cambridge Universities Labour Club|University Labour Club]] and a private discussion society called the Heretics, of which [[Charles Kay Ogden]] was President; [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[I.A. Richards]] and [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett]] often attended. Philip Spratt, [[Maurice Dobb]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], [[Ivor Montagu]], the historian Allen Hutt, A.L Bacharach, Barnet Woolf and [[Michael Roberts (writer)]] comprised the tiny handful of Communist Party members at the university at that time. Spratt, Woolf and Roberts would sell the ''Worker's Weekly'' to railwaymen at the town railway station or canvass the working-class areas of Cambridge. Spratt worked, for a while, at the Labour Research Department in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Deptford]], and was a member of the London University Labour Party. 

In 1926, at the age of 24, he was asked by Clemens Dutt (the elder brother of [[Rajani Palme Dutt]]) to journey to India as a Comintern agent to organise the working of the then nascent Communist Party of India, and in particular to launch a Workers and Peasants' Party as a legal cover for their activities. He was expected to arrange for the infiltration of CPI members into the Congress party, trade unions and youth leagues to obtain leadership of them. Spratt was also asked to write a pamphlet on China, urging India to follow the example of the [[Kuomintang]]. He was accompanied to India by Ben Bradley and [[Lester Hutchinson]].

==Move to India==

Spratt was arrested in 1927, on account of some cryptic letters written to and by him that were seized by the Police. He was, however, charged with sedition, on account of the pamphlet entitled ''India and China'' that he had written on Clemens Dutt's instructions. He was tried by jury and – the judge, Mr. Justice Fawcett, having summed up very leniently – they found in his favour. 

[[Hansard]] records show that on 28 November 1927, [[Shapurji Saklatvala]], the MP for Battersea North, questions [[Earl Winterton]] (then Under-Secretary of State for India in Baldwin's government) about the wrongful detention of Philip Spratt for six weeks prior to his trial. 

:::HC Deb 28 November 1927 vol 211 cc15-6

:::§ 32. Mr. SAKLATVALA asked the Under-Secretary of State for India if, in view of the fact that a Mr. Philip Spratt has recently been found not guilty by a jury in India of a charge of sedition in relation to the publication of a pamphlet entitled India and China, he will cause inquiries to be made as to the reason why he was in the first instance refused bail and thus kept in prison for six weeks prior to trial; and whether he will make representations for compensation to be paid to the said British national?

:::§ Earl WINTERTON It appears from the newspapers that bail was refused by Mr. Justice Davar in the High Court of Bombay, and it would not be proper to make inquiries as to the reasons for a decision which was within the competence of the Court. The answer to the second part of the question is in the negative.

:::§ Mr. SAKLATVALA Does the Noble Lord agree that this prosecution was launched by the Government and that the Judge of the High Court refused bail on certain representations which were made by the Government's prosecutor, which representations proved in the end to be untrue?
 
:::§ Earl WINTERTON The hon. Member is bringing a most serious charge against a Judge of the High Court, which I can-not accept for a moment. Judges of the High Court in India, as in this country, judge a question on its merits. Representations were doubtless made by prosecuting counsel, but the Judge is the sole interpreter as to whether they are correct, and I must respectfully decline to discuss on the Floor of the House the conduct of a Judge of the High Court.

:::§ Mr. SAKLATVALA Will the Noble Lord allow me to dispel his dramatic performance? Does the Noble Lord understand my question, which does not put any blame or comment or criticism on the Judge at all? My question is that the Judge, who gave a right decision upon the case presented to him by the Government prosecutor, afterwards, by his judgment, said it was a wrong presentation.

:::§ Earl WINTERTON I do not quite understand the hon. Member's question now. He has asked me whether I will cause inquiry to be made as to the reason why bail was refused. I have informed the hon. Member that I cannot do so because it would be committing a totally improper act, as criticising the action of the Judge. It rests solely with the Judge as to whether bail is granted or not.

:::§ Mr. SPEAKER Clearly, it is a matter for the Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1927/nov/28/mr-philip-spratt-prosecution MR. PHILIP SPRATT (PROSECUTION)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meerut Conspiracy Trial==

In March 1929, almost all the members of the Communist Party of India and about an equal number of trade unionists, congressmen and others who were working alongside them – 30 people in all – were arrested simultaneously in half a dozen different towns and taken to Meerut jail. [[Meerut Conspiracy Case]]

They were charged under Section 121A: conspiring to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty of British India. The body of conspirators was the Comintern and its associated organisations, and in particular the Indian party. 

Spratt was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, which on appeal, was reduced to 2; he was released from jail in October 1934. He discusses the psychology of imprisonment in an article which appeared in the [[Modern Review (Calcutta)]] in 1937. 

It is his time in Meerut – Spratt records in his memoirs – that marked the beginning of his emotional turn away from communism: “When we had been in jail a year or two, the significance of the new Comintern line which we had accepted so uncomprehendingly at Calcutta began to show itself. It compelled the renovated party to split the central trade union body twice within two years, and to direct fierce criticism at the Congress, whose great Civil Disobedience campaigns made our activities look rather silly. We found fault with what was being done, but we did not direct our attack at the persons really responsible, viz. the Comintern authorities in Moscow… My own feelings were not of doubt or criticism but of boredom. I was closely involved in the preparation of the defence case, an immense and tedious job, and in the politics of the jail and the party outside. I gradually lost interest in all three, and became absorbed in reading and writing on other subjects… I have no doubt that here was the beginning of an emotional turn away from communism.” &lt;ref&gt;Philip Spratt. ''Blowing Up India: Reminiscences and Reflections of a Comintern Emissary.'' Calcutta: Prachi Prakashan, 1955. p. 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1934 he was arrested again and interned under the emergency legislation passed to suppress [[Civil Disobedience]]. He spent 18 months in the Fort at [[Belgaum]], and was released finally in June 1936. 

During his time in Meerut, Spratt learnt to read Hindi and one of the first books he read was ''Atmakatha'' by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. On doing so, he resolved to write a study of Gandhi and while in Belgaum wrote his book on the Mahatma entitled ''Gandhism: An Analysis''. While in confinement, Spratt also wrote the foreword for ''Peshawar to Moscow: Leaves from an Indian Muhajireen's Diary'' by [[Shaukat Usmani]].

==Personal life==

Soon after his release in 1934, he became engaged to Seetha, the grand-niece of [[Malayapuram Singaravelu Chettiar]], who was a barrister and a founding member of the Communist Party in the south of India.  Philip and Seetha married in 1939, and had four children: Herbert Mohan Spratt, Arjun Spratt, Radha Norah Spratt and Robert Spratt.

==Post-Meerut life in India==

Spratt began to write strongly in criticism of Soviet policy after the Russian invasion of Finland in 1939. In 1943, he joined M. N. Roy’s [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]], and remained a fairly active member until the party ceased to exist in 1948. In 1951, Spratt became secretary of the newly formed Indian Congress for Cultural Freedom, and a frequent contributor to its bulletin, ''Freedom First''. He settled in [[Bengaluru|Bangalore]], and was the Chief Editor of a pro-American and pro-Capitalist weekly named ''MysIndia'', until 1964.&lt;ref name="Shroff"&gt;{{harvnb|Guha|2008|pp=692–693}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its columns, he criticised the policies of the government which he believed, 'treated the entrepreneur as a criminal who has dared to use his brains independently of the state to create wealth and give employment'. He further believed that the result would be 'the smothering of free enterprise, a famine of consumer goods, and the tying down of millions of workers to soul deadening techniques'.&lt;ref name="Shroff"/&gt;

Spratt believed that the [[Kashmir valley]] should be granted independence. In 1952, he stated that India must abandon its claim to the valley and allow the [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] leader [[Sheikh Abdullah]] to 'dream of independence'. It should withdraw its armies and write off its loans to the state government.&lt;ref name="Spratt"&gt;{{harvnb|Guha|2008|pp=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated:&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;
{{quote|"Let Kashmir go ahead, alone and adventurously, in her explorations of a secular state. We shall watch the act of faith with due sympathy but at a safe distance, our honour, our resources and our future free from the enervating entaglements which write a lie in our soul."}} He argued that Indian policy was based on a 'mistaken belief in the one-nation theory and greed to own the beautiful and strategic valley of [[Srinagar]]'.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt; He further stated that the costs of this policy, present and future, were incalculable, and that rather than give Kashmir special privileges and create resentment elsewhere in India, it was best to let the state secede.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;  

Spratt later moved to [[Madras]], and edited the ''[[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]]'', which was a newspaper run by [[C. Rajagopalachari]], and a mouthpiece of the [[Swatantra Party]]. During these years he also wrote several books on diverse subjects, numerous pamphlets and also translated books from French, German, Tamil, Sanskrit and Hindi, into English. He died of cancer on 8 March 1971, in Madras.

The '''Piasa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɔː}} {{respell|PY|ə-saw}}) or '''Piasa Bird''' is a Native American [[dragon]] depicted in one of two [[murals]] painted by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on bluffs (cliffsides) above the [[Mississippi River]]. Its original location was at the end of a chain of limestone bluffs in Madison County, Illinois at present-day [[Alton, Illinois]].  The original Piasa illustration no longer exists; a newer 20th-century version, based partly on 19th-century sketches and lithographs, has been placed on a bluff in Alton, Illinois, several hundred yards upstream from its origin.  The location of the present-day mural is at 38.898055, -90.19915.  The [[limestone]] rock quality on the new site is unsuited for holding an image, and the painting must be regularly restored.  The original site of the painting was a high-quality (6–8 foot thick) layer of [[lithographic limestone]], which was predominantly quarried away in the late 1870s by the Mississippi Lime Company.&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi Lime Co. records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dragons: A Natural History by Karl Shuker&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murals==
The ancient mural was created prior to the arrival of any [[European ethnic groups|European]] explorers in the region, and possibly before 1200 CE.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The location of the image was at a river-bluff terminus of the [[American Bottoms]] floodplain. It may have been an older [[iconograph]] from the large [[Mississippian culture]] city of [[Cahokia]], which began developing about 900 CE. Cahokia was at its peak about 1200 CE, with 20,000 to 30,000 residents. It was the largest prehistoric city north of Mexico and a major [[chiefdom]]. Icons and animal pictographs, such as [[falcon]]s, thunder-birds, bird men, and monstrous snakes were common motifs of the Cahokia culture. The Piasa creature may have been painted as a graphic symbol to warn strangers traveling down the Mississippi River that they were entering Cahokian territory.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Washington SP petroglyph Dec2011 n28.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An eagle petroglyph at Washington State Park in Missouri]]
An ''Alton Evening Telegraph'' newspaper article of May 27, 1921 stated that seven smaller painted images, believed to be of archaic American Indian origin, were found in the early 20th century about 1.5 miles upriver from the ancient Piasa creature's location. These pictures were carved and painted in rocks located in the Levis Bluffs area by George Dickson and William Turk in 1905.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Four of these paintings were of "an owl, a sun circle, a squirrel, and a piece showing two birds or some kind of animals in a contest", the other three paintings were of "a great animal, perhaps a lion, and another an animal about as large as a dog".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} These paintings were photographed by Prof. William McAdams and were to be placed in his book ''Records of Ancient Races in the Mississippi Valley: being an account of some of the pictographs, sculptured hieroglyphs, symbolic devices, emblems and traditions of the prehistoric races of America, with some suggestions as to their origin'', William McAdams, C. R. Barns Publishing Co., 1887. {available on Google Books}. These seven archaic American Indian paintings have been lost in recorded annals as they were to have been in transit to the Missouri Historical Society c. 1922. Other Native American carved petroglyphs of a similar time period and region as the Piasa monster are carved into the rocks at [[Washington State Park]] in [[Missouri]] about 60 miles southwest of the current Piasa image.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The 1797-1798 map of French explorer Nicolas De Finiels' shows the cliffs above the Piasa labeled as ''Hauteurs De Paillisa'' (source archives Versailles, France "Carte d'une Partie Du Cours Du Mississippi"). (Partial source: See Costa 2005: 297)

An earlier 1778 map titled "A new map of the western parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and North Carolina; comprehending the river Ohio, and all the rivers, which fall into it; part of the river Mississippi, the whole of the Illinois River, ... Author Hutchins, Thomas, 1730-1789" clearly shows the place name "PIASAS" where the present day City of Alton is located and bounded by the Wood River to the east.

In 1673,&lt;ref&gt;Marquette, Jacques. Journal. The Jesuit Relations: Natives and Missionaries in Seventeenth-Century North America. Allan Greer, ed. Bedford/St. Martin's: Boston, New york, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Father [[Jacques Marquette]] saw the painting on a limestone bluff overlooking the [[Mississippi River]] while exploring the area. He recorded the following description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"While Skirting some rocks, which by Their height and length inspired awe, We saw upon one of them two painted monsters which at first made Us afraid, and upon Which the boldest savages dare not Long rest their eyes. They are as large As a calf; they have Horns on their heads Like those of a deer, a horrible look, red eyes, a beard Like a tiger's, a face somewhat like a man's, a body Covered with scales, and so Long A tail that it winds all around the Body, passing above the head and going back between the legs, ending in a Fish's tail. Green, red, and black are the three Colors composing the Picture. Moreover, these 2 monsters are so well painted that we cannot believe that any savage is their author; for good painters in France would find it difficult to reach that place Conveniently to paint them. Here is approximately The shape of these monsters, As we have faithfully Copied It."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Later French explorers, like St. Cosme, reported that by 1699 the series of images were badly worn due to the habits of the local Indians to "discharge their weapons" at the images as they passed.  Author A. D. Jones, in his book "Illinois and the West" c. 1838, also describes the ravages of weapons (firearms) upon the images, and further refers to the paintings as being named "Piasua".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

This original was the largest Native American painting ever found in North America.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==John Russell account==
[[File:Piasa P7090004.JPG|thumb|Restored Piasa Bird carving along the Mississippi River near the junction with the Illinois River.]]The monster depicted in the mural was first referred to as the "Piasa Bird" in an article published c. 1836 by [[John Russell of Bluffdale|John Russell]] of [[Eldred, Illinois|Bluffdale, Illinois]]. John Russell was an imaginative professor of Greek and Latin at [[Shurtleff College]], Upper Alton, Illinois. The article was entitled "The Tradition of The Piasa" and Russell claimed the origin of the word to be from a nearby stream: "This stream is the Piasa. Its name is Indian, and signifies, in the Illini, "''The Bird That Devours Men''"." (note: The original "Piasa Creek" ran through the main ravine in downtown Alton, and was completely covered by huge drainage pipes c. 1912.) According to the story published by Russell, the creature depicted by the painting was a huge bird that lived in the cliffs. Russell claimed that this creature attacked and devoured people in nearby Indian villages shortly after the corpses of a war gave it a taste for human flesh. The legend claims that a local Indian chief, named Chief ''Ouatoga'', managed to slay the monster using a plan given to him in a dream from the [[Great Spirit]]. The chief ordered his bravest warriors to hide near the entrance of the Piasa Bird's cave, which Russell also claimed to have explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Beyond Belief|publisher=Scholastic|year=1991|pages=38–39|chapter=Giant Birds, Beasts, and Human Skeletons of Great Size|isbn=0-590-44252-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouatoga then acted as bait to lure the creature out into the open. As the monster flew down toward the Indian chief, his warriors slew it with a volley of poisoned arrows. Russell claimed that the mural was painted by the Indians as a commemoration of this heroic event.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Some sources report that this account was simply a story created by John Russell. In the book ''Records of Ancient Races in the Mississippi Valley...'' Chapter 2, 1887 by W. McAdams, the author says he contacted John Russell and Russell admitted the story was fabricated.
The bird imagery is not reported in Father Marquette's description, which makes no mention of wings. It is also possible that Marquette's description and Russell's account were both accurate for their respective times.  The image may have been repainted at some point between 1673 and 1836 to revise its appearance and [[iconography]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

When contemporary [[historian]]s, [[folklorist]]s, and tourism promoters are looking for a narrative description of the story behind the Piasa "Bird", they often rely on Russell's account. This colorful version of the tale can be adapted to allow a wide range of interpretation and allow other cities and counties to claim promotional rights to the legend.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The '''political career of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]''' began in 1994, when Berlusconi entered politics for the first time serving intermittent terms as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006 and 2008 to 2011, his career was racked with [[Controversies surrounding Silvio Berlusconi|controversies]] and [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi|trials]]; amongst these was his failure to honour his promise to sell his personal assets in [[Mediaset]], the largest television broadcaster network in Italy, in order to dispel any perceived [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].

== Political career ==
In the early 1990s, the five pro-western governing parties, [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (''Democrazia Cristiana''), the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[Italian Social-Democratic Party]], the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Italian Liberal Party]], lost much of their electoral strength almost overnight due to a large number of judicial investigations concerning the financial corruption of many of their foremost members (see the [[Mani Pulite]] affair). This led to a general expectation that upcoming elections would be won by the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], the heirs to the former [[Italian Communist Party]], and their [[Alliance of Progressives]] coalition unless there was an alternative. On 26 January 1994, Berlusconi announced his decision to  "enter the field", presenting his own political party, [[Forza Italia]], on a platform focused on protecting Italy from ''[[communism|the Communists]]''. His political aim was to convince the voters of the Pentapartito, (i.e. the usual five governing parties) who were shocked and confused by [[Mani Pulite]] scandals, that [[Forza Italia]] offered both novelty and the continuation of the pro-western free market policies followed by Italy since the end of the [[World War II|2nd World War]]. Shortly after he decided to enter the political [[arena]], investigators into the [[Mani Pulite]] affair were said to be close to issuing warrants for the arrest of Berlusconi and senior executives of his business group. During his years of political career Berlusconi has maintained that the Mani Pulite investigations were led by communist [[prosecutors]] who wanted to establish a [[Soviet Union|soviet]]-style government in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/060compecon/Europe%20West/Italy/060330berlusc.txt | title = As Italy Votes, Golden Career Of Berlusconi Is at Crossroads | publisher = Wall Street Journal|date=30 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=385&amp;p=2 | title = Italian Election, The Prelude | publisher = [[The American (magazine)|The American]] | date = 1 April 2006 | access-date = 12 January 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222014325/http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?article=385&amp;p=2# | archive-date = 22 February 2014 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994 electoral victory ===

In order to win the [[Italian general election, 1994|March 1994 general election]] Berlusconi formed two separate electoral alliances: [[Pole of Freedoms]] (''Polo delle Libertà'') with the [[Lega Nord]] (''Northern League'') in northern Italian districts, and another, the [[Pole of Good Government]] (''Polo del Buon Governo''), with the post-fascist [[Alleanza Nazionale|National Alliance]] (''Alleanza Nazionale''; heir to the [[Italian Social Movement]]) in central and southern regions.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a shrewd pragmatic move, he did not ally with the latter in the North because the League disliked them. As a result, [[Forza Italia]] was allied with two parties that were not allied with each other.

Berlusconi launched a massive campaign of electoral advertisements on his three TV networks. He subsequently won the elections, with [[Forza Italia]] garnering 21% of the popular vote, the highest percentage of any single party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://elezionistorico.interno.it/liste.php?tp=C&amp;dt=27/03/1994&amp;cta=I&amp;tpEnte=A&amp;tpSeg=C&amp;numEnte=0&amp;sut1=&amp;sut2=&amp;sut3=&amp;descEnte=&amp;descArea=ITALIA&amp;codTipoSegLeader= | title = Elezioni della Camera dei Deputati del 27 Marzo 1994 | language = Italian | publisher = [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090612091446/http://elezionistorico.interno.it/liste.php?tp=C&amp;dt=27%2F03%2F1994&amp;cta=I&amp;tpEnte=A&amp;tpSeg=C&amp;numEnte=0&amp;sut1=&amp;sut2=&amp;sut3=&amp;descEnte=&amp;descArea=ITALIA&amp;codTipoSegLeader= | archivedate = 12 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant promises that he made in order to secure victory was that his government would create "one million more jobs". He was appointed Prime Minister in 1994, but his term in office was short because of the inherent contradictions in his coalition: the League, a regional party with a strong electoral base in northern Italy, was at that time fluctuating between [[federalist]] and [[separatist]] positions, and the National Alliance was a [[nationalist]] party that had yet to renounce [[neo-fascism]] at the time.

=== Fall of the Berlusconi I cabinet ===
In December 1994, following the communication of a new investigation from Milan magistrates that was leaked to the press, [[Umberto Bossi]], leader of the [[Lega Nord]], left the coalition claiming that the [[electoral pact]] had not been respected, forcing Berlusconi to resign from office and shifting the majority's weight to the centre-left side. Lega Nord also resented the fact that many of its MPs had switched to Forza Italia, allegedly lured by promises of more prestigious portfolios. In 1998 various articles attacking Berlusconi were published by Lega Nord's official newspaper (www.lapadania.it), with titles such as "La Fininvest è nata da Cosa Nostra"&amp;nbsp;– "Fininvest (Berlusconi's principal company) was founded by the Mafia".

Berlusconi remained  prime minister for a little over a month until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by [[Lamberto Dini]]. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said the only way he would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was only supported by most opposition parties but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and was replaced by a centre-left government led by [[Romano Prodi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forza-italia.it/notizie/int_2817.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313005130/http://www.forza-italia.it/notizie/int_2817.htm |archivedate=13 March 2007 | title = The First Seven Years Of Forza Italia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electoral victory of 2001 ===

In 2001 Berlusconi again ran as leader of the centre-right coalition [[House of Freedoms]] ({{lang-it|La Casa delle Libertà}}), which included the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], the [[Lega Nord]], the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the [[Italian general election, 2001|May 2001 general election]] led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 45.4% of the vote for the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] and 42.5% for the [[Italian Senate|Senate]].

On the television interviews programme ''[[Porta a Porta]]'', during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a ''Contratto con gli Italiani'' ({{lang-en|[[Contract with the Italians]]}}), an idea apparently conceived by his advisor Luigi Crespi and inspired by [[Newt Gingrich]]'s [[Contract with America]] introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | date = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 campaign bid for prime ministership. In this solemn agreement, Berlusconi claimed his commitment on improving several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed); secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate; thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros; and fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = Il mulino
  | date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.

=== The Berlusconi II cabinet ===
[[File:Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush and Silvio Berlusconi.jpg|250px|thumb|From left to right: [[Bill Clinton]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[George W. Bush]] and Silvio Berlusconi.]]
Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his ''Contratto con gli Italiani''. Some of his partners in government, especially the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] have admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself has consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided ''un miracolo continuo'' (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognize these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the printed media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/politica/campagna3/goveber/goveber.html |title=Berlusconi: 'Successi straordinari Contro di me l'85% dei giornali', La Repubblica, 24 maggio 2004 |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=2004-05-24 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luca Ricolfi]], an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to maintain only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension levels. The other four promises were not, in Luca Ricolfi’s view, honoured. In particular, the undertakings on the tax simplification and the reduction of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Subsequent elections ===
[[House of Freedoms]] did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.

=== The Berlusconi III cabinet ===
In the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), the [[centre-left]] gubernatorial candidates won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and governorships was at stake. Berlusconi's coalition kept only two of the regional bodies ([[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]]) up for re-election. Three parties, [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and [[New Italian Socialist Party]], threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. The Italian [[Premier]], after some hesitation, then presented to the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]] a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point required by the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (and to a lesser extent by [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction central to the government's ambitions be changed.

=== The 2006 elections ===

Operating under a new electoral law written unilaterally by the governing parties over strong criticism from the [[parliamentary opposition]] the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 general election]] was held. The results of this election handed [[Romano Prodi]]'s centre-left coalition, known as [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]], (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition [[House of Freedoms]] in the [[Lower House]] and a two-senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the House of Freedoms). The Court of Cassation has subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional.

According to the new electoral rules, The Union, (nicknamed "[[The Soviet Union]]" by Silvio Berlusconi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.repubblica.it/2005/b/sezioni/politica/cdltre/berlusparla/berlusparla.html | title = Berlusconi sull'Unione "Rimpiangono quella Sovietica" | language = Italian | publisher = [[la Repubblica]]|date=11 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) with a margin of only 25,224 votes (out of over 38 million voters), nevertheless won 348 seats (compared to 281 for the House of Freedoms) in the lower house as a result of a majority premium given to whichever coalition of parties was awarded more votes.&lt;br /&gt;
Ironically, the same electoral law that Berlusconi's coalition had approved shortly before the election in order to win the election, caused his defeat and gave Prodi the chance to form a new cabinet. However Prodi's [[coalition government|coalition]] consisted of a large number of smaller parties. If only one of the nine parties forming The Union withdrew its support to Prodi, his government would have collapsed. This situation was ''also'' the result of the new "''diabolic''" electoral system.&lt;ref name="BBC glee"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208705.stm | title = Will Italian opposition's glee last? | publisher = BBC News|date=25 January 2008|accessdate=27 January 2008 | first=Christian | last=Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centrist parties such as the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] immediately conceded The Union's victory, while other parties, like Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League, refused to accept its validity, right up until 2 May 2006, when Berlusconi submitted his resignation to President Ciampi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4963882.stm | title = Berlusconi resigns as Italian PM | publisher = BBC News|date=2 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "running board revolution": 2008 electoral victory and formation of a new party ===
Following the run-up to the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]] there had been talk among some of the components of the [[House of Freedoms]] regarding a possible merger into a "united party of moderates and reformers". [[Forza Italia]], the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] party of [[Gianfranco Fini]], and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] of [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]] all seemed interested in the project. Soon after the election, however, Casini started to distance his party from its historical allies.

On 2 December 2006, during a major demonstration of the centre-right in Rome against the [[Prodi II Cabinet|government led by Romano Prodi]], Silvio Berlusconi proposed the foundation of a "''Freedom Party''", stressing that the people and the voters of the different political movements adhering to the demonstration were all part of a "''people of freedom''".[[File:People of Freedom logo.PNG|thumb|175px|[[The People of Freedom]]]]

After the sudden fall of the [[Prodi II Cabinet]] on 24 January, the break-up of [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] coalition and [[2008 Italian political crisis|the subsequent political crisis]] (which paved the way for a [[Italian general election, 2008|fresh general election on April 2008]]), Berlusconi, [[Gianfranco Fini]] and other party leaders finally agreed on 8 February 2008 to form a joint list named "'''''[[The People of Freedom]]'''''" ({{lang-it|Il Popolo della Libertà}}), allied with the ''[[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]]'' of Umberto Bossi and with the Sicilian ''[[Movement for Autonomy]]'' of [[Raffaele Lombardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp | title = Svolta di Berlusconi, arriva il Pdl: "Forza Italia-An sotto stesso simbolo" | language = Italian | publisher = [[La Stampa]] | date = 8 February 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029214056/http://www1.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp | archivedate = 29 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Italian general election, 2008|snap parliamentary elections held on 13/14 April 2008]] this coalition won against [[Walter Veltroni]]'s centre-left coalition in both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]].

In the 315-member Senate of the Republic, Berlusconi's coalition won 174 seats to Veltroni's 134. In the [[lower house]], Berlusconi's conservative bloc led by a margin of 9% of the vote: 46.5% (344 seats) to 37.5% (246 seats). Berlusconi capitalised on discontent over the nation's stagnating [[Economy of Italy|economy]] and the unpopularity of [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi's government]]. His declared top priorities were to remove piles of trash from the streets of [[Naples]] and to improve the state of the Italian economy, which had underperformed the rest of the [[Eurozone]] for years. He also said he was open to working with the opposition, and pledged to fight [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]], reform justice and reduce public debt. He intended to reduce the number of [[Prodi II Cabinet|Cabinet ministers]] to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/15/italy.election.ap/index.html|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi and his ministers ([[Berlusconi IV Cabinet]]) were sworn in on 8 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link| url = http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=485635&amp;lng=1|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2008 the National Council of [[Forza Italia]], chaired by [[Alfredo Biondi]] and attended by Berlusconi himself, dissolved Forza Italia and established [[The People of Freedom]], whose inauguration took place on 27 March 2009, the 15th anniversary of Berlusconi's first electoral victory.

While Forza Italia had never held a formal party congress to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of Forza Italia have been held, all of them resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009 at the foundation congress of the [[People of Freedom]] political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval. On 5820 voting delegates 5811 voted in favour, 4 against and 5 abstained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://giornaleonline.unionesarda.ilsole24ore.com/Articolo.aspx?Data=20090330&amp;Categ=1&amp;Voce=2&amp;IdArticolo=2336849 |title=La Russa, Verdini, Bondi: ecco il triumvirato |language=Italian |publisher=[[L'Unione Sarda]] |date=30 March 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that political congress Silvio Berlusconi was elected as [[Chairman]] of the [[People of Freedom]] by handraising.

=== The People of Freedom split and the fall of the Berlusconi IV cabinet ===
{{See also|The People of Freedom|Future and Freedom}}

Between 2009 and 2010 [[Gianfranco Fini]], former leader of the conservative National Alliance (AN) and President of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]], became a vocal critic of the leadership of Berlusconi. Fini departed from party's majority line on several issues but, most of all, he was a proponent of a more structured party organisation. His criticism was aimed at the leadership style of Berlusconi, who tends to rely on his personal charisma to lead the party from the centre and supports a lighter form of party, which in his mind should be a movement-party that organises itself only at election times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/16/premier_consegna_prime_case_Poi_co_8_090916015.shtml | title = Il premier consegna le prime case Poi l' attacco in tv | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2010 an association named [[Generation Italy]] was launched in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different party organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/marzo/15/Via_Generazione_Italia_nuova_associazione_co_9_100315008.shtml | title = Via a Generazione Italia la nuova associazione "benedetta" da Fini | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=2010-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2010 the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year. The conflict between Fini and Berlusconi was covered live by television. At the end of the day a resolution proposed by Berlusconi's loyalists was put before the assembly and approved by a landslide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/aprile/23/sfida_del_cofondatore_Non_sono_co_8_100423002.shtml | title = La sfida del cofondatore "Non sono un dipendente Sarà lui a bruciarsi" | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=2010-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2010 the party executive released a document in which Fini was described as "incompatible" with the political line of the PdL and unable to perform his job of President of the Chamber of Deputies in a neutral way. Berlusconi asked Fini to step down and the executive proposed the suspension from party membership of three MPs who had harshly criticized Berlusconi and accused some party members of criminal offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2010/07/29/news/pdl_il_documento_dell_ufficio_di_presidenza-5938625/?ref=HREA-1 | title = Pdl, il documento dell'Ufficio di Presidenza | publisher = Repubblica.it |date=2010-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As response, Fini and his followers formed their own groups in both chambers under the name of [[Future and Freedom]] (FLI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/luglio/31/Via_gruppi_finiani_Qualche_difficolta_co_8_100731003.shtml | title = Via ai gruppi finiani "Qualche difficoltà ma numeri importanti" | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/01/Previsioni_sbagliate_sui_numeri_nel_co_8_100801004.shtml | title = Previsioni sbagliate sui numeri: nel mirino le fedelissime | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/02/Finiani_pronto_gruppo_anche_Senato_co_9_100802014.shtml | title = Finiani, pronto il gruppo anche al Senato | publisher = Corriere della Sera |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/node/16743353 | title = Italy's political crisis: A FLI in his ear | publisher = The Economist |date=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon clear that FLI would leave the PdL and become an independent party. On 7 November, during a convention in [[Bastia Umbra]], Fini asked Berlusconi to step down from his post of Prime Minister and proposed a new government including the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]] (UdC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/novembre/08/Fini_premier_dimetta_noi_lasceremo_co_8_101108064.shtml |title=Fini: "Il premier si dimetta o noi lasceremo il governo" |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the four FLI members of the government resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/novembre/16/finiani_fuori_dal_governo_Duello_co_9_101116035.shtml |title=I finiani fuori dal governo Duello sul voto di fiducia |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December FLI voted against Berlusconi in a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, a vote won by Berlusconi by 314 to 311.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/novembre/17/Dal_Pdl_Fli_andata_ritorno_co_8_101117015.shtml |title=Dal Pdl a Fli, andata e ritorno Angeli: vedrò il Cavaliere |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/dicembre/15/Sfida_Aula_governo_passa_per_co_9_101215011.shtml |title=Sfida in Aula, il governo passa per tre voti |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 the party suffered a big blow in local elections.

On 1 July the National Council modified the party's constitution and Alfano was elected secretary almost unanimously. In his acceptance speech, Alfano proposed the introduction of primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/luglio/02/Svolta_nel_Pdl_Alfano_segretario_co_9_110702007.shtml |title=Svolta nel Pdl, Alfano segretario "Voglio un partito degli onesti" |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation ===
On 10 October the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] rejected the law on the budget of the State proposed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/11_ottobre_11/governo-camera-rendiconto-berlusconi_aa9115e4-f41b-11e0-8382-87e70525ad6b.shtml |title=Redazione Online.

While he resigned crowds of his opponents sang the hallelujah portion of [[Messiah (Handel)|George Frederick Handel’s "Messiah"]], demonstrating their approval of the decision; there was also dancing in the streets outside the [[Quirinal Palace]], the official residence of the [[President of Italy]], where Berlusconi went to tender his resignation.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-12 Nov" /&gt;

The austerity package was passed, it will raise €59.8&amp;nbsp;billion in savings from spending cuts and tax raises, including freezing public-sector salaries until 2014 and gradually increasing the retirement age for women in the private sector from 60 in 2014 to 65 in 2026.&lt;ref name="BBC-12 Nov" /&gt; The resignation also came at a difficult time for Berlusconi, as he was involved in numerous [[Trials and allegations involving Silvio Berlusconi|trials for corruption, fraud and sex offences]]. He was often found guilty in lower courts but is alleged to have used loopholes in Italy's legal system to evade incarceration.&lt;ref name="BBC-12 Nov" /&gt;

Berlusconi had also failed to meet some of his pre-election promises and had failed to prevent economic decline and introduce serious reforms.&lt;ref name="BBC-12 Nov" /&gt; Many believed that the problems and doubts over Berlusconi's leadership and his coalition were one of the factors that contributed to market anxieties over an imminent Italian financial disaster, which could have a potentially catastrophic effect on the 17-nation eurozone and the world economy.&lt;ref name="The Independent-8 Nov" /&gt; Many critics of Berlusconi accused him of using his power primarily to protect his own business ventures.&lt;ref name="BBC-12 Nov" /&gt; [[Umberto Bossi]], leader of the [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]], a partner in Berlusconi's right-wing coalition, was quoted as informing reporters outside parliament, "We asked the prime minister to step aside."&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, John; Squires, Nick (November 10, 2011).

==== Announcement ====
[[File:Pigna_-_palazzo_Grazioli_1170066.JPG|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Grazioli]]]]
[[CNN]] reported on 7 November that Berlusconi had previously denied the rumors that he was going to resign and had stated on his Facebook page that "The rumors of my resignation are groundless."&lt;ref name="CNN-7 Nov" /&gt; On 12 November 2011, after a final meeting with his cabinet, Berlusconi met Italian president [[Giorgio Napolitano]] at the Quirinal Palace to tender his resignation.&lt;ref name="HuffingtonPost-13 Nov" /&gt; He announced this to the Italian public by telephone on one of his television channels.&lt;ref name="Guardian-8 Nov-own-tv" /&gt; Italian news agency [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] reported that Berlusconi had remarked to his aides that "This is something that deeply saddens me".&lt;ref name="HuffingtonPost-13 Nov" /&gt; Berlusconi conceded that he had lost his parliamentary majority and concluded that "things like who leads or who doesn't lead the government was less important than doing what is right for the country." Berlusconi issued a statement that he would not stand for office in Italy again after the budget defeat.&lt;ref name="Metro-9 Nov" /&gt; In his resignation he was said to have also mentioned "eight traitors", former allies who had abstained.&lt;ref name="The Independent-8 Nov" /&gt;

As he arrived at the Quirinal Palace, a hostile crowd gathered with banners shouting insults at Berlusconi and throwing coins at the car and some 200 people marched down Via del Corso yelling "resign, resign!".&lt;ref name="HuffingtonPost-13 Nov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-12 Nov" /&gt; After his resignation, the booing and jeering continued as he left in his convoy, with the public shouting words such as "buffoon" and "[[Sicilian Mafia|mafioso]]".&lt;ref name="BBC-12 Nov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph-13 Nov" /&gt; An orchestra performed the hallelujah portion of [[Messiah (Handel)|Händel's "Messiah"]] and the Dies Irae portion of [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart's "Requiem"]] outside the Quirinal Palace, with vocal accompaniment and dancing in the streets.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-12 Nov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CorSera-12 Nov" /&gt; ''[[La Repubblica]]''{{'}}s headline on 13 November was "Berlusconi leaves, party in the streets" whilst ''[[La Stampa]]''{{'}}s headline read "Berlusconi bids farewell, now for Monti".&lt;ref name="Telegraph-13 Nov" /&gt;

'''Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Семён Константи́нович Тимоше́нко}}, ''Semën Konstantinovič Timošenko''; {{lang-uk|Семе́н Костянти́нович Тимоше́нко}}, ''Semen Kostiantynovych Tymoshenko'') ({{OldStyleDate|18 February|1895|6 February}}&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 1970) was a Soviet military commander and [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]].

==Early life==
Timoshenko was born into a peasant family of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] ethnicity&lt;ref name="Twentieth Century"&gt;Wojciech Roszkowski, Jan Kofman (2016). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_HGlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1030&amp;lpg=PA1030 Biographical Dictionary of Central and Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century]''". p.1030. {{ISBN|1317475941}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Furmanivka, Odessa Oblast|Furmanivka]], in the [[Budjak]] region&lt;ref&gt;[http://warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=896 warheroes.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; (Southern [[Bessarabia]], present-day [[Odessa Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]).

==Military career==

===First World War===
In 1914, he was drafted into the army of the [[Russian Empire]] and served as a [[cavalry]]man on Russia's western front. On the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, he sided with the Bolsheviks, joining the [[Red Army]] in 1918{{sfn|Glantz|House|2009|p=41}} and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] in 1919.{{sfn|Axelrod|Kingston|2007|p=813}}

===The Russian Civil War and the 1930s===
During the [[Russian Civil War]], Timoshenko fought on various fronts. His most important encounter occurred at Tsaritsyn (later renamed [[Stalingrad]]), where he commanded a cavalry regiment, and met and befriended [[Joseph Stalin]], who was responsible for the city's defense.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2009|p=41}} This connection would ensure his rapid advancement after Stalin gained control of the Communist Party by the end of the 1920s. In 1920–1921, Timoshenko served under [[Semyon Budyonny]] in the [[1st Cavalry Army]]; he and Budyonny would become the core of the "Cavalry Army [[clique]]" which, under Stalin's patronage, would dominate the Red Army for many years.

Timoshenko fought against Polish forces in Kiev and then against [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|Pyotr Wrangel]]'s [[White movement|White Army]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]].&lt;ref name="Twentieth Century"/&gt; By the end of the Civil and [[Polish–Soviet War]]s, Timoshenko had become the commander of the Red Army cavalry forces. Thereafter, under Stalin, he became Red Army commander in [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]] (1933); in [[Kiev]] (1935); in the northern [[Caucasus]] and then [[Kharkov]] (1937); and Kiev again (1938). In 1939, he was given command of the entire western border region and led the [[Ukrainian Front (1939)|Ukrainian Front]] during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet occupation of eastern Poland]]. He also became a member of the Communist Party's [[Central Committee]]. Due to being a loyal friend of Stalin, Timoshenko survived the [[Great Purge]] to become the Red Army's senior professional soldier.

===The Winter War===
In January 1940, Timoshenko took charge of the Soviet armies fighting [[Finland]] in the [[Soviet-Finnish War]]. This had begun the previous November, under the disastrous command of [[Kliment Voroshilov]]. Under Timoshenko's leadership, the Soviets succeeded in breaking through the Finnish [[Mannerheim Line]] on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], prompting Finland to sue for peace in March. His reputation increased, Timoshenko was made the [[People's Commissar]] for Defence and a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in May, replacing Stalin's crony [[Kliment Voroshilov|Marshal Voroshilov]] as the minister of Defence.

British historian [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although by no means a military intellectual, Timoshenko had at least passed through the higher command courses of the Red Army and was a fully trained 'commander-commissar'. During the critical period of the military purge, Stalin had used Timoshenko as a military district commander who could hold key appointments while their incumbents were liquidated or exiled.{{sfn|Erickson|1999|pp=96, 107}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Timoshenko was a competent but traditionalist military commander who nonetheless saw the urgent need to modernise the Red Army if, as expected, it was to fight a war against [[Nazi Germany]]. Overcoming the opposition of other more conservative leaders, he undertook the [[mechanisation]] of the Red Army and the production of more [[tank]]s. He also reintroduced much of the traditional harsh discipline of the Tsarist Russian Army{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}.

In June 1940, Timoshenko ordered the formation of the [[Baltic Military District]] in the occupied [[Baltic states]].

===World War II===
[[File:Маршал Тимошенко 1940 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Timoshenko in 1940]]
Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Timoshenko was named chairman of [[Stavka]], the Soviet Armed Forces High Command, on June 23, 1941.&lt;ref name="ZiemkeBauer1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Earl Frederick Ziemke|author2=Magna E. Bauer|title=Moscow to Stalingrad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjOxtqM8768C&amp;pg=PA30|year=1987|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-080081-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1941, Stalin replaced Timoshenko as Defense Commissar and Stavka's chairman before sending him to the [[Soviet Central Front|Central Front]] and [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]]{{sfn|Glantz|House|2009|p=41}} to supervise a fighting retreat from the border to [[Smolensk]]. In September, he was transferred to the [[Ukraine]] to replace Budyonny and restore order in the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] at the gates of [[Kiev]]. In November and December 1941 Timoshenko organized major counter offensives in the [[Battle of Rostov (1941)#Rostov Offensive Operation|Rostov]] region, as well as carving a bridgehead into German defenses south of [[Kharkov]] in January 1942.{{sfn|Glantz|House|2009|p=41}}

In May 1942, Timoshenko, with 640,000 men, launched a counter-offensive (the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]]) which was the first Soviet attempt to gain initiative in the springtime war. After initial Soviet successes, the Germans struck back at Timoshenko's exposed southern flank, halting the offensive, encircling Timoshenko's armies, and turning the battle into [[Second Battle of Kharkov#Analysis and conclusions|a major Soviet defeat]].

General [[Georgy Zhukov]]'s success in defending Moscow during December 1941 had persuaded Stalin that he was a better commander than Timoshenko.{{fact|date=February 2017}} Stalin removed Timoshenko from front-line command, giving him roles as overall commander of the Stalingrad (June 1942), then North-Western (October 1942), [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (June 1943), [[Caucasus]] (June 1944) and [[Baltic region|Baltic]] (August 1944) fronts.

Between 15 August 1945 and 15 September 1945, Marshal Timoshenko traveled alone to review the [[Staryya Darohi|Starye Dorogi]] [[displaced persons camp]] where [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] survivors recuperated after their liberation. Later author [[Primo Levi]] (Prisoner 174517) wrote in ''[[The Truce]]'', how the extremely tall Timoshenko "unfolded himself from a tiny Fiat 500A Topolino" to announce the liberated survivors would soon begin their final journey home.&lt;ref&gt;Primo Levi, ''If This Is A Man -- The Truce'' (Abacus, 2013), p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar===
After the war, Timoshenko was reappointed commander of the Baranovichi Military District ([[Byelorussian Military District]]  since March 1946), then of the [[South Urals Military District]] (June 1946); and then the Byelorussian Military District once again (March 1949). In 1960, he was appointed Inspector-General of the Defence Ministry, a largely honorary post. From 1961 he chaired the State Committee for War Veterans. He died in Moscow in 1970.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6349">'''Tracie Andrews''' (born 9 April 1969) is an [[English people|English]] woman who murdered her [[fiancé]], Lee Raymond Dean Harvey (born 20 September 1971) on 1 December 1996. She was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] after being found guilty of murder at her trial in July 1997 and served 14 years before being released from prison.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/193210.stm|title=Andrews loses appeal |date=1998-10-14|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==

Now, 14 years on (and after £5k of NHS cosmetic surgery) she's out shopping | first=Helen | last=Weathers | date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; model and barmaid, stabbed Harvey over 42 times with a pen knife after they had stopped in his car following an argument on the way to their flat in The Becks, [[Alvechurch]], [[Worcestershire]], during the early hours of 1 December 1996. 

At a press conference on 3 December 1996, she claimed that Harvey was killed in a [[road rage]] attack, saying that a "fat man with staring eyes" had stabbed him over 30 times after getting out of a [[Ford Sierra]] in which he was a passenger.&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7288543.stm|title=Killers who cry crocodile tears |date=2008-06-25|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-19|first=Chris|last=Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two weeks, police carried out investigations to track down the murderer of Lee Harvey. On 5 December, Tracie Andrews was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose, and was still in hospital two days later when police first questioned her about the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/police-guard-road-rage-victims-fiancee-1313711.html|title=Police guard `road rage' victim's fiancee|date=9 December 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being discharged from hospital, she was charged with the murder of Lee Harvey on 19 December 1996 and released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/road-killing-fiance-stabbed-in-row-over-hat-1315425.html|title=Road killing fiance `stabbed in row over hat'|date=21 December 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracie Andrews went on trial at [[Birmingham]] [[Crown Court]] for murder on 1 July 1997, and was found guilty on 29 July 1997. She was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]],&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt; with a recommendation that she serve at least 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1191389/Road-rage-murderer-Tracie-Andrews-gets-5-000-plastic-surgery-taxpayers-expense.html|title=Road rage murderer Tracie Andrews gets £5,000 of plastic surgery at taxpayers' expense|last=Wilkes|first=David|date=2009-06-08|work=Mail Online|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=2009-10-15|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews appealed the sentence, claiming that she was the victim of a miscarriage of justice because of damaging publicity surrounding her case. In October 1998, the appeal was denied.&lt;ref name="bbc1" /&gt; In April 1999, Andrews admitted that she did [[stabbing|stab]] Harvey to death, whilst still maintaining she acted in self-defence.

==Facial surgery==
In November 2009, Tracie Andrews underwent a [[submandibular]] [[osteotomy]] operation to correct a class III [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]]. Specifically, this corrected her bottom jaw from protruding further than her top jaw.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail 11 November 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkes|first=David|title=Road rage murderer Tracie Andrews gets £5,000 of plastic surgery at taxpayers' expense|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1191389/Road-rage-murderer-Tracie-Andrews-gets-5-000-plastic-surgery-taxpayers-expense.html|website=dailymail.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]]|accessdate=28 July 2011|location=London|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}

==Release==

'''Vinzenz Schöttl''' (30 June 1905 in [[Zolling|Appersdorf]] – 28 May 1946 in [[Landsberg am Lech]]) was a German [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) officer and high-ranking functionary in the [[Nazi concentration camps]].

Schöttl initially joined the [[Nazi Party]] in November 1928 before renewing his membership in February 1931, having joined the SS in January 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Lasik, 'Die Organisationsstruktur des KL Auschwitz', in Aleksander Lasik, Franciszek Piper, Piotr Setkiewicz, Irena Strzelecka, ''Auschwitz 1940-1945. Studien zur Geschichte des Konzentrations und Vernichtungslagers Auschwitz'', Band I: Aufbau und Struktur des Lagers, Staatliches Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau, Oświęcim 1999, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; His highest SS rank was [[Obersturmführer]] in the [[Waffen-SS]] Reserve, a position he gained in 1942.&lt;ref name="Klee"&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945'', Fischer-Taschenbuch-Verlag, Frankfurt am Main, 2007, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, he was a member of the guards at [[Dachau concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; In the summer of 1937, he became the National Director of the Lindenhofs der Herzogsägmühle, a facility for travellers.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; From 1940 he worked for a short time in the ghetto of [[Lublin]] from where he was transferred to [[Neuengamme concentration camp]], and soon afterwards to [[Majdanek concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; From July 1942 until its evacuation in January 1945 Schöttl was Director of [[Monowitz concentration camp]], otherwise known as [[Auschwitz|Auschwitz concentration camp]] III.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; From 3 February 1945 he served under [[Otto Förschner]] as deputy commander of [[Kaufering concentration camp]], a subsidiary network of the larger Dachau camp, remaining in that role until the camp's evacuation in late April of the same year.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt;

Schöttl was captured by the [[United States Army]] and on 15 November was indicted for war crimes as part of the [[Dachau Trials]]. Reports of his mistreatment of prisoners, as well as the shooting of another prisoner, were taken into account and, on 13 December 1945, he was one of 36 defendants sentenced to death by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Lessing, ''Der erste Dachauer Prozess (1945/46)'', Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft, Baden-Baden, 1993, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; His execution was carried out in [[Landsberg Prison]] on 28 May 1946.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt;

The Old Attorney General: A Biography of Richard John Uniacke. Halifax: Nimbus Publishing, 1980, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  At age 20, William Bowie arrived in Nova Scotia in 1803 from [[Inverness]], [[Scotland]].  He became president of the [[North British Society]].  Under the mentorship of [[Alexander Brymer]], Bowie founded the firm Bowie &amp; DeBlois and in a few years amassed a fortune and Bowie became a leading citizen in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/annalsnorthbri00nort#page/136/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/deblois_stephen_wastie_7E.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duel ==

During a supreme court case in July 1819, Bowie's opposing lawyer was [[Richard John Uniacke, Jr.]]  They both made insulting remarks to each other and Uniacke challenged Bowie to a duel.&lt;ref&gt;Cutherbertson reports that nature of Uniacke's charge against Bowie is unknown, however, it may have been about Bowie being arrested for smuggling (See [https://books.google.ca/books?id=BC2trqrpnwUC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=%22william+bowie%22+halifax&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DWhJzeWqix&amp;sig=8rJPuX6rwEitgMxcRJwNcbwFdPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN663V2I_UAhUCJiYKHW5BA0oQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22william%20bowie%22%20halifax&amp;f=false here]).&lt;/ref&gt; They met near the Narrows at 4:00 am on July 21.  They marched twelve paces from each other. Then they fired two shots, after which Bowie was taken to a nearby barn where he died.  He was age 36. 

The duel and death of Bowie "shocked Halifax" and the flags of all the vessels in the harbour were hung at half mast.&lt;ref&gt;Cutherbertson, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first important trial to happen in the court at [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Province House]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=SvdGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA190&amp;lpg=RA1-PA190&amp;dq=Bowie+%26+DeBlois++halifax&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nW8S88e_CC&amp;sig=bLiazE3mlZBrLe54sWuE0gT-iug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPjaH10Y3UAhWCLSYKHbvlB0MQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Bowie%20%26%20DeBlois%20%20halifax&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The grand jury trial proved to be "screaming farce." &lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/annalsnorthbri00nort#page/139/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; Such a trial would have normally been prosecuted by Uniacke's father [[Richard John Uniacke]] who was the attorney general, however, he declined.  The drama of the trial was captured by the ''[[Acadian Recorder]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;
:... about 20 minutes past 11 o'clock, the Hon. [[Richard John Uniacke]] entered the Court, supporting his son on his right arm... He advanced to the Bench and stated to the Court, under feeling which evidently almost overpowered him, that he had an important and melancholy duty to perform that whatever his feelings might be upon the occasion, they must be subservient to the laws of the land, which he did not doubt would be administered with justice and mercy."&lt;ref&gt;Acadian Recorder. July 31, 1819 as cited in Cuthbertson, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Uniacke's only defence was his honour and the honour of his family and, as expected, he was found not guilty.

[[File:Yahia Benmabrouk.jpg|thumb|242x242px|Yahia Benmabrouk in the film: "L'Inspecteur Tahar Marque le But".]]
[[File:Hadj Abderrahmane et Yahia Benmabrouk en 1974..jpg|thumb|Hadj Abderrahmane et Yahia Benmabrouk en 1974.]]
'''Yahia Benmabrouk''' (1928&amp;ndash;2004) is an [[Algeria]]n comedian and film actor, born on March 30 on 1928 in [[Algiers]] and dead on October 8, 2004 in [[Bab El Oued]].

He is best known to the general public for his role of « L’Apprenti » (the apprentice), interpreted in theater, on TV and in films with his friend and associate [[Hadj Abderrahmane]], in “[[inspecteur Tahar|L’inspecteur Tahar]]’s” adventures during the late 60s and 70s. The early death of his companion has somehow taken him away from the art scene.

==Biography==
His start in comedy dates from the 1940&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Quite by chance, he takes the stage to replace ayoung actor who was ill. Their theatrical troupe was composed by young talented comedians who became very quickly famous on the Algerian scene: Hadj Omar, [[Sid-Ali Kouiret]], Allel El-Mouhib, [[Rouiched]] (M. Ayad), Hadj Chérif, Abdelkader Bougaci, M'Guellati and many others. All these actors will form later El Masrah El Djazairi theatrical troupe, directed by [[Mustapha Kateb]]. It was under the latter’s supervision that Yahia Benmabrouk really learned the theatrical art.

In 1956 he was targeted by an attack by a [[Pied-Noir]] extremist group, during the [[Algerian War|Algerian war]] for independence. Traumatized, this attack took him away from the scenes for almost two years; and he left [[Algeria]] for France.However, his stay there would be short-lived because of a very important task. In fact, in early 1958, the [[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]] invited him to join Mohamed Bouzidi H'ssissen, Boualem Rais, Sid Ali Kouiret, Saâdaoui and other artists to form theatrical troupe able to make Algeria famous worldwide and to promote the struggle of the Algerian people freedom.

Yahia Benmabrouk returned to the country by the end of the war and continued to tread the boards among the elements that will constitute the Algerian National Theatre until he retired in the 1980s.

1967 was a decisive year for Yahia Benmabrouk because it marks the birth of the explosive duo: Yahia Ben Mabrouk (L'Apprenti) and Hadj Abderrahmane (L'InspecteurTahar) in the film: « L’Inspecteur Tahar Mène l’Enquète ». And it was followed by many other films.

The tragic death of his friend [[Hadj Abderrahmane]] on October 5, 1981 plunged him into a depression. Nothing will be the same for him.

Yahia Benmabrouk died on October 8, 2004 at the age of 76, in the university hospital of Bab-El-Oued.
