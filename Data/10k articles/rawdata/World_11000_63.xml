'''"All To You"''' was the [[Austria]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]], performed in [[English Language|English]] by [[The Rounder Girls]].

The song was performed 24th (last) on the night, following [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Eamonn Toal]] with "[[Millennium of Love]]". At the close of voting, it had received 34 points, placing 14th in a field of 24.

The song is an upbeat number, with the girls describing their feelings for their lovers - or rather, explaining that they can't describe them.

Due to poor performances, Austria was not able to enter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 Contest]], however they were permitted to enter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002 edition]]. Thus, the song was succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] by [[Manuel Ortega (singer)|Manuel Ortega]] singing "[[Say a Word]]".

The '''Anthem of the 21st of April''' ({{lang-el|Ύμνος της 21ης Απριλίου}}) was the anthem of the ruling military regime during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]], ''de facto'' used as an unofficial co-[[national anthem]] along with the [[Hymn to Liberty]]. The anthem glorifies the "national revolution" begun by the regime, which took power with the [[Coup d'état of 21 April 1967]].

Μέσα στ' Απρίλη τη Γιορτή
το Μέλλον χτίζει η Νιότη
αγκαλιασμένοι - δυνατοί
μ' Εργάτη, Αγρότη, Φοιτητή
και πρώτο τον Στρατιώτη.

Τραγούδι αγάπης αντηχεί
γελούν όλα τα χείλη
Και σμίγουν μέσα στην ψυχή
του Εικοσι-ένα η εποχή 
κι η Εικοσι-μιά τ' Απρίλη

Μες στις καρδιές φτάνει ζεστή
του Απριλιού η λιακάδα
κι έχουν στα στήθεια μας χτιστεί
Θρησκεία, Οικογένεια
και πάνω απ' όλα Ελλάδα!

In the feast of April
The Youth builds the future
embraced - strong
with the Worker, Farmer, Student
and first of all the Soldier.

A song of love sounds
all lips smile
And unite inside the soul
the [[Greek Revolution|era of '21]]
and the [[Coup d'état of 21 April 1967|21st of April]]

Inside the hearts arrives warm
the sunshine of April
and they are built on our chests

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Apiarius of Sicca''' was an African priest convicted by the Bishops of [[Africa]] of numerous unspecified crimes in the early 5th century AD, and excommunicated by [[Bishop Urbanus]] of Sicca Veneria.  In 418 Apiarius appealed his convictions directly to [[Pope Zosimus]] (Term of Office: March 417 - December 418) by-passing the African Bishops appeals system.  Pope Zosimus, citing the [[Nicene Canons]], sent legates to assess the charges. The Canon citation: ''"When a bishop thinks he has been unjustly deposed by his colleagues he may appeal to Rome, and the Roman bishop shall have the business decided by judices in partibus"''; was not of the Nicene Canons, but rather part of the [[Sardica Canons]].  The Bishops of Africa, not finding the statement in their copies of Nicene Canons, sought copies of the Nicene Canons from the Archbishops of [[Constantinople]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Antioch]].  

[[Pope Boniface I]] (Term of Office: December 418 - 423) took over the appeal by Apiarius of Sicca in 418 at the death of Pope Zosimus. In 419 the Bishops of Africa sent the copies of the Nicene Canons obtained from Alexandria and Constantinople to justify their position that the Nicene Canons did not permit Pope Zosimus actions.

The controversy over the right of a bishop to appeal directly to Rome outlasted Pope Boniface and was still the subject of correspondence during the term of [[Celestine I]] (Term of Office: 423 - 432), successor to Boniface.  The disposition of the appeal of Apiarius of Sicca is not known.

The '''Arctic policy of the United States''' refers to the [[foreign policy of the United States]] in regard to the [[Arctic]] region. In addition, the United States' domestic policy toward [[Alaska]] is part of its Arctic policy.

Since March 30, 1867 (when the United States purchased Alaska from the [[Russian Empire]]), the United States of America has been one of the [[Arctic cooperation and politics|eight Arctic nations]] and one of the five Arctic Ocean [[littoral]] countries. The United States has been a member of the [[Arctic Council]] since its inception in 1996 and assumed the Chairmanship (from Canada) in April 2015. 4 of the Arctic Council's 6 Permanent Participant indigenous organizations have representatives in Alaska. The United States is also an observer of the [[Arctic cooperation and politics#Conference of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region (CPAR)|Conference of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region]].

Since 1880, the global temperature has risen 0.8[[°C]]; but the temperature in the Arctic has warmed twice as much, leading to much less sea ice coverage and greater accessibility to natural resources, transport passages and fisheries.&lt;ref name="Arctic Security Considerations"&gt;[Titley, David W., and Courtney C. St. John. "Arctic Security Considerations And The U. S. Navy's Roadmap For The Arctic." Naval War College Review 63.2 (2010): 35-48. Academic Search Complete. Web. 9 Mar. 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals stated in the United States Arctic Policy released in NSPD-66 on January 9, 2009 are as follows: Meet national security and homeland security needs relevant to the Arctic region; Protect the Arctic environment and conserve its biological resources; Ensure that natural resource management and economic development in the region are environmentally sustainable; Strengthen institutions for cooperation among the eight Arctic nations (the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and Sweden); Involve the Arctic's indigenous communities in decisions that affect them; and Enhance scientific monitoring and research into local, regional, and global environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-66.htm] United States Arctic Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2013, the Obama White House released the National Strategy for the Arctic Region, emphasizing three areas: advancing U.S. security interests, pursuing responsible Arctic region stewardship, and strengthening international cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/nat_arctic_strategy.pdf] National Strategy for the Arctic Region&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada is the United States' closest partner in Arctic affairs, due to geographic proximity and similar Arctic policy directives. The countries work together on scientific research, including mapping the Arctic sea floor.  Two significant disagreements are the border dispute in the [[Beaufort Sea]] and the legal designation (international or internal waters) of the [[Northwest Passage]].

==Background and history==
The current Arctic policy of the United States has its beginnings in the Nixon Administration.  In December 1971, President Nixon produced National Security Decision Memorandum 144 to address the United States' stance toward the Arctic.  The memo suggested that the development of the United States' Arctic policy focus on three key areas:  minimize adverse risks to the environment; promote international cooperation in the Arctic; and provide for the protection of security interests in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsdm-nixon/nsdm-144.pdf] Nixon National Security Decision Memorandum 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea ice extent values are normalized (scaled) so that the average for years 1981 to 2000 is equal to 100%. Totally ice free summer conditions would equal 0%.]]
 
In 1984, the United States Congress passed the "Arctic and Policy Act of 1984" to provide for the national defense of the region, enhance commercial fishing endeavors, and fund environmental and climate research in the region.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41153.pdf] CRS Report: Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States remained largely quiet in the international arena with regard to Arctic policy until joining the eight other Arctic countries by signing the [[Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy]] agreement in 1991.&lt;ref name="arctic-council.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/artic_environment.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2008-09-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720000343/http://arctic-council.org/filearchive/artic_environment.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}} Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy Agreement&lt;/ref&gt;  The main purpose behind this agreement was to coordinate the protection of the Arctic region by: researching the various pollutants in the region and sharing the data; assessing the environmental impacts of development activities; and control pollutants and their effects on the Arctic environment.&lt;ref name="arctic-council.org"/&gt;  The [[Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy]] was absorbed into the [[Arctic Council]] following the Yalta Declaration in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arctic-council.npolar.no/Archives/AEPS%20Docs/Arctic%20Council%C2%A0_%C2%A0The%20Alta%20Declaration.htm]{{dead link|date=October 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Alta Declaration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Source no longer exists --&gt;

In May 2008, five of the Arctic nations adopted the [[Illulissat Declaration]] which incorporates the 'law of the sea'. The US has not ratified [[UNCLOS]] and is the only Arctic nation yet to join, even though the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations have all favored ratification.&lt;ref name="Arctic Security Considerations"/&gt;

The [[Arctic Council]] was the face of United States Arctic Policy until the latest National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD-66) was signed by President Bush on January 9, 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-66.htm] US Arctic Region Policy Presidential Directive&lt;/ref&gt;  With the diminishment of Arctic sea ice, the increase in human activities in the region, and territorial considerations of the unclaimed Arctic have provided a new sense of urgency to the Arctic issue.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;  This impetus is unique to the United States during this time because of climate change in the region.

While the [[Arctic Council]] still remains the authoritative international body on Arctic issues, the United States has started to develop its own strategy toward addressing its resources and claims toward the region. US Arctic Region Policy Presidential Directive, a collaborative effort replacing the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton]]-era Arctic policy directive.  NSPD-66 is the official, active Arctic policy being pursued by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] and its departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/20387/us_deputy_secretary_of_state.html] US Deputy Secretary of State: Arctic region will be next international strategic challenge&lt;/ref&gt;  The policy's international aims are to support the ratification of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), promote participation in the [[Arctic Council]], develop agreements with other Arctic countries on increased human activity in the region, and "continue to cooperate with other countries on Arctic issues through the United Nations (U.N.) and its specialized agencies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The policy argues against the need for a treaty among Arctic nations similar to the [[Antarctic Treaty]] restricting commercial and military activities. The policy calls for the US to, "assert a more active and influential national presence to protect its Arctic interests and project sea power throughout the region," and to secure free passage of vessels through the [[Northwest Passage]] and the [[Northern Sea Route]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2009/01/19/660405/president-obama-should-reject.html] President Obama should reject last-minute Arctic policy&lt;/ref&gt;

At the March 29, 2010, "Arctic Five" meeting in [[Ottawa]], [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]], criticized Canada for not inviting the other three Arctic nations or indigenous groups.  [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister]], [[Lawrence Cannon]], said the meeting was not intended to, "replace or undermine the Arctic Council".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8594291.stm] Clinton Criticizes Canada Over Arctic Talks&lt;/ref&gt;

The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has provided the strongest impetus for a more assertive United States policy in the Arctic region.  The United States focuses on numerous facets of the Arctic region in promoting and explaining their reasoning for a stronger policy position in the region.  As an Arctic country with territory at stake, the United States is continuously pushing for a larger influence in the region to pursue industry and energy development considerations.  One of the tenets of NSPD-66 is the ratification of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), this would provide clarity and the appropriate framework for the United States to submit a claim to some area of the Arctic as the sea ice continues to melt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/100426_Conley_USStrategicInterests_Web.pdf] Center for Strategic and International Studies: "US Strategic Interests in the Arctic" Page 31&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, new passageways in commercial shipping may become available due to the breaking of ice.

The population influx in the Arctic region is also predicted to coincide with more commercial shipping, marine tourism, and the transportation of large passenger vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/100426_Conley_USStrategicInterests_Web.pdf] Center for Strategic and International Studies: "US Strategic Interests in the Arctic"&lt;/ref&gt;  This poses coverage gaps to the US Navy and US Coast Guard search and rescue functions.  Due to the non-military nature of the [[Arctic Council]], the United States will also need to pursue separate military agreements with other Arctic countries to ensure a protected and secure region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arctic-council.org/article/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070823045031/http://arctic-council.org/article/about |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }} Arctic Council: About the Arctic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Executive Agencies Active in Arctic Policy==
[[The US Arctic Policy Group]] is a federal inter agency working group comprising those agencies with programs and/or involvement in research and monitoring, land and natural resources management, environmental protection, human health, transportation and policy making in the Arctic. The APG is chaired by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] and meets monthly to develop and implement US programs and policies in the Arctic, including those relevant to the activities of the [[Arctic Council]].

[[The Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force]] was initiated by the [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] (OSTP), and [[NOAA]] in 2009 and includes representatives from more than 20 federal agencies. President Obama has called on the Task Force to develop federal recommendations for adapting to climate change impacts both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ceq/20100315-interagency-adaptation-progress-report.pdf|title=Progress Report of the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, March 16, 2010|website=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Formerly The Navy had icebreakers, but now uses submarines in the Arctic.)
Admiral [[Gary Roughead]] believes overfishing and melting sea ice are increasing the importance of the Navy in the Arctic. He also favors the United States ratifying the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty “so we have a seat at the table’’ and so the United States could “expand its sovereign rights to the increasingly accessible outer continental shelf areas of the resource-rich environment of the Arctic.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arctic.foreignpolicyblogs.com/2010/07/06/the-navy-and-the-arctic/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913104535/http://arctic.foreignpolicyblogs.com/2010/07/06/the-navy-and-the-arctic/ |archivedate=2010-09-13 |df= }} As of 2010, the Navy and the Arctic&lt;/ref&gt; Navy Rear Admiral [[David Titley]] was heavily involved in Arctic Policy.&lt;ref name="thecable.foreignpolicy.com"/&gt;

==Arctic natural resources==
The Arctic contains significant deposits of precious minerals, timber, and fish. Research plans to determine the extent of the US Outer Continental Shelf and the amounts of resources it contains is a primary directive of the US Arctic policy delineated in NSPD-66.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-66.htm] US Arctic Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental protection and conservation of natural resources===
The Arctic environment is unique and changing. Despite the heavy research, the Arctic is still poorly understood. The need for sound scientific and socioeconomic information, Arctic environmental research, monitoring, and vulnerability assessments are top priorities. These priorities include sea ice and glaciers, thawing permafrost and coastal erosion, as well as the pollutants from the Arctic contaminating the region. As the temperature rises, contaminants locked in the ice and soils will be released into the air, water, and land. The increased human activity in the Arctic will lead to an increase of contaminants.

NSPD-66 policy states that for "environmental protection and conservation of natural resources, the Secretaries of State, the Interior, Commerce, and Homeland Security and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall respond effectively to increased pollutants and other environmental challenges; continue to identify ways to conserve, protect, and sustainably manage Arctic species and ensure adequate enforcement presence to safeguard living marine resources; seek to develop ways to address changing and expanding commercial fisheries in the Arctic; and intensify efforts to develop scientific information on the adverse effects of pollutants on human health and the environment and work with other nations to reduce the introduction of key pollutants into the Arctic."&lt;ref name =  "Bush" /&gt;

===Oil and natural gas===
{{See also|Petroleum exploration in the Arctic}}
The United States Geological Survey estimates that 22 percent of the world's oil and natural gas could be located beneath the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2009_hr/arctic.pdf] US Congressional Hearing.  "Strategic Importance of the Arctic in US Policy." Page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate of oil availability to the US is in the range of 30 billion barrels while that of natural gas reserves could be 221 billion cubic feet.

===Fisheries===
The range of some sub-Arctic fish stocks is likely to extend into Arctic areas due to climate change, and decreasing ice-cover will likely lead to more fishing activity.  Scientific understanding of Arctic fish populations is limited and needs to be studied before increased Arctic fishing occurs.

In May 2008, President Bush signed a [http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=180591&amp;amp;documentId=207392 joint resolution] passed by Congress relating to Arctic Fisheries. The resolution stresses the need for the United States to work with other nations to conserve and manage future Arctic fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/oes/ocns/opa/arc/index.htm] US Dept. of State: Ocean &amp; Polar Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSPD-66 states,"The United States supports the application in the Arctic region of the general principles of international fisheries management outlined in the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982, relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and similar instruments. The United States endorses the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the Arctic from destructive fishing practices and seeks to ensure an adequate enforcement presence to safeguard Arctic living marine resources."&lt;ref name = "Bush"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Security Presidential Directive and Homeland Security Presidential Directive, NSPD-66/HSPD-25, Arctic Region Policy|work=National Security Presidential Directives - NSPDs|publisher=The United States Office of the President|date=January 9, 2009|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-66.htm|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic to north of the Atlantic, extensive commercial fisheries and international managerial mechanisms already exist. North of the Bering Strait, there are currently no significant commercial fisheries and no international management mechanisms.

The Arctic Fishery Management Plan went into effect December 3, 2009, closing the Arctic Management Area to commercial fishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/newsreleases/2009/arctic_alert110309.htm] NOAA Fisheries News Alert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes==
Several different lines are planned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectsandleads.com/campaign/Newsletter/Newsletter_Sep09.html|accessdate=2011-02-20|title=10 Bahrain projects you should get involved in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pink Line, connecting [[Hamad Town]], [[Riffa]], Isa Town, [[Sitra]], and South Manama;

==Project==
The project was unveiled in 2008, with construction planned to start in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.bna.bh/?ID=73448 |accessdate=2011-02-20 |title=Bahrain News Agency }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, construction has been repeatedly delayed.

The first phase,  including 24&amp;nbsp;km of light rail network, is expected to cost BD453 million. Subsequent phases will cost more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/stn_178416.html|accessdate=2011-02-20|title=Bahrain's $8bn public transport network on track|quote=Light}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Beurre d'Ardenne''' is a type of [[cow]]'s [[milk]] [[Butter]] made in the [[Ardennes]] of [[Belgium]].

As a traditional product of the area it received Belgian [[Protected Geographical Status|appellation d'origine]] by Royal decree in 1984,&lt;ref name="BELDOC"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/clea/fr/details.jsp?id=395 Beurre d'Ardennes AO info]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (French) OMPI Resources&lt;/ref&gt; and received European ''PDO'' status in 1996.&lt;ref name="DOOR"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=128 Beurre d'Ardennes Profile], European PDO/PGI Database, European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The areas where it is produced are within [[Wallonia]] and include the provinces of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]], [[Namur (province)|Namur]] and [[Liège (province)|Liège]].&lt;ref name="APAQWPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaqw.be/files/files/Pdf/Peda/doss/Lesproduitslaitiers_beurre.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525103244/http://www.apaqw.be/files/files/Pdf/Peda/doss/Lesproduitslaitiers_beurre.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-25 |df= }}, APAQ-W&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify, production must take place entirely in those areas, from milking of the cows, through to [[Churning (butter)|churning]] and, final maturation of the butter,&lt;ref name="APAQW"&gt;[http://www.apaqw.be/search.asp?q=barattage Agency for Wallonian Agricultural Produce (APAQ-W) - Butter Product Search] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132608/http://www.apaqw.be/search.asp?q=barattage |date=July 6, 2011 }} (French)&lt;/ref&gt; and may be made by churning milk, cream or a mixture of both. The final product must be of at least 82% [[butterfat]] and [[butyric acid]].

Prior to its uniform adoption of [[proportional representation]] in 1999, the United Kingdom used [[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] for the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]] in England, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[European Parliament constituency|European Parliament constituencies]] used under that system were smaller than the later regional constituencies and only had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] each. 

The constituency of Birmingham East was one of them.

It consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|Westminster Parliament constituencies]] of [[Birmingham Edgbaston (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham Erdington (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Erdington]], [[Birmingham Hall Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Hall Green]], [[Birmingham Hodge Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Hodge Hill]], [[Birmingham Northfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Northfield]], [[Birmingham Selly Oak (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Selly Oak]], [[Birmingham Small Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Small Heath]], [[Birmingham Sparkbrook (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Sparkbrook]], and [[Birmingham Yardley (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Yardley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ |title=David Boothroyd's United Kingdom Election Results |accessdate=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It started in 1978, operated under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] &lt;ref name=fantastico1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/09/nsa-documents-show-united-states-spied-brazilian-oil-giant.html|title=NSA Documents Show United States Spied Brazilian Oil Giant|date=September 8, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Really screengrabs in the attached video, they are exposed for only a few frames each--&gt;&lt;ref name="wp_slides"&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/ | date = June 6, 2013 |title=NSA Slides Explain the PRISM Data-Collection Program |work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was expanded after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470|title=New Details Show Broader NSA Surveillance Reach|author=Siobhan Gorman|author2=Jennifer Valentio-DeVries|last-author-amp=yes|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013|work=The Wall Street Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103030949/http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470#|archive-date=January 3, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection takes place at top-level telecommunications facilities within the United States, choke points through which most traffic will flow, including wireless. This type of surveillance is referred to as [[Upstream collection]].

BLARNEY was first brought to public view in a [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] slide revealed by [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="wp_slides" /&gt; The FY 2013 budget for BLARNEY was $65.96 million.&lt;ref name="WP20130830"&gt;{{cite news|title=NSA paying U.S. companies for access to communications networks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-paying-us-companies-for-access-to-communications-networks/2013/08/29/5641a4b6-10c2-11e3-bdf6-e4fc677d94a1_story.html|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=30 August 2013|author=Craig Timberg|author2=Barton Gellman|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misrepresentations ==
Initially it was assumed that BLARNEY was the program under which the NSA cooperated with AT&amp;T and that among the tapping facilities were [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[Room 641A]] in [[San Francisco]], California, revealed in 2006 by [[Mark Klein]], and another in [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=wsj1 /&gt; However, new NSA documents released on August 15, 2015 show that the cooperation with AT&amp;T takes places under [[Fairview (surveillance program)|FAIRVIEW]], and that Room 641A is probably part of that program, instead of BLARNEY.&lt;ref name=electrospaces&gt;Electrospaces.net: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2015/08/fairview-collecting-foreign.html FAIRVIEW: Collecting foreign intelligence inside the US], August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The new documents about FAIRVIEW also show that this isn't a larger umbrella program comprising BLARNEY, [[OAKSTAR]], [[STORMBREW]] and others, as was said by [[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]]. Those programs are very similar, but associated with different companies, and may have slightly different legal arrangements with the NSA. Arrangements with corporations are associated with the NSA's [[Special Source Operations]] division (SSO).&lt;ref name=electrospaces /&gt;&lt;ref name=dailydot1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/fairview-prism-blarney-nsa-internet-spying-projects/|title=Forget PRISM: FAIRVIEW is the NSA's project to "own the Internet"|author=Kloc, Joe|date=July 12, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal authorities ==
BLARNEY operates under three legal authorities: NSA FISA, FBI FISA and section 702 [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FAA]]. Collection of data under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] authority requires a court order from the [[FISA Court]] (FISC) in which the identifiers ("selectors") for the target are mentioned. Although this process to acquire a court order is very time-consuming, BLARNEY collection under the FISA authority is the main contributor to the [[President's Daily Brief]] and accounts for over 11,000 product reports a year.&lt;ref name=sso&gt;See page 14 of the NSA presentation [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2274321-sso-corpteambrief20mar2012-s2d.html SSO Corporate Portfolio Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workings ==
To gather intelligence, algorithms are used to sift through the communications, and forward on, for storage and possible analysis, those which are believed likely to contain foreign intelligence. The first stage of filtering is done by the telecoms themselves, at the request of the NSA. The filters are not always perfect, and sometimes purely domestic communications are caught.

In the event that domestic communications are swept up, the minimization procedures are applied. The procedures require that most "incidental" communications between U.S. persons be destroyed, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref name=FisaUpstream&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/22/us/22nsa-opinion-document.html?_r=0|title=Judge’s Opinion on N.S.A. Program|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptions include: the content is encrypted, it contains foreign intelligence, or is evidence of a crime. This last exception allows the NSA to pass to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s Special Operations Division (SOD) information relating to drug trafficking.  &lt;!-- link to minimization document --&gt; The program has been likened to [[Project SHAMROCK]], in which the NSA, and its predecessor organization were given daily microfilm copies of all telegrams entering and exiting the United States.&lt;ref name=wsj1/&gt;

== SIGADs ==

BLARNEY is known to be associated with two [[SIGAD]]s of the same name.&lt;ref name=fantastico1/&gt; The designation for [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] (US-984XN) is very similar to the designations of the BLARNEY SIGADs: US-984 and US-984X.&lt;ref name=fantastico1/&gt;&lt;ref name=wp_slides/&gt; Accordingly, the speaker's notes of an NSA presentation that was released on August 15, 2015, say that "PRISM falls under BLARNEY, but is just one access of many".&lt;ref name=sso /&gt;

The '''Bloomberg Global Business Forum''' is an annual event organized by [[Bloomberg Philanthropies]], the charity founded by former [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]. The event is held during the annual meeting of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] each September in New York City. The conference represents a 'handoff' of the annual meeting of the [[Clinton Global Initiative]], the last of which was held during the 2016 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1058261/mike-bloomberg-is-looking-to-take-over-new-yorks-most-elite-conference-from-bill-clinton/|title=Mike Bloomberg is looking to take over New York’s most elite conference from Bill Clinton|last=Karaian|first=Jason|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/nyregion/bill-hillary-clinton-global-initiative-mike-bloomberg.html|title=As the Clintons Step Back From Global Stage, Bloomberg Steps Up|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The first Bloomberg Global Business Forum (GBF) took place in New York in 2017. The event "was inspired" by an earlier Bloomberg Philanthropies event, the U.S.-Africa Business Forum which was held in 2014 and 2016 and was co-sponsored by the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] and Bloomberg Philanthropies. That event brought business leaders together with heads of state from every African nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/michael-bloomberg-is-the-new-clinton-1513304973-b657da64-db1a-44fd-8c63-d6bfcde6d782.html|title=Michael Bloomberg is the new Clinton|website=Axios|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2016 U.S.-Africa Business Forum, then-president [[Barack Obama]] said "on so many key challenges that we face — our security, our prosperity, climate change, the struggle for human rights and human dignity, the reduction of conflict — Africa is essential to our progress. Africa's rise is not just important to Africa, it's important to the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/21/remarks-president-obama-us-africa-business-forum|title=Remarks by President Obama at the U.S.-Africa Business Forum|date=2016-09-21|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-09-21/obama-speaks-about-u-s-investment-in-africa-video|title=Obama Speaks About U.S. Investment in Africa|website=www.bloomberg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other precedent for the GBF is the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, a project of the Clinton Foundation. The CGI was held annually beginning in 2005 "as a way to try to implement meaningful solutions to world problems such as climate change, world hunger and poverty." In August 2016, former president Bill Clinton announced that the CGI scheduled for the following month would be the last one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/bill-clinton-clinton-global-initiative-1201840585/|title=Clinton Foundation to End Global Initiative Event, Curb Donations|last=Johnson|first=Ted|date=2016-08-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days before the first Global Business Forum in September 2017, Bloomberg adviser and key GBF organizer [[Kevin Sheekey]] linked the event to the Clinton Global Initiative, saying that Clinton "doesn't just happen to be the first speaker." Sheekey also said "There's a bit of a handoff" between the two events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the global development industry, leaders also linked the Global Business Forum with CGI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/bloomberg-philanthropies-aims-to-make-splash-during-global-goals-week-91005|title=Bloomberg Philanthropies aims to make splash during Global Goals Week|date=2017-09-12|work=Devex|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2017 Forum content ==
The GBF agenda addressed a range of global topics such as "mitigating [[climate change]], eradicating disease and alleviating [[poverty]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agenda also featured discussions on addressing the disruption caused by automation and exploring new models for global business.

In an op-ed published on the day of the Global Business Forum, Mike Bloomberg highlighted the importance of the private sector in U.S. foreign policy, saying "it's important to remember that in a global economy, America's relationship with the world does not depend solely on the state of politics along Pennsylvania Avenue."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-20/stronger-global-relations-require-business-leadership|title=Stronger Global Relations Require Business Leadership|last=Bloomberg|first=Michael|date=20 September 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg argued that in a range of topics, "from public health and safety to broadband access to anti-poverty efforts," government should collaborate with business "because the private sector is often better at allocating resources productively, controlling costs, and using cutting-edge technology to solve problems."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the Global Business Forum, leaders offered several major announcements. [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] President [[Jim Yong Kim|Jim Kim]] and the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] [[Patricia Espinosa]] announced a new joint platform to reduce the risk of climate investments called "Invest4Climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.devex.com/news/with-help-from-michael-bloomberg-the-world-bank-and-un-look-to-take-the-risk-out-of-climate-investments-91097|title=With help from Michael Bloomberg, the World Bank and UN look to take the risk out of climate investments|date=2017-09-21|work=Devex|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the forum, California Governor [[Jerry Brown|Edmund G.

The '''Bosnian diaspora''' consists of Bosnian emigrants of all ethnicities and their descendants in countries such as the United States, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Australia and elsewhere. There are an estimated 2,000,000 [[Bosnians]] living outside [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA MIGRATION PROFILE|url=http://www.mhrr.gov.ba/iseljenistvo/Publikacije/MigrationProfile2010ENGLISHFINAL.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The Bosnian diaspora was the consequence of either voluntary departure, coercion and/or forced migrations or expulsions that occurred on several occasions since the 1870s:
* In the late 19th century to the east and west caused by the invading forces of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].
* In the early 20th century between the two wars, Bosnians moved to the east and west. They fled to [[Turkey]], [[Austria]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. This occurred mostly during the [[Second World War]].
* The [[Bosnian War]] in the early 1990s (from 1992 to 1995). Many Bosnian refugees sought asylum in Western Europe ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]], and the non-[[European Union|EU]] nations of [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]]), North America ([[United States]] and [[Canada]]) and Oceania ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2667">[[File:Boulevard barbes.jpg|thumb|The Boulevard Barbès]]
The '''Boulevard Barbès''' is a boulevard in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]. It is named after French politician [[Armand Barbès]]. It was built in 1867 during [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. It starts at the [[boulevard de la Chapelle]] and ends at the [[rue Ordener]]. It is 835 metres long and 35 metres wide.

== Notable buildings ==
[[File:Barbes3.jpg|thumb|The Boulevard Barbès, c. 1900]]
*Nos. 11, 13 &amp; 15: the buildings of the former Grands Magasins Dufayel. In 1856, Jacques François Crespin opened the « Palais de la Nouveauté » on a section of the old rue des Poissonniers. Commerce extended on the boulevard and became in 1888 the Grands Magasins Dufayel. After a series of extensions they occupied the whole rectangle between the boulevard and the rue Christiani, the rue de Sofia and the rue de Clignancourt.

{{History of Chile}}
The '''Chilean transition to democracy''' began when a Constitution establishing a transition itinerary was approved in a plebiscite. From 11 March 1981 to March 1990, several organic constitutional laws were approved leading to the final restoration of [[democracy]]. After the 1988 plebiscite, the [[Constitution of Chile|1980 Constitution]], still in force today, was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the constitution, create more seats in the senate, diminish the role of the National Security Council and equalize the number of civilian and military members (four members each).

[[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Patricio Aylwin]] served from 1990 to 1994 and was succeeded by another Christian Democrat, [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] (son of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]]), leading the same coalition, for a six-year term. [[Ricardo Lagos Escobar]] of the [[Chilean Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] and the [[Party for Democracy (Chile)|Party for Democracy]] led the [[Concertacion]] to a narrower victory in the 2000 presidential election. His term ended on March 11, 2006, when [[Michelle Bachelet Jeria|Michelle Bachelet]] of the Socialist Party took office.&lt;ref name="USDoS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm|title=Background note|publisher=Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; Center-right investor and businessman [[Sebastián Piñera]], of the [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]], assumed the presidency on March 11, 2010, after Bachelet's term expired. Bachelet returned to the office on March 11, 2014, being succeeded by Piñera in the following term (2018-2022).

==1988 plebiscite and reform of the Constitution==
{{main|Chilean national plebiscite, 1988}}
Passed under tight military control in 1980, the [[Constitution of Chile|Chilean constitution]]'s legal dispositions were designed to lead to the convocation of all citizens to a [[plebiscite]] during which the Chilean people would ratify a candidate, proposed by the Chief of Staff of the [[Chilean Armed Forces]] and by the General Director of the [[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]], the national police force, and who would become the [[President of Chile]] for an eight-year term. In 1980, this meant that the [[Chilean people]] were supposed to approve [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s candidacy, assuring him popular legitimacy and the sanction of a [[vote]]. Should the people refuse the junta's chosen candidate, the military would relinquish political control to the civilians, convoking the following year presidential and parliamentary [[democracy|democratic elections]], and thus putting an end to the military government. In 1987, Pinochet's government passed a law allowing the creation of [[political parties]] and another law allowing the opening of national registers of voters. If the majority of the people voted "yes" to Pinochet's plebiscite, he would have remained in power for the next eight years, but Congress would have been elected and installed on March 11, 1990, as in fact happened.

{{Quote|''Touch only one of my men, and forget about the rule of law.''|Augusto Pinochet, 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnHSNena2vkC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=si+me+tocan+el+estado+de+derecho+pinochet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6vX_SaQth2&amp;sig=kLdMdww6UnItUQ-h-xzru-LpANs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WCV2VZmgGM7e7Aa6n4CQAQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=si%20me%20tocan%20el%20estado%20de%20derecho%20pinochet&amp;f=false |title=Educación para la Ciudadanía: Democracia, capitalismo y estado de derecho |publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]] |accessdate=2015-06-08 |isbn= |page=204 |language=Spanish |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Context and causes of Pinochet's decision to follow the Constitution===
Among various causes of Pinochet's decision to resume this procedure, the situation in the [[Soviet Union]], where [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had initiated the [[glasnost]] and the [[perestroika]] democratic reforms, which would finally lead to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and to the official end of the [[Cold War]], is clearly an important factor. The Cold War had important consequences in [[South America]], considered by the [[United States and South and Central America|United States to be a full part]] of the Western Bloc, in contrast with the [[Eastern Bloc]], a division born with the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Yalta Conference]]. Following the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] and the local implementation in several countries of [[Che Guevara]]'s [[foco theory]], the US waged a war in South America against the "[[Communists]] [[subversion (politics)|subversives]]," leading to [[United States intervention in Chile|support in Chile]] of the right-wing, which would culminate with the coup of 1973 in Chile. In a few years, all of South America was covered by similar military dictatorships, called ''[[military juntas|juntas]]''. In [[History of Paraguay|Paraguay]], [[Alfredo Stroessner]] was in power since 1954; in [[History of Brazil|Brazil]], left-wing President [[João Goulart]] was overthrown by a [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|military coup in 1964]]; in [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]], General [[Hugo Banzer]] overthrew leftist General [[Juan José Torres]] in 1971; in [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay]], considered the "Switzerland" of South America, [[Juan María Bordaberry]] seized power in the June 27, 1973 coup. A "[[Dirty War]]" was waged all over the continent, culminating with [[Operation Condor]], an agreement between security services of the [[Southern Cone]] and other South American countries to repress and assassinate political opponents. Militaries also took power in [[History of Argentina|Argentina]] in 1976, and then supported the 1980 "Cocaine Coup" of [[Luis García Meza Tejada]] in Bolivia, before training the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua where the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], headed by [[Daniel Ortega]], had taken power in 1979, as well as [[Guatemalan Civil War|militaries in Guatemala]] and in [[History of El Salvador|El Salvador]]. In the 1980s, however, the situation progressively evolved in the world as in South America, despite a [[Cold War (1979-1985)|renewal of the Cold War]] from 1979 to 1985, [[Cold War (1985-1991)|the year]] during which Gorbatchev replaced [[Konstantin Chernenko]] as leader of the USSR.
[[File:Visita de Juan Pablo a la PUC (33437732200).jpg|thumb|It is believed that the visit of Pope John Paul II in April 1987 may have influenced Pinochet's decision to call for elections. The Pope is shown here at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] on April 4, 1987.]]
Another alleged reason of Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile, during which he visited [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Viña del Mar]], [[Valparaíso]], [[Temuco]], [[Punta Arenas]], [[Puerto Montt]] and [[Antofagasta]]. Before the pontiff's pilgrimage to [[Latin America]], during a meeting with reporters, he criticized Pinochet's regime as "dictatorial." In the words of ''[[The New York Times]]'', he was "using unusually strong language" to criticize Pinochet and told the journalists that the Church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/world/pope-on-latin-trip-attacks-pinochet-regime.html?pagewanted=1 Pope, on Latin Trip, Attacks Pinochet Regime] ''The New York Times'', April 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; During his 1987 Chilean visit, the Polish pope asked Chile's 31 Catholic bishops to campaign for free elections in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-1314763.html Pope Tells Chile's Bishops To Press for Free Elections; Pontiff Joins Pinochet on Palace Balcony] [[The Washington Post]], April 3, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed the topic of the return to democracy. John Paul II would have allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of the regime, and would even have called for his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heraldo Munoz]], ''The Dictator's Shadow: Life under Augusto Pinochet'', p. 183, Basic Books (2008), {{ISBN|0465002501}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Cardinal [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], Pope John Paul II's secretary, confirmed that, during his visit with Pinochet, the Pope asked him to step down and transfer power over to civilian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Weigel]], ''Biografía de Juan Pablo II - Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza &amp; Janés (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to Chile, John Paul II supported the [[Vicariate of Solidarity]], the Church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organization. John Paul II visited the Vicariate of Solidarity's offices, spoke with its workers, and "called upon them to continue their work, emphasizing that the Gospel consistently urges respect for human rights."&lt;ref&gt;Timmerman, Jacobo ''Chile: Death in the South'', p. 114, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-517-02902-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have erroneously accused John Paul II of affirming Pinochet's regime by appearing with the Chilean ruler in his balcony. However, Cardinal [[Roberto Tucci]], the organizer of John Paul II's pilgrimages revealed that Pinochet tricked the pontiff by telling him he would take him to his living room, while in reality he took him to his balcony. Tucci claims that the pontiff was "furious."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75477,7396637,Dlaczego_Jan_Pawel_II_wyszedl_z_Pinochetem_na_balkon.html Dlaczego Jan Paweł II wyszedł z Pinochetem na balkon] [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the case, political advertisement was legalized on September 5, 1987, and became a key element of the campaign for the "NO" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. Finally, the "NO" to Pinochet won with 55.99% of the votes, against 44.01% of the votes. Thus presidential and legislative elections were called for the next year.

Furthermore, in July 1989, a [[Chilean referendum, 1989|constitutional referendum]] took place after long negotiations between the government and the opposition. If approved, 54 constitutional reforms were to be implemented, among which the reform of the way that the Constitution itself could be reformed, the restriction of [[state of emergency]] dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], the strengthening of constitutional rights as well as of the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to the political life. All parties in the political spectrum supported the reforms, with the exception of the small right-wing Avanzada Nacional and other minor parties, and the reforms were passed with 91.25% of the vote

==Aylwin administration==
Representing the ''[[Concertación]]'' coalition which supported the return to democracy, gathering the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat Party]] (PDC), the [[Socialist Party (Chile)|Socialist Party]] (PS), the [[Party for Democracy (Chile)|Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD), Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]] won a sweeping victory in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1989|first democratic elections]], in December 1989, since the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 election]] won by [[Salvador Allende]]. Patricio Aylwin had gathered around him 3,850,023 votes (55.17%), while the center-right supermarket tycoon [[Francisco Javier Errázuriz Talavera]], who represented the [[Progressive Union of the Centrist Center|UCCP]] party, managed to take 15.05% of the vote, which had as main effects to lower right-wing candidate [[Hernán Büchi]]'s score to 29.40% (approximately 2 millions votes, almost half than Patricio Aylwin).
[[File:Aylwin Banda (2).jpg|thumb|In December 1989, Patricio Aylwin, head of the ''Concertación'' coalition, won the first democratic election in Chile since 1970.]]
The ''Concertación'' coalition dominated Chilean politics for much of the next two decades. It established in February 1991 the [[National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation]], which released in February 1991 the [[Rettig Report]] on human rights violations during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. This report, contested by human rights NGOs and associations of political prisoners, counted 2,279 cases of "[[forced disappearance|disappearances]]" which could be proved and registered. Of course, the very nature of "disappearances" made such investigations very difficult, while many victims were still intimidated by the authorities, and did not dare go to the local police center to register themselves on lists, since the police officers were the same as during the dictatorship.

The same problem arose, several years later, for the [[Valech Report]], released in 2004 and which counted almost 30,000 victims of [[torture]], among testimonies from 35,000 persons. However, the Rettig Report did list important detention and torture centers, such as the [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|Esmeralda ship]], the [[Estadio Nacional de Chile|Víctor Jara Stadium]], [[Villa Grimaldi]], etc.  The registering of victims of the dictatorship, and then, in the 2000s, trials of military personnel guilty of human rights violations, would dominate the struggle for the recognition of crimes committed during the dictatorship by human rights NGOs and associations of political prisoners, whom many resided in exile.

Beside implementing the Rettig Commission, Aylwin's government established a ''Comisión Especial de Pueblos indígenas'' (Special Commission of Indigenous People), whose report provided the intellectual framework of the "Indigenous Law" (''ley indígena'') or law n° 19 253, promulgated on September 28, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.cl/masma/patri_edu/PDF/LeyIndigena.PDF LEY Nº 19.253 - LEY INDÍGENA] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recognized in particular the [[Mapuche]] people as inherent part of the Chilean nation. Other indigenous people officially recognized included [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, [[Atacameña]]s, [[Kolla people|Colla]]s, [[Quechua people|Quechua]]s, [[Rapa-Nui]], [[Yámana]]s and [[Kawashkar]]s. Despite this state proclamation of indigenous rights, conflicts brought by land-occupations and Mapuche's claims led to state repression and the use of the anti-terrorist law against Mapuche activists, a law voted by the military ''junta''.

==Frei Ruiz-Tagle administration==
{{main|Chilean presidential election, 1993}}
Preparing for the [[Chilean presidential election, 1993|1993 election]], the Concertación held primaries in May 1993, opposing on its left-wing [[Ricardo Lagos]] ([[Party for Democracy (Chile)|PPD]]) to Christian-Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], ([[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|PDC]]), the son of former President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] (1911–1982, President from 1964 to 1970). Eduardo Frei won these primaries by a large majority of 63%.

The right-wing, grouped in the [[Alliance for Chile]], also held primaries opposing [[Sebastián Piñera Echenique|Sebastián Piñera]] ([[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]], RN, the largest right-wing party at the time), who had supported the "NO" during the 1988 plebiscite on the return to civilian rule, to [[Arturo Alessandri Besa]], former member of the [[National Party (Chile)|National Party]] (PN, opposed to Eduardo Frei in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 presidential election]]) and currently representant of the [[Independent Democrat Union]] (UDI). Alessandri won those, and thus represented the Alliance for Chile against the Concertación.

Others candidates included [[José Piñera]], former Minister in the early 1980s who had implemented the law granting property of [[copper]] to the [[Chilean Armed Forces]], who presented himself as an independent (6%); ecologist [[Manfred Max-Neef]] (5.55%), representative of the ''Left-Wing Democratic Alternative'' (which gathered the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] (PCC), [[MAPU]] (part of the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] coalition of Allende) and the [[Christian Left Party (Chile)|Christian Left Party]]); [[Eugenio Pizarro Poblete]] (less than 5%); and finally [[Cristián Reitze Campos]] of the left-wing [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]] (1.1%).

On 28 May 1993, the ''Boinazo'' took place, during which paratroopers surrounded the Chilean Army headquarters located close-by to the [[Palacio de la Moneda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcgnews.com/santiagotimes/index.php?nav=story&amp;story_id=14609&amp;topic_id=15 Chile: Illicit Croatia Arms Sale Case in Final Stage], ''[[The Santiago Times]]'', 4 September 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motive of the military uprising was the opening of [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|investigations concerning the "Pinocheques"]], or checks received by Pinochet for a total amount of $3 million in the frame of kickbacks from an arms deal.&lt;ref name=Boinazo&gt;[http://www.sii.cl/SIIPRENSA/2005/2509/02.htm El verdadero objetivo del "boinazo" de Pinochet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911134856/http://www.sii.cl/SIIPRENSA/2005/2509/02.htm |date=2007-09-11 }}, ''Diario Siete'', 25 September 2005 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, unnoticed at the time, a few days before, Jorge Schaulsohn, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had also denounced irregularities during arms trade committed by the [[Chilean Army]] through the intermediary of the FAMAE (Factories and Arsenals of the Army of Chile) &amp;mdash; much later connected to the [[Gerardo Huber]] case, who was assassinated the year before.&lt;ref name=Boinazo/&gt;

Frei Ruiz-Tagle finally won the election in the first turn, held in December 1993, with an [[absolute majority]] of almost 58%, and more than 4 millions votes against Arturo Allesandri who gathered around 1,700 000 votes (24.4%). Eduardo Frei took office in March 1994 and presided for a 6-year term, until 2000. During his term, it was not possible to judge any military for his role during the dictatorship, while large sectors of the Chilean society remained ''Pinochetista''.

==Arrest and trial of Pinochet and Lagos administration==
{{further|Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|Chilean presidential election, 1999-2000}}
[[File:Feretro Pinochet.jpg|thumb|Pinochet's funeral.]]
Following an agreement between Pinochet and [[Andrés Zaldívar Larraín]], president of the [[Chilean Senate|Senate]], the latter voted to abolish the date of 11 September as a National Holiday which celebrated the 1973 coup. Supporters of Pinochet had blocked until then any such attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/155040.stm Chile abolishes coup holiday], ''[[BBC News]]'', August 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Pinochet traveled to London for an operation. Once there, he [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial|was arrested]] on the orders of Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]], provoking worldwide attention, not only because of the history of Chile and South America, but also because this was one of the first arrest of a dictator based on the [[universal jurisdiction]] principle. Pinochet tried to defend himself by referring to the State Immunity Act of 1978, an argument rejected by British judicial system. However, UK Home Secretary [[Jack Straw]] took the responsibility to release him on medical grounds, and refused to extradite him to Spain. Pinochet returned to Chile in March 2000. Upon descending the plane on his wheelchair, he quickly stood up and saluted the cheering crowd of supporters, including an army band playing his favorite military march tunes, which was awaiting him at the airport in Santiago. President [[Ricardo Lagos]], who had just been sworn in on March 11, said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/665342.stm Thousands march against Pinochet], ''[[BBC]]'', March 4, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing the ''[[Concertación]]'' coalition for democracy, Ricardo Lagos had won [[Chilean presidential election, 1999-2000|the election]] just a few months before, by a very tight score of less than 200,000 votes (51.32%) against [[Joaquín Lavín]] (less than 49%), who represented the right-wing [[Alliance for Chile]]. None of the six candidates had obtained an absolute majority on the first turn held on December 12, 1999. Lagos was sworn-in on March 11, 2000, for a 6-year term.

In June 2000, the Congress voted a new law which granted anonymity to members of the armed forces who provide information on the ''[[desaparecidos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/807599.stm Soldier confirms Chile stadium killings], ''[[BBC]]'', 27 June 2000 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the trials concerning human rights violations during the dictatorship continued. Pinochet was stripped of his [[parliamentary immunity]] in August 2000 by the [[Chilean Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and indicted by judge [[Juan Guzmán Tapia]]. Tapia had ordered in 1999 the arrest of five military men, including General Pedro Espinoza Bravo of the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], for their role in the [[Caravan of Death]] following the 11 September coup. Arguing that the bodies of the "[[forced disappearances|disappeared]]" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]] which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military.  Pinochet's trial continued until his death on December 10, 2006, with an alternance (badword) of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution. The Supreme Court affirmed in March 2005 Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General [[Carlos Prats]] in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of [[Operation Condor]]. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were "disappeared" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial fundings of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between USD $4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[Shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only "a former public official"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caraïbs islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing Belgian 'Mirage' air-fighters in 1994, Dutch 'Léopard' tanks, Swiss 'Mowag' tanks or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], in the middle of the [[Balkans war]].) His wife, [[Lucía Hiriart]], and his son, Marco Antonio Pinochet, were also sued for complicity. For the fourth time in seven years, Pinochet was indicted by the Chilean justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/28/chile.pinochet/?section=cnn_topstories U.S. sends back Pinochet daughter], ''[[CNN]]'', January 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean authorities took control in August 2005 of the [[Colonia Dignidad]] concentration camp, directed by [[ex-Nazi]] [[Paul Schäfer]].

===2005 reform of the 1980 Constitution===
Over 50 reforms to Pinochet's Constitution were approved in 2005, which eliminated some of the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (institutional senators, or [[senators for life]]) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. These reforms led the President to controversially declare Chile's transition to democracy as complete. However, the [[anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist measures]] of it remained in force, and have been used against the [[Mapuche]]s. Furthermore, the military still receives money from the copper industry.

In 2006, the ''Concertación'' again won the [[Chilean presidential election, 2005–2006|presidential election]]: [[Michelle Bachelet]], Chile's first woman president, beat [[Sebastián Piñera]] (Alliance for Chile), and obtained more than 53% of the vote. Bachelet's first political crisis occurred with [[2006 student protests in Chile|massive protests by student]], who were demanding free bus fares and the waiving of the university admissions test (PSU) fee, as well as the longer-term demands, which included: the abolition of the Organic Constitutional Law on Teaching (LOCE), an end to municipalization of subsidized education, a reform to the Full-time School Day policy (JEC) and a quality education for all. The protests peaked on May 30, 2006, when 790,000 students adhered to strikes and marches throughout the country, becoming Chile's largest student demonstration of the past three decades.&lt;ref name=NLR&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Riesco | first = Manuel | title = Is Pinochet dead? | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 47 | publisher = New Left Review | date = September–October 2007 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/47/manuel-riesco-is-pinochet-dead | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://newleftreview.org/article/download_pdf?language=es&amp;id=2685 Spanish pdf.] [http://newleftreview.org/article/download_pdf?language=it&amp;id=2685 Italian pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006–2007 Chilean corruption scandals]] were a series of events in which the Chilean governing [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|''Concertación'']] was under investigations of corruption.

In June 2007, General [[Raúl Iturriaga]], the former deputy director of the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for the abduction of Luis Dagoberto San Martin in 1974. Iturriaga had been in hiding from the authorities for a number of years{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} but was arrested in August 2007.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Lagos | first1 = Claudia | last2 = McDonneln | first2 = Patrick J. | title = Pinochet-era general is caught | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-chile3aug03,0,1144327.story?coll=la-home-world | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = August 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CUT (Chile)|CUT]] trade-union federation called for demonstrations in August 2007. These went on during the night, and at least 670 people were arrested (including journalists and a mayor,&lt;ref name=RFI&gt;{{cite web | last = Martin | first = Claire | title = Affrontements violents lors des manifestations anti-Bachelet | url = http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/092/article_55854.asp | website = rfi.fr | publisher = [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] | location = France | date = 30 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 33 ''[[Carabiniers of Chile|carabineros]]'' injured.&lt;ref name=Coop&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Ultimo balance cifra en 670 los detenidos en jornada de protesta | work = [[Radio Cooperativa]] | date = 30 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were aimed against the Bachelet's government free market policies.

In August 2007, a BBC correspondent wrote that about three million workers, roughly half the workforce, earned the [[minimum wage]] of $260 (£130) a month.&lt;ref name=BBC_Demos/&gt; At the same time, Arturo Martínez, general secretary of the CUT, requested explanations from the government, and accused it of having stirred up the tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Arturo Martínez acusó al Gobierno de generar clima de violencia | work = [[Radio Cooperativa]] | date = 30 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians from the center-right ''Alianza'' and from the governing center-left ''Concertación'' have in turn criticized the CUT for the violence of the protest.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Deen.jpg|157px|thumb|left|[[Deen (singer)|Deen]] performing "In the Disco" for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]
'''"In the Disco"''' was the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnia-Herzegovinian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]], performed entirely in [[English Language|English]] (the first time the country had not sung at least partly in one of its official languages) by [[Deen (singer)|Deen]].

As Bosnia had not finished in the top ten in the previous Contest, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed twenty-first (following [[Serbia and Montenegro]]'s [[Željko Joksimović]] &amp; [[Ad Hoc Orchestra]] with "[[Lane Moje]]" and preceding the [[Netherlands]]'s [[Re-Union]] with "[[Without You (Eurovision song)|Without You]]"). It received 133 points to place 7th in the 22-song semi-final and qualify for the final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=9 Eurovision Semi-Final 2004 Scoreboard]. Eurovision.tv. Retrieved 30.07.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final, it was performed twelfth (following [[Croatia]]'s [[Ivan Mikulić]] with [[You Are the Only One (Ivan Mikulić song)|You Are The Only One]] and preceding [[Belgium]]'s [[Xandee]] with "[[1 Life]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 91 points, placing 9th in a field of 24 and qualifying Bosnia for the final at the next Contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=8 Eurovision Final 2004 Scoreboard]. Eurovision.tv. Retrieved 30.07.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is an up-tempo Eurodisco number, with Deen expressing his desire to "stay all night, in the disco".&lt;ref&gt;[http://diggiloo.net/?2004ba "In the Disco" Lyrics]. Diggiloo Thrush. Retrieved 30.07.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It was succeeded as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005 Contest]] by [[Feminnem]] with "[[Call Me (Feminnem song)|Call Me]]".

'''Intelsat 29e''', also known as '''IS-29e''' is a [[High-throughput satellite|high throughput]] [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] designed and manufactured by [[Boeing Satellite Development Center|Boeing]] on the [[Boeing 702|BSS-702MP]]  platform.&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat29e /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat29e /&gt; It is the first satellite of the Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; service, and covers [[CONUS]], Latin America and North America from the [[50th meridian west|50° West]] longitude, where it is replaced [[Intelsat 1R]]. It also replaced [[Intelsat 805]] which was moved from [[56th meridian west|56.5° West]] to [[169th meridian east|169° East]].&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-wpepicngplatform /&gt; It has a mixed [[C band (IEEE)|C band]], [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] and [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] payload with all bands featuring wide and the K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; also featuring spot beams.&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat29e /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat29e /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat29e /&gt;

==Satellite description==
The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by [[Boeing Satellite Development Center|Boeing]] on the [[Boeing 702]]MP [[satellite bus]].&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat29e /&gt;&lt;ref name=satbeams-intelsat29e /&gt; It has a launch mass of {{convert|6,552|kg|abbr=on}} and a design life of more than 15 years.&lt;ref name=arianespace-launchkitva228 /&gt; When stowed for launch, the satellite measures {{convert|7.5|x|3|x|2|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arianespace-launchkitva228 /&gt;

It is powered by two wings, with four panels each, of [[Triple-junction solar cell|triple-junction]] [[Gallium arsenide|GsAs]] [[solar cell]]s, that span {{convert|44|m|abbr=on}} when deployed.&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt; Intelsat 29e can generate 15.8&amp;nbsp;Kw at the end of its expected life and has four [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion]] batteries.&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt;

This [[Three-axis stabilisation|three axis stabilized]] platform has a [[Bipropellant rocket|bi-propellant propulsion]] system using [[Nitrogen tetroxide|NTO]]/[[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It has a {{convert|449|N|abbr=on}} [[Liquid Apogee Engine]] for [[Orbital maneuver|orbit raising]] and {{convert|22|N|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4|N|abbr=on}} thrusters for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]].&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt; The propellant tanks hold approximately {{convert|1550|kg|abbr=on}} of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and {{convert|2000|kg|abbr=on}} of NTO.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160113 /&gt; This new series of geosynchronous satellites lack an [[Attitude control#Earth sensor|Earth Sensor]], and thus enter Earth pointing attitude based on the orbital position as determined by the [[star tracker]].&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160218 /&gt;

Its payload is the first [[High-throughput satellite|high throughput]] Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; deployment, of the six planned as of January 2016.&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20160127 /&gt; The Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; is characterized by the implementation of frequency reuse due to a mix of frequency and polarization in small spot beams. Not only applied to the classical [[High-throughput satellite|HTS]] [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]], but also applying the same technique in [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] and [[C band (IEEE)|C band]]. The Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; series also keep the use of wide beams to offer high throughput and broadcast capabilities in the same satellite.&lt;ref name=intelsat-wpepicngplatform /&gt;

The payload is designed and manufactured by Boeing based on the work of the [[Wideband Global SATCOM|WGS]] constellation.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20150714 /&gt; It most innovative feature of this fully digital payload, is that it enables to dynamically link two sites through a single satellite without needing to go through a ground station.&lt;ref name=intelsat-wpepicngplatform /&gt;&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20160127 /&gt;

In the case of Intelsat 29e, the C band side has 14 physical [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] with a bandwidth 864&amp;nbsp;MHz K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; or 24 [[transponder equivalent]].&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt; It covers South America in a wide beam.&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat29e /&gt; The K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band has physical 56 transponders (249 transponder equivalent) for a total bandwidth of 9,395&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt; The K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; spot beams cover the Americas and the North Atlantic route, while a wide beam can broadcast to North America and North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat29e /&gt; The K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band payload has 450&amp;nbsp;MHz of bandwidth on a global beam centered at its position.&lt;ref name=airbusds-launchkitva228 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-intelsat29e /&gt;

==History==
In July 2009, [[Intelsat]] became the first customer of the [[Boeing 702|Boeing 702MP]]  platform, when it place an order for four spacecrafts, [[Intelsat 21]], [[Intelsat 22]], [[Intelsat 27]] and what would become '''Intelsat 29e'''.&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt;

On June 7, 2012, Intelsat announced the Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; platform. It would improve available bandwidth due to the use of frequency reuse and polarization and feature spot and wide beams, enabling high bandwidth and broadcast applications on a backward compatible way. The first two satellites would be Intelsat 29e and Intelsat 33e.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20120607 /&gt; On September 4, 2012, Intelsat and Boeing announced that Intelsat 29e, the first Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; satellite, would be made by Boeing on the 702MP platform, completing the 2009 order of four such satellites.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20120904 /&gt;

In May 2013 Intelsat ordered a further four 702MP-based Epic&lt;sup&gt;NG&lt;/sup&gt; satellites, [[Intelsat 32e]], [[Intelsat 33e]] and two as of August 2016 unnamed spacecraft. And in July 2014 a sixth Epic was ordered, [[Intelsat 35e]].&lt;ref name=boeing-backgounderintelsat /&gt;&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20160127 /&gt;

During 2013, Intelsat signed a contract to launch Intelsat 29e aboard an [[Ariane 5]].&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160126 /&gt; Brian Sing, was assigned as Senior Program Manager for the launch aboard the rocket.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20151211a /&gt;

During June 2015, the payload was integrated and went through testing. First it was deployed and stowed back, then it went through [[Environmental noise|sound environment]] and [[Shaker (testing device)|vibration testing]], and finally deployment was tested again.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20150617 /&gt; On July 14, 2015, the payload integration to the [[satellite bus]] and its non-environmental testing was completed. It would then go through the  [[Environmental tests|environmental testing]] campaign which would start with [[thermal vacuum chamber]] tests.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20150714 /&gt; It is a Boeing design based on the work of the [[Wideband Global SATCOM|WGS]] constellation.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20150714 /&gt;

On December 10, 2015, Intelsat announced that the launch date for Intelsat 29e had been set for January 27, 2016.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20151210 /&gt;

After four years of project development, Intelsat 29e arrived to the launch site aboard an [[Antonov 124]] on December 11, 2015.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20151211 /&gt; At the site's Payload Processing Facility, Boeing technicians unpackaged the spacecraft and associated equipment and performed a quick fit check.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20151214 /&gt; On the second weeks of January, 2016, the satellite was fueled and installed in the rocket payload adapter.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160113 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160116 /&gt; By January 21, the spacecraft had been moved to the Final Assembly Building where it was mated to the launcher rocket.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160121 /&gt; On January 26, 2016 all checks were completed and the launch review for the next day was completed.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160126 /&gt;

On January 27, 2016, at 23:20&amp;nbsp;UTC, an [[Ariane 5 ECA]] launched from the [[ELA-3]] launch pad at the [[Guiana Space Center]].&lt;ref name=gsp-intelsat29e /&gt;&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20160127 /&gt; Intelsat 29e, its only passenger, separated 30 minutes later, and the satellite first signals were received shortly afterwards by the Kumsan, South Korea, Ground Station.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160127 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160129 /&gt; The next two days were spent evaluating the health of the satellite and determining the exact orbit, then a series of nine orbital maneuvers to raise the perigee to {{convert|35,786|km|abbr=on}} were started.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160203 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160204 /&gt; This orbit circularization would consume approximately {{convert|2500|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160113 /&gt;

When it reached its test position at 49.7° West, it deployed its antennas and solar panels.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160218 /&gt; In a March 28, 2016 blog by Duy Nguyen, Senior Program Manager, it was announced that Intelsat 29e had successfully passed the 30-day payload in-orbit testing (PIOT) and was undergoing the first performance testing with an anchor customer. It had been particularly challenging because it was the first digital configurable payload for Intelsat, and they had to also test the ground segment for the first time.&lt;ref name=intelsat-news20160328 /&gt;

The '''''Jacobstads Wapen''''' is a modern [[Ship replica|replica]] of an 18th-century [[galeas]] built in [[Jakobstad]], Finland, between 1988 and 1994. She is built according to blueprints by the Swedish warship architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman]] dating from 1755, the oldest vessel blueprints found in Finland. She is classified by the Finnish national board of navigation as a passenger, special-purpose vessel. The 18th century galleon ''Jacobstads Wapen'' was sold off in [[Amsterdam]].

She has been used as a symbol for Jakobstad but as of late has encountered financial problems. She participated in the festivities at the 300 year anniversary of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], Russia, in 2003. In 2005 it was discovered that some of the woodwork had deteriorated and is currently awaiting renovations.

==History==
During [[World War II]], Juneau Airport was used by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a transport link between the combat bases being established in the Aleutians and airfields in the Continental United States. It was also used by [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] and facilitated the transport of [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft to the [[Soviet Union]] via [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] ([[Marks Army Airfield]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical airline service===
[[Pan American World Airways]] ([[Pan Am]]) was one of the first major airlines to serve Juneau. In 1947, Pan Am was operating daily [[Douglas DC-4]] propliner service to [[Seattle]] via a stop at the [[Annette Island Airport]], which served [[Ketchikan]] at the time and also flew DC-4 service twice a week nonstop to [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] in the [[Yukon Territory]] of [[Canada]] with continuing, no change of plane service to [[Fairbanks]], [[Galena]] and [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Nov. 1, 1947 Pan American World Airways system timetable.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pan Am later operated [[Douglas DC-6B]] and [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] aircraft into the airport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sitnews.com&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1950s, [[Pacific Northern Airlines]] served the airport with [[Douglas DC-4]] and [[Lockheed Constellation]] propliners with daily service to Seattle via a stop at Annette Island as well as nonstop to [[Anchorage]] and [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]] and direct to [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 2, 1958 Pacific Northern Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;

The jet age arrived in Juneau during the early 1960s.  In 1963, Pan Am was operating daily [[Boeing 707]] jetliner flights to Seattle via a stop at Annette Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Aug. 1, 1963 Pan American World Airways system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1965, Pacific Northern was operating [[Boeing 720]] jets nonstop to Seattle, Anchorage and Annette Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 1, 1965 Pacific Northern Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Pacific Northern was acquired by and merged into [[Western Airlines]], which continued to operate jet service into the airport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetablemages.com{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Aug. 1, 1967 Pacific Northern Airlines (a division of Western Airlines) system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1968, Western was operating daily nonstop [[Boeing 720B]] jet service to Seattle, Anchorage and Annette Island with one stop direct service to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Aug. 1, 1968 Western Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1969, [[Alaska Airlines]] was operating [[Boeing 727-100]] jet service into the airport on a daily basis with a round trip routing of Seattle - [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] - Juneau - Yakutat - Cordova - Anchorage - [[Unalakleet]] - Nome - [[Kotzebue]].&lt;ref name="timetableimages.com"&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Summer-Fall 1969 Alaska Airlines system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  Alaska Air has served Juneau for over 45 years and primarily operated [[Boeing 727-100]], [[727-200]] and [[737-200]] jetliners into the airport (including the [[Boeing 737-200]] passenger/freight [[Combi aircraft]]) in addition to [[Boeing 720]] jetliners before switching to later model [[Boeing 737]] jets.&lt;ref&gt;"Alaska Airlines" by Cliff &amp; Nancy Hollenbeck, www.hollenbeckproductions.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides operating jet service into Juneau, Alaska Airlines also flew smaller prop and turboprop aircraft from the airport in the past including the [[Convair 240]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and two versions of the [[Grumman Goose]] [[amphibian aircraft]], being a piston powered model and a turboprop version with the latter being named the "Turbo-Goose" by the airline.&lt;ref name="timetableimages.com"/&gt;  Alaska Airlines began serving Juneau during the late 1960s following its acquisition of two local air service carriers, [[Alaska Coastal Airlines]], which was based in Juneau, and Cordova Airlines.[[File:Juneau International Airport Main Terminal and Control Tower.jpg|thumb|250px|Closeup view of the airport's main terminal, including both older and newer [[control tower]]s.  [[Mendenhall Glacier]] is seen in the background.]]Other air carriers that served Juneau over the years included [[Wien Air Alaska]] and [[MarkAir]], which had both been based in Alaska.  [[Western Airlines]] also returned to Juneau after ceasing service during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, April 30, 1972 Western Airlines route map&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Wien was operating [[Fairchild F-27]] turboprop flights into the airport three days a week on a routing of Juneau - Whitehorse - Fairbanks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 16, 1968 Wien Air Alaska system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;   By 1977, Wien was flying [[Boeing 737-200]] jet service twice a week from the airport on a routing of Juneau - Whitehorse - Fairbanks - Anchorage and by 1979 the airline was operating daily nonstop 737-200 jet flights to Seattle and Anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 15, 1977 Wien Air Alaska system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle-Juneau &amp; Anchorage-Juneau schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early and mid 1980s, Western was operating daily nonstop [[Boeing 727-200]] service to Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, April 1, 1983 &amp; Feb. 15, 1985 Official Airline Guide (OAG) editions, Seattle-Juneau schedules&lt;/ref&gt; Following its acquisition of and merger with Western in 1987, [[Delta Air Lines]] continued to serve Juneau with daily nonstop [[Boeing 727-200]] flights to Seattle and direct, one stop service to Los Angeles into the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, Dec. 15, 1989 &amp; Oct. 1, 1991 Official Airline Guide (OAG) editions, Seattle-Juneau schedules&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1995, MarkAir operated daily nonstop [[Boeing 737-400]] jet service to Seattle and Anchorage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.departedflights.com, April 2, 1995 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Seattle-Juneau &amp; Anchorage-Juneau schedules&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, [[Delta Air Lines]] returned to Juneau offering first seasonal, and then year round service before leaving the market again at the end of 2016 and now serves Juneau on a seasonal basis.  Delta entering the market to compete with Alaska Air resulted in fares to Seattle being reduced almost by half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-04-11/delta-end-year-round-service-juneau |title=Delta to end year-round service in Juneau |last=Phu |first=Lisa |publisher=Juneau Empire |date=April 11, 2016 |website=JuneauEmprie.com |access-date=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

[[File:JNU2.jpg|thumb|An [[Alaska Airlines]] [[Boeing 737-400|Boeing 737-400C]] at Juneau International Airport.]]
Because of the extreme geography of Southeastern [[Alaska]], land flat enough for airport facilities is at a premium. One of these few areas is the current location of the airport: the Mendenhall Wetlands State Game Refuge, a vastly diverse and ecologically critical region rich with plant life, small mammals, birds, several species of salmon, even [[American black bear|black bear]]s and [[bald eagle]]s. The original airstrip was built in the 1930s, and no environmental impact analysis was performed at that time. The area currently housing the terminal and runways had to be filled in and part of the [[Gastineau Channel]] had to be dredged before the airport, in its current incarnation, could be built.

The airport is the only way in and out of the city, with exception of the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] and cargo ships traversing the [[Inside Passage]]. In the past, concerns have been raised over the safety of the airport, which is comparatively quite small, with the amount of air traffic it receives. In addition to frequent arrivals and departures from hubs such as [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle/Tacoma]], the airport also has daily and/or weekly service to smaller regional communities, a [[floatplane]] runway/docking area, and a [[heliport]]. Three major construction projects are planned at the airport within the next few years. An airport terminal renovation project will be the first comprehensive upgrade to the passenger facilities in over twenty years and will provide for better flow through the passenger screening process. The airfield maintenance facilities project will provide much needed room for storage and servicing of snow removal equipment. The runway safety area project will extend the runway at both ends and improve taxiways to meet Federal Aviation Administration requirements.

==Accidents and incidents==
On September 4, 1971, [[Alaska Airlines Flight 1866]], a [[Boeing 727-100]], crashed into the easterly slope of a canyon in the Chilkat Range of the [[Tongass National Forest]] while on approach to Juneau International Airport. All 111 passengers and crew on board were killed. At the time it was the worst single airplane air disaster in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kiffer|first=Dave|date=September 7, 2011|title=40 Years ago, 111 died in Alaska Airlines Crash Near Juneau|url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/AlaskaAirJuneau/090711_ak_airlines_crash.html|newspaper=Stories in the News|location=[[Ketchikan]]|access-date=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaffee Alt Wien''' is a traditional [[Viennese coffee house|Viennese café]] located at Bäckerstraße 9 in the [[Innere Stadt]] first district in [[Vienna]], Austria. It was established in 1936 by [[Leopold Hawelka]] and his wife [[Josefine Hawelka|Josefine]] on the day after their wedding. They ran the café until 1939 at which time they moved to [[Dorotheergasse]], where they opened a new coffee house, the famous [[Café Hawelka]].

The Alt Wien is nowadays not one of Vienna's chic coffee houses, but instead rather smoky and gloomy, and the clientele often includes bizarre characters. Consequently, in 1976, a notable [[happening]] by the Viennese artist [[Gottfried Helnwein]] took place in the café. Since the 1980s, the Kaffee Alt Wien has developed into a night café.

[[File:World Population Cartogram Map 2002.tif|thumb|A [[cartogram]] of the world population in 2002.]]

This is a list of [[country|countries]] and [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] by [[population]]. It includes [[list of sovereign states|sovereign states]], inhabited [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard [[ISO 3166-1]]. For instance, the [[United Kingdom]] is considered as a single entity while the constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain [[list of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] not found in ISO 3166-1.

Also given in percent is each country's population compared with the [[World population|population of the world]], which the [[United Nations]] estimates at {{#expr: {{worldpop}}/1000000000 round 2}} billion as of today.

==Method==
{{See also|List of countries and territories by population density|List of regional organizations by population}}
Figures used in this chart are based on the most up to date [[Population projection|estimate or projections]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.economist.com/node/18651512 | title=China's Population: The Most Surprising Demographic Crisis |journal=The Economist |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the national [[census]] authority where available, and are usually rounded off. Where updated national data are not available, figures are based on the projections for 2018 by the Population Division of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].&lt;ref name="unpop"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ | title=World Population Prospects 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of [[statistics|accuracy]], the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total. A handful of nations have not conducted a census in over 30 years, providing high error margin estimates only.

Areas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the [[countries of the United Kingdom]], are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities, such as the [[European Union]],&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The European Union is a ''[[sui generis]]'' [[supranational union]] whose sovereign members delegate to it by treaty certain powers that are often exercised by sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 510,284,430 on January 1, 2016, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has {{#expr: 510284430 / {{worldpop}} * 100 round 2}}% of the world's population&amp;nbsp;— see {{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00001&amp;tableSelection=1&amp;footnotes=yes&amp;labeling=labels&amp;plugin=1|title=Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface（TGM）table|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michele Cachia''' ({{lang-mt|Mikiel Cachia}}, 30 September 1760 – 24 January 1839) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] architect and military engineer. He is also known for his role during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|Maltese uprising]] of 1798–1800.

==Life==
Michele Cachia was born on 30 September 1760 in the town of [[Żejtun]]. He was the cousin of [[Antonio Cachia]], another architect and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|authorlink1=Stephen C. Spiteri|title=Fort Tigné 1792|journal=Arx – International Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=2011|issue=1|page=65|url=https://issuu.com/arkitettura/docs/forttigne?e=1720231/2966495}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1784, he applied for the post of ''perito agrimensore''. Like his father and grandfather, Cachia also worked in the construction of the [[Church of St Catherine, Żejtun|Żejtun Parish Church]].&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt; He was also an [[adjutant]] within the Żejtun militia while [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|Malta was ruled by the Order of St. John]].&lt;ref name=arx/&gt;

Cachia took part in the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|Maltese uprising]] of 1798–1800 against the [[French occupation of Malta]]. He designed a number of [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798–1800)|batteries]] for the insurgents, including the [[Corradino Batteries]], [[Tal-Borg Battery]] and the [[Żejtun Batteries]]. In 1799, he also designed a [[gunpowder magazine]] at [[San Rocco Battery]].&lt;ref name=arx&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798–1800|journal=Arx – Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|pages=16, 34|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1801 and 1821, Cachia lived in [[Floriana]], a suburb of the capital [[Valletta]].&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt; In 1802, he went to England as part of a delegation of Maltese people.&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt;

Cachia was responsible for the construction of the hospital in [[Victoria, Gozo|Rabat, Gozo]]. His most famous work is the [[portico]] of the Church of Our Lady of Divine Providence in [[Siġġiewi]], which he designed after the church was damaged by a lightning strike in 1815&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 1 A-F|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church had been built in the 18th century to designs of [[Andrea Belli]].

Cachia had a collection of notebooks containing personal notes about property in [[Valletta]]. 217 notebooks have survived, and they contain a lot of information about the city in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=mhs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zammit|first1=Andrè|title=Valletta and Michele Cachia (1760 –1839) – A factual appraisal through his notebooks|url=http://mhs.eu.pn/60/60_26.html|website=mhs.eu.pn|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Military Committee for National Salvation''' ([[French language|French]], ''Comité Militaire de Salut National'', CMSN) was a military government of the [[Islamic Republic of Mauritania]] that took power in 1979. It was installed by [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]], [[Ahmed Ould Bouceif]] and fellow [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s, in an internal regime/military [[coup d'état]] on April 6, 1979, removing [[Col.]] [[Mustapha Ould Salek]] of the [[Military Committee for National Recovery]] (CRMN) from effective power. He was replaced by [[Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Louly]] in May 1979; Haidallah would later emerge as the main military strongman, and go on to assume full powers, only to be deposed by [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]]. The CMSN remained as an institution until 1992, when Taya introduced a [[multi-party system]] - he himself lost power only in 2005.

The main achievement of the CMSN was to make peace with the [[Western Sahara]]n [[Polisario Front]], which had been fighting Mauritania since the government of [[President of Mauritania|President]] [[Moktar Ould Daddah]] invaded the country in 1975. The CMSN opted for complete withdrawal from the conflict, evacuating southern [[Rio de Oro]] (which had been annexed as [[Tiris El Gharbiya]]) and recognizing the Polisario as the representative of the [[Sahrawi people]]; this led to a crisis in relations with Morocco, which had similarly annexed the northern two-thirds of the country, and was also facing Sahrawi resistance.

{{Politics of Ukraine}}

The '''Ministry of Revenues and Duties''' ({{lang-uk|Міністерство доходів і зборів України}}) was a government ministry of [[Ukraine]].

The ministry was created on 24 December 2012 by a Decree of [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and it merged the country's State Tax Service and the State Customs Service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bp.ubr.ua/profile/klimenko-aleksandr-viktorovich|title=UBR – АЛЕКСАНДР ВИКТОРОВИЧ КЛИМЕНКО – биография}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/klymenko-becomes-head-of-new-revenues-and-duties-ministry-318100.html], [[Kyiv Post]] ( Dec. 24, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Its first and only minister was [[Oleksandr Viktorovych Klymenko|Oleksandr Klymenko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/klymenko-becomes-head-of-new-revenues-and-duties-ministry-318100.html], [[Kyiv Post]] ( Dec. 24, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2014 the ministry was liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/cardnpd?docid=247085827 About liquidation of the Ministry of Revenues and Duties]. Government portal. March 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Its agencies were transferred to the [[Ministry of Finance (Ukraine)|Ministry of Finance]].

On May 27, 2014 it was announced that the ministry will be reorganized into the [[State Fiscal Service (Ukraine)|State Fiscal Service]] and will be subordinated to the Ministry of Finances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150202041118/http://espreso.tv/news/2014/05/27/zamist_mindokhodiv_teper_bude_derzhavna_fiskalna_sluzhba___yacenyuk Yatsenyuk left the Arbuov's child, but renamed it into the State Fiscal Service].

==Corruption case==
The building of this ministry contained a large [[jacuzzi]]; [[Angel|angelic]] [[fresco]] on the ceiling; a deluxe [[sauna]] and a "salt room" (with the floor and ceiling covered in salt); allegedly [[bare-knuckle boxing]] matches were held in a specially designed room for it in the building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2618083/Ukraines-tax-office-massage-tables-tanning-booth-boxing-gym.html#ixzz3OdGUk3f5 Boxing gym, tanning booth, hi-tech jacuzzi and a salt room. No, it’s not an expensive health spa… just some of the facilities at Ukraine’s corrupt former tax office], [[DailyMail]] (1 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 31 May 2014 Klymenko is wanted by the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] for the creation of [[tax evasion]] procedures to significantly reducing the customs value of certain companies.&lt;ref name=LIGA/&gt; An alleged example of this is the setting up of non-existing firms to whittle tax obligations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/06/10/ap-impact-wide-scale-ukrainian-scam-intercepted-billions-in-taxes-using-fake/ AP IMPACT: Wide scale Ukrainian scam intercepted billions in taxes using fake companies], [[Fox News]] (June 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This and other alleged crimes are to have costed the state budget of Ukraine 6 billion [[Ukrainian hryvnia]].&lt;ref name=LIGA&gt;{{ru icon}}'''/(website has automatic [[Google Translate]] option)''' [http://file.liga.net/person/3778-aleksandr-klimenko.html Short bio], LIGA&lt;/ref&gt; Klymenko has denied all allegations against him and has called them "groundless".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/06/10/ap-impact-wide-scale-ukrainian-scam-intercepted-billions-in-taxes-using-fake/ AP IMPACT: Wide scale Ukrainian scam intercepted billions in taxes using fake companies], [[Fox News]] (June 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PaddleDoll.jpg|thumb|right|125px|A paddle doll typical of those found in most Middle Kingdom XI Dynasty (2080 - 1990 BC) tombs of Thebes. This example now resides in a private collection.]]
'''Paddle dolls''' are a type of female figurine found in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs, beginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] period and particularly in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2040&amp;ndash;1750 BC). Female statuettes made of clay, found in later burials, are considered a later development of these sometimes elaborately coiffured wooden dolls.

Paddle dolls were often highly stylized, and archaeologists currently suggest that the emphasis on the breast, hips and pubic area - the sexual characteristics of the figure - symbolizes the sexual aspects of regeneration.  This theory identifies the artifacts as fertility symbols placed in burials to guarantee eternal rebirth.  Other theories assert that the dolls may have been placed in tombs to do jobs for the deceased in the Osirian afterworld, to protect the deceased or to provide entertainment.  The latter hypothesis is bolstered by the burial of dolls often in groups with the accoutrements of dancers and musicians used by performing troupes ([[Dance_in_ancient_Egypt#Dancers|khener]]).&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris EF | title = Paddle Dolls and Performance | journal = [[Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt]] | volume = 47 | pages = 71-103 |url=http://www.academia.edu/2023000/Paddle_dolls_and_performance_in_ancient_Egypt | date = 2011 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some wooden dolls exhibit extensive wear, suggesting they may have been played with and thus represent [[toy]]s.&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt;

Several types of paddle dolls have been discovered in tombs in Egypt. The dolls are made of wood, flat, and constructed in a shape has led the form to be called a 'paddle doll'.  The dolls seemingly follow a convention for the female figure, emphasizing the hips and hair.  The wooden figures are usually painted with a geometric pattern of lines and dots.  These patterns may reproduce tattoos or ritual scarring in female Egyptian culture of the period or represent clothing or jewelry.  Some have hair composed of unfired clay and [[faience]] beads strung on flax fiber, sometimes interwoven with squares of straw to imitate gold hair rings.

A fine example of a paddle doll with hair constructed of string and sun-dried clay beads, found in a tomb in [[Ancient Egypt]], is on display at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/toys2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Porcelain Palace''' is a large [[public toilet]] complex at the [[Foreigners' Street]] amusement park in the city of [[Chongqing]], [[China]].

The [[facade]] of the complex was inspired by ancient [[Egyptian art]]. A toilet complex to the south is in the distinctive style of the Spanish Catalan architect [[Antoni Gaudi]]. The complex contains a total of more than 1,000 toilets and [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s making it the largest [[toilet]] complex in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/china-welcomes-the-porcelain-palace/article690333/ | newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] | title=China Welcomes the Porcelain Palace | location=Toronto, Canada | date=25 July 2007 | accessdate=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lifelounge.com.au/technology/news/china-opens-bathroom-with-1000-stalls.aspx | title=China Opens Bathroom With 1000 Stalls | website=www.lifelounge.com.au | publisher=Lifelounge | location=Australia | date=13 July 2007 | accessdate=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive toilet edifice is more than {{convert|3000|m2|sqft}} in size and has been submitted by Chinese authorities to the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/biggest/largest_public_restroom_from_china_set_world_record_70449.htm | website=www.worldrecordacademy.com | publisher=World Record Academy | title=Largest public restroom from China set world record | date=12 July 2007 | accessdate=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primetime 24''' (PT24) was a special package offered on [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] satellite sent out to viewers who mainly live in remote and distant locations. The package consisted of local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates on the East Coast: The service was broadcast via the [[AMC-3]] satellite, encrypted using [[DigiCipher 2]]. Until 2012, the service was owned by Lorac Communications, based in [[Collingwood, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

==History==
When Primetime 24 first started in 1992, the group originally consisted of:

* [[WABC-TV]], [[New York City]] (ABC)
* [[WBBM-TV]], [[Chicago]] (CBS)
* [[WXIA-TV]], [[Atlanta]] (NBC)
* [[WFLD]], Chicago (Fox)

In 1994, however, the two Chicago stations were replaced with [[WRAL-TV]] [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] for CBS and [[WSVN]] Miami for Fox; by 1997, PT24 dropped Fox, and WRAL, due to many pre-emptions of CBS programming, was replaced with [[WSEE-TV]] [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], which has been PT24's CBS affiliate ever since. WABC and WXIA still remained the ABC and NBC (respectively) affiliates for PT24 through 2008; however, for a time, WABC was replaced with [[WJLA-TV]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] and later [[WKRN-TV]] of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; WXIA was replaced with [[WNBC]] of New York City, and later was replaced by [[WTVJ]] in Miami. WABC was dropped in favor of [[WPLG]] on January 1, 2009, and Fox was restored by adding [[WUTV]] of [[Buffalo, New York]].

==Other time zones==
At one point, PT24 offered a package called "The [[Denver]] 5", featuring that city's [[KMGH-TV]] (ABC), [[KCNC-TV]] (CBS), [[KUSA (TV)|KUSA]] (NBC), [[KDVR]] (Fox), and even a [[PBS]] station, [[Rocky Mountain PBS|KRMA]]. At one point, [[The WB|WB]] affiliate [[KWGN-TV]] was added to the mix.

Stations on the West Coast were also included in the late 1990s and early 2000s, featuring [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]'s [[KOMO-TV]] (ABC), [[San Francisco]]'s [[KPIX-TV]] (CBS), and [[Los Angeles]]' [[KNBC]] (NBC).

==Similar packages==
* Netlink offered a network package called "A3" for a time that included WPLG (ABC), [[WUSA-TV]] Washington (CBS), and [[WBZ-TV]] Boston for NBC (later replaced with [[WHDH-TV]], following the 1995 affiliation change).
* Before PT24 began, a package called "Atlantic Coast" was used, which included WPLG, WUSA and WBZ, plus [[WTXF-TV]] from [[Philadelphia]] for Fox.
* In the early days of [[direct broadcast satellite]], many companies offered local channels on a nationwide basis, subject to FCC restrictions: [[PrimeStar]] offered [[WSB-TV]] [[Atlanta]] for ABC, plus, WUSA, WHDH and WTXF, plus a national PBS service. West Coast channels included [[KABC-TV]] from Los Angeles for ABC, [[KOIN]] from [[Portland, Oregon]] for CBS, [[KCRA-TV]] from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] for NBC, and [[KTVU]] from [[San Francisco]] for Fox. [[DirecTV]] offered [[WRAL-TV]] ([[Raleigh, North Carolina]]) and [[KPIX]] (San Francisco) for CBS, [[WNBC]] (New York) and [[KNBC]] (Los Angeles) for NBC, [[KOMO-TV]] (Seattle) and WJLA (Washington, D.C.) for ABC, and [[WNET]] (New York) for PBS.&lt;!--They had east coast NBC affiliates too, I just can't recall them right now.--&gt;
* In the US, [[Dish Network]] and [[DirecTV]] still offer local channels nationally as well, where local service is not available terrestrially or on satellite. In Canada, [[Bell TV]] and [[Shaw Direct]] offer US networks on their services, as do most cable systems, though American commercial stations are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]] regulations.

'''Pulau Ayu''', often called '''Pulau Aju''', '''Ayau''' or simply '''Ajoe''', is a small [[Indonesia]]n island located in the [[Ayu Islands]] above the northern tip of the [[Waigeo]] Islands.

Pulau Ayu is part of the [[Raja Ampat]] regency of the [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] geographical and administrative region of [[Indonesia]].

The two major settlements on the island include Imbik Kuan and Ayu.

The island is surrounded by two large [[reefs]].

[[Pulau Reni]] and [[Pulau Kanobe]] are two other small inhabited islands north of Pulau Ayu.

Access to the island is limited to small [[boats]] due to the reefs and the small size of the island.

==World War II==
Pulau Ayu and all the islands in the Ayu Archipelago were occupied by the [[Japanese Empire]] during [[World War II]] from 1942 until the end of the war in 1945.
