'''Alabaster''' is a [[mineral]] or rock that is soft, often used for carving, and is processed for [[plaster]] powder. Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from [[geologist]]s. The former use is in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of [[gypsum]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/science/gypsum  ''Gypsum'', Britannica, retrieved 8 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fine-grained banded type of [[calcite]].&lt;ref name="OxfMuseum"&gt;''More about alabaster and travertine'', brief guide explaining the different use of these words by geologists, archaeologists, and those in the stone trade. Oxford University Museum of Natural History, 2012, [http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/corsi/files/pdf/Alabaster-travertine.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geology|Geologists]] define alabaster only as the [[gypsum]] type.&lt;ref name="OxfMuseum"/&gt; Chemically, [[gypsum]] is a [[Water of crystallization|hydrous]] [[sulfur|sulfate]] of [[calcium]], while [[calcite]] is a [[carbonate]] of calcium.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; 

Both types of alabaster have similar properties. They are usually lightly colored, translucent, and soft stones. They have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;"Grove": R. W. Sanderson and Francis Cheetham. "Alabaster", [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 13 March 2013, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T001400 subscriber link].&lt;/ref&gt;

The calcite type is also denominated "'''onyx-marble'''", "'''Egyptian alabaster'''", and "'''Oriental alabaster'''" and is geologically described as either a compact banded [[travertine]]&lt;ref name="OxfMuseum" /&gt; or "a [[stalagmitic]] [[limestone]] marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown".&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; "Onyx-marble" is a traditional, but geologically inaccurate, name because both [[onyx]] and [[marble]] have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of "alabaster".

In general, ancient alabaster is [[calcite]] in the wider [[Middle East]], including [[Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], while it is [[gypsum]] in medieval [[Europe]]. Modern alabaster is probably [[calcite]] but may be either. Both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water. They have been used for making a variety of indoor artwork and carving, and they will not survive long outdoors.

The two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses: gypsum alabaster is so soft that a fingernail scratches it ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2), while calcite cannot be scratched in this way (Mohs hardness 3), although it yields to a knife. Moreover, calcite alabaster, being a [[carbonate]], [[effervescence|effervesces]] when treated with [[hydrochloric acid]], while gypsum alabaster remains almost unaffected when thus treated.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alabaster|volume=1|pages=466-467|first=Frederick William|last=Rudler}} Endnotes:

==Etymology==
The origin of "alabaster" is in Middle English through Old French "''alabastre''", in turn derived from [[Latin]] "''alabaster''", and that from [[Greek language|Greek]] "''ἀλάβαστρος''" ("''alabastros''") or "''ἀλάβαστος''" ("''alabastos''"). The Greek words denoted a vase of alabaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233809 Alabastos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The name may be derived further from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] "''a-labaste''", which refers to vessels of the Egyptian goddess [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]]. She was represented as a lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/alabaster alabaster - definition at YourDictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/alabaster "alabaster"], ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions include derivation from the name of the ancient town of Alabastron, [[Egypt]],{{sfn|Rudler|1911}}{{dubious|Circular argument...|date=July 2016}} described in sometimes contradictory manner by ancient Roman authors, e. g. [[Pliny the Elder]] in ''On Stones'' and [[Ptolemy]] in ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''), the location of which is unknown.&lt;ref name="MatHyer"&gt;{{cite book |title= Materia hieroglyphica |author=Sir John Gardner Wilkinson |year=1828 |location=Malta |publisher=privately printed |page=22 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nWgGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA22 |accessdate=26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MatInd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries |author= Alfred Lucas, John Richard Harris |year=2011 |edition=reprint of 4th edition (1962), revised from first (1926) |location=Mineola, NY |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |page=60 |isbn=9780486404462 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8dIoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60 |accessdate=26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and usability==
[[File:Septimius Severus busto-Musei Capitolini.jpg|thumb|Alabaster bust of [[Roman emperor]] [[Septimius Severus]] at the [[Musei Capitolini]], [[Rome]]]]

The purest alabaster is a snow-white material of fine uniform grain, but it often is associated with an oxide of [[iron]], which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone. The coarser varieties of gypsum alabaster are converted by calcination into [[plaster of Paris]], and are sometimes known as "plaster stone."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The softness of alabaster enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms, but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; If alabaster with a smooth, polished surface is washed with [[dishwashing liquid]], it will become rough, dull and whiter, losing most of its translucency and lustre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griswold|first=John|date=September 2000|title=Care of Alabaster|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/15-01.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=15|pages=4|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an [[stone masonry|ornamental stone]], especially for [[ecclesiastical]] decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;{{dubious|When? Where?|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13426913&amp;search_terms=DTL45|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1733|isbn=|location=Leipzig|publication-place=Leipzig|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern processing==
[[File:Alabastro z05.JPG|thumb|Alabaster workshop in [[Volterra]], Italy]]

===Working techniques===
Alabaster is mined and then sold in blocks to alabaster workshops.&lt;ref name="BruciExtraction"&gt;[http://www.alialabastro.it/estrazione-en.html  Italian Alabaster Works of G. Bruci &amp; Co., Volterra: Extraction]&lt;/ref&gt; There they are cut to the needed size ("squaring"), and then are processed in different techniques: [[Turning|turned]] on a [[lathe]] for round shapes, [[Stone carving|carved]] into three-dimensional [[sculpture]]s, [[chisel]]led to produce [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|low relief]] figures or decoration; and then given an elaborate finish that reveals its transparency, colour, and texture.&lt;ref name="BruciWork"/&gt;

===Marble imitation===
In order to diminish the [[Translucent|translucency]] of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble, the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually—nearly to the boiling point—an operation requiring great care, because if the temperature is not regulated carefully, the stone acquires a dead-white, chalky appearance. The effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum. If properly treated, it very closely resembles true marble and is known as "marmo di Castellina".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Dyeing===
Alabaster is a porous stone and can be "dyed" into any colour or shade, a technique used for centuries.&lt;ref name="BruciWork"&gt;[http://www.alialabastro.it/lavorazione-en.html  Italian Alabaster Works of G. Bruci &amp; Co., Volterra: Working techniques]&lt;/ref&gt; For this the stone needs to be fully immersed in various pigmentary solutions and heated to a specific temperature.&lt;ref name="BruciWork"/&gt; The technique can be used to disguise alabaster. In this way a very misleading imitation of [[Coral (precious)|coral]] that is called "alabaster coral" is produced.

==Types, occurrence, history==

Typically only one type is sculpted in any particular cultural environment, but sometimes both have been worked to make similar pieces in the same place and time. This was the case with small flasks of the [[alabastron]] type made in [[Cyprus]] from the [[Bronze Age]] into the Classical period.&lt;ref&gt;Hermary, Antoine, Mertens, Joan R., ''The Cesnola Collection of Cypriot Art: Stone Sculpture'', 2014, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|1588395502}}, 9781588395504, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OsHUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA384 pp. 384-398]&lt;/ref&gt;

When cut in thin sheets, alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It was used for this purpose in Byzantine churches and later in [[medieval]] ones, especially in [[Italy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Large sheets of Aragonese gypsum alabaster are used extensively in the contemporary [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]],&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt; which was dedicated in 2002 by the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California Archdiocese]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The ancients used the calcite type,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffaloah.com/a/DCTNRY/a/alab.html  Buffalo Architecture and History: Alabaster]&lt;/ref&gt; while the modern Los Angeles cathedral is using gypsum alabaster.
 
===Calcite alabaster===

[[File:Calcite dish. From Royal Tomb "U", Semerkhet, at Abydos, Egypt. 1st Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Calcite dish from the Ancient Egyptian tomb of "U", [[Semerkhet]]]]

Calcite alabaster, harder than the gypsum variety, was the kind primarily used in ancient Egypt and the wider Middle East (but not [[Assyrian palace reliefs]]), and is also used in modern times. It is found as either a [[stalagmite|stalagmitic]] deposit from the floor and walls of [[limestone]] [[cavern]]s, or as a kind of [[travertine]], similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water. Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross-section, from which its name is derived: onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply (and wrongly) as [[onyx]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

====Egypt and the Middle East====
Egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near [[Suez]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and [[Assiut]].&lt;ref name="MatInd"/&gt;

This stone variety is the "alabaster" of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Bible]] and is often termed ''Oriental alabaster'', since the early examples came from the [[Far East]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''alabastrites'' is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron in [[Egypt]], where the stone was quarried. The locality probably owed its name to the mineral;{{dubious|Circular argumentation...|date=July 2016}} the origin of the mineral name is obscure&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; (though see [[Alabaster#Etymology|above]]).

The "Oriental" alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called [[alabastron|alabastra]]; the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name. In Egypt, craftsmen used alabaster for [[canopic jar]]s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A [[sarcophagus]] discovered in the tomb of [[Seti I]] near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] is on display in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], [[London]]; it is carved in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Algeria]]n onyx-marble has been quarried largely in the province of [[Oran]].

====North America====
In [[Mexico]], there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at [[La Pedrara]], in the district of [[Tecali]], near [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. Onyx-marble occurs also in the district of [[Tehuacán Municipality|Tehuacán]] and at several localities in the US including  [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Gypsum alabaster===
Gypsum alabaster is the softer of the two varieties, the other being calcite alabaster. It was used primarily in medieval Europe, and is also used in modern times.

====Ancient and Classical Near East====
[[File:The Royal lion hunt reliefs from the Assyrian palace at Nineveh, a dying male lion, about 645-635 BC, British Museum (12254756385).jpg|thumb|Wounded lion, detail from the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', 7th century BC, [[British Museum]]]]
"Mosul marble" is a kind of gypsum alabaster found in the north of modern [[Iraq]], which was used for the [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] of the 9th to 7th centuries BC; these are the largest type of alabaster sculptures to have been regularly made.  The relief is very low and the carving detailed, but large rooms were lined with continuous compositions on slabs around {{convert|7|ft|m}} high.  The ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and military [[Lachish reliefs]], both 7th century and in the [[British Museum]], are some of the best known.

Gypsum alabaster was very widely used for small [[sculpture]] for indoor use in the ancient world, especially in ancient Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]]. Fine detail could be obtained in a material with an attractive finish without iron or steel tools. Alabaster was used for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity Bast in the culture of the ancient Egyptians, and thousands of gypsum alabaster [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating to the late [[4th millennium BC]] also have been found in [[Tell Brak]] (present day [[Nagar, Syria|Nagar]]), in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;item=1988.323.8&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129011651/http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;item=1988.323.8&amp;viewmode=0&amp;isHighlight=1|date=November 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mesopotamia, gypsum alabaster was the typical material for figures of deities and devotees from temples, as in a figure believed to represent the deity, [[Abu (god)|Abu]], dating to the first half of the 3rd millennium BC in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=40%2E156]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901175655/http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&amp;viewmode=0&amp;item=40.156|date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aragon, Spain====
{{more_citations_needed|date=April 2018|}}

Much of the world's alabaster extraction is performed in the centre of the [[Ebro Valley]] in [[Aragon]], [[Spain]], which has the world's largest known exploitable deposits.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aragon.es/estaticos/GobiernoAragon/Departamentos/IndustriaInnovacion/Areas/Mineria/alabaster%20in%20Aragon.pdf |title=Alabaster in Aragon (Spain)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a brochure published by the Aragon government, alabaster has elsewhere either been depleted, or its extraction is so difficult that it has almost been abandoned or is carried out at a very high cost.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;{{unreliable_source?|reason=Commercial motivation to mislead is probable.|certain=yes|date=April 2018|}}&lt;!--skeptical that an agency overseeing industry, commerce, and tourism would have no selfish purposes in publishing such information:  no secondary sources of documentation are listed to corroborate veracity of their claim; claim may be more–or–less correct, but this source is certainly unreliable.--&gt;
There are two separate sites in Aragon, both are located in [[Tertiary]] basins.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;
The most important site is the Fuentes-[[Azaila]] area, in the Tertiary [[Ebro]] Basin.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;
The other is the [[Calatayud]]-Teruel Basin, which divides the Iberian Range in two main sectors (NW and SE).&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;

The abundance of Aragonese alabaster was crucial for its use in architecture, sculpture and decoration.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;
There is no record of likely use by pre-Roman cultures, so perhaps the first ones to use alabaster in Aragon were the Romans, who produced vessels from alabaster following the Greek and Egyptian models.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;
It seems that since the reconstruction of the Roman Wall in [[Zaragoza]] in the 3rd century AD with alabaster, the use of this material became common in building for centuries.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;
Muslim Saraqusta (today, Zaragoza) was also called "Medina Albaida", the White City, due to the appearance of its alabaster walls and palaces, which stood out among gardens, groves and orchards by the Ebro and Huerva Rivers.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;

The oldest remains in the [[Aljafería]] Palace, together with other interesting elements like capitals, reliefs and inscriptions, were made using alabaster, but it was during the artistic and economic blossoming of the Renaissance that Aragonese alabaster reached its golden age.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;
In the 16th century sculptors in Aragon chose alabaster for their best works. They were adept at exploiting its lighting qualities and generally speaking the finished art pieces retained their natural color.&lt;ref name="AragonGov"/&gt;

====Volterra (Tuscany)====
[[File:alabaster.whole.600pix.jpg|thumb|200px|Uplighter lamp, white and brown Italian alabaster, base diameter 13 cm (20th century)]]
In [[Europe]], the centre of the alabaster trade today is [[Florence, Italy]]. [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age. The mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries, in the district of [[Volterra]]. Several varieties are recognized—veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from [[Castellina Marittima|Castellina]], is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved locally, into vases, lights, and various ornamental objects. These items are objects of extensive trade, especially in Florence, [[Pisa]], and [[Livorno]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the 3rd century BC the [[Etruscans]] used the alabaster of Tuscany from the area of modern-day Volterra to produce [[funeral urn]]s, possibly taught by Greek artists.&lt;ref name="Volterra"&gt;[http://www.volterratur.it/en/come/alabaster/the-alabaster-history/  Official website of Volterra]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]] the craft of alabaster was almost completely forgotten.&lt;ref name="Volterra"/&gt; A revival started in the mid-16th century, and until the beginning of the 17th century alabaster work was strictly artistic and did not expand to form a large industry.&lt;ref name="BruciHist"&gt;[http://www.alialabastro.it/alabastrostoria-en.html  Italian Alabaster Works of G. Bruci &amp; Co., Volterra: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries production of artistic, high-quality Renaissance-style artifacts stopped altogether, being replaced by less sophisticated, cheaper items better suited for large-scale production and commerce. The new industry prospered, but the reduced need of skilled craftsmen left only few still working. The 19th century brought a boom to the industry, largely due to the "traveling artisans" who went and offered their wares to the palaces of Europe, as well as to America and the East.&lt;ref name="BruciHist"/&gt;

In the 19th century new processing technology was also introduced, allowing for the production of custom-made, unique pieces, as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials.&lt;ref name="BruciHist"/&gt; Apart from the newly developed craft, artistic work became again possible, chiefly by Volterran sculptor [[Albino Funaioli]].&lt;ref name="BruciHist"/&gt; After a short slump, the industry was revived again by the sale of mass-produced mannerist [[Expressionist]] sculptures, and was further enhanced in the 1920s by a new branch creating ceiling and wall lamps in the [[Art Deco]] style and culminating in the participation at the 1925 [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts]] from [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="BruciHist"/&gt; Important names from the evolution of alabaster use after [[World War II]] are Volterran [[Umberto Borgna]], the "first alabaster designer", and later on the architect and [[industrial design]]er [[Angelo Mangiarotti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toscana900.com/en/museo/ecomuseo-dellalabastro/][[:it:Ecomuseo dell'alabastro]]&lt;span&gt;, Volterra; official website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Henry IV of England]] --&gt;
Gypsum alabaster is a common mineral, which occurs in England in the [[Keuper]] [[marl]]s of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], especially at [[Chellaston]] in [[Derbyshire]], at Fauld in [[Staffordshire]], and near [[Newark, England|Newark]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the 14th and 15th centuries its carving into small statues and sets of [[relief]] panels for [[altarpiece]]s was a valuable [[Nottingham Alabaster|local industry in Nottingham]], as well as a major English export. These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble. After the [[English Reformation]] the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued, but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued.

Besides examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]], and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the [[Musée de Cluny]], Spain, and Scandinavia.

Alabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere. In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or "floors" in spheroidal masses known as "balls" or "bowls" and in smaller lenticular masses termed "cakes." At Chellaston, where the local alabaster is known as "Patrick," it has been worked into ornaments under the name of "Derbyshire spar"―a term more properly applied to [[fluorspar]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

====Black alabaster====
''Black alabaster'' is a rare anhydrite form of the gypsum-based mineral. This black form is found in only three veins in the world, one each in [[United States]], [[Italy]], and [[China]].

[[Alabaster Caverns State Park]], near [[Freedom, Oklahoma]] is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster. There are several types of alabaster found at the site, including pink, white, and the rare black alabaster.

[[File:Phylica arborea.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Phylica arborea'' tree]]
[[File:Gazelle-arctocephalus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Southern fur seals on Amsterdam Island]]

The '''Amsterdam and Saint-Paul Islands temperate grasslands''' is an [[ecoregion]] comprising two volcanic islands in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].  The only way to visit the islands is on the French research vessel [[Marion Dufresne (1995)|''Marion Dufresne II'']] which services the [[Martin-de-Viviès]] research station on Amsterdam Island.

==Setting==
[[Île Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul]] are two volcanoes 83&amp;nbsp;km from each other lying in the centre of a triangle between [[Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and southern [[Africa]]. The islands are remote, situated about 3000&amp;nbsp;km (1860&amp;nbsp;mi) from each neighboring continent. They have cool [[oceanic climate]]s with temperatures ranging from 13&amp;nbsp;°C (55&amp;nbsp;°F) in August to 17&amp;nbsp;°C (63&amp;nbsp;°F) in February, rainfall of 1,100&amp;nbsp;mm (43&amp;nbsp;in), persistent westerly winds, and high humidity levels.

==Flora==
Plant life changes with elevation; at lower levels the volcanoes are covered with grass and [[tussock grass]]lands and [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] meadows and, on Amsterdam, the tree ''[[Phylica arborea]]'' mixed with [[fern]]s. Higher up, on the [[Plateau des Tourbières]], there are [[shrub]]s, [[bog]]s, and [[moss]]es.

==Fauna==
These isolated islands are not rich in wildlife diversity but are home to a large population of [[subantarctic fur seal]]. They are an important breeding ground for the [[Indian yellow-nosed albatross]], [[flesh-footed shearwater]], [[gentoo penguin]], [[northern rockhopper penguin]] ''(Eudyptes moseleyi)'' [[great skua]], [[Antarctic tern]] and the endemic [[Amsterdam albatross]]. They were formerly home to two endemic ducks: the [[Amsterdam wigeon]] and an undescribed species on Île Saint-Paul.  

==Threats and conservation==
Although the islands are remote and therefore safe from most human activity and pollution, several [[introduced species]] of both flora and fauna have damaged the environment; the [[Amsterdam Island cattle|feral cattle]], in particular, grazed on young and regenerating plants and trampled on bird eggs. Five cattle had been brought to Amsterdam in January 1871; they were abandoned later that year and subsequently increased to a wild population of 2,000. As part of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] the islands are home to a research base which is working to preserve the original plant and animal life. Initially, they restricted the cattle to the northern half of Amsterdam. When the discovery was made in 2007 that the native flora and fauna had returned to the areas no longer grazed by the cattle, a plan to cull the remaining cattle on the island was launched in 2008. By 2010, the eradication program was complete, and no cattle remain on the island.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The cattle population itself had become of scientific interest as it was a rare example of a feral, unmanned herd of cattle. Humans have caused other damage to the islands' ecosystems, as much of Amsterdam's woodland was cleared in the 18th and 19th centuries by whalers, sealer, and visitors from passing ships and is struggling to recover. Seal populations have recovered from the commercial seal hunting, and are no longer threatened.

[[Image:Particles and antiparticles.svg|thumb|alt=Diagram illustrating the particles and antiparticles of electron, neutron and proton, as well as their "size" (not to scale). It is easier to identify them by looking at the total mass of both the antiparticle and particle. On the left, from top to bottom, is shown an electron (small red dot), a proton (big blue dot), and a neutron (big dot, black in the middle, gradually fading to white near the edges). On the right, from top to bottom, are show the anti electron (small blue dot), anti proton (big red dot) and anti neutron (big dot, white in the middle, fading to black near the edges).|Illustration of electric charge of [[particle]]s (left) and antiparticles (right). From top to bottom; [[electron]]/[[positron]], [[proton]]/[[antiproton]], [[neutron]]/[[antineutron]].]]

In [[particle physics]], every type of [[particle]] has an associated '''antiparticle''' with the same [[mass]] but with opposite [[charge (physics)|physical charges]] (such as [[electric charge]]). For example, the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is the [[antielectron]] (which is often referred to as ''positron''). While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of [[radioactive decay]].  The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.

Some particles, such as the [[photon]], are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter (the kind we are made of), and the other (usually given the prefix "anti-") as ''[[antimatter]]''.

Particle–antiparticle pairs can [[particle annihilation|annihilate]] each other, producing [[photon]]s; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of [[gamma ray]]s, a process exploited in [[positron emission tomography]].

The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an [[antiproton]] and a [[positron]] can form an [[antihydrogen]] [[atom]], which is believed to have the same properties as a [[hydrogen]] atom. This leads to the question of why the [[baryogenesis|formation of matter after the Big Bang]] resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and [[antimatter]]. The discovery of [[CP violation|Charge Parity violation]] helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.

Because [[Charge (physics)|charge]] is [[Charge conservation|conserved]], it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge (as is for instance the case when antiparticles are produced naturally via [[beta decay]] or the collision of [[cosmic ray]]s with Earth's atmosphere), or by the simultaneous creation of both a particle ''and'' its antiparticle, which can occur in [[particle accelerator]]s such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of [[quark]]s, the [[antineutron]] from [[Quark#Antiquarks|antiquarks]], and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as [[photon]]s, [[W and Z bosons#Z boson|Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;bosons]], [[Pi meson|{{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}]]&amp;nbsp;[[meson]]s, and hypothetical [[graviton]]s and some hypothetical [[Weakly interacting massive particle|WIMP]]s.

== History ==

=== Experiment ===

In 1932, soon after the prediction of [[positron]]s by [[Paul Dirac]], [[Carl D. Anderson]] found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a [[cloud chamber]]— a [[particle detector]] in which moving [[electron]]s (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a [[magnetic field]]. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction.  Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.

The [[antiproton]] and [[antineutron]] were found by [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]] in 1955 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Since then, the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of [[antimatter]] have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/11/101118-antimatter-trapped-engines-bombs-nature-science-cern/|title=Antimatter Atoms Trapped for First Time—"A Big Deal"|date=19 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dirac hole theory ===
{{quote box|quote=... the development of [[quantum field theory]] made the interpretation of antiparticles as holes unnecessary, even though it lingers on in many textbooks.|source=[[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steve|title=The quantum theory of fields, Volume 1 : Foundations|isbn=0-521-55001-7|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=300px}}
Solutions of the [[Dirac equation]] contained{{clarify|date=September 2015}} negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a "sea" of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this [[Dirac sea]] to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a ''[[electron hole|hole]]'' in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These holes were interpreted as "negative-energy electrons" by Paul Dirac and by mistake he identified them with [[proton]]s in his 1930 paper ''A Theory of Electrons and Protons''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

This picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe—a problem of which Dirac was aware. Dirac tried{{clarify|date=September 2015}} to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried{{clarify|date=September 2015}} to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until [[Hermann Weyl]] proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Proton+}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}, where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons. [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Igor Tamm]] proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.

However, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains.{{why|date=September 2015}} Also, as we now know, [[bosons]] also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only [[fermion]]s do), hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in [[quantum field theory]], which solves both these problems.{{how|date=September 2015}}

== Particle–antiparticle annihilation ==
{{main|Annihilation}}
[[Image:kkbar had.svg|frame|alt=Feynman diagram of a kaon oscillation. A straight red line suddenly turns purple, showing a kaon changing into an antikaon. A medallion is show zooming in on the region where the line changes color. The medallion shows that the line is not straight, but rather that at the place the kaon changes into an antikaon, the red line breaks into two curved lines, corresponding the production of virtual pions, which rejoin into the violet line, corresponding to the annihilation of the virtual pions. |An example of a virtual [[pion]] pair that influences the propagation of a [[kaon]], causing a neutral kaon to ''mix'' with the antikaon. This is an example of [[renormalization]] in [[quantum field theory]]— the field theory being necessary because of the change in particle number.]]

If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;→ &amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}} (the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair) are an example. The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair, {{Subatomic particle|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{Subatomic particle|Photon}}, cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and [[momentum]] together in this process. However, in the Coulomb field of a nucleus the [[translational invariance]] is broken and single-photon annihilation may occur.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse reaction (in free space, without an atomic nucleus) is also impossible for this reason. In quantum field theory, this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the [[uncertainty principle]]. This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may ''fluctuate'' into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the [[vacuum state]] and [[renormalization]] of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of [[mass renormalization]].

== Properties ==

[[Quantum state]]s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the [[C-symmetry|charge conjugation]] (C), [[P-symmetry|parity]] (P), and [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) operators. If &lt;math&gt;|p,\sigma ,n \rangle &lt;/math&gt; denotes the quantum state of a particle (n) with momentum p, spin J whose component in the z-direction is σ, then one has
::&lt;math&gt;CPT \ |p,\sigma,n \rangle\ =\ (-1)^{J-\sigma}\ |p,-\sigma,n^c \rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
where n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the charge conjugate state, that is, the antiparticle. This behaviour under [[CPT symmetry]] is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]]. Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then
::&lt;math&gt;T\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |-p,-\sigma,n\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;CP\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |-p,\sigma,n^c\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C\ |p,\sigma,n\rangle \ \propto \ |p,\sigma,n^c\rangle ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have
*the same mass m
*the same spin state J
*opposite [[electric charge]]s q and -q.

== Quantum field theory ==
:''This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of [[canonical quantization]] of a [[quantum field theory]].''

One may try to quantize an electron [[field (physics)|field]] without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing

::&lt;math&gt;\psi (x)=\sum_{k}u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where we use the symbol ''k'' to denote the quantum numbers ''p'' and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, ''E(k)'', and ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with [[fermion]]s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]

::&lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{k} E(k) a^\dagger_k a_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then one sees immediately that the expectation value of ''H'' need not be positive. This is because ''E(k)'' can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.

So one has to introduce the charge conjugate ''antiparticle'' field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations

::&lt;math&gt;b_{k\prime} = a^\dagger_k\ \mathrm{and}\ b^\dagger_{k\prime}=a_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' has the same ''p'', and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form

::&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\sum_{k_+} u_k (x)a_k e^{-iE(k)t}+\sum_{k_-} u_k (x)b^\dagger _k e^{-iE(k)t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes

::&lt;math&gt;H=\sum_{k_+} E_k a^\dagger _k a_k + \sum_{k_-} |E(k)|b^\dagger_k b_k + E_0,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an infinite negative constant. The [[vacuum state]] is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;a_k |0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_k |0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, '''H''' is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a [[fermion]].

This approach is due to [[Vladimir Fock]], [[Wendell Furry]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. If one quantizes a real [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]], then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.

By considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, [[Ernst Stueckelberg]] reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass '''m''' and spin '''J''' but opposite charges '''q'''. This allowed him to rewrite [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] precisely in the form of diagrams. [[Richard Feynman]] later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism, and they are now called [[Feynman diagram]]s. Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time. This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today.

Since this picture was first developed by Stueckelberg,&lt;ref&gt;Stueckelberg, Ernst (1941), "La signification du temps propre en mécanique ondulatoire." ''Helv. Phys. Acta'' '''14''', pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt; and acquired its modern form in Feynman's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Richard P.|last=Feynman|title=Space-time approach to non-relativistic quantum mechanics|journal= [[Reviews of Modern Physics]]|volume= 20|pages= 367–387|year=1948|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.20.367|bibcode = 1948RvMP...20..367F|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is called the '''Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of antiparticles to honor both scientists.

A '''bio-based material''' is a material intentionally made from substances derived from living (or once-living) organisms. These materials are sometimes referred to as [[biomaterial]]s, but this word also has another meaning. Strictly the definition could include many common materials such as [[wood]] and [[leather]], but it typically refers to modern materials that have undergone more extensive processing. Unprocessed materials may be called [[biotic material]]. Bio-based materials or biomaterials fall under the broader category of [[bioproducts]] or bio-based products which includes materials, chemicals and energy derived from renewable biological resources.

Bio-based materials are often [[biodegradable]], but this is not always the case.

Examples include:
* [[cellulose fiber]]s — fibers made from reconstituted cellulose.
* [[casein]] — a [[phosphoprotein]] extracted from milk during the process of creating low fat milk, it is processed in various ways to make: [[plastic]], dietary supplements for body builders, glue, [[cotton candy]], protective coatings, paints, and occurs naturally in cheese, giving it a creamy texture.
* [[polylactic acid]] — a [[polymer]] produced by [[industrial fermentation]]
* [[bioplastic]]s — include a [[soy]] [[Vegetable oil|oil]] based [[plastic]] now being used to make body panels for [[John Deere]] [[tractor]]s
* [[engineered wood]] — products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[particle board]]
* [[zein]] — a natural [[biopolymer]] which is the most abundant corn protein 
* [[cornstarch]] — the starch of the maize grain, used to make packing pellets
* grease — lubricants made from vegetable oils, including soybean oil, that can replace petroleum based lubricants

'''''Calathea allouia''''', known as '''lerén''' or '''lairén''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and also known in English as '''Guinea arrowroot''', and '''sweet corn root''', is a plant in the [[Marantaceae|arrowroot family]], native to northern [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]], The name "allouia" is derived from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] name for the plant&lt;ref&gt;"Topi Tambo, Leren, Guinea Arrowroot", ''Eat the Weeds'', [http://www.eattheweeds.com/topi-tambo-leren-guinea-arrowroot/], accessed 17 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Leren is a minor food crop in the American tropics, but was one of the earliest plants domesticated by pre-historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] in South America. 
[[File:Topee-Tambo, Trinidad and Tobago.JPG|thumb|left|Leren is called Tipee-Tambo in Trinidad and Tobago.]]

==Distribution==
Leren is considered native to [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Lesser Antilles]], [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Brazil]]. It is reportedly naturalized in Jamaica&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=222934 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, ''Calathea allouia'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/133119#page/241/mode/1up Lindley, John. 1829.

Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Calathea allouia -- FAO.GIF|thumb|left|Leren or Calathea allouia&lt;ref&gt;FAO, "Guinea Arrowroot" (1994), ''Neglected Crops: 1492 from a Different Perspective'', Plant Production and Protection Series, No. 26, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Leren is a perennial plant, approximately {{convert|1|m|inch}} in height. It produces egg-shaped tuberous roots {{convert|2|cm|inch}} to {{convert|8|cm|inch}} long at the end of fibrous roots. The leaves are large, up to {{convert|60|cm|inch}} long and {{convert|20|cm|inch}} wide.  [[Indigenous people of the Americas]] have used the durable leaves to make traditional medicines and as baby clothing. Leren usually reproduces itself through [[rhizomes]] which produce shoots and new plants.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==

Leren is adapted to a tropical climate with alternating rainy and dry seasons.  It sprouts with the first rains and grows rapidly, forming tubers which are harvested as the foliage begins to die back eight or nine months after the initial sprouting.  The rhizomes, harvested at the same time, are tolerant of both drying and flooding, and divided and replanted again at the onset of the rainy season.  Frequent irrigation is necessary during dry periods.  Leren is often planted in shade or partial shade but can grow in full sun with adequate moisture and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 252-252&lt;/ref&gt;

Leren is traditionally cultivated on a small scale.  Its cultivation is declining as it has been replaced by other crops.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
Leren is usually cooked by boiling the tubers for 15 to 60 minutes,  As food, leren is often compared to water chestnut ([[Eleocharis dulcis]]) because leren, like the water chestnut, retains its crispness despite being cooked. Boiled leren has a taste similar to [[sweet corn]], hence one of its common English names. The cooked tuber is covered with a thin, edible skin which is most easily peeled after cooking. Leren is mostly eaten as an [[hors d'oeuvre]] or appetizer. Leren tubers can be stored at room temperatures for up to three months, but do not tolerate refrigeration well.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Cabanillas, pp. 254-256&lt;/ref&gt;

The nutritional value of leren has not been thoroughly studied, but the tubers have a starch content of 13-15 percent and a protein content of 6.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Cabanillas, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric domestication==

[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have discovered that leren was one of the first plants domesticated in prehistoric South America. Leren, along with arrowroot (''[[Maranta arundinacea]]''), [[squash (plant)|squash]] (''[[Cucurbita moschata]]''), and bottle gourd (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]'') were being cultivated in northern South American and Panama between 8200 BCE and 5600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Piperno, Dolores R. (Oct 2011), "The Origins of Plant Cultivation and Domestication in the New World Tropics", ''Current Anthropology'', Vol 52, No. 54, p. S 459.  Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the cultivation of leren spread to places where it was not likely native.  For example, the people of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas culture]] on the arid and semi-arid [[Santa Elena Peninsula]] of [[Ecuador]] grew leren by about 7000 BCE. Leren was being grown there to be eaten raw, dried, or ground into flour.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jerry D. (2014), ''A Prehistory of South America'', Boulder: University Press of Colorado, pp. 97-99. Downloaded from [[Project Muse]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circuit total limitation''' ('''CTL''') is one of the present-day standards for [[electrical panel]]s sold in the United States according to the [[National Electrical Code]].  This standard requires an electrical panel to provide a physical mechanism to prevent installing more circuit breakers than it was designed for.  This has generally been implemented by restricting the use of tandem (duplex) breakers to replace standard single pole breakers.

==Code Requirement==
The 1965 edition of the NEC, article 384-15 was the first reference to the circuit total limitation of [[panelboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = American Electricians' Handbook | work = 15th Edition |author1=Terrell Croft |author2=Wilford I. Summers |author3=Frederic Hartwell | page = 4.52 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y-vq2G1lHUMC&amp;pg=PT2144&amp;lpg=PT2144&amp;dq=(NFPA+OR+NEC)+408.54&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fJbfDAdBdl&amp;sig=1fgfhsEulN8PH8XkqnqV3z1yI8g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jb6sSe_lGozKMvny_O0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPT2144,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, the location of this language is at Article 408.54 now titled "Maximum Number of Overcurrent Devices."
Non-CTL panels have not been made by reputable manufacturers since 1965.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;Telephone conversation with Woody Kerns, Sr. Staff Engineer at Square-D (phone: 888-778-2733) Feb. 24, 2009 {same as reference at [[Square_D#QO]]}.&lt;/ref&gt; Phone conversations are not a reliable reference --&gt;

==Non-CTL for replacement only==

Circuitboards and panelboards built prior to 1965 did not have circuit total limiting devices or features built-in.  To support these old panels, non-CTL circuit breakers that bypass the rejection feature are still sold "for replacement use only."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = UL's ''Guide Information for Electrical Equipment: The White Book 2008'' | page = 90 | url = http://www.ul.com/regulators/2008_WhiteBook.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082528/http://www.ul.com/regulators/2008_WhiteBook.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, numerous unsafe situations have resulted where panels were dangerously overloaded because these non-CTL breakers continue to be used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  With the use of non-CTL breakers, panels can be configured with the total number of circuits in excess of the designed capacity of that panel.

The 2008 code did away with the previous 42 circuit limitation on panelboards.&lt;ref&gt;See "bullet" in 2008 NEC between Articles 408.30 and 408.36, where 2005's Article 408.35 appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; One can now order panelboards with as many as 84 circuit places, and a corresponding ampacity rating.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://ecatalog.squared.com/pubs/Electrical%20Distribution/Panelboards/NQ%20Lighting%20and%20Appliance%20Branch-Circuit%20Panelboards/1600HO0802.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Catalogues are not reliable secondary sources --&gt; If a panelboard with a sufficient number of breaker positions is installed in the first place, the need for non-CTL breakers should be eliminated.

'''Compactrons''' are a type of [[vacuum tube|thermionic valve]], or vacuum tube, which contain multiple electrode structures packed into a single enclosure. They were designed to compete with early transistor electronics and were used in [[television]]s, [[radio]]s, and similar roles.

== History ==
The '''Compactron''' was a trade name applied to multi-electrode structure tubes specifically constructed on a 12-pin Duodecar base. This [[vacuum tube]] family was introduced in 1961 by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicdesign.com/4g/multi-function-compactrons-promise-two-tube-radio |title=Multi-Function Compactrons Promise Two-Tube Radio |publisher=Electronic Design |page=74 |date=July 20, 1960 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to compete with transistorized electronics during the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] transition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.junkbox.com/electronics/CompactronTubesIndex.shtml  |title=Compactron Tubes: A Junkbox Guide |publisher=Copperwood Media LLC. |first=Jeff |last=Duntemann |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television]] sets were a primary application. The idea of multi-electrode tubes itself was far from new and indeed the Loewe company of Germany was producing multi-electrode tubes as far back as 1926, and they even included all of the required passive components as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_3nf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Use was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. The first portable color television, the General Electric [[Porta-Color]], was designed using 13 tubes, 10 of which were Compactrons. Even before the compactron design was unveiled, nearly all tube based electronic equipment used multi-electrode tubes of one type or another. Virtually every AM/FM radio receiver of the 1950's and 60's used a 6AK8 (EABC80) tube (or equivalent) consisting of three diodes and a triode which was designed in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-type.org/exhib/abc0014.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Compactron's integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what [[integrated circuits]] were to [[transistors]]). Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They were also used by the Ampeg guitar amplifier company in some of their guitar amps. No modern tube based Hi-Fi systems are known to use this tube type, as simpler and more readily available tubes have again filled this niche.

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Duodekar.JPG|thumb|right|The evacuation tip is in the center of the circular pin pattern.]]
A distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the [[evacuation tip]] on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with "miniature" tubes, and a characteristic 3/4" diameter circle pin pattern.
* Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1{{fraction|1|8}}" to 2{{fraction|3|4}}" depending upon the internal configuration. Variations of the Compactron design were made by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] and by some Japanese firms.

== Examples ==
Examples of Compactrons type types include:

Due to their specific applications in television circuits, many different Compactron types were produced. Almost all were assigned using standard US tube numbers.

== Technological obsolescence ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2016}}Integrated circuits (of the analogue and digital type) gradually took over all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. "Hybrid" television sets produced in the early to mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986. Other specialist uses of the tube declined in parallel with the television set manufacture. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s. [[New old stock]] replacements for almost all Compactron types produced are easily found for sale on the Internet.

'''''Consolamentum''''', known as '''heretication''' to its [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] opponents, was the unique [[sacrament]] of the [[Cathars]].&lt;ref name=LRL&gt;{{cite book|title=Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error |author=Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|publisher=Random House/editions Gilmard|year=1975|ISBN=978-0807615980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common with Christianity, Cathars believed in original sin, and—like [[Gnostic]]s—believed temporal pleasure to be sinful or unwise. The process of living thus inevitably incurred "regret" that required "consolation to move nearer to God or to approach heaven. It occurred only twice in a lifetime: upon confirmation in the faith and upon impending death. It was available to both men and women who made a commitment to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Book reference|title = The Cathars|last = Lambert|first = Malcolm|publisher = Blackwell|year = 1998|isbn = 0-631-20959-X|location = Oxford|pages = throughout}} &lt;/ref&gt; Following the ceremony the consoled individual became a "[[Cathar Perfect]]".

According to the Albigenses and other Cathars, the ''consolamentum'' was an [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|immersion (or baptism) in the Holy Spirit]]. It implied reception of all spiritual gifts including absolution from sin, spiritual regeneration, the power to preach and elevation to a higher plane of perfection.&lt;ref name=LRL /&gt;

==The ritual==
Reference to the trinity was systematically replaced with the name of Christ since the doctrine of the Albigenses and Cathars professed a single unified deity (their Christology resembled [[Patripassianism|modalistic monarchism]] in the West and [[adoptionism]] in the East). 

The ritual took various forms; some used the entire New Testament scripture whilst others relied on extracts such as the Gospel attributed to John while administering consolation. There were reportedly some remote cases where [[holy water]] was used as a cleansing agent during ''consolamentum'' being profusely poured over the recipient's head until he/she was completely wet (as opposed to sprinkling).&lt;ref name=LRL /&gt;

In contrast to Catholic ceremonies, the form used by the majority of Cathars only required verbal blessings and scriptures administered to the person to be consoled, and did not involve [[wikt:token|token]]s such as [[Consecration|consecrated]] bread or wine because these would pass through the body and become befouled. Dying persons might abstain from food in order that their bodies be as pure as possible as it passed into eternity.

According to a few known cases in the latter years of Catharism, the terminally ill would voluntarily undertake a complete [[fasting|fast]] known as the [[Catharism#Sacraments|endura]]. It was only undertaken when death was clearly inevitable. It was a form of purification and separation from the material world which was controlled by the evil one. They believed that this final sacrifice ensured their reunification with the Good God.&lt;ref name=LRL /&gt;

Laying on of hands was always part of the ceremony. Some historians have stated that incidents of ecstatic utterances during ''consolamentum'' was actually [[glossolalia]], or "speaking in tongues," which demanded that the rite be even more secretly guarded since this phenomenon occurring outside of the Catholic Church was considered witchcraft and was punishable by death.&lt;ref name=LRL /&gt; 

Once consoled, [[Cathar Perfect|Parfaits]] were required to be [[vegetarian]], to be [[clerical celibacy|celibate]], and to dedicate their lives to travelling and teaching Albigensian and Cathar doctrines. These Parfaits were the leaders of the Albigensian and other Cathar communities (Albigenses were a branch of Cathari in what was to later become southern France. Most people use the term Albigenses when referring to those that adhered to a branch of Cathari that was less dualistic and more closely resembled orthodoxy).&lt;ref name=LRL /&gt;

The vast majority of the population did not receive ''consolamentum'' until on the verge of death. Once given the ''consolamentum'', the same rules applied to them, though they were obviously not expected to travel or preach from their deathbed. This allowed most believers to live somewhat normal lives and receive ''consolamentum'' shortly before passing away.&lt;ref name=LRL /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10931">The Copenhagen Wheel is a self-contained rear wheel electric bicycle system which transforms a traditional bicycle into a hybrid [[Electric bicycle|e-bike]]. The app-connected Wheel is equipped with an [[electric motor]], [[Battery electric vehicle|battery]], and suite of sensors that work together to seamlessly amplify a rider’s pedal power by up to ten times. The Copenhagen Wheel was developed at [[MIT Senseable City Lab|MIT’s Senseable City Lab]] in 2009 in partnership with the city of [[Copenhagen]], and unveiled at the 2009 [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]]. In December 2012, Assaf Biderman, a co-inventor of the Wheel and Associate Director of the [[MIT Senseable City Lab]], founded [[Superpedestrian|Superpedestrian Inc.]] with an exclusive license to commercialize the Wheel. After several years of engineering, testing, and validation, the Copenhagen Wheel officially launched in the U.S. in April 2017, and in Europe in October 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/superpedestrians-copenhagen-wheel-europe-expansion-2017-10|title=A startup born at MIT has created a wheel that can make any bike electric — and now it's coming to Europe|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Copy of SP Catalogue0288mod2 whiteknockout (1).tif|thumb|Copenhagen Wheel with red hub]]

== Physical components ==
The Copenhagen Wheel contains a custom [[Brushless Motor|brushless motor]], advanced sensors, control systems, and a [[lithium-ion battery]], all enclosed within the rear wheel hub&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://account.superpedestrian.com/support/article/Get-to-know-your-Copenhagen-Wheel-and-how-it-works|title=Support - Get to know your Copenhagen Wheel and how it works|website=account.superpedestrian.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The control system interfaces with a range of sensors measuring actual [[torque]], power, [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]], pedal position, and [[acceleration]] to monitor a rider’s effort when pedaling. The Wheel responds to a rider’s inputs by providing the appropriate level of assistance at each moment, creating a seamless ride experience. The wheel’s battery is charged via an external cord that fits a standard wall outlet. Electronic Braking Assistance while riding will partially recharge the wheel when coasting or backpedaling. With a full charge, the wheel’s reported range is up to 50km (31mi), with variations depending on assist mode and terrain. Extensions in range are possible when using low-power modes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://account.superpedestrian.com/support/article/What-affects-my-range|title=Support - What affects my range?|website=account.superpedestrian.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== App control ==
In order to gain assist, the Wheel must be connected to Superpedestrian’s Wheel App, available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The Wheel connects to the App via [[Bluetooth]], and enables riders to personalize their cycling experience from their [[smartphone]]. The Wheel App tracks rides and calorie information, and allows riders to toggle between ride modes such as Turbo, Eco, and Exercise. A [[smartphone]] also acts as a digital key, activating the Wheel automatically when ready to ride, and communicating with the cloud in real time. A self-diagnostic safety system monitors components within the Wheel and proactively responds to events within milliseconds, protecting both rider and Wheel. Superpedestrian releases frequent updates to the Wheel App.

== Compatibility ==
Copenhagen Wheels are custom built to fit each customer’s bicycle. The Wheel is compatible with steel or aluminum bicycle frames, and requires rear rim brakes. The Copenhagen Wheel is available in both single and multi-speed versions. The multi-speed version supports a 7, 8, 9 or 10-speed Shimano/SRAM-compatible (external) multi-speed cassette. Copenhagen Wheels come in two wheel sizes -  622mm or 559mm - with either road, hybrid, or mountain bike tires. Available rim colors include silver and black&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://account.superpedestrian.com/support/article/What-options-can-I-choose-for-my-Wheel|title=Support - What options can I choose for my Wheel?|website=account.superpedestrian.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Future ==
Superpedestrian is currently working on future versions of the Copenhagen Wheel with updated features and wider compatibility. In the meantime, over-the-air firmware updates and app updates are available to current riders.

== Purchasing ==
The Copenhagen Wheel is available throughout the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]]. Superpedestrian offers a complete bike product as well, called Wheel + Bike. Customers can choose from a wide range of bicycle frames, from [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM’s]] like [[Marin Bikes|Marin]], [https://publicbikes.com/ Public], [[Montague Bikes|Montague]], [[Fyxation]], [[Tern (company)|Tern]], [[Cinelli]], and [https://fortifiedbike.com/ Fortified] to pair with the Copenhagen Wheel. [[Superpedestrian]] also works with over 260 independent bicycle retailers across the United States and Europe to provide demos, maintenance, and installation services. The MSRP of the wheel as of August, 2018 was US$1749&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.superpedestrian.com/en/choose|title=Wheel Choice {{!}} Superpedestrian|website=www.superpedestrian.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Cyclotron radiation''' is [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by accelerating [[electric charge|charge]]d particles deflected by a [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monreal|first1=Benjamin|title=Single-electron cyclotron radiation|journal=Physics Today|date=Jan 2016|volume=69|issue=1|page=70|doi=10.1063/pt.3.3060|bibcode=2016PhT....69a..70M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lorentz force]] on the particles acts perpendicular to both the magnetic field lines and the particles' motion through them, creating an acceleration of charged particles that causes them to emit radiation as a result of the acceleration they undergo as they spiral around the lines of the magnetic field.

The name of this radiation derives from the [[cyclotron]], a type of [[particle accelerator]] used since the 1930s to create highly energetic particles for study. The cyclotron makes use of the circular orbits that charged particles exhibit in a uniform magnetic field. Furthermore, the period of the orbit is independent of the energy of the particles, allowing the cyclotron to operate at a set [[frequency]]. Cyclotron radiation is emitted by all charged particles travelling through magnetic fields, not just those in cyclotrons. Cyclotron radiation from [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the [[interstellar medium]] or around [[black hole]]s and other astronomical phenomena is an important source of information about distant magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dogiel|first1=V. A.|title=Gamma-ray astronomy|journal=Contemporary Physics|date=March 1992|volume=33|issue=2|pages=91–109|doi=10.1080/00107519208219534|bibcode=1992ConPh..33...91D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheleznyakov|first1=V.

==Properties==
The [[Power (physics)|power]] (energy per unit time) of the emission of each electron can be calculated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longair|first1=Malcolm S.|title=High Energy Astrophysics: Volume 2, Stars, the Galaxy and the Interstellar Medium|date=1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521435840|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1TMSMpzD2UC&amp;pg=PA232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{-dE \over dt}={\sigma_t B^2 v^2 \over c \mu_o} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is energy, ''t'' is time, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_t &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Thomson cross section]] (total, not differential), ''B'' is the magnetic field strength, ''v'' is the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field, ''c'' is the speed of light and &lt;math&gt; \mu_o &lt;/math&gt; is the [[permeability of free space]].

Cyclotron radiation has a spectrum with its main spike at the same fundamental frequency as the particle's orbit, and [[harmonic]]s at higher integral factors. Harmonics are the result of imperfections in the actual emission environment, which also create a broadening of the [[spectral line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilditch|first1=R.

When the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, cyclotron radiation is known as [[synchrotron radiation]].

The recoil experienced by a particle emitting cyclotron radiation is called [[radiation reaction]]. Radiation reaction acts as a resistance to motion in a cyclotron; and the work necessary to overcome it is the main energetic cost of accelerating a particle in a cyclotron. Cyclotrons are prime examples of systems which experience radiation reaction.

==Examples==

In the context of [[magnetic fusion energy]], cyclotron radiation losses translate into a [[Aneutronic fusion#Power balance|requirement]] for a minimum plasma energy density in relation to the magnetic field energy density.

Cyclotron radiation would likely be produced in a [[high altitude nuclear explosion]]. [[Gamma ray]]s produced by the explosion would [[ionization|ionize]] [[atom]]s in the upper atmosphere and those free electrons would interact with the Earth's magnetic field to produce cyclotron radiation in the form of an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP).  This phenomenon is of concern to the military as the EMP may damage [[Solid-state electronics|solid state]] electronic equipment.

Davy was born in [[Ottery St Mary]], Devonshire, England, son of Thomas Davy (medical practitioner and house surgeon at [[Guy's Hospital]], London). Edward Davy was educated at a school run by his maternal uncle in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Street]], London. He was then apprenticed to Dr C. Wheeler, house surgeon at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Serle&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davy won the prize for botany in 1825, was licensed by the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] in 1828 and the Royal College of Surgeons in 1829.&lt;ref name=Serle/&gt; Soon after graduating, Davy began trading as an operative chemist under the name of Davy &amp; Co. In 1836 he published a small book ''Experimental Guide to Chemistry'', at the end of which was a catalogue of goods supplied by his firm.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Serle/&gt;

Davy published ''Outline of a New Plan of Telegraphic Communication'' in 1836 and carried out telegraphic experiments the following year. He demonstrated the operation of the telegraph over a mile of wire in [[Regent's Park]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In 1837 he demonstrated a working model of the telegraph in [[Exeter Hall]]. He was granted a patent for his telegraph in 1838.&lt;ref name=bsp&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was soon obliged to drop his investigations of telegraphy for personal reasons. His patent was purchased by the [[Electric Telegraph Company]] in 1847 for £600.&lt;ref name=bsp/&gt; Davy also invented an electric relay. He used a magnetic needle which dipped into a mercury contact when an electric current passed through the surrounding coil. In recognition of this he was elected in 1885 as an honorary member of the [[Society of Telegraph Engineers]] and was informed of this by telegraph shortly before his death.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In 1838 Davy migrated to South Australia without his first wife and son. He was editor of the ''Adelaide Examiner'' from June to July 1842 and was elected president of the Port Adelaide Mechanics' Institute at its inaugural meeting in 1851.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Davy was a director and manager of the Adelaide Smelting Company and became chief assayer of the Government Assay Office in Adelaide in February 1852.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Davy was appointed assay master in Melbourne in July 1853&lt;ref name=Serle/&gt; until the office was abolished in October 1854. For a short while, he took up farming near [[Malmsbury, Victoria]] then moved into Malmsbury where he practised as a physician for the rest of his life. He was three times mayor of Malmbury.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8126">'''Electric discharge in gases''' occurs when [[electric current]] flows through a [[gas]]eous medium due to [[ionization]] of the gas. Depending on several factors, the discharge may radiate visible light. The properties of electric discharges in gases are studied in connection with design of lighting sources and in the design of high voltage electrical equipment.

==Discharge types==
[[Image:Electron avalanche.gif|thumbnail|right|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionising electron and the liberated electron.]]

I: unstable region: glow-arc transition&lt;br/&gt;
J: [[electric arc]]&lt;br/&gt;
K: electric arc&lt;br/&gt;
The A-D region is called a dark discharge; there is some ionization, but the current is below 10 microamperes and there is no significant amount of radiation produced.&lt;br/&gt;
The F-H region is a region of glow discharge; the plasma emits a faint glow that occupies almost all the volume of the tube; most of the light is emitted by excited neutral atoms.&lt;br/&gt;
The I-K region is a region of arc discharge; the plasma is concentrated in a narrow channel along the center of the tube; a great amount of radiation is produced.]]
In cold cathode tubes, the electric discharge in gas has three regions, with distinct [[current-voltage characteristic]]s:&lt;ref name="refeng"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R67HARlhisYC&amp;pg=PA2-IA342&amp;dq=gas+filled+tube+hydrogen+neon+argon+mercury&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=gas%20filled%20tube%20hydrogen%20neon%20argon%20mercury&amp;f=false Reference Data for Engineers: Radio, Electronics, Computers and Communications] By Wendy Middleton, Mac E. Van Valkenburg, p. 16-42, Newnes, 2002 {{ISBN|0-7506-7291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''I''': [[Townsend discharge]], below the [[breakdown voltage]]. At low voltages, the only current is that due to the generation of charge carriers in the gas by cosmic rays or other sources of ionizing radiation. As the applied voltage is increased, the free electrons carrying the current gain enough energy to cause further ionization, causing an [[avalanche breakdown|electron avalanche]]. In this regime, the current increases from femtoamperes to microamperes, i.e. by nine orders of magnitude, for very little further increase in voltage. The voltage-current characteristics begins tapering off near the breakdown voltage and the glow becomes visible.
*'''II''': [[glow discharge]], which occurs once the breakdown voltage is reached. The voltage across the electrodes suddenly drops and the current increases to milliampere range. At lower currents, the voltage across the tube is almost current-independent; this is used in glow discharge [[voltage-regulator tube]]s. At lower currents, the area of the electrodes covered by the glow discharge is proportional to the current. At higher currents the normal glow turns into [[abnormal glow]], the voltage across the tube gradually increases, and the glow discharge covers more and more of the surface of the electrodes. Low-power switching (glow-discharge thyratrons), voltage stabilization, and lighting applications (e.g. [[Nixie tube]]s, [[decatron]]s, [[neon lamp]]s) operate in this region.
*'''III''': [[arc discharge]], which occurs in the ampere range of the current; the voltage across the tube drops with increasing current. High-current switching tubes, e.g. [[triggered spark gap]], [[ignitron]], [[thyratron]] and [[krytron]] (and its [[vacuum tube]] derivate, [[sprytron]], using [[vacuum arc]]), high-power [[mercury-arc valve]]s and high-power light sources, e.g. [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s and [[metal halide lamp]]s, operate in this range.

Glow discharge is facilitated by electrons striking the gas atoms and ionizing them. For formation of glow discharge, the [[mean free path]] of the electrons has to be reasonably long but shorter than the distance between the electrodes; glow discharges therefore do not readily occur at both too low and too high gas pressures.

The [[electrical breakdown|breakdown]] voltage for the glow discharge depends nonlinearly on the product of gas pressure and electrode distance according to [[Paschen's law]]. For a certain pressure&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance value, there is a lowest breakdown voltage. The increase of strike voltage for shorter electrode distances is related to too long mean free path of the electrons in comparison with the electrode distance.

A small amount of a radioactive element may be added into the tube, either as a separate piece of material (e.g. [[nickel-63]] in [[krytron]]s) or as addition to the alloy of the electrodes (e.g. [[thorium]]), to preionize the gas and increase the reliability of electrical breakdown and glow or arc discharge ignition. A gaseous radioactive isotope, e.g. [[krypton-85]], can also be used. Ignition electrodes and keepalive discharge electrodes can also be employed.&lt;ref name="handopto"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3GmcgL7Z-6YC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=gas+discharge+properties+mercury+neon+hydrogen+deuterium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ivxVbrcyip&amp;sig=8ozlMgy-CAtNgmXRd9eTFIDioSc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WKXNS66xFYqy0gSfs4nqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=34&amp;ved=0CH4Q6AEwIQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook of optoelectronics, Volume 1] by John Dakin, Robert G. W. Brown, p. 52, CRC Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-7503-0646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The E/N ratio between the [[electric field]] E and the concentration of neutral particles N is often used, because the mean energy of electrons (and therefore many other properties of discharge) is a function of E/N. Increasing the electric intensity E by some factor q has the same consequences as lowering gas density N by factor q.

Its [[SI unit]] is V·cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but the [[Townsend (unit)|Townsend unit]] (Td) is frequently used.

==Application in analog computation==
The use of a glow discharge for solution of certain mapping problems was described in 2002.

&lt;/ref&gt; researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that gives tourists luminous route indicators. To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass slide. Fitting a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs.  When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B – and the gas glows like a tiny glowing strip light. The approach itself provides a novel visible [[analog computing]] approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a glow discharge in a microfluidic chip.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">The '''EnergySmart Home Scale''' (E-Scale) is a standard applied to homes in the USA that meet the [[Builders Challenge]] program requirements. The E-Scale visually shows the energy performance of the labeled home. Homes need to score a 70 or less on the E-Scale to qualify for the Builders Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/challenge/energysmart.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The E-Scale is based on the 2004 [[International Energy Conservation Code]], with a 100 equating to a code built home. A home that scores a 70 on the E-Scale is 30% more energy efficient than a code built home.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/challenge/energysmart.html&lt;/ref&gt; The E-Scale allows for an easy comparison between homes, very similar to a MPG sticker for a car but for a home. Homes meeting the Challenge will receive an E-Scale with a Sunburst displaying the E-Scale rating of the home, enabling home buyers to easily compare the energy performance of homes.

The E-Scale ends at zero, which equates to the Builders Challenge goal to provide a “net zero energy home (NZEH) anywhere in the United States - a grid-connected home that, over the course of a year, produces as much energy as it uses” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/challenge/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903011241/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/challenge/about.html |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Builders Challenge]] program and E-Scale requirements are based on years of research results from the [[United States Department of Energy]]’s Building America program. Building America research “is expected to achieve cost-neutral Net-Zero Energy Homes by 2020. "Cost-neutral" means that the added first costs of system enhancements (when amortized over a 30 year period) are equal to the monthly energy cost savings that result from these enhancements. While the Building America program develops and field-tests the technologies needed to cost-effectively move to higher levels of efficiency, the Builders Challenge will promote the implementation of proven strategies that builders can implement in any climate region.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/challenge/initiative_goals.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10108">'''Energy in Romania''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Romania]].

Romania has significant oil and gas reserves, substantial coal deposits and it has substantial hydroelectric power installed. However, Romania imports oil and gas from [[Energy in Russia|Russia]] and other first world countries, (it mainly imports from the EU). To ease this dependency Romania seeks to use nuclear power as an alternative to electricity generation. So far, the country has two [[nuclear reactors]], located at [[Cernavodă]], accounting for about 18–20% of the country's [[electricity]] production, with the second one online in 2007. [[Nuclear waste]] is stored on site at reprocessing facilities.

[[Electricity sector in Romania|Electric power in Romania]] is dominated by government enterprises, although privately operated coal mines and oil refineries also existed. Accordingly, Romania placed an increasingly heavy emphasis on developing nuclear power generation. Electric power was provided by the ''Romanian Electric Power Corporation'' (CONEL). Energy used in electric power generation consisted primarily of nuclear, coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Of the electricity generated in 2007, 13.1 percent came from nuclear plants then in operation, 41.69 percent from thermal plants (oil and coal), and 25.8 percent from hydroelectric sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electrica.ro/files/eticheta%202007.pdf Report from state power company]&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted in 2007 that the generation structure by the year 2010 would be 10.2 percent hydroelectric, 12.2 percent oil, 22.9 percent coal, 10.2 percent LNG, and 44.5 percent nuclear.

==Energy strategy 2007 ==
According to the National Energy Strategy adopted by the government in September 2007, investments in upgrading power plants would top EUR 35 bln in the 2007–2020 period. EUR 8.6 bln will be invested in the electricity generation.&lt;ref name="Nine O'Clock, issue 4013, page 7"&gt;Nine O'Clock, issue 4013, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change ==

In the decade between 1989 and 1999, Romania saw decrease of its greenhouse gas emissions by 55%. This can be accounted for by a 45% decrease in energy use due to languishing economy, and a 15% decrease in its [[carbon intensity]] of energy use. In this period of time the carbon intensity of Romania's economy decreased by 40%, while Romania's GDP declined 15%. Romania's GDP has recovered significantly since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cait.wri.org Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrocarbons==
{{Main|Petrochemical industry in Romania}}
[[File:Oil Balance Romania.svg|thumb|Romania's oil production peaked in the 1970s.]]
[[File:Gas Balance Romania.svg|thumb|Gas production does not fare any better]]

Possessing substantial oil refining capacities, Romania is particularly interested in the Central Asia – Europe pipelines and seeks to strengthen its relations with some [[Persian Gulf states]]. With 10 refineries and an overall refining capacity of approximately {{convert|468000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, Romania has the largest refining industry in the region. Romania's refining capacity far exceeds domestic demand for refined petroleum products, allowing the country to export a wide range of oil products and petrochemicals—such as lubricants, bitumen, and fertilizers—throughout the region.&lt;ref name="gasandoil.com"&gt;http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/nte30277.htm Romania has the largest power sector in south-eastern Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy producers were dominated by government enterprises, although privately operated coal mines and oil refineries also existed. Accordingly, Romania placed an increasingly heavy emphasis on developing nuclear power generation.

== Electric power ==

According to the data displayed by Electrica Furnizare SA in August 2017 (source www.electricafurnizare.ro), the structure of electricity production of Romania in 2016 was provided by:

1. High-carbon energy sources: 40.13%, as follows
*24.47% – coal
*14.99% – natural gas
*0.28% – naphta
*0.39% – other conventional sources

2. [[Low-carbon power|Low-carbon]] sources: 59.87%, as follows
*28.86% – hydro-energy
*17.49% – nuclear
*10.13% – wind power
*0.75% – biomass
*2.60% – solar energy
*0.05% – other renewable sources

===Hydroelectric power===
[[Image:Vidraru Dam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Vidraru Dam]], where the largest hydroelectric power plant is located]]
{{Main|Hydroelectricity in Romania}}

Romania has an estimated total usable hydropower of 36,000 GWh per year.&lt;ref name="Nine O'Clock, issue 4013, page 7"/&gt;
{{See also|List of reservoirs and dams in Romania}}

===Wind power===
{{See also|Wind power in Romania}}

===Solar power===
{{See also|Solar power in Romania}}

===Nuclear power===
{{Main|Nuclear power in Romania}}
Romania placed a heavy emphasis on nuclear power generation. The country's first nuclear power plant, the [[Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant|Cernavodă Number One]] located near [[Cernavodă]], opened in 1993. Two reactors were operational in 2007 when atomic power generation was an estimated 21,158 million kilowatts, or 23.1 percent of total electric power.

To cover the increasing energy needs of its population and ensure the continued raising of its living standard, Romania plans several [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] [[power plants]]. Nuclear power proposals were presented as early as in the 1990s, but plans were repeatedly canceled even after bids were made by interested manufacturers because of high costs and safety concerns.

Besides the nuclear power plant in Cernavodă, which consists of two nuclear reactors, the Government has recently announced that it plans to build another nuclear power plant which would most likely be located near one of the major rivers in Transylvania. The new nuclear power plant would consist of two or four nuclear reactors and would have a total output of 2,400 MW. The feasibility studies will be ready by mid-2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineoclock.ro/index.php?page=detalii&amp;categorie=business&amp;id=20080619-512835 Nine O'Clock&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania has always chosen [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] nuclear reactors because they use natural [[enriched uranium|unenriched uranium]] which is cheap and available locally and because they can be refueled online.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2676">'''Energy policy of Iraq''' describes the [[politics of Iraq]] related to energy. [[Energy in Iraq]] describes the [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Iraq]]. [[Electricity sector in Iraq]] is the main article of electricity in Iraq.

Oil revenues are the major income in the [[economy of Iraq]].

Based on data from [[BP]] at the end of 2009 the highest proved [[oil reserves]] including the non-conventional oil deposits are in 1) [[Energy in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] (18 per cent of global reserves) 2) [[Energy in Canada|Canada]] (12%, mostly [[oil sands]]) 3) [[Energy in Venezuela|Venezuela]] (12%, mostly [[tar sands]]) 4) [[Energy in Iran|Iran]] (9%) and 5) Iraq (8%)&lt;ref name=TI2011&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf  2011 report on oil and gas companies, Promoting revenue Transparency] [[Transparency International]] 2011 page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil prices==
Iraq is a member of [[OPEC]].

The global oil and gas prices have been strongly influenced by political decisions and events. For example, [[1967 Oil Embargo|the oil embargo 1967]] and [[1973 oil crisis]] during the 1970s, [[Iran–Iraq War|the Iran-Iraq War]] in the 1980s, [[Invasion of Kuwait|the Iraq-Kuwait War]] in the 1990s and [[Iraq War|the Iraq War]] from 2003.&lt;ref name="TI2011"/&gt;

== Corruption risks ==
{{Main| Corruption in Iraq}}

One of the corruption risks is that the oil resources are publicly owned but often privately produced. The complex system of licenses and fees may drive corruption incentives. According to [[Transparency International]] Bribe Payers Index 2008, the oil and gas industry in general is highly vulnerable to 1) [[bribery]] of public officials and 2) undue influence on the legislative process and government policies. IMF Working Paper confirms the relationship between oil rents and [[corruption]]. Higher increases in oil rents tends to increase corruption and erode political rights. Open Budget Survey 2008 by International Budget Partnership confirmed that the oil- and gas-dependent countries tend to be less transparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf  2011 report on oil and gas companies, Promoting revenue Transparency] [[Transparency International]] 2011 page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sprotect2}}
[[File:Trimyristin-3D-vdW.png|thumb|A fat, or [[triglyceride]], molecule. Note the three fatty acid chains attached to the central glycerol portion of the molecule.|alt=A space-filling model of an unsaturated triglyceride.]]{{Fats}}
[[File:Fat_composition_in_foods.png|thumb|Composition of fats from various foods, as percentage of their total fat.]]

'''Fat''' is one of the three main [[macronutrients]], along with the other two: [[carbohydrate]] and [[protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/macronutrients.htm|title = Macronutrients: the Importance of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat|date = |accessdate = 20 September 2014|website = McKinley Health Center|publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms, thus they are all [[hydrocarbon]] molecules. Examples include [[cholesterol]], [[phospholipids]] and [[triglyceride]]s.

The terms "[[lipid]]", "[[oil]]" and "fat" are often confused. "Lipid" is the general term, though a lipid is not necessarily a [[triglyceride]]. "Oil" normally refers to a lipid with short or [[Unsaturated (hydrocarbon)|unsaturated]] fatty acid chains that is liquid at [[room temperature]], while "fat" (in the strict sense) may specifically refer to lipids that are solids at room temperature – however, "fat" (in the broad sense) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid. Fats, like other lipids, are generally [[hydrophobic]], and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.

Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life, and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions.  They are a necessary part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of most [[heterotroph]]s (including humans) and are the most energy dense, thus the most efficient form of energy storage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/fat-and-protein-metabolism/v/introduction-to-energy-storage | title = Introduction to Energy Storage | publisher = [[Khan Academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not bind water thus do not increase body mass as much as proteins, especially carbohydrates, both of which bind a lot more water. 

Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents. There are two [[essential fatty acids]] (EFAs) in human nutrition: [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozaffarian|first=Dariush|last2=Katan|first2=Martijn B.|last3=Ascherio|first3=Alberto|last4=Stampfer|first4=Meir J.|last5=Willett|first5=Walter C.|date=2006-04-13|title=Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601–1613|doi=10.1056/NEJMra054035|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16611951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt; Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats. Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called [[lipase]]s produced in the [[pancreas]].

Fats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain. Fats that are [[saturated fat]]s have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain. [[Unsaturated fat]]s have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain. The nomenclature is based on the non-acid (non-carbonyl) end of the chain. This end is called the omega end or the n-end. Thus [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] is called an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end. Some oils and fats have multiple double bonds and are therefore called  [[polyunsaturated fats]]. Unsaturated fats can be further divided into [[cis fat]]s, which are the most common in nature, and [[trans fat]]s, which are rare in nature. Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This action, called [[hydrogenation]], tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat. To make vegetable shortening, then, liquid ''cis''-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40&amp;nbsp;°C), and store well, whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air. However, [[trans fat]]s are generated during hydrogenation as contaminants created by an unwanted side reaction on the catalyst during partial hydrogenation.

Saturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature.  For example, animal fats [[tallow]] and [[lard]] are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids.  Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid. Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 [[Calorie|food calories]] (37 [[Joule|kJ]] = 8.8 [[Calorie|kcal]]).&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/contents/made The Food Labelling Regulations 1996] &amp;ndash; [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/7/made Schedule 7: Nutrition labelling]&lt;/ref&gt; Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, [[Glycerin|glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.  Glycerol itself can be converted to [[glucose]] by the liver and so become a source of energy.

==Chemical structure==
{{main| Triglyceride}}[[File:Triglyceride Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|Example of a natural triglyceride with three different fatty acids. One fatty acid is saturated (&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; highlighted), another contains one [[double bond]] within the carbon chain (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;'''green'''&lt;/span&gt; highlighted). The third  fatty acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid, highlighted in &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''red'''&lt;/span&gt;) contains three [[double bond]]s within the carbon chain. All carbon-carbon double bonds shown are ''cis'' isomers. ]]
There are many different kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure.  All fats are derivatives of [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Most fats are [[glyceride]]s, particularly [[triglyceride]]s ([[ester|triesters]] of glycerol). One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid (-COOH) with the alcohol; I.e. three chains per molecule. Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an -O- bond through [[Condensation reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. This process is called [[esterification]] and fats are therefore [[ester]]s.  As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and [[bond angle|angles]] of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E.  The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol "backbone" would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines. Fats therefore have "ester" [[Chemical bond|bonds]].

The properties of any specific fat molecule depend on the particular fatty acids that constitute it.  Fatty acids form a family of compounds that are composed of increasing numbers of carbon atoms linked into a zig-zag chain (hydrogen atoms to the side). The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid, the longer its chain will be.  Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction (in this case, [[van der Waals forces]]), and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature ([[melting point]]).

|}

Fatty acid chains may also differ by length, often categorized as short to very long.
* Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons (i.e. butyric acid).
* Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6–12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.
* Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons.
* Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons.
Any of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short [[triformin]] to very long, e.g., cerotic acid, or ''hexacosanoic acid'', a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid. Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow (lard) whose chains are 17 carbons long. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Importance for living organisms ===

Fats are also sources of [[essential fatty acid]]s, an important dietary requirement. They provide energy as noted above. [[Vitamin]]s [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]] are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy [[skin]] and [[hair]], insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as [[excretion]], [[urination]], accidental or intentional [[bloodletting]], [[sebum]] excretion, and [[hair]] growth.

==Adipose tissue==
[[File:Fatmouse.jpg|right|thumb|The [[obesity|obese]] [[mouse]] on the left has large stores of adipose tissue. For comparison, a mouse with a normal amount of adipose tissue is shown on the right.]]
{{main|Adipose tissue}}
In animals, [[adipose tissue]], or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. [[Adipocyte]]s (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver [[metabolism]]. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the [[circulatory system|circulation]]. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., [[insulin]], [[glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]]). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone [[leptin]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/adipose|title=The human proteome in adipose - The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: [[visceral fat]] is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas "[[subcutaneous fat]]" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but ''above'' the abdominal muscle wall).  Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., [[hormone]]s), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is [[resistin]] which has been linked to obesity, [[insulin resistance]], and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.

==Fatty acids and human health==

Dietary consumption of fatty acids has effects on human health. Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with ''cis'' unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the [[Cochrane Library]] concluded: "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats."&lt;ref&gt;Hooper et al., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737/abstract;jsessionid=0DEB4D52F5ECDF485FAD400C5795A535.f02t04 "Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease"],''Cochrane Database Syst Rev''. 2015 Jun 10;'''(6)''':CD011737.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have also found that consumption of ''trans'' fats increases risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;  The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] advises that replacing ''trans'' fats and saturated fats with ''cis'' monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/ "Fats and Cholesterol"], ''Harvard School of Public Health''.

'''Fuel Pricing Software''' is a business tool intended to allow retail fuel marketers to determine the most appropriate price at which to offer fuel based on their [[pricing strategies]].&lt;ref name=CSN&gt;[http://www.csnews.com/top-story-petroleum-skyline_products_selling_fuel_pricing_software_as_stand_alone_product-56544.html "Skyline Products Selling Fuel Pricing Software as Stand-alone Product."] Convenience Store News. March 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The software solutions were developed to help fuel retailers manage margins, sales and stock volumes in the face of fuel market price volatility, unfavorable supply arrangements, and price sensitivity of retail customers.&lt;ref name=Rigik&gt;Rigik, Erin. [http://www.csdecisions.com/2011/06/17/developing-a-fuel-strategy-amid-soaring-costs/ "Developing a Fuel Strategy Amid Soaring Costs."] Convenience Store Decisions. June 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NACS&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/YourBusiness/FuelsReports/GasPrices_2013/Pages/HowRetailersGetSellGas.aspx "What Influences Gasoline Prices?"] NACS: The Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing.&lt;/ref&gt; This can even include managing fuel order placement and monitoring overall site traffic.&lt;ref name=PetrolWorld&gt;{{cite news|title=Pricing - The Drive To Optimise |url=http://www.pagesonline.ie/issue/2013/Petrol_World_Issue_4_2013/#/20/ |accessdate=24 October 2013 |newspaper=Petrol World |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185405/http://www.pagesonline.ie/issue/2013/Petrol_World_Issue_4_2013/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors such as pricing of competitors, analysis of current market costs and sales for each grade of fuel are all considerations that affect the outcome of fuel prices. In addition to this, sales by related convenience stores can effectively subsidize the fuel, lowering the price.&lt;ref name=Magner&gt;{{cite web|last=Magner|first=Lauren|title=Service stations and convenience stores battle the giants|url=http://www.ibisworld.com.au/media/2013/09/02/service-stations-and-convenience-stores-battle-the-giants/|work=IBISWorld|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some software is designed to integrate with [[Point of sale software#Modern software|point-of-sale systems]], pumps, wetstock systems providers,&lt;ref name=PetrolPlaza&gt;{{cite web|title=Inform Information Systems wins deal to support EuroGarages’ fuel pricing|url=http://www.petrolplaza.com/news/industry/MiZlbiYxNTI2NSYmMQ==|work=Petrol Plaza|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and electronic price signs to automate instant price changes. This saves store staff the inconvenience of changing gas price signs manually and allows retailers to more responsively post optimal pricing,&lt;ref name=CSN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pape&gt;Pape, Pat. [http://www.nacsonline.com/magazine/PastIssues/2009/May2009/Pages/Feature_3.aspx "Sign of the Times."] May, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; even monitoring the market in real time.&lt;ref name=PetrolPlaza /&gt;
	
Fuel pricing software is intended to replace manual or spreadsheet-based processes that could delay the update of fuel costs and jeopardize profit margins. Delayed updates of fuels costs can cause fuel buyers to pay more than necessary, with day-to-day price swings occurring at 3 cents nearly 50% of the time and 5 cents at just over 25%.&lt;ref name=Fontevecchia&gt;Fontevecchia, Agustino.

==Mobile Applications==
Fuel pricing [[mobile applications]] for consumers, such as [[GasBuddy.com|GasBuddy]] and Fuel Finder, are intended to locate the best prices on fuel according to their current location.&lt;ref name=Brady&gt;Brady, Jeff.

The '''Ghana Atomic Energy Commission''' (GAEC) is the state organization in [[Ghana]] involved with surveillance of the use of [[nuclear energy in Ghana]]. It is similar in aim to the [[Ghana Nuclear Society]] (GNS), with the difference being that the GNS is a [[nonprofit]] organisation, whereas the GAEC is part of the [[parliament of Ghana]]. Its primary objectives were set out by the parliament act 588, which involve investigating the use of nuclear energy for Ghana and supporting [[research and development]] both in Ghana and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC), http://www.gaecgh.org/, 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This first sentence doesn't read properly --&gt;'''Green strength''', or '''handling strength''', can be defined as the strength of a material it is processed to form its final [[ultimate tensile strength]].  This strength is usually considerably lower than the final ultimate strength of a material. The term green strength is usually referenced when discussing non-metallic materials such as [[adhesives]] and [[elastomers]] (such as rubber). Recently, it has also been referenced in [[metallurgy]] applications such as [[powdered metallurgy]].

== Adhesives ==
A joint made through the use of an [[adhesive]] can be referred to as an adhesive joint or bond.

[[File:Epoxy-Chemistry-time-v-temp.jpg|thumb|Phases of Epoxy ]]

The green strength of adhesives is the early development of [[bond strength]] of an adhesive. It indicated "that the adhesive bond is strong enough to be handled a short time after the adherents are mated but much before full cure is obtained." Usually, this strength is significantly lower than the final curing strength. Most adhesives typically have an initial green strength and a final ultimate tensile strength listed for their application. For household adhesives, this data is usually reflected on the packaging.&lt;ref name=AdhesiveBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pocius|first1=Alphonsus|title=Adhesion and Adhesives Technology: An Introduction|date=2012|publisher=Hanser|isbn=978-1-56990-511-1|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best example of this is seen in typical [[Epoxy|epoxies]] from a local hardware stores. During curing, the epoxy will travel into an initial curing phase, also called "green phase", when it begins to gel. At that point, the epoxy is no longer workable and will move from being tacky to a firm rubber-like texture. While the epoxy is only partially cured at this point, it has formed a lower green strength. Normally, this process occurs within 30 minutes to 1 hour. At this time, the part in question can be handled, but cannot handle large loads or stress. It typically takes up to 24 hours for a standard epoxy to cure to its final and complete strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Characteristics of Several Common Adhesive Tests|website=https://www.adhesivesmag.com/articles/86462-important-characteristics-of-several-common-adhesive-tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epoxy Chemistry|url=https://www.westsystem.com/instruction-2/epoxy-basics/epoxy-chemistry/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperature is an important factor in the time it takes for an adhesive to form the green strength. While this can vary from adhesive to adhesive, general speaking, heat can speed up the process to form the green strength and the overall curing time. [[Time-temperature transformation|Time-Temperature-Transformation]] Diagrams exist for various adhesives that relate the time and temperature to the state of the adhesive during curing. This allows for a proper understanding of when the green strength will be reached for an adhesive joint based on certain conditions.&lt;ref name=AdhesiveBook /&gt;

=== Testing ===
Mechanical testing can be used  to verify the green strength of a material. This will allow the user the understand the amount of load that can be applied in the green phase before final cure.&lt;ref name=AdhesiveBook /&gt;

Tensile loading can be verified by various testing methods. Multiple ASTM specifications exist for the tensile testing of adhesives that are relatively easy to follow. Such tests include the process of attaching the adhesive to two adherents (typically wood or steel) then testing the joint with a pull-type test. One example is the use us ASTM Test Method D2095. In this test, two metal rod ends are polished so it contains no burrs that could affect the adhesive bond. It also machined so the surfaces are perfectly parallel. The rods are then butted against each with the adhesive joining them. As it cures and sets, the fulfillment of green strength can be tested by a pull test, putting the bond in full tension load.&lt;ref name=AdhesiveBook /&gt;
[[File:Example of Lap Shear.jpg|thumb|Example of Lap Shear Joint in Load]]
Shear loading can also be tested in respect to green strength. Most adhesive bonds used in design require the bond to typically be in a state of shear, not tensile. Because of this, it is very important to understand the shear loading of a joint in relation to its green strength and final strength. Just like in tensile loading, [[ASTM]] provides very specific testing methods for a joint in shear loading. The standard lap shear specimen test is described in ASTM D1002. This test is the single common and discussed test method for adhesive bonds. In this method, the surface is prepped and cleaned for each specimen. The adhesive is then applied to the area that will be lapped. This lap length is generally 0.5" and the bond width is 1". The bond is then fixed and allowed to cure. For green strength testing, the fixture can be removed, at the appropriate time, and the specimen can be loaded in shear until it finally fails. This will verify the green strength of the material.&lt;ref name=AdhesiveBook /&gt;

Other testing, such as cleavage loading and peel test, can be used to determine both the green strength and final strength of a material. These are typically not reflected on the data sheet for standard adhesives, but can be used for testing of adhesives based on their applications in residential and commercial environments.&lt;ref name=AdhesiveBook /&gt;

== Elastomers ==
[[File:F1 tire 2012-hard.svg.png|thumb|Rubber Tire (Elastomer)]]
Green strength is a term in the elastomer industry used to describe the strength of an elastomer an unvulcanized and uncured state. The most popular, referenced type of elastomer is rubber.
For rubber composites, the green strength is essential during the formation and manufacturing of materials such as radial tires, tank tracks, etc. These rubbers must be stretched from one mill to another during processing to form the final vulcanized product. The green strength allows this to happen without tearing or wrinkling of the material before final curing is complete.

To improve the green strength of elastomers and prevent issues during forming, various additives and compounds are typically added to the composite. Also, fabrication and forming techniques have been modified to reduce the amount of stress on the material before it is vulcanized. These techniques are a pertinent component of the tire making industry because it is a process that requires lots of forming, stretching, and bending during fabrication before the final curing is complete.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ma|first1=Liquing|title=Method to improve green strength in elastomers|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US8563656|website=Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metals ==
Green strength of metals is typically referenced in the field of powder metallurgy. Powder metallurgy refers to the fabrication of materials or components from powders. In powder metallurgy, the initial green strength is formed during compacting and forming. Increased complexity of parts and geometry have created a need for a higher green strength during this process. &lt;ref name=Powder&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luk|first1=Sydney|title=Enhanced Green Strength Material System for Ferrous and Stainless P/M Processing|journal=PM2TEC '96 World Congress|date=1996|url=http://www.yunamedia.com/www.hoegtest.com/TechPapersv2/40.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several limitations that restrict the ability to increase green strength in powder metallurgy components. Characteristics such as particle size and compressibility pose limits on the final green strength. &lt;ref name=Powder /&gt;

There are currently various studies in place to improve the green strength of powder metallurgy. The use of advanced [[Lubricant|lubricants]] and the addition of high alloys have shown that it is possible to increase the green strength of these materials. &lt;ref name=Powder /&gt;

The '''HVDC Sileru–Barsoor''' is a [[high voltage direct current]] transmission system between Sileru and Barsoor in India. It is in service since 1989 as the first HVDC line in the country. The HVDC Sileru–Barsoor is a bipolar HVDC with a voltage of 200&amp;nbsp;kV and a transmission rate of 400&amp;nbsp;megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.transmission.bpa.gov/cigresc14/Compendium/SILERU.htm |title=Technical details of Sileru-Barsuru HVDC link |accessdate=22 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115122606/http://www.transmission.bpa.gov/cigresc14/Compendium/SILERU.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The HVDC Sileru–Barsoor couples two asynchronously operated parts of Indian electricity mains over a {{convert|196|km}} long overhead line, which was originally a double-circuit 220&amp;nbsp;kV AC line from which three conductors are paralleled.

This HVDC line is not in use for a long time. On 1 January 2014, the NEW grid is synchronised with the Southern regional grid making this HVDC link redundant. 200&amp;nbsp;kV AC line of NEW grid can be directly connected to the 200&amp;nbsp;kV line of Southern grid bypassing the HVDC converter stations. Thus the energy losses taking place in the converter stations can be avoided and these [[HVDC converter station]]s can be shifted to elsewhere to export/import power from other countries.

These unused converter stations owned by APTransCo, can be used to generate hydro electricity from [[Srisailam Dam]] or [[Nagarjuna Sagar Dam]] hydro power stations when the water level in the reservoirs are below the minimum rated water head by generating power at lower/under frequency (&lt; 50 Hz). The lower frequency power is converted to normal grid frequency power with these converter stations. Thus more water available in the dead storage of these reservoirs can be used for additional power generation to meet peaking demand in summer months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">'''Hydrogenated jojoba oil''' is the end product of the complete [[hydrogenation]] of [[jojoba oil]].

== Chemical structure ==
Hydrogenated jojoba oil is a straight-chain [[wax ester]] of 36 to 46 carbons in length, an ester bond in the approximate middle of the chain, no branching, no points of unsaturation, and terminal methyl groups at each end.  As with jojoba oil, there is no [[triglyceride]] component of hydrogenated jojoba oil.

== Physical properties ==
Hydrogenated jojoba oil is a hard, crystalline wax ester. The melting point is 68-70 °C and the iodine value is &lt; 2.0, making it one of the very few commercially available, high-melting-point wax esters of botanical origin. Hydrogenated jojoba oil is relatively colourless and odourless.  Hydrogenated jojoba oil contains no trans isomers.

== Uses ==
Hydrogentated Jojoba Oil has particular functionality in cosmetics, due to its ability to strengthen the wax matricies of "stick" formulations such as lipstick, eyeliner, lip balm et al.  Hydrogenated jojoba oil is often used as a material for [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]] particles due to its uniform color, hardness, and controllable crystallinity.

A '''Hygrophyte''' ([[ancient Greek|Greek]]  ''hygros'' = wet  + ''phyton'' = plant) is a plant living  above ground that are adapted to the conditions of abundant moisture pads of  surrounding air. These plants inhabit mainly wet and dark forests and islands darkened swamp and very humid and  floody [[meadows]]. Within the group of all types of terrestrial plants, they are at least resistant to drought.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book|editor= Lawrence E.|year=1999|title=Henderson's Dictionary of biological terms|publisher=Longman Group Ltd.|place= London|isbn=  0-582-22708-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Međedović"&gt;{{cite book|author=Međedović S., Maslić E., Hadžiselimović R.|year=2002|title=Biologija 2. |publisher=Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the environmental attributes are a group of plants between categories [[hydrophyte]]s (aquatic plants) and [[mesophyte]]s  (plants in  moderate environmental conditions)
Plants living in the or moist habitats typically lack [[xerophyte|xeromorphic]] features.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;

The '''International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969''', renewed in 1992 and often referred to as the '''CLC Convention''', is an international maritime treaty admistered by the [[International Maritime Organization]] that was adopted to ensure that adequate compensation would be available where oil pollution damage was caused by maritime casualties involving [[oil tankers]] (i.e. ships that carry oil as cargo).&lt;ref name="imo.org"&gt;International Maritime Organization on the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC), 1969 [http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-on-Civil-Liability-for-Oil-Pollution-Damage-(CLC).aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liability ==
The convention introduces [[strict liability]] for shipowners.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bhanu Krishna Kiran, [http://nujslawreview.org/2016/12/03/liability-and-compensation-for-oil-pollution-damage-an-examination-of-imo-conventions/ "Liability and Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage: An examination of IMO Convention"], ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015, Accessed on 1 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases when the shipowner is deemed guilty of fault for an instance of oil pollution, the convention does not cap liability.

When the shipowner is not at fault, the convention caps liability at between 3 million [[special drawing rights]] (SDR) for a ship of {{GT|5,000}} to 59.7 million SDR for ships over {{GT|140,000}}.

The 2000 Amendments

Adoption: 18 October 2000

Entry into force: 1 November 2003

The amendments raised the compensation limits by 50 percent compared to the limits set in the 1992 Protocol, as follows:  
For a ship not exceeding 5,000 gross tonnage, liability is limited to  4.51 million SDR (US$5.78 million)
For a ship  5,000 to 140,000 gross tonnage:  liability is limited to 4.51 million SDR  plus 631 SDR  for each additional gross tonne over 5,000
For a ship over 140,000 gross tonnage: liability is limited to  89.77 million SDR

 The [[HNS Convention]] to compensation for damages occurring from spill of [[dangerous goods]] is based on the same legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hnsconvention.org/Pages/TheConvention.aspx|title=HNS Convention Legal Framework|accessdate=2014-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201225527/http://www.hnsconvention.org/Pages/TheConvention.aspx|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insurance ==

If a ship carries more than 2000 tons of oil in cargo, CLC requires shipowners to maintain "insurance or other financial security" sufficient to cover the maximum liability for one oil spill&lt;ref name="imo.org"/&gt;

== Coverage ==
As of September 2016, 136 states, representing 97.5 per cent of the world fleet, are contracting parties to the '''CLC Protocol''' of 1992, which amends the original CLC Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Pages/Default.aspx International Maritime Organization – Status of Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolivia]], [[North Korea]], [[Honduras]], and [[Lebanon]]—which are generally [[flag of convenience]] states—have not ratified the treaty.&lt;ref name="marisec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shipping Industry Flag State Performance Table |last=MARISEC |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Maritime International Secretariat Services |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages=1–2 |url=http://www.marisec.org/shippingfacts/uploads/File/FlagStatePerformanceTable09.pdf?SID=lghwfzybi |accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States of America]] is not a signatory to CLC, despite considerable involvement in its formulation. This is due to significant nation legislation such as the [[Oil Pollution Act, 1990]], so signing the CLC was deemed unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION FOR SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/dtltlb20114_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|accessdate=30 June 2017|pages=20, 23|date=31 January 2012|quote=[p20:] However, it should be noted that in some cases, substantial compensation may be available under applicable national law, as for instance in the case of the United States Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA 1990). [and p23:] [Non-signatories] includes notably the United States, where, however, strong national legislation to provide for liability and compensation has been enacted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">'''Iron sulfide''' or '''Iron sulphide''' can refer to a range of [[chemical compound]]s composed of [[iron]] and [[sulfur]].

==Natural minerals==
By increasing order of stability: 
* [[Iron(II) sulfide]], FeS, the less stable amorphous form;
* [[Greigite]], a form of [[iron(II,III) sulfide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), analog to [[magnetite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;;
* [[Pyrrhotite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;S (where x = 0 to 0.2), or Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;;
* [[Troilite]], FeS, the [[endmember]] of pyrrhotite;
* [[Mackinawite]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;1+x&lt;/sub&gt;S (where x = 0 to 0.1);
* [[Marcasite]], or iron(II) disulfide, FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (orthorhombic);
* [[Pyrite]], or iron(II) disulfide, FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cubic), the more stable endmember, known as fool's gold.

==Artificial product==
* [[Iron(III) sulfide]], Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a quite unstable artificial product synthesised at –20&amp;nbsp;°C and not identified in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="698">An '''isodesmic crystal''' is a [[crystal]] in which all the [[chemical bond|bonds]] have the same [[electrostatic]] [[valency (chemistry)|valency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfennig|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Inorganic Chemistry|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-twqBwAAQBAJ|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that all the bonds are of the same strength. [[Diamond]]s and [[halite]] have isodesmic crystals. The opposite of an isodesmic crystal is an [[anisodesmic crystal]], in which [[anion]]s more strongly bonded to central coordinating [[cation]]. [[Graphite]] is an example of an anisodesmic crystal.

Oslo, p. 42.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as the ''Langvatn kraftverk'',&lt;ref name="NVE"/&gt; which should not be confused with the [[Langvatn Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Rana, Norway|Rana]].

The plant utilizes a drop of {{convert|64|m|sp=us}}&lt;ref name="Sks"/&gt; between two lakes: ''[[Fellvatnet]]'' ({{lang-smj|Roavggojávrre}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Nordland/Gildesk%C3%A5l/Fellvatnet/|title=Fellvatnet, Gildeskål (Nordland)|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulated between an elevation of {{cvt|393|m}} and {{cvt|333|m}}, and ''[[Langvatnet (Gildeskål)|Langvatnet]]'' ({{lang-smj|Gåddumjávrre}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Nordland/Gildesk%C3%A5l/Langvatnet/|title=Langvatnet, Gildeskål (Nordland)|publisher=[[yr.no]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulated between an elevation of {{cvt|331|m}} and {{cvt|299|m}}.

The plant has a 5&amp;nbsp;MW turbine and an average annual production of about 21&amp;nbsp;GWh.&lt;ref name="Sks"/&gt; Its catchment area is {{convert|93|km2|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Sks"/&gt; The plant is owned by [[Salten Kraftsamband]] and it came into operation in 1979.&lt;ref name="Sks"/&gt; The plant is built into the mountainside at the end of a drain tunnel and the water it discharges is later used by the [[Sundsfjord Hydroelectric Power Station]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15257">In [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] the  '''mass dimension one fermions of spin one half''' are  a [[dark matter]] candidate. These fermions are fundamentally different from the hitherto known matter particles, like electrons or neutrinos. Despite being endowed with spin one half they are not described by the celebrated Dirac formalism but, instead, by a spinorial Klein-Gordon formalism.

In 2004 Dharam Vir Ahluwalia (IIT Guwahati) in collaboration with Daniel Grumiller presented an unexpected theoretical discovery of spin one-half fermions with mass dimension one. See,&lt;ref&gt;D. V. Ahluwalia and D. Grumiller,

However, the formalism suffered from two troubling features, that of non-locality and a subtle violation of Lorentz symmetry. The origin of both of these issues has now been traced to a hidden freedom in the definition of duals of spinors and the associated field adjoints.&lt;ref&gt;D. V. Ahluwalia, The theory of local mass dimension one fermions of spin one half,  Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 27 (2017) no.3, 2247-2285 . [[doi:10.1007/s00006-017-0775-1]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result there now exists an entirely new  quantum theory of spin one-half fermions that is free from all the mentioned issues. The interactions of the new fermions are restricted to dimension-four quartic self interaction, and also to a dimension-four coupling with the Higgs. A generalised Yukawa coupling of the new fermions with neutrinos provides an hitherto unsuspected source of lepton-number violation. The new fermions thus present a first-principle dark matter partner to Dirac fermions of the standard model with contrasting mass dimensions — that of three halves for the latter versus one of the former without mutating the statistics from fermionic to bosonic.

Mass dimension one fermionic field of spin one half uses ELKO as its expansion coefficients. ELKO is an acronym of the original German term "'''E'''igenspinoren des '''L'''adungs'''k'''onjugations'''o'''perators", designating [[spinors]] that are eigenspinors of the [[charge conjugation]] operator.

Since the new fermions have a mass dimensionality mismatch with [[standard model]] matter fields they were suggested as a dark matter candidate. As a result of their scalar-like mass dimension they differ significantly from the mass dimension 3/2 Dirac fermions.&lt;ref&gt;M. Dias, F. de Campos and J. M. Hoff da Silva,
   ``Exploring Elko typical signature,''
  Phys. Lett. B '''706''', 352 (2012)

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass dimension one fermions have unexpected implications for cosmology by providing first principle dark matter and dark energy fields. Immediately after the publication of the Ahluwalia-Grumiller papers in 2005, Christian Boehmer  pioneered application of Elko to cosmology and argued that Elko "are not only prime dark matter candidates but also prime candidates for inflation." &lt;ref&gt;C.G.Boehmer,
  The Einstein-Elko system: Can dark matter drive inflation?,''
  Annalen Phys.\  '''16''', 325 (2007),
  [[doi:10.1002/andp.200610237]]
  [gr-qc/0701087].&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein–Cartan–Elko system was first introduced in cosmology by Boehmer.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Boehmer,

  [[doi:10.1002/andp.200610216]]

  [arXiv:1608.02777 [gr-qc]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Abhishek Basak and colleagues have argued that the fast-roll inflation attractor point is unique for Elko and it is independent of the form of the potential.&lt;ref&gt;

These effects, leading to the non-vanishing Λ could be responsible for the inflationary phase at early universe stages. Furthermore, for the late time evolution, corresponding to a model with a time varying cosmological term, such quantum effects are in agreement with a previous recent work &lt;ref&gt;S.H.

'''Minerotrophic''' [[soil]]s and [[vegetation]] receive their water supply mainly from [[stream]]s or [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]].  This water has flowed over or through rocks or other minerals, often acquiring dissolved chemicals which raise the nutrient levels and reduce the [[acidity]].  If these chemicals include [[Base (chemistry)|chemical base]]s such as [[calcium]] or [[magnesium]] [[ion]]s, the water is referred to as ''[[base-rich]]'' and is [[pH|neutral]] or [[alkali]]ne.

In contrast to minerotrophic environments, [[ombrotrophic]] environments get their water mainly from precipitation, and so are very low in nutrients and more acidic.

The German National Platform for Electric Mobility ("Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität") is an advisory council of the [[Cabinet of Germany|German Federal Government]] for [[electric vehicle]] introduction. It consists of the top representatives of industry (10 Members), politics (6), science (3), associations (3) and unions (1). It was officially established on 3 May 2010 during a meeting with [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|German chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]. Its task is to push on the National Development Plan for Electric Mobility ("Nationaler Entwicklungsplan Elektromobilität"). The goal for 2020 of the NPE is to develop Germany to the leading supplier and lead market for electric mobility and to gain an employment effect of 30,000 additional jobs.

== History ==
The foundation for the promotion of electric mobility in Germany has been set with the Integrated Energy and Climate Programme of the Federal Government decided in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/gesamtbericht_iekp.pdf|format=PDF|title=Integriertes Energie- und Klimaprogramm (IEKP)|language=German|website=bmu.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete measures were proposed in connection with the National Strategy Conference on Electromobility at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elektromobilitaet2008.de|title=elektromobilitaet2008.de|work=elektromobilitaet2008.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; First fundings followed under the second economic stimulus package in early 2009. Before that, the industry had formed a so-called Innovation Alliance "LIB 2015". This industry consortium committed to invest 360 million euros for research and development of lithium-ion batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fz-juelich.de/ptj/LIB|title=„Lithium Ionen Batterie LIB 2015“|work=fz-juelich.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic stimulus package brought up an amount of 500 million euros for projects in 15 topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foerderinfo.bund.de/_media/elektromobilitaet_konjunkturpaket_ii.pdf|format=PDF|title=Elektromobilität im Rahmen des Konjunkturpakets II|language=German|website=foerderinfo.bund.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718204726/http://www.foerderinfo.bund.de/_media/elektromobilitaet_konjunkturpaket_ii.pdf|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the Federal Ministries of Economics and Technology ([[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|BMWi]]), of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs ([[Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure|BMVBS]]), for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety ([[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety|BMU]]), of Education and Research ([[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|BMBF]]) and of Food, Agriculture and Consumer protection ([[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|BMELV]]). The actual implementation was mostly coordinated by partners like the VDI/VDE-IT that already coordinated previous developments in electric mobility like research and development of batteries.&lt;ref&gt;VDI/VDE-IT: [http://www.pt-elektromobilitaet.de/ Projektträger Elektromobilität]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 [[Annette Schavan]], [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal minister of Education and Research]], inaugurated the Forum Electric Mobility ("Forum Elektromobilität") as part of the joint project System Research for Electromobility of the [[Fraunhofer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forum-elektromobilitaet.de Forum-Elektromobilität], unterstützt vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)&lt;/ref&gt; The forum was assigned to pool the research and development efforts of the 33 Fraunhofer institutes together with the industrial partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo-online.de/suedhessen/template_detail.php3?id=792305 Echo Online: ''Darmstadt. Schaltstelle für "Systemforschung Elektromobilität"''] vom 24. September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011 the schemes were funded with 30 million euros from the economic stimulus package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idw-online.de/de/news332766 Annette Schavan: "Elektromobilität hat jetzt eine Adresse"], Informationsdienst Wissenschaft, Pressemitteilung vom 9. September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This support constitutes the first step of implementation of the National Development Plan for Electric Mobility.

The Federal Chancellery gave increasingly top priority to the National Development Plan for Electric Mobility. The Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs established the Joint Agency for Electric Mobility of the Federal Government on 1 February 2010 ("Gemeinsame Geschäftsstelle Elektromobilität der Bundesregierung").&lt;ref name="ggemo-foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/energie,did=329290.html|title=BMWi - Energie|author=Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, Referat Öffentlichkeitsarbeit|work=bmwi.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/energie,did=329290.html Pressemeldung vom 1.2.2010 "Gemeinsame Geschäftsstelle Elektromobilität der Bundesregierung (GGEMO) nimmt Fahrt auf"] "um das Ziel zu erreichen, Deutschland zu einem Leitmarkt für Elektromobilität zu entwickeln und bis 2020 eine Mio. Elektrofahrzeuge in Deutschland zu haben."&lt;/ref&gt; With its kick-off it announced the foundation of the German National Platform for Electric Mobility, which was proclaimed on 3. May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=340772.html|title=BMWi - Pressemitteilungen|author=Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, Referat Öffentlichkeitsarbeit|work=bmwi.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently the involved partners committed to establish cross-company and cross-sector working groups and to deliver a first interim report until the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmvbs.de/Presse/Pressemitteilungen-,1632.1159625/Nationale-Plattform-Elektromob.htm?global.back=/Presse/-%2c1632%2c0/Pressemitteilungen.htm%3flink%3dbmv_liste%26link.sKategorie%3d "Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität kommt mit ihrer Arbeit gut voran"], press release 217/2010, German [[Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development]], 28. July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination panels of the NPE could build on experts of the existing working groups of the [[Deutsche Kommission Elektrotechnik Elektronik Informationstechnik im DIN und VDE|German Commission for Electrical, Electronic &amp; Information Technologies of DIN and VDE]] (DKE) of the [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies]] (VDE). The VDE Congress "E-mobility" on 8 and 9 December 2010 in Leipzig was used for technical consultation, from which the first interim report for the Federal Government has been derived. It describes the state of development and the expectations of the representatives of industry and research.&lt;ref name="npe2010heise"&gt;[http://www.heise.de/autos/artikel/Nationale-Plattform-Elektromobilitaet-legt-Zwischenbericht-vor-1146019.html "Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität legt Zwischenbericht vor"], heise autos, 2. November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The second report was published in 2011. The report refined the details on development options and proposes support of different projects. In an early statement the German industry expressed the opinion that the current stimulation plan is insufficient to reach the defined goal of 1 million [electric vehicle|electric vehicles] in Germany by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/autos/artikel/Deutsche-Industrie-fordert-Subventionen-fuer-Elektroautos-1229521.html "Deutsche Industrie fordert Subventionen für Elektroautos"], Heise Autos online, 18. April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report states that with the right incentive measures the goals of the NPE could still be reached.

At the International Conference of the German Government for Electric Mobility on 27 and 28 May 2013, the representatives of the Government confirmed the objectives and the planned financing and incentives. With its fourth report (Progress Report 2014 – Review of Pre-Market Phase) the NPE completed the pre-market phase (2010 – 2014) and showed the progress so far. At the same time the NPE presented a package of measures for the subsequent phase of the market-ramp-up (2015 - 2017), which showed how Germany could achieve the targets till 2020. The report stresses the need for additional incentives to reach the one million target.

In June 2015 the [[Bundestag|German Bundestag]] passed the first act on electric mobility ("Elektromobilitätsgesetz"). At the National Conference for Electric Mobility of the Federal Government in 2015, Chancellor Merkel announced a decision on further support measures for the end of the year. In spring of 2016 the decision on a support program was made, which directly addresses buyers of electric vehicles by financial incentives.

== Organisation ==
[[File:NPE Organisation englisch.png|thumb|Organigram of the NPE]]
The platform consists of the steering committee, an editorial team and six topic-specific working groups. The steering committee coordinates the working groups. It is the decision-making body and reflects the structure of the NPE, which is made up of members of economy, science, politics and associations. Its members are the chairmen of the working groups, representatives of the federal government, the industrial circle electric mobility and the members of the editorial team. The editorial team supports the steering committee in the elaboration of reports and other publications of the NPE. The NPE is supported by the Federal Government’s Joint Agency for Electric Mobility (GGEMO). The Office of the NPE Chair moderates the platform and coordinates the NPE communication.

==Approach==
[[File:Ansatz Phasenmodell NPE englisch.jpg|thumb|Phase model of the NPE]]
The NPE considers electric mobility as a total system of the components vehicle, energy supply, transport infrastructure and urban planning, which transcends the limits of traditional industry branches. This corresponds to the cross-sector and cross-disciplinary organization and operation of the NPE. The aim of the NPE is a self-sustaining market, which requires no political monetary support. To achieve the goals, the NPE recommends certain measures to the federal government and conducts regular reviews to their stage of development. The basis for their recommendations to support electric mobility is a three-phase model that reflects the different market stages.

==Tasks==

The National Platform for Electric Mobility has the mandate to develop concrete proposals to achieve the objectives of the National Development Plan for Electric Mobility. Therefore the six working groups address the following main topics:

* Drive technology
* Battery technology (e.g. [[Lithium-ion battery]])
* Charging infrastructure and power grid integration ([[Charging station|charging stations]])
* Regulation, standardisation and certification (e.g. [[Combined Charging System]])
* Information and communication technologies
* General Framework
* Education and qualification (now completed)
* Materials and recycling (partly finished, partly distributed on WG 1 and WG 2)

The experts in the working groups develop common positions and represent them in status analyzes, roadmaps and recommendation papers that summarize the need for action in electric mobility. The NPE hands over the publications to the federal government and opens it to the interested public. On 30 November 2010, a first interim report was published. The second report was published on 16 May 2011 and the third on 1 June 2012. The Progress Report 2014 – Review of Pre-Market Phase was passed to the Federal Government on 2 December 2014.

'''Neptunium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Np''' and [[atomic number]] 93. A [[radioactivity|radioactive]] [[actinide]] metal, neptunium is the first [[transuranic element]]. Its position in the [[periodic table]] just after [[uranium]], named after the planet [[Uranus]], led to it being named after [[Neptune]], the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 [[proton]]s and 93 electrons, of which seven are [[valence electron]]s. Neptunium metal is silvery and [[tarnish]]es when exposed to air. The element occurs in three [[allotrope|allotropic]] forms and it normally exhibits five [[oxidation state]]s, ranging from +3 to +7. It is [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]], [[radiation poisoning|poisonous]], [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], and can accumulate in [[bone]]s, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.

Although many false claims of its discovery were made over the years, the element was first synthesized by [[Edwin McMillan]] and [[Philip H. Abelson]] at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] in 1940. Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by [[neutron irradiation]] of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional [[nuclear power]] reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it is used as a precursor for the formation of [[plutonium-238]], used in [[radioisotope thermal generator]]s to provide electricity for [[spacecraft]]. Neptunium has also been used in [[neutron detector|detector]]s of high-energy [[neutron]]s.

The most stable [[isotope]] of neptunium, neptunium-237, is a by-product of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[plutonium]] production. It, and the isotope neptunium-239, are also found in trace amounts in [[uranium]] ores due to [[neutron capture|neutron capture reactions]] and [[beta decay]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = C.

__TOC__

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
Neptunium is a [[hardness (materials science)|hard]], silvery, [[ductility|ductile]], [[radioactivity|radioactive]] actinide [[metal]]. In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[uranium]], to the left of the actinide [[plutonium]] and below the [[lanthanide]] [[promethium]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida718/&gt; Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]], comparable to that of [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dabos |first1=S. |last2=Dufour |first2=C. |last3=Benedict |first3=U. |last4=Pagès |first4=M. |date=1987 |title=Bulk modulus and P–V relationship up to 52&amp;nbsp;GPa of neptunium metal at room temperature |journal=Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials |volume=63–64 |pages=661–3 |doi=10.1016/0304-8853(87)90697-4|bibcode = 1987JMMM...63..661D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases.&lt;ref name=Yoshida718/&gt; Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3&amp;nbsp;°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4&amp;nbsp;°C), is due to the [[orbital hybridization|hybridization]] of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal.&lt;ref name="Yu. D. Tretyakov"/&gt; The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174&amp;nbsp;°C is extrapolated from the [[vapor pressure]] of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535&amp;nbsp;K passes between its melting and boiling points).&lt;ref name=Yoshida718/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;

Neptunium is found in at least three [[allotrope]]s.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven.&lt;ref name=Yoshida718&gt;Yoshida et al., p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt; This multiplicity of allotropes is common among the actinides. The [[crystal structure]]s of neptunium, [[protactinium]], uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d&amp;nbsp;[[transition metal]]s.&lt;ref name="Yu.

====Alloys====
Due to the presence of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the [[transition metal]]s to the local moment behavior typical of [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], and the [[lanthanide]]s. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal [[ligand]]s, and the fact that the 5f orbital is [[relativistic effects|relativistically]] destabilized and extends outwards.&lt;ref name=Yoshida720&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 719–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, pure neptunium is [[paramagnetic]], Np[[aluminium|Al]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is [[ferromagnetic]], Np[[germanium|Ge]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has no magnetic ordering, and Np[[tin|Sn]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; behaves [[fermion]]ically.&lt;ref name=Yoshida720/&gt; Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, [[americium]], [[plutonium]], [[zirconium]], and [[iron]], so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.&lt;ref name=Yoshida720/&gt;

One neptunium-based [[superconductivity|superconductor]] alloy has been discovered with formula Np[[palladium|Pd]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This occurrence in neptunium compounds is somewhat surprising because they often exhibit strong magnetism, which usually destroys superconductivity. The alloy has a tetragonal structure with a superconductivity transition temperature of −268.3&amp;nbsp;°C (4.9&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=T. D.

===Chemical===
Neptunium has five ionic [[oxidation state]]s ranging from +3 to +7 when forming chemical compounds, which can be simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its valence electrons in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of [[coordination compound]]s.&lt;ref name="Himiya neptuniya"&gt;{{cite book|title = Analytical chemistry of neptunium|editor=V. A. Mikhailov|place =Moscow |publisher = [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]]|date = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic===
A neptunium atom has 93 electrons, arranged in the [[electron configuration|configuration]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Radon|Rn]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;5f&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This differs from the configuration expected by the [[Aufbau principle]] in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This is because of the similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the [[noble gas]] radon;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Golub, A. M. |title = Общая и неорганическая химия (General and Inorganic Chemistry)|date = 1971|volume = 2|pages=222–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is [Rn]&amp;nbsp;5f&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their [Rn]&amp;nbsp;5f&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first [[ionization potential]] of neptunium was measured to be at most {{val|6.19|0.12|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}} in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d;&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite journal |first1=W.

20 neptunium [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np with a [[half-life]] of 2.14 million years, &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Np with a half-life of 154,000 years, and &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;Np with a half-life of 396.1 days.  All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 4.5 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 50 minutes.

The isotopes of neptunium range in [[atomic weight]] from 225.0339 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;225&lt;/sup&gt;Np) to 244.068 u (&lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Np).&lt;ref name=unc/&gt; Most of the isotopes that are lighter than the most stable one, &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np, [[radioactive decay|decay]] primarily by [[electron capture]] although a sizable number, most notably &lt;sup&gt;229&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Np, also exhibit various levels of decay via [[alpha emission]] to become [[protactinium]]. &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np itself, being the [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-stable isobar]] of mass number 237, decays almost exclusively by alpha emission into &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of protactinium|Pa]], with very rare (occurring only about once in trillions of decays) [[spontaneous fission]] and [[cluster decay]] (emission of &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;Mg to form &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Tl).

===Occurrence===
Since all isotopes of neptunium have half-lives that are many times shorter than the [[age of the Earth]], any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of its original amount;&lt;ref name=Yoshida704&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 703–4.&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the whole Earth had initially been made of pure &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its [[critical mass]] of 60&amp;nbsp;kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the [[formation of the Solar System]], and thus all of it would have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.&lt;ref name="Himiya neptuniya"/&gt;

[[Trace radioisotope|Trace]] amounts of the neptunium isotopes neptunium-237 and -239 are found naturally as [[decay product]]s from  [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] reactions in [[uranium ore]]s.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=emsley345347&gt;Emsley, pp. 345–347.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np are the most common of these isotopes; they are directly formed from [[neutron capture]] by uranium-238 atoms. These neutrons come from the [[spontaneous fission]] of uranium-238, naturally neutron-induced fission of uranium-235, [[cosmic ray spallation]] of nuclei, and light elements absorbing [[alpha particle]]s and emitting a neutron.&lt;ref name=Yoshida704/&gt; The half-life of &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np is very short, although the detection of its much longer-lived [[daughter product|daughter]] &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu in nature in 1951 definitively established its natural occurrence.&lt;ref name=Yoshida704/&gt; In 1952, &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np was identified and isolated from concentrates of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]]: in these minerals, the ratio of neptunium-237 to uranium is less than or equal to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.&lt;ref name=Yoshida704/&gt;&lt;ref name="thompson1to4"&gt;

Most neptunium (and plutonium) now encountered in the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the [[Trinity test|first atomic bomb]] in 1945 and the ratification of the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. The total amount of neptunium released by these explosions and the few atmospheric tests that have been carried out since 1963 is estimated to be around 2500&amp;nbsp;kg. The overwhelming majority of this is composed of the long-lived isotopes &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np since even the moderately long-lived &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;Np (half-life 396&amp;nbsp;days) would have decayed to less than one-billionth (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;) its original concentration over the intervening decades. An additional very small amount of neptunium, created by neutron irradiation of natural uranium in nuclear reactor cooling water, is released when the water is discharged into rivers or lakes.&lt;ref name=Yoshida704/&gt;&lt;ref name=thompson1to4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foster |first=R. F. |title=Environmental behavior of chromium and neptunium ''in'' Radioecology |date=1963 |publisher=Reinhold |location=New York |pages=569–576}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np in seawater is approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel (unit)|millibecquerels]] per [[liter]]: this concentration is between 0.1% and 1% that of plutonium.&lt;ref name=Yoshida704/&gt;

Once in the environment, neptunium generally [[oxidation|oxidizes]] fairly quickly, usually to the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits a much greater mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times as well as the other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no [[carbonate]]s present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with [[quartz]]. It has also been observed to bond well with [[goethite]], [[ferric oxide]] colloids, and several clays including [[kaolinite]] and [[smectite]]. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility.&lt;ref name=thompson1to4/&gt;&lt;ref name=atwood4&gt;Atwood, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building [[nuclear waste]] storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is [[Redox|reduced]] to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by [[humic acid]] if it is present on the surface of goethite, [[hematite]], and [[magnetite]]. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by [[tuff]], [[granodiorite]], and [[bentonite]]; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to [[colloid|colloidal particulates]], an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.&lt;ref name=thompson1to4/&gt;&lt;ref name=atwood4/&gt;&lt;ref name="atwood1"&gt;Atwood, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hpschapters.org/northcarolina/NSDS/neptunium.pdf| title=Human Health Fact Sheet - Neptunium| publisher=Health Physics Society| date=2001| accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background and early claims===
[[File:Mendelejevs periodiska system 1871.png|thumb|right|upright=2.25|alt=a table with a typical cell containing a two-letter symbol and a number|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]'s table of 1871, with an empty space at the position after uranium]]
When the first [[periodic table]] of the elements was published by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] in the early 1870s, it showed a "&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;" in place after uranium similar to several other places for then-undiscovered elements. Other subsequent tables of known elements, including a 1913 publication of the known radioactive isotopes by [[Kasimir Fajans]], also show an empty place after uranium, element 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fajans | first1 = Kasimir | title = Die radioaktiven Umwandlungen und das periodische System der Elemente (Radioactive Transformations and the Periodic Table of the Elements) | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft (German Chemical Society Reports) | volume = 46 | pages = 422–439 | date = 1913 | doi = 10.1002/cber.19130460162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to and after the discovery of the final component of the atomic nucleus, the [[neutron]] in 1932, most scientists did not seriously consider the possibility of elements heavier than uranium. While nuclear theory at the time did not explicitly prohibit their existence, there was little evidence to suggest that they did. However, the discovery of [[induced radioactivity]] by [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] in late 1933 opened up an entirely new method of researching the elements and inspired a small group of Italian scientists led by [[Enrico Fermi]] to begin a series of experiments involving neutron bombardment. Although the Joliot-Curies' experiment involved bombarding a sample of &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of aluminium|Al]] with [[alpha particle]]s to produce the radioactive &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of phosphorus|P]], Fermi realized that using neutrons, which have no electrical charge, would most likely produce even better results than the positively charged alpha particles. Accordingly, in March 1934 he began systematically subjecting all of the then-known elements to neutron bombardment to determine whether others could also be induced to radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months of work, Fermi's group had tentatively determined that lighter elements would disperse the energy of the captured neutron by emitting a [[proton]] or [[alpha particle]] and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a [[gamma ray]]. This latter behavior would later result in the [[beta decay]] of a neutron into a proton, thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table. When Fermi's team bombarded uranium, they observed this behavior as well, which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an [[atomic number]] of 93. Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim, but after his team observed several unknown half-lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope, he published a paper entitled ''Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92'' in June 1934. In it he proposed the name [[ausonium]] (atomic symbol Ao) for element 93, after the Greek name ''Ausonia'' (Italy).&lt;ref name="Fermi"&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1038/133898a0 | title =Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 | date =1934 | author =Fermi, E. | journal =Nature | volume =133 | pages =898–899 | bibcode=1934Natur.133..898F | issue =3372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theoretical objections to the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom [[Neutron capture|captured a neutron]] was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt in the minds of many scientists, notably [[Aristid von Grosse]] and [[Ida Noddack]], that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing [[protactinium]] (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory did not include a way for this to be possible. Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, pp. 120–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ida Noddack|authorlink=Ida Noddack|date=1934|pages=653–655|title=Über das Element 93|volume=47|journal=Zeitschrift für Angewandte Chemie|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Noddack-1934.html|doi=10.1002/ange.19340473707|issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, pp. 210–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rhenium single crystal bar and 1cm3 cube.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|left|[[Rhenium]]. For a long time, chemists thought that element 93 would be [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] to rhenium, making the discovery and identification of neptunium nearly impossible.]]
Although the many different and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]] who were among the best radiochemists in the world at the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the [[actinide series]]. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the [[group 7 element]]s, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much rarer, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that [[plutonium]] and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the [[f-block]], the actinide series was firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the question of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer [[Odolen Koblic]] in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated [[pitchblende]]. He proposed the name [[bohemium]] for the element, but after being analyzed it turned out that the sample was a mixture of [[tungsten]] and [[vanadium]].&lt;ref name="Koblic"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Odolen | last = Koblic | doi =10.1038/134055b0 | title =A New Radioactive Element beyond Uranium | date =1934 | journal =Nature | volume =134 | pages =55 | issue=3376|bibcode = 1934Natur.134R..55. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1126/science.80.2086.588-a | title =Bohemium - An Obituary | date =1934 | author =Speter, M. | journal =Science | volume =80 | pages =588–9 | pmid =17798409 | issue =2086|bibcode = 1934Sci....80..588S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist [[Horia Hulubei]] and French chemist [[Yvette Cauchois]], claimed to have discovered the new element via [[spectroscopy]] in minerals. They named their element [[sequanium]], but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.&lt;ref name=emsley345347/&gt;&lt;ref name="fontani"&gt;{{cite conference| first = Marco| last = Fontani| title = The Twilight of the Naturally-Occurring Elements: Moldavium (Ml), Sequanium (Sq) and Dor (Do)| booktitle = International Conference on the History of Chemistry| pages = 1–8| date = 2005| location = Lisbon| url = http://5ichc-portugal.ulusofona.pt/uploads/PaperLong-MarcoFontani.doc| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224090117/http://5ichc-portugal.ulusofona.pt/uploads/PaperLong-MarcoFontani.doc| archivedate=2006-02-24| accessdate = 2013-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Nouvelles recherches sur l'élément 93 naturel|first = H.|last = Hulubei|author2=Cauchois, Y.|journal = Comptes Rendus|date = 1939|volume = 209|pages = 476–479|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3161s.image.f478.langFR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Peppard | first1 = D.

Although by 1938 some scientists, including [[Niels Bohr]], were still reluctant to accept that Fermi had actually produced a new element, he was nevertheless awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in November 1938 "''for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons''". A month later, the almost totally unexpected discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by Hahn, Meitner, and [[Otto Frisch]] put an end to the possibility that Fermi had discovered element 93 because most of the unknown half-lives that had been observed by Fermi's team were rapidly identified as [[fission products]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, pp. 264–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1938 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1938/index.html |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meitner|first1=Lise|last2=Frisch|first2=O.

Perhaps the closest of all attempts to produce the missing element 93 was that conducted by the Japanese physicist [[Yoshio Nishina]] working with chemist [[Kenjiro Kimura]] in 1940, just before the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in 1941: they bombarded [[uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]] with fast neutrons. However, while slow neutrons tend to induce neutron capture through a (n, γ) reaction, fast neutrons tend to induce a "knock-out" (n, 2n) reaction, where one neutron is added and two more are removed, resulting in the net loss of a neutron. Nishina and Kimura, having tested this technique on &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;[[thorium|Th]] and successfully produced the known &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Th and its long-lived beta decay daughter &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;[[protactinium|Pa]] (both occurring in the natural decay chain of [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]]), therefore correctly assigned the new 6.75-day half-life activity they observed to the new isotope &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;U. They confirmed that this isotope was also a beta emitter and must hence decay to the unknown nuclide &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;93. They attempted to isolate this nuclide by carrying it with its supposed lighter congener rhenium, but no beta or alpha decay was observed from the rhenium-containing fraction: Nishina and Kimura thus correctly speculated that the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;93, like that of &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa, was very long and hence its activity would be so weak as to be unmeasurable by their equipment, thus concluding the last and closest unsuccessful search for transuranic elements.&lt;ref name=Ikeda&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ikeda |first1=Nagao |date=25 July 2011 |title=The discoveries of uranium 237 and symmetric fission — From the archival papers of Nishina and Kimura |journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B: Physical and Biological Sciences |volume=87 |issue=7 |pages=371–6 |doi=10.2183/pjab.87.371 |bibcode=2011PJAB...87..371I |pmc=3171289 |pmid=21785255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|right|upright|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939|alt=Black-and-white picture of heavy machinery with two operators sitting aside]]
As research on nuclear fission progressed in early 1939, [[Edwin McMillan]] at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] decided to run an experiment bombarding uranium using the powerful 60-inch (1.52 m) [[cyclotron]] that had recently been built at the university. The purpose was to separate the various fission products produced by the bombardment by exploiting the enormous force that the fragments gain from their mutual electrical repulsion after fissioning. Although he did not discover anything of note from this, McMillan did observe two new beta decay half-lives in the uranium trioxide target itself, which meant that whatever was producing the radioactivity had not violently repelled each other like normal fission products. He quickly realized that one of the half-lives closely matched the known 23-minute decay period of uranium-239, but the other half-life of 2.3 days was unknown. McMillan took the results of his experiment to chemist and fellow Berkeley professor [[Emilio Segrè]] to attempt to isolate the source of the radioactivity. Both scientists began their work using the prevailing theory that element 93 would have similar chemistry to rhenium, but Segrè rapidly determined that McMillan's sample was not at all similar to rhenium. Instead, when he reacted it with [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF) with a strong [[oxidizing agent]] present, it behaved much like members of the [[rare earths]]. Since these elements comprise a large percentage of fission products, Segrè and McMillan decided that the half-life must have been simply another fission product, titling the paper "An Unsuccessful Search for Transuranium Elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Segrè| first1=Emilio| title=An Unsuccessful Search for Transuranium Elements| date=1939| pages=1104–5|  journal=Physical Review|volume=55| issue=11|bibcode = 1939PhRv...55.1104S |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.55.1104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, pp. 346–350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 699–700.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as more information about fission became available, the possibility that the fragments of nuclear fission could still have been present in the target became more remote. McMillan and several scientists, including [[Philip H. Abelson]], attempted again to determine what was producing the unknown half-life. In early 1940, McMillan realized that his 1939 experiment with Segrè had failed to test the chemical reactions of the radioactive source with sufficient rigor. In a new experiment, McMillan tried subjecting the unknown substance to HF in the presence of a [[reducing agent]], something he had not done before. This reaction resulted in the sample [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] with the HF, an action that definitively ruled out the possibility that the unknown substance was a rare earth. 
Shortly after this, Abelson, who had received his [[Doctor of Science|graduate degree]] from the university, visited Berkeley for a short vacation and McMillan asked the more able chemist to assist with the separation of the experiment's results. Abelson very quickly observed that whatever was producing the 2.3-day half-life did not have chemistry like any known element and was actually more similar to uranium than a rare earth. This discovery finally allowed the source to be isolated and later, in 1945, led to the classification of the [[actinide series]]. As a final step, McMillan and Abelson prepared a much larger sample of bombarded uranium that had a prominent 23-minute half-life from &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;U and demonstrated conclusively that the unknown 2.3-day half-life increased in strength in concert with a decrease in the 23-minute activity through the following reaction:&lt;ref name="EL93"/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;{^{238}_{92}U} + {^{1}_{0}n} -&gt; {^{239}_{92}U} -&gt;[\beta^-][23\ \ce{min}] {^{239}_{93}Np} -&gt;[\beta^-][2.355\ \ce{days}] {^{239}_{94}Pu}&lt;/chem&gt; &lt;small&gt;''(The times are [[half-life|half-lives]].)''&lt;/small&gt;

This proved that the unknown radioactive source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled ''Radioactive Element 93'' in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' on May 27, 1940.&lt;ref name="EL93"&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1103/PhysRev.57.1185.2| title =Radioactive Element 93| date =1940| author =Mcmillan, Edwin| journal =Physical Review| volume =57| pages =1185–1186| last2 =Abelson| first2 =Philip| issue =12|bibcode = 1940PhRv...57.1185M }}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not propose a name for the element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name ''neptunium'' since [[Neptune]] is the next planet beyond [[Uranus]] in our solar system.&lt;ref name="lanl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths|volume=18 – Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry|editor=K.

===Subsequent developments===
[[File:Neptune Full.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The planet [[Neptune]], after which neptunium is named]]
It was also realized that the beta decay of &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called [[plutonium]]), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = David L.|last1 = Clark|first2 = Siegfried S.|last2 = Hecker|first3 = Gordon D.|last3 = Jarvinen|first4 = Mary P.|last4=Neu|contribution = Neptunium|title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements|editor1-first = Lester R.|editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.|editor2-last = Edelstein|editor3-first = Jean|editor3-last = Fuger|edition = 3rd|date = 2006|volume = 3|publisher = Springer|location = Dordrecht, the Netherlands|page = 814|url = http://radchem.nevada.edu/classes/rdch710/files/plutonium.pdf|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-3598-5_7|isbn = 978-1-4020-3555-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of plutonium had to wait until the end of 1940, when [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] and his team identified the isotope [[plutonium-238]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The plutonium story|author=Glenn T. Seaborg |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California |id=LBL-13492, DE82 004551 |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/5808140-l5UMe1/|date=September 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neptunium's unique radioactive characteristics allowed it to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions, at first this was the only method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements. As the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half-life, McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology that was then available. However, after the discovery of the long-lived &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np isotope in 1942 by [[Glenn Seaborg]] and [[Arthur Wahl]], forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor.&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt;&lt;ref name=migration/&gt; Its half-life was initially determined to be about 3&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years (later revised to 2.144&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years), confirming the predictions of Nishina and Kimura of a very long half-life.&lt;ref name=Ikeda/&gt;

Early research into the element was somewhat limited because most of the nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. Research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944.&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt;&lt;ref name=migration&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1lArAAAAYAAJ | title = Radiochemistry of neptunium | author1 = Burney, G.

Much of the research into the properties of neptunium since then has been focused on understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations is considered to be a waste product.&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt;&lt;ref name=migration/&gt;

==Production==

===Synthesis===
The vast majority of the neptunium that currently exists on Earth was produced in artificial nuclear reactions. Neptunium-237 is the most commonly synthesized isotope due to it being the only one that both can be created via [[neutron capture]] and also has a half-lifelong enough to allow weighable quantities to be easily isolated. As such, it is by far the most common isotope to be utilized in chemical studies of the element.&lt;ref name=Yoshida702&gt;Yoshida et al., p. 700–2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* When an [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] atom captures a neutron, it is converted to an excited state of [[Uranium-236|&lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U]]. About 81% of the excited &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U nuclei undergo fission, but the remainder decay to the ground state of &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;U by emitting [[gamma radiation]]. Further neutron capture creates &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;U which has a half-life of 7 days and quickly decays to &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np through [[beta decay]].  During beta decay, the excited &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;U emits an electron, while the atomic [[weak interaction]] converts a [[neutron]] to a [[proton]], thus creating &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np.&lt;ref name=Yoshida702/&gt;

::&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{cases}
\ce{^{235}_{92}U + ^{1}_{0}n -&gt; ^{236}_{92}U_m -&gt;[][120 \ \ce{ns}] ^{236}_{92}U + \gamma}\\
\ce{^{236}_{92}U + ^{1}_{0}n -&gt; ^{237}_{92}U -&gt;[\beta^-][6.75 \ \ce{d}] ^{237}_{93}Np}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;U is also produced via an ([[neutron|n]],2n) reaction with [[Uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]]. This only happens with very energetic neutrons.&lt;ref name=Yoshida702/&gt;
* &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np is the product of [[alpha decay]] of [[Americium-241|&lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am]], which is produced through neutron irradiation of [[uranium-238]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida702/&gt;

Heavier isotopes of neptunium decay quickly, and lighter isotopes of neptunium cannot be produced by neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled [[spent nuclear fuel]] gives nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np.&lt;ref name=Yoshida702/&gt; The short-lived heavier isotopes &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np, useful as [[radioactive tracer]]s, are produced through neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter isotopes &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Np are produced through irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U with [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s in a [[cyclotron]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida702/&gt;

Artificial &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np metal is usually isolated through a reaction of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;NpF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with liquid [[barium]] or [[lithium]] at around  1200 °[[Celsius|C]] and is most often extracted from spent [[nuclear fuel rod]]s in  kilogram amounts as a by-product in [[plutonium]] production.&lt;ref name=emsley345347/&gt;

:2 NpF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Ba → 2 Np + 3 BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

By weight, neptunium-237 discharges are about 5% as great as plutonium discharges and about 0.05% of [[spent nuclear fuel]] discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| format=PDF| url = http://www.isis-online.org/publications/fmct/book/New%20chapter%205.pdf| title = Separated Neptunium 237 and Americium| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even this fraction still amounts to more than fifty tons per year globally.&lt;ref name="rsc"&gt;http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/interactive_periodic_table_transcripts/neptunium.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purification methods===
Recovering uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel for reuse is one of the major processes of the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. As it has a long half-life of just over 2&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;years, the [[alpha decay|alpha emitter]] &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np is one of the major isotopes of the [[minor actinide]]s separated from spent nuclear fuel.&lt;ref name=Yoshida7045&gt;Yodshida et al., pp. 704–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium, operating on small and large scales. The small-scale purification operations have the goals of preparing pure neptunium as a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of metallic neptunium and its compounds, and also to isolate and preconcentrate neptunium in samples for analysis.&lt;ref name=Yoshida7045/&gt;

Most methods that separate neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium (from +3 to +6 or sometimes even +7) in solution.&lt;ref name=Yoshida7045/&gt; Among the methods that are or have been used are: solvent [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] (using various [[extractant]]s, usually [[denticity|multidentate]] β-diketone derivatives, [[organophosphorus compound]]s, and [[amine]] compounds), [[chromatography]] using various [[ion exchange|ion-exchange]] or [[chelation|chelating]] resins, [[coprecipitation]] (possible [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrices]] include [[lanthanum(III) fluoride|LaF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[bismuth phosphate|BiPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[barium sulfate|BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[iron(III) hydroxide|Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[manganese(IV) oxide|MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[electroplating|electrodeposition]], and [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] methods.&lt;ref name=Yoshida70517&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 705–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with [[tributyl phosphate]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida710&gt;Yoshida et al., p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry and compounds==

===Solution chemistry===
[[File:Np ox st.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Neptunium ions in solution]]
When it is in an aqueous solution, neptunium can exist in any of its five possible oxidation states (+3 to +7) and each of these show a characteristic color. The stability of each oxidation state is strongly dependent on various factors, such as the presence of [[oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] or [[reducing agent]]s, [[pH]] of the solution, presence of [[coordination complex]]-forming [[ligand]]s, and even the concentration of neptunium in the solution.&lt;ref name=Yoshida753&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 752–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[acid (chemistry)|acidic]] solutions, the neptunium(III) to neptunium(VII) ions exist as Np&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Np&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{chem|NpO|2|+}}, {{chem|NpO|2|2+}}, and {{chem|NpO|3|+}}. In [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solutions, they exist as the oxides and hydroxides Np(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{chem|NpO|5|3-}}. Not as much work has been done to characterize neptunium in basic solutions.&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; Np&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Np&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; can easily be reduced and oxidized to each other, as can {{chem|NpO|2|+}} and {{chem|NpO|2|2+}}.&lt;ref name=Yoshida759&gt;Yoshida et al., p. 759.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is the second-least easily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] neptunium ion in water, forming the NpOH&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt; Np&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is the predominant neptunium ion in solutions of pH&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768&gt;Yoshida et al., p. 766–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Neptunium(IV)
Np(IV) or Np&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; is pale yellow-green in acidic solutions,&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt; where it exists as hydrated complexes ({{chem|Np|(H|2|O|)|''n''|4+}}). It is quite unstable to hydrolysis in acidic aqueous solutions at pH&amp;nbsp;1 and above, forming NpOH&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt; In basic solutions, Np&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; tends to hydrolyze to form the neutral neptunium(IV) hydroxide (Np(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and neptunium(IV) oxide (NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;

;Neptunium(V)
Np(V) or {{chem|NpO|2|+}} is green-blue in aqueous solution,&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt; in which it behaves as a strong [[Lewis acid]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; It is a stable ion&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; and is the most common form of neptunium in aqueous solutions. Unlike its neighboring homologues {{chem|UO|2|+}} and {{chem|PuO|2|+}}, {{chem|NpO|2|+}} does not spontaneously [[disproportionation|disproportionate]] except at very low pH and high concentration:&lt;ref name=Yoshida759/&gt;

:2 {{chem|NpO|2|+}} + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ Np&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|NpO|2|2+}} + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

It hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and {{chem|NpO|2|(OH)|2|-}}.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;

;Neptunium(VI)
Np(VI) or {{chem|NpO|2|2+}}, the neptunyl ion, shows a light pink or reddish color in an acidic solution and yellow-green otherwise.&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt; It is a strong Lewis acid&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; and is the main neptunium ion encountered in solutions of pH&amp;nbsp;3–4.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt; Though stable in acidic solutions, it is quite easily reduced to the Np(V) ion,&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; and it is not as stable as the homologous hexavalent ions of its neighbours uranium and plutonium (the [[uranyl]] and plutonyl ions). It hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form the oxo and hydroxo ions NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, {{chem|(NpO|2|)|2|(OH)|2|2+}}, and {{chem|(NpO|2|)|3|(OH)|5|+}}.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;

;Neptunium(VII)
Np(VII) is dark green in a strongly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] solution. Though its [[chemical formula]] in basic solution is frequently cited as {{chem|NpO|5|3-}}, this is a simplification and the real structure is probably closer to a hydroxo species like {{chem|[NpO|4|(OH)|2|]|3-}}.&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; Np(VII) was first prepared in basic solution in 1967.&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; In strongly [[acid (chemistry)|acidic]] solution, Np(VII) is found as {{chem|NpO|3|+}}; water quickly reduces this to Np(VI).&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt; Its hydrolysis products are uncharacterized.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;

===Hydroxides===
The oxides and hydroxides of neptunium are closely related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as [[thorium]] and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida753/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;

Neptunium(III) hydroxide is quite stable in acidic solutions and in environments that lack oxygen, but it will rapidly oxidize to the IV state in the presence of air. It is not soluble in water.&lt;ref name=migration/&gt; Np(IV) hydroxides exist mainly as the electrically neutral Np(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its mild solubility in water is not affected at all by the pH of the solution. This suggests that the other Np(IV) hydroxide, {{chem|Np|(OH)|5|-}}, does not have a significant presence.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trygve E Eriksen |display-authors=4 |author2=Pierre Ndalamba |author3=Daqing Cui |author4=Jordi Bruno |author5=Marco Caceci |author6=Kastriot Spahiu |date=1993 |title=Solubility of the redox-sensitive radionuclides &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc and &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np under reducing conditions in neutral to alkaline solutions. |journal=SKB Technical Report |volume=93-18 | pages=1–32 |url=http://www.skb.se/upload/publications/pdf/TR93-18webb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Np(V) ion {{chem|NpO|2|+}} is very stable, it can only form a hydroxide in high acidity levels. When placed in a 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[molar concentration|M]] [[sodium perchlorate]] solution, it does not react significantly for a period of months, although a higher molar concentration of 3.0&amp;nbsp;M will result in it reacting to the solid hydroxide NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH almost immediately. Np(VI) hydroxide is more reactive but it is still fairly stable in acidic solutions. It will form the compound NpO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;· H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the presence of [[ozone]] under various [[carbon dioxide]] pressures. Np(VII) has not been well-studied and no neutral hydroxides have been reported. It probably exists mostly as {{chem|[NpO|4|(OH)|2|]|3-}}.&lt;ref name=Yoshida768/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neck, V. |author2=Kim, J.

===Oxides===
Three anhydrous neptunium oxides have been reported, [[neptunium(IV) oxide|NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and Np&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, though some studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fahey, J. A. |author2=Turcotte, R. P. |author3=Chikalla, T. D.  |date=1976 |title=Decomposition, stoichiometry and structure of neptunium oxides |journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=495–500 |doi=10.1016/0022-1902(76)80291-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; have stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting that claims of Np&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. However, as the full extent of the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched, it is not certain which of these claims is accurate. Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air.&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoshida724"&gt;Yoshida et al., 724–726.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=B.

The greenish-brown NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is very stable over a large range of pressures and temperatures and does not undergo phase transitions at low temperatures. It does show a phase transition from face-centered cubic to orthorhombic at around 33-37GPa, although it returns to is original phase when pressure is released. It remains stable under oxygen pressures up to 2.84 MPa and temperatures up to 400&amp;nbsp;°C.  
Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is black-brown in color and [[monoclinic]] with a lattice size of 418×658×409&amp;nbsp;picometres. It is relatively unstable and decomposes to NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 420-695&amp;nbsp;°C. Although Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium [[peroxide]] to 300-350&amp;nbsp;°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an [[ampoule]] at 180&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Yoshida724"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richteretal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benedict, U. |author2=Dabos, S. |author3=Dufour, C. |author4=Spirelet, J.

Neptunium also forms a large number of oxide compounds with a wide variety of elements, although the neptunate oxides formed with [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metals]] have been by far the most studied. Ternary neptunium oxides are generally formed by reacting NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the oxide of another element or by precipitating from an alkaline solution. [[Lithium|Li]]&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has been prepared by reacting Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 400&amp;nbsp;°C for 16 hours or by reacting Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with NpO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; · H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at 400&amp;nbsp;°C for 16 hours in a quartz tube and flowing oxygen. Alkali neptunate compounds [[Potassium|K]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Caesium|Cs]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Rubidium|Rb]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are all created by a similar reaction: 
:NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 MO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;#8594; M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(M = K, Cs, Rb)

The oxide compounds KNpO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CsNpO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and RbNpO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are formed by reacting Np(VII) ({{chem|[NpO|4|(OH)|2|]|3-}}) with a compound of the alkali metal [[nitrate]] and [[ozone]]. Additional compounds have been produced by reacting NpO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and water with solid alkali and alkaline [[peroxide]]s at temperatures of 400 - 600&amp;nbsp;°C for 15–30 hours. Some of these include Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Sodium|Na]]NpO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;LiNpO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, a considerable number of hexavelant neptunium oxides are formed by reacting solid-state NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with various alkali or alkaline earth oxides in an environment of flowing oxygen. Many of the resulting compounds also have an equivalent compound that substitutes uranium for neptunium. Some compounds that have been characterized include Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These can be obtained by heating different combinations of NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to various temperature thresholds and further heating will also cause these compounds to exhibit different neptunium allotropes. The lithium neptunate oxides Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained with similar reactions of NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=Yoshida728&gt;Yoshida et al, pp. 728–730.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Die reaktion der oxide der transurane mit alkalioxiden—I: Ternäre oxide der sechswertigen transurane mit lithium und natrium |author=Keller, C. |author2=Kock, L. |author3=Walter, K.

===Halides===
{{further|Neptunium hexafluoride}}
Although neptunium [[halide]] compounds have not been nearly as well studied as its oxides, a fairly large number have been successfully characterized. Of these, neptunium [[fluoride]]s have been the most extensively researched, largely because of their potential use in separating the element from nuclear waste products. Four binary neptunium fluoride compounds, Np[[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NpF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and NpF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, have been reported. The first two are fairly stable and were first prepared in 1947 through the following reactions:
:NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|1|2}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 HF &amp;#8594; NpF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(400°C)
:NpF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|1|2}} O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HF &amp;#8594; NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|1|2}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(400°C)
Later, NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained directly by heating NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to various temperatures in mixtures of either [[hydrogen fluoride]] or pure fluorine gas. NpF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is much more difficult to create and most known preparation methods involve reacting NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or NpF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compounds with various other fluoride compounds. NpF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; will decompose into NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NpF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; when heated to around 320&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fried, N. R.

NpF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or [[neptunium hexafluoride]] is extremely volatile, as are its adjacent actinide compounds [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[plutonium hexafluoride]] (PuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). This volatility has attracted a large amount of interest to the compound in an attempt to devise a simple method for extracting neptunium from spent nuclear power station fuel rods. NpF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was first prepared in 1943 by reacting NpF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and gaseous fluorine at very high temperatures and the first bulk quantities were obtained in 1958 by heating NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and dripping pure fluorine on it in a specially prepared apparatus. Additional methods that have successfully produced neptunium hexafluoride include reacting [[bromine trifluoride|BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[bromine pentafluoride|BrF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] with NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and by reacting several different neptunium oxide and fluoride compounds with anhydrous hydrogen fluorides.&lt;ref name=Yoshida730/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G.

Two neptunium [[chloride]]s, Np[[chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NpCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, have been characterized. Although several attempts to create NpCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; have been made, they have not been successful. NpCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and [[carbon tetrachloride]] ([[carbon|C]]Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and NpCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at around 500&amp;nbsp;°C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NpCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaNpCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Neptunium [[bromide]]s Np[[bromine|Br]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NpBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have also been created; the latter by reacting [[aluminium bromide]] with NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 350&amp;nbsp;°C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with [[zinc]] present. The neptunium [[iodide]] Np[[iodine|I]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has also been prepared by the same method as NpBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Yoshida736&gt;Yoshida et al, pp. 736–738.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fried, S. and Davidson, N.

===Chalcogenides, pnictides, and carbides===
Neptunium [[chalcogen]] and [[pnictogen]] compounds have been well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in the natural environment. Pnictide and [[carbide]] compounds have also attracted interest because of their presence in the fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs, although the latter group has not had nearly as much research as the former.&lt;ref name=Yoshida739&gt;Yoshida et al, pp. 739–742.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chalcogenides
A wide variety of neptunium [[sulfide]] compounds have been characterized, including the pure sulfide compounds Np[[sulfur|S]], NpS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Of these, Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, prepared by reacting NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[carbon disulfide]] at around 1000&amp;nbsp;°C, is the most well-studied and three allotropic forms are known. The α form exists up to around 1230&amp;nbsp;°C, the β up to 1530&amp;nbsp;°C, and the γ form, which can also exist as Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, at higher temperatures. NpS can be created by reacting Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and neptunium metal at 1600&amp;nbsp;°C and Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can be prepared by the decomposition of Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at 500&amp;nbsp;°C or by reacting sulfur and neptunium hydride at 650&amp;nbsp;°C. Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is made by heating a mixture of Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and pure sulfur to 500&amp;nbsp;°C. All of the neptunium sulfides except for the β and γ forms of Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[isostructural]] with the equivalent uranium sulfide and several, including NpS, α−Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and β−Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are also isostructural with the equivalent plutonium sulfide. The oxysulfides NpOS, Np&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S, and Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S have also been created, although the latter three have not been well studied. NpOS was first prepared in 1985 by vacuum sealing NpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and pure sulfur in a quartz tube and heating it to 900&amp;nbsp;°C for one week.&lt;ref name=Yoshida739/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcon, J.

Neptunium [[selenide]] compounds that have been reported include Np[[selenium|Se]], NpSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

;Pnictides and carbides
Neptunium [[nitride]] (Np[[nitrogen|N]]) was first prepared in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and [[ammonia]] gas at around 750&amp;nbsp;°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it was produced by reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] nitrogen gas at 1550&amp;nbsp;°C. NpN is [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isomorphous]] with [[Uranium nitride|uranium mononitride]] (UN) and [[Plutonium nitride|plutonium mononitride]] (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830&amp;nbsp;°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium [[phosphide]] compounds have been reported, Np[[phosphorus|P]] and Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with [[phosphine]] gas at 350&amp;nbsp;°C. Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be created by reacting neptunium metal with [[red phosphorus]] at 740&amp;nbsp;°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with [[nitric acid]] to produce Np(IV) solution.&lt;ref name=Yoshida742&gt;Yoshida et al, pp. 742–744.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fried1953"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sheft, I. |author2=Fried, S. |date=1953 |title=Neptunium Compounds  |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=75 |issue=5 | pages=1236–7 |doi=10.1021/ja01101a067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Olson, W.

Three neptunium [[arsenide]] compounds have been prepared, Np[[arsenic|As]], NpAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube for about a week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639&amp;nbsp;°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615&amp;nbsp;°C. Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a [[Chemical transport reaction|transporting agent]]. NpAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals are brownish gold and Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is black. The neptunium [[antimonide]] compound Np[[antimony|Sb]] was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Other inorganic===
;Hydrides
Neptunium reacts with [[hydrogen]] in a similar manner to its neighbor plutonium, forming the [[hydride]]s NpH&lt;sub&gt;2+''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ([[face-centered cubic]]) and NpH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]). These are [[isostructural]] with the corresponding plutonium hydrides, although unlike PuH&lt;sub&gt;2+''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[lattice parameter]]s of NpH&lt;sub&gt;2+''x''&lt;/sub&gt; become greater as the hydrogen content (''x'') increases. The hydrides require extreme care in handling as they decompose in a vacuum at 300&amp;nbsp;°C to form finely divided neptunium metal, which is [[pyrophoric]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida722&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 722–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Phosphates, sulfates, and carbonates
Being chemically stable, neptunium [[phosphate]]s have been investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and [[boron phosphate]] at 1100&amp;nbsp;°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where M is an [[alkali metal]] ([[lithium|Li]], [[sodium|Na]], [[potassium|K]], [[rubidium|Rb]], or [[caesium|Cs]]), are all known. Some neptunium [[sulfate]]s have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium [[carbonate]]s have been investigated to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of neptunium in [[geological repository|geological repositories]] and the environment, where it may come into contact with carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.&lt;ref&gt;Lemire et al., pp. 177–180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshida744&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 744–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic===

A few organoneptunium compounds are known and chemically characterized, although not as many as for [[organouranium compound|uranium]] due to neptunium's scarcity and radioactivity. The most well known organoneptunium compounds are the [[cyclopentadienyl]] and [[cyclooctatetraenyl]] compounds and their derivatives.&lt;ref name=Yoshida750&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 750–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The trivalent cyclopentadienyl compound Np(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·[[tetrahydrofuran|THF]] was obtained in 1972 from reacting Np(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl with [[sodium]], although the simpler Np(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) could not be obtained.&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt; Tetravalent neptunium cyclopentadienyl, a reddish-brown complex, was synthesized in 1968 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with potassium cyclopentadienide:&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt;

:NpCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4&amp;nbsp;KC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Np(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4&amp;nbsp;KCl

It is soluble in [[benzene]] and [[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]], and is less sensitive to [[oxygen]] and water than [[plutonium|Pu]](C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [[americium|Am]](C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt; Other Np(IV) cyclopentadienyl compounds are known for many [[ligand]]s: they have the general formula (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NpL, where L represents a ligand.&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt;
[[Neptunocene]], Np(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was synthesized in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;). It is [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isomorphous]] to [[uranocene]] and [[plutonocene]], and they behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but are sensitive to air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and [[toluene]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt; Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R = [[ethanol]], [[butanol]]) and KNp(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound.&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt; In addition, neptunium [[hydrocarbyl]]s have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.&lt;ref name=Yoshida750/&gt;

===Coordination complexes===
There is much interest in the [[coordination chemistry]] of neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the [[actinide contraction]] (the greater-than-expected decrease in [[ionic radii]] across the actinide series, analogous to the [[lanthanide contraction]]).&lt;ref name=Yoshida745&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 745–750.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solid state====
Few neptunium(III) coordination compounds are known, because Np(III) is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen while in aqueous solution. However, [[sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate]] can reduce Np(IV) to Np(III), stabilizing the lower oxidation state and forming various sparingly soluble Np(III) coordination complexes, such as {{chem|Np|2|(C|2|O|4|)|3}}·11H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, {{chem|Np|2|(C|6|H|5|AsO|3|)|3}}·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and {{chem|Np|2|[C|6|H|4|(OH)COO]|3}}.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt;

Many neptunium(IV) coordination compounds have been reported, the first one being {{chem|(Et|4|N)Np(NCS)|8}}, which is isostructural with the analogous uranium(IV) coordination compound.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt; Other Np(IV) coordination compounds are known, some involving other metals such as [[cobalt]] ({{chem|CoNp|2|F|10}}·8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, formed at 400&amp;nbsp;K) and [[copper]] ({{chem|CuNp|2|F|10}}·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, formed at 600&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt; Complex nitrate compounds are also known: the experimenters who produced them in 1986 and 1987 produced single crystals by slow evaporation of the Np(IV) solution at ambient temperature in concentrated [[nitric acid]] and excess 2,2′-[[pyrimidine]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt;

The coordination chemistry of neptunium(V) has been extensively researched due to the presence of [[cation–cation interaction]]s in the solid state, which had been already known for [[actinyl]] ions.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt; Some known such compounds include the neptunyl [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] {{chem|Na|4|(NpO|4|)|2|C|12|O|12}}·8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and neptunium glycolate, both of which form green crystals.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt;

Neptunium(VI) compounds range from the simple oxalate {{chem|NpO|2|C|2|O|4}} (which is unstable, usually becoming Np(IV)) to such complicated compounds as the green {{chem|(NH|4|)|4|NpO|2|(CO|3|)|3}}.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt; Extensive study has been performed on compounds of the form {{chem|M|4|AnO|2|(CO|3|)|3}}, where M represents a monovalent cation and An is either uranium, neptunium, or plutonium.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt;

Since 1967, when neptunium(VII) was discovered, some coordination compounds with neptunium in the +7 oxidation state have been prepared and studied. The first reported such compound was initially characterized as {{chem|Co(|NH|3|)|6|NpO|5}}·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in 1968, but was suggested in 1973 to actually have the formula {{chem|[Co(|NH|3|)|6|][NpO|4|(OH)|2|]}}·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O based on the fact that Np(VII) occurs as {{chem|[NpO|4|(OH)|2|]|3-}} in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt; This compound forms dark green prismatic crystals with maximum edge length 0.15–0.4&amp;nbsp;[[millimeter|mm]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida745/&gt;

====In aqueous solution====
Most neptunium [[coordination complex]]es known in solution involve the element in the +4, +5, and +6 oxidation states: only a few studies have been done on neptunium(III) and (VII) coordination complexes.&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 771–82.&lt;/ref&gt; For the former, NpX&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|NpX|2|+}} (X = [[chlorine|Cl]], [[bromine|Br]]) were obtained in 1966 in concentrated [[lithium chloride|LiCl]] and [[lithium bromide|LiBr]] solutions, respectively: for the latter, 1970 experiments discovered that the {{chem|NpO|2|3+}} ion could form [[sulfate]] complexes in acidic solutions, such as {{chem|NpO|2|SO|4|+}} and {{chem|NpO|2|(SO|4|)|2|-}}; these were found to have higher [[equilibrium constant|stability constants]] than the neptunyl ion ({{chem|NpO|2|2+}}).&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182/&gt; A great many complexes for the other neptunium oxidation states are known: the inorganic ligands involved are the [[halide]]s, [[iodate]], [[azide]], [[nitride]], [[nitrate]], [[thiocyanate]], [[sulfate]], [[carbonate]], [[chromate]], and [[phosphate]]. Many organic ligands are known to be able to be used in neptunium coordination complexes: they include [[acetate]], [[propionate]], [[glycolate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[oxalate]], [[malonate]], [[phthalate]], [[mellitate]], and [[citrate]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182/&gt;

Analogously to its neighbours, uranium and plutonium, the order of the neptunium ions in terms of complex formation ability is Np&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; {{chem|NpO|2|2+}} ≥ Np&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; {{chem|NpO|2|+}}. (The relative order of the middle two neptunium ions depends on the [[ligand]]s and solvents used.)&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182/&gt; The stability sequence for Np(IV), Np(V), and Np(VI) complexes with monovalent inorganic ligands is [[fluoride|F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &gt; [[dihydrogen phosphate|{{chem|H|2|PO|4|-}}]] &gt; [[thiocyanate|SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &gt; [[nitrate|{{chem|NO|3|-}}]] &gt; [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] &gt; [[perchlorate|{{chem|ClO|4|-}}]]; the order for divalent inorganic ligands is [[carbonate|{{chem|CO|3|2-}}]] &gt; [[hydrogen phosphate|{{chem|H|PO|4|2-}}]] &gt; [[sulfate|{{chem|SO|4|2-}}]]. These follow the strengths of the corresponding [[acid]]s. The divalent ligands are more strongly complexing than the monovalent ones.&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182/&gt; {{chem|NpO|2|+}} can also form the complex ions [{{chem|NpO|2|+|M|3+}}] (M = [[aluminium|Al]], [[gallium|Ga]], [[scandium|Sc]], [[indium|In]], [[iron|Fe]], [[chromium|Cr]], [[rhodium|Rh]]) in [[perchloric acid]] solution: the strength of interaction between the two cations follows the order Fe &gt; In &gt; Sc &gt; Ga &gt; Al.&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182/&gt; The neptunyl and uranyl ions can also form a complex together.&lt;ref name=Yoshida77182/&gt;

==Applications==

===Precursor in plutonium production===
An important of use of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np is as a precursor in plutonium production, where it is irradiated with neutrons to create [[Plutonium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]], an [[alpha emitter]] for [[radioisotope thermal generator]]s for spacecraft and military applications.  &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np will capture a neutron to form &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Np and [[beta decay]] with a half-life of just over two days to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.enconman.2007.10.028|pages = 393–401|title = Review of recent advances of radioisotope power systems|date = 2008|author = Lange, R|journal = Energy Conversion and Management|volume = 49|last2 = Carroll|first2 = W.|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;^{237}_{93}Np + ^{1}_{0}n -&gt; ^{238}_{93}Np -&gt;[\beta^-][2.117 \ \ce{d}] ^{238}_{94}Pu&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu also exists in sizable quantities in [[spent nuclear fuel]] but would have to be separated from other [[isotopes of plutonium]].&lt;ref name=Yoshida703&gt;Yoshida et al., pp. 702–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Irradiating neptunium-237 with electron beams, provoking [[bremsstrahlung]], also produces quite pure samples of the isotope [[plutonium-236]], useful as a tracer to determine plutonium concentration in the environment.&lt;ref name=Yoshida703/&gt;

===Weapons===
Neptunium is [[fissionable]], and could theoretically be used as fuel in a [[fast neutron reactor]] or a [[nuclear weapon]], with a [[critical mass]] of around 60 kilograms.&lt;ref name="rsc" /&gt; In 1992, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] declassified the statement that neptunium-237 "can be used for a nuclear explosive device".&lt;ref name="RDD-7"&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html "Restricted Data Declassification Decisions from 1946 until Present"], accessed Sept 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium. As of 2009, the world production of neptunium-237 by commercial power reactors was over 1000 critical masses a year, but to extract the isotope from irradiated fuel elements would be a major industrial undertaking.&lt;ref name=Nevada/&gt;

In September 2002, researchers at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] briefly created the first known nuclear [[critical mass]] using neptunium in combination with shells of [[enriched uranium]] ([[uranium-235]]), discovering that the critical mass of a bare sphere of neptunium-237 "ranges from kilogram weights in the high fifties to low sixties,"&lt;ref name="criticality"/&gt; showing that it "is about as good a bomb material as [uranium-235]."&lt;ref name="Weiss"/&gt; The United States Federal government made plans in March 2004 to move America's supply of separated neptunium to a nuclear-waste disposal site in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=Nevada/&gt;

===Physics===
&lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np is used in devices for detecting high-energy (MeV) neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page =236| title =Experimental techniques in nuclear physics| publisher =Walter de Gruyter| date = 1997| isbn =978-3-11-014467-3| name-list-format =vanc| author1 =Dorin N.

==Role in nuclear waste==
Neptunium accumulates in commercial household ionization-chamber [[smoke detector]]s from decay of the (typically) 0.2 [[microgram]] of americium-241 initially present as a source of [[ionizing radiation]]. With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in an [[smoke detector#Design|ionization smoke detector]] includes about 3% neptunium after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years.

Neptunium-237 is the most mobile [[actinide]] in the [[deep geological repository]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00818052.pdf| title= Yucca Mountain| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it and its predecessors such as [[americium-241]] candidates of interest for destruction by [[nuclear transmutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1016/S0029-5493(03)00034-7| title =Deep-Burn: making nuclear waste transmutation practical| date =2003| author =Rodriguez, C| journal =Nuclear Engineering and Design| volume =222| pages =299–317| issue =2–3| display-authors =4| last2 =Baxter| first2 =A.| last3 =McEachern| first3 =D.| last4 =Fikani| first4 =M.| last5 =Venneri| first5 =F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its long half-life, neptunium will become the major contributor of the total [[radiotoxicity]] in 10,000 years. As it is unclear what happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the neptunium would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.&lt;ref name=Nevada&gt;{{cite web|url = http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2005/11/29/getting-the-neptunium-out-of-nuclear-waste/|date =2005-11-29| title = Getting the Neptunium out of Nuclear Waste|first = Lynn|last = Yarris|publisher = Berkeley laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate = 2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-14307.pdf|title = Existing Evidence for the Fate of Neptunium in the Yucca Mountain Repository|author = J.

==Biological role and precautions==
Neptunium does not have a biological role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via the [[digestive tract]]. When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.&lt;ref name=emsley345347/&gt;

Finely divided neptunium metal presents a fire hazard because neptunium is [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.&lt;ref name=Yoshida724/&gt;

'''''Nine Maneaters And One Rogue''''' is the first book of jungle tales and [[man-eaters]] written by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]], first published in 1954 by George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.

==Dedication==
"To the memory of the jungle of the Southern India, their birds and animals, particularly [[Indian elephant|elephant]], [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] and [[Indian leopard|panther]], and their forest-people, Chensoos, Sholagas, Karumbas and Poojarees, I proudly and gratefully dedicate this book, in return for the twenty-five years of unadulterated joy they have given me in making and keeping their acquaintance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kenneth|title=Nine Man Eaters and One Rogue|year=1954|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
'''Introduction'''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson discusses the causes of man-eating in tigers and panthers, as well as possible causes of an elephant becoming [[Rogue elephant|rogue]].

'''The Maneater of Jowlagiri'''&lt;br /&gt;
A tigress turns man-eater after being wounded by a poacher in the [[Jowlagiri]] area. After the death toll reaches around fifteen, Anderson is contacted to track down the beast. Anderson has an agonizing wait sat over a human kill, followed by a lucky escape when the man-eater starts to stalk him. The man-eater is not heard of again for another five months, and when a fresh human kill is reported Anderson heads back to Jowlagiri - where he manages to lure the tigress to her death by imitating a tiger's [[mating call]].

'''The Spotted Devil of Gummlapur'''&lt;br /&gt;
Over an area of some {{convert|250|mi2}}, a man-eating leopard is responsible for some 42 human deaths. When Anderson arrives to dispatch the animal, villagers are reluctant to assist  as they believed the 'shaitan' would hear of it and hasten their death. Anderson spends his nights waiting up for the panther, first using himself as bait and then changing tact and using a dummy. On one such night he comes across a stray dog, which he keeps with him for company in his hut. The dog ends up saving his life by signalling when the panther finally arrives at Anderson's hut - in repayment Anderson takes the dog home and names him 'Nipper'.

'''The Striped Terror of Chamala Valley'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1937 a tiger is responsible for the death of seven people in the space of six months. Anderson locates the tiger by tying out baits, and though not fully equipped he decides to sit up over a kill and await the tigers return. Successfully killing the tiger, the locals help to carry it back to the village, though Anderson begins to doubt if in fact this is the correct tiger. Days later a report reaches him of a further tiger attack in the region, Anderson arrives on the scene and tracks the trail of the tiger up a dry stream bed... this time he  has found the right tiger.

'''The Hosdurga-Holalkere Man-eater'''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson recounts the cat and mouse game that ensued in the hunt for the Hosdurga-Holalkere man-eating tiger along with his friend Mac. Whilst sitting over human remains atop a large cluster of boulders, Anderson sits with his back to a sheer drop of 12 foot and as such believes himself safe from an attack from the rear - but unexpectedly that is where the [[man-eater]] decides to attack.

'''The Rogue Elephant of Panapatti'''&lt;br /&gt;
An elephant with one whole tusk and one half tusk turns rogue in the Panapatti area and is responsible for multiple human deaths. Anderson first encounters the elephant when out trying to bag a [[peacock]] - armed only with a shotgun. Anderson escapes unscathed, though the elephant goes on to attack a camp of people - causing the government to double its reward for the animal. Anderson spends four laborious days tracking the elephant through the jungle, finally coming across a lone elephant - but is unsure if it is the right animal until it turns to face him...

'''The Maneater of Segur'''&lt;br /&gt;
After first recounting a story of a pack of [[dhole|wild dogs]] taking on a tigress in the [[Nilgiri Hills]], Anderson goes on to detail his hunt for the man-eating tiger of the same region. After a run in with a [[sloth bear]] family, and two failed vigils over two different human kills, Anderson comes across the one-eyed tiger by chance when a [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] deer sounds its warning.

'''The Maneater of Yemmaydoddi'''&lt;br /&gt;
Early in 1946 a small male tiger appeared in the Yemmaydoddi locality and started lifting local cattle. In 1948 after breaking down in Tiptur, Anderson and his friend Alfie finally arrive in Birur to find they are given the choice of shooting either a cattle lifting panther or a cattle lifting tiger. Unfortunately they opt for the panther, as after they leave the region the cattle lifting tiger is wounded badly in the lower jaw by a local villager protecting his cattle and turns man-eater. Anderson returns to the region and months go by of monotonous nights of waiting, until finally Anderson gets a shot at the tiger. Only managing to wound the animal, he returns the next day to track the tiger with the help of a herd of buffalo.

'''The Killer of Jalahalli'''&lt;br /&gt;
During a rabbit beat in the Jalahalli region, a leopard (previously wounded by a policeman) caught between the nets and the beaters with dogs, succeeds in mauling six people in order to escape. Locals persist in trying to bring the leopard to bag, but the leopard is a fighter and survives their assaults - in the progress managing to maul a total of 11 people and kill 3.  Anderson arrives in the area and the leopard again manages to escape the attempt on his life, obtaining more wounds in the progress. The next day Anderson follows circling vultures to the body of the leopard which had painfully succumbed to its many wounds.

'''The Hermit of Devarayandurga'''&lt;br /&gt;
A local tigress is nicknamed 'the hermit' due to its shabby appearance and choice of abode. Not a recorded man-eater, it reportedly was very aggressive towards humans, and killed two men and one woman. After spending some very cold all night vigils sat over baits, Anderson gets a shot at the tigress. Badly wounding the animal, he has a tense morning following its distinctive blood trail until he puts an end to 'the hermit'.

'''Byra the Poojaree'''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson recounts how a chance meeting with a [[poacher]], turns into a close friendship of over 25 years and who appears in many of his hunting stories. Anderson shares some such tales about Byra, including a vicious bear attack and Byra's part in hunting a man-eater in the Muthur area.

'''The Tigers of Tagarthy '''&lt;br /&gt;
Anderson found the village of Tagarthy to have no less than 4 tigers operating in the area, and on one single day - eight cattle kills were reported to have been made by tigers. Anderson recounts his own close encounters with the tigers of the region, including the story of how local man Sham Rao Bapat comes to shoot one of these tigers in his garden, and Anderson's own hunt for the hostile, cattle lifting tiger of Goowja.

[[File:Koitjärve raba 05-2015.jpg|thumb|Precipitation accumulates in many bogs forming bog pools.]]

'''Ombrotrophic''' ("cloud-fed") soils or vegetation receive all of their water and nutrients from [[precipitation]], rather than from streams or springs. Such environments are [[hydrology|hydrologically]] isolated from the surrounding landscape, and since rain is [[acid]]ic and very low in [[Plant nutrition|nutrients]], they are home to organisms tolerant of acidic, low-nutrient environments. The vegetation of ombrotrophic [[peatland]]s is often [[bog]], dominated by ''[[Sphagnum]]'' mosses. The [[hydrology]] of these environments are directly related to their [[climate]], as precipitation is the water and nutrient source, and temperatures dictate how quickly water evaporates from these systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Bethan|last2=Farmer|first2=Jenny|last3=Royles|first3=Jessica|last4=Amesbury|first4=Matt|last5=Payne|first5=Richard|last6=Swindles|first6=Graeme|last7=van Bellen|first7=Simon|last8=Roland|first8=Tom|title=Bogs and Climate|url=https://bogology.org/what-we-do/bogs-and-climate/|website=Bogology|publisher=Bogology|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ombrotrophic circumstances may occur even in landscapes composed of [[limestone]] or other nutrient-rich substrates – for example, in high-rainfall areas, limestone boulders may be capped by acidic ombrotrophic bog vegetation. [[Epiphytic]] vegetation (plants growing on other plants) is ombrotrophic.

In contrast to ombrotrophic environments, [[minerotrophic]] environments are those where the water supply comes mainly from streams or springs. This water has flowed over or through rocks often acquiring dissolved chemicals which raise the nutrient levels and reduce the acidity, which leads to different vegetation such as [[fen]] or [[poor fen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2145">A '''partial linear space''' (also '''semilinear''' or '''near-linear''' space) is a basic [[incidence structure]] in the field of incidence geometry, that carries slightly less structure than a [[linear space (geometry)|linear space]].
The notion is equivalent to that of a linear [[hypergraph]].
==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;S=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal B}, \textbf{I}) &lt;/math&gt; an incidence structure, for which the elements of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal P}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''points'' and the elements of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal B}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''lines''. ''S'' is a partial linear space, if the following axioms hold:
* any line is incident with at least two points
* any pair of distinct points is incident with at most one line

If there is a unique line incident with every pair of distinct points, then we get a linear space. 

==Properties==
The [[De Bruijn–Erdős theorem (incidence geometry)]] shows that in any finite linear space &lt;math&gt;S=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal B}, \textbf{I})&lt;/math&gt; which is not a single point or a single line, we have &lt;math&gt;|\mathcal{P}| \leq |\mathcal{L}|&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Examples ==
* [[Projective space]]
* [[Affine space]]
* [[Polar space]]
* [[Generalized quadrangle]]
* [[Generalized polygon]]
* [[Near polygon]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2650">A '''strong link/weak link''' and '''exclusion zone''' nuclear detonation mechanism is a type of safety mechanism employed  in the [[fuse (explosives)|arming]] and [[firing mechanism]]s of modern [[nuclear weapon]]s.  It is a form of automatic safety [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]].  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/nsam-160/pal.html Permissive Action Links] by [[Steven M. Bellovin]], accessed March 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety mechanism starts by enclosing the electronics and mechanical components used to arm and fire the nuclear weapon with a mechanical and electrical isolation barrier, forming the ''exclusion zone''.  This is insulated from mechanical, thermal, and electrical disruptions (such as [[static electricity]], [[lightning]], [[fire]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Pal.html Permissive Action Links], Carey Sublette, at the Nuclear Weapon Archive, accessed March 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the exclusion zone and the actual detonators, a normally disconnected link mechanism is used, such as a switch which has a built in motor to activate it.  The arming system has to activate the switch in order to connect the firing circuits to the detonators in the weapon.  This disconnection, which requires the arming mechanism to operate, is called the ''strong link''.

It is possible for an accident ([[rocket]] explosion, [[airplane crash]], accident while weapon is being moved) to disrupt the weapon and break the integrity of the exclusion zone.  As a safety mechanism, a ''weak link'' is also built into the system.  This is a set of components designed to fail at lower stresses (thermal, mechanical, and electrical) than will cause failure of the strong link mechanisms.  The weak link acts to break the connection to the detonators before the strong link could be disrupted and fail by the stress of an accident.

These mechanisms do not prevent misuse of the weapon, which is restricted by [[Permissive Action Link]] code systems, or an accident from physically causing initiation of the explosives or detonators directly from extremely high temperatures, impact forces, or electrical disturbance such as lightning.  The risk of accidental direct detonation is significantly reduced by using [[insensitive high explosive]]s such as [[TATB]], which is extremely unlikely to detonate due to fire or impact or electricity.  While TATB may decompose or burn in a fire, it is extremely unlikely to detonate as a result of that action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1464">In [[fluid dynamics]], '''Total Dynamic Head (TDH)''' is the total equivalent height that a fluid is to be pumped, taking into account friction losses in the pipe.

&lt;math&gt; {\rm h_{total}= \frac{P_2-P_1}{\rho g}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''TDH = Static Height + Static Lift + Friction Loss'''

where:&lt;br /&gt;
''Static Height'' is the maximum height reached by the pipe after the pump (also known as the '[[discharge head]]').

''Static Lift'' is the height the water will rise before arriving at the pump (also known as the ''suction head'').&lt;br /&gt;
''Friction Loss'' (or [[Hydraulic_head#Head_loss|Head Loss]]).&lt;br /&gt;
This equation can be derived from [[Bernoulli's_principle#Incompressible_flow_equation|Bernoulli's Equation]].

For a relatively incompressible fluid such as water, TDH is simply the [[pressure head]] difference between the inlet and outlet of the pump, if measured at the same elevation and with inlet and outlet of equal diameter.

TDH is also the [[Mechanical work|work]] done by the pump per [[unit weight]], per unit volume of fluid.

'''Transposition''' is the periodic swapping of positions of the conductors of a [[transmission line]], in order to reduce [[crosstalk]] and otherwise improve transmission.  In telecommunications this applies to [[balanced pair]]s whilst in [[power transmission]] lines three conductors are periodically transposed.

For cables, the swapping is gradual and continuous; that is the two or three conductors are twisted around each other.  For communication cables this is called [[twisted pair]].  For [[overhead power line]]s or open pair communication lines, the conductors are exchanged at pylons, for example at [[transposition tower]]s or at [[utility pole]]s, respectively.

The mutual influence of electrical conductors is reduced by transposition.  Transposition also equalizes their impedance relative to ground, thus avoiding one-sided loads in [[three-phase electric power]] systems.  Transposing is an effective measure for the reduction of inductively linked normal mode interferences.

== Power lines ==
[[File:Wire Transposition.svg|thumb|Wire transposition on top of pole]]
For longer powerlines without branches, wires are transposed according to the transposing scheme.  At closely branched grids and where several electric circuits share a route (in particular when the lines operate at different voltages) on the same pylons the outside unbalance of the line, which is caused by the other electric circuits, dominates.  In these cases one finds large deviations from the transposing schemes.  For example, in some such transpositions, only two of the three conductors on the pylons change their place. Also transpositions on pylons near power substations are used to get an optimal arrangement of the feeding system without crossing of conductors.

As the mutual influence of electric circuits can change after new lines are installed or old lines dismantled, certain transpositions may disappear or be added after new construction in electricity mains. In the case of a twisted line the individual conductors of an electric circuit swap places, either in their whole course (at cables) or at certain points (at overhead lines). The mutual influence of electrical conductors is reduced by transposing. The unbalance of the line, which can lead to one-sided loads in three-phase systems, is also reduced. Transposing of overhead lines is usually realized at so-called transposing pylons. Transposing is an effective measure for the reduction of inductively linked normal mode interferences.

[[File:Verdrillschemata.gif|thumb|Three basic patterns, with variants]]
A '''transposing scheme''' is a pattern by which the conductors of [[overhead power line]]s are transposed at transposing structures. In order to ensure balanced capacitance of a three-phase line, each of the three conductors must hang once at each position of the overhead line.

At a [[transposition tower]], the conductors change their relative places in the line. A transposing structure may be a standard structure with special cross arms, or may be a dead-end structure. The transposing is necessary as there is capacitance between conductors, as well as between conductors and ground. This is typically not symmetrical across phases. By transposing, the overall capacitance for the whole line is approximately balanced.  Transposings also reduce effects to communiciations circuits.&lt;ref&gt;Central Station Engineers,  ''Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book'', Westinghouse Electric Corporation, East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 4th Ed. 1950 pages 748, 778&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telecommunication ==
In communications cables, transposition is used to reduce coupling between circuits in the same cable. The principal measure is the pitch or lay length,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cablecad.com/User_Manual/index.htm#page=Chap2/Lay_Length.htm Lay Length] cablecad.com&lt;/ref&gt; the distance over which the pairs of a circuit are twisted.  By twisting, the wires become longer than the cable. The stranding factor indicates the relationship of single wire length to cable length; it amounts to with communication cables about 1.02 to 1.04.

=== Kinds of stranding ===
In practice the following kinds of stranding occur more frequently: 
* Pair stranding: Two single wires are stranded to [[twisted pair]] transmission line. 
* Three-stranding: Three single wires are stranded to a tripartite group. 
* Four-stranding: Two tightly twisted pairs may be loosely twisted together, or: 
** [[Star quad]] twisting: Four single wires maintain the same relation to each other in the quad, whereby the members of a twisted pair face each other diagonally.

=== Transmission technique ===
The kinds of stranding have different transmission characteristics. The capacity of a stranding affects itself, for example the two conductors of a quadruple run parallel over the entire cable length in [[star quad]] twisting. [[Capacitance]] between the conductors is thus substantially higher than with Dieselhorst Martin (DHM) - stranding in which the situation of the conductors to each other in the cable changes repeatedly. Because of the smaller work capacity of the DHM stranding it is possible to form additional electric circuits with the help of a [[phantom circuit]]. Since the phantom transducers are turned on to in the middle of the master transducers, the currents of the phantom circuit on the two coming Rome circles{{Huh?|date=August 2014}} compensate themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4209">[[File:Merlin usteye bokion.jpg|thumb|right|Splitting or riving a log]]
'''Wood splitting''' (''riving'',&lt;ref name="OED" &gt;"Riving" def. 1.b. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; cleaving) is an ancient technique used in [[carpentry]] to make [[lumber]] for making wooden objects, some [[basket weaving]], and to make [[firewood]]. Unlike [[sawmill|wood sawing]], the wood is split along the [[Wood grain|grain]] using tools such as a hammer and [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]], [[splitting maul]], [[cleaving axe]], [[side knife]], or [[froe]].

==Woodworking==
In woodworking carpenters use a wooden siding which gets its name, clapboard,&lt;ref&gt;"Clapboard" def. 1., 2., and 3. Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia''. vol. 2. New York: Century Co., 1901. 1027. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; from originally being split from logs—the sound of the plank against the log being a clap. This is used in [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard architecture]] and for [[Panelling#Wainscot_panelling|wainscoting]]. Coopers use oak clapboards to make barrel staves.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; [[Split-rail fence]]s are made with split wood.

==Basket making==
Some Native Americans traditionally make baskets from [[Fraxinus nigra|Black ash]] by pounding the wood with a mallet and pulling long strips from the log.

==Firewood==
'''Log splitting''' is the act of splitting firewood from logs that have been [[Log bucking|pre-cut]] into sections (rounds, bolts, billets&lt;ref&gt;"billet, n 2. 1 a." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 2009 CD-rom&lt;/ref&gt;). This can be done by hand, using an [[axe]] or [[splitting maul|maul]], or by using a mechanical [[log splitter]]. When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett &amp;#38; Kate McKay |url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/11/24/how-to-split-firewood/ |title=How to Split Firewood Correctly |publisher=The Art of Manliness |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or twisted grain can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. [[Batoning]] is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a ''batoning chisel'', a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting.

==Advantages==
The advantages of splitting wood along its grain, rather than sawing it is that the wood is much stronger. Due to this, it was historically used for building ships (e.g. [[viking ship|drekars]]) and traditional [[ski]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Happy People: A year in the Taiga,&lt;/ref&gt; A defining feature of [[Shake (shingle)|shakes]], which are like shingles, are that they are split rather than sawn and because the cell structure of the wood remains intact may be more durable, and similarly [[Treenail|trunnels]] when split are stronger than when sawn.

==Prevention==
Sometimes wood splitting is undesirable. Methods to prevent splitting in woodworking are the [[butterfly joint]], [[truss connector plate]]s, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed in the center to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or [[pilot hole]]s drilled to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or screwing. ''End grain sealers'' are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits. Metal end plates or S-shaped pieces of metal may be driven into the butt ends of a timber. Splitting is the primary reason building codes do not allow notching in the bottom of joists and beams.
