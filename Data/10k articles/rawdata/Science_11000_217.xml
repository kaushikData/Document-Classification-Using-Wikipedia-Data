'''Balch Glacier''' ({{Coord|66|50|S|64|48|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] {{convert|9|nmi|km}} long, on the east coast of [[Graham Land]], flowing southeast into [[Mill Inlet]], to the south of [[Gould Glacier]]. It was first surveyed by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] in 1946–47, and named "East Balch Glacier". With "West Balch Glacier" it was reported to fill a transverse depression across Graham Land, but further survey in 1957 showed that there is no close topographical alignment between the two. The name "Balch", for [[Edwin S. Balch]], an American Antarctic historian, has been limited to this glacier and an entirely new name, [[Drummond Glacier]], approved for the west glacier.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

'''Bassorah Fossa''' is a [[Trough (geology)|trough]] south of [[Ali Baba (crater)|Ali Baba]] [[impact crater|crater]] on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Bassorah Fossa was first seen in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images.  It is located at 45.4° [[north]], 6.3° west, and is 131 kilometers long.

Bassorah Fossa is named after the city of [[Basra]], [[Iraq]], from which [[Sindbad]] embarked on his third voyage in the ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

'''Behavioral strategy''' refers to the study of corporate or business strategies from a [[Microfoundations|micro-foundations perspective]]. This area of study is emerging in the field of [[management]] and [[economics]]. It considers the role of conscious and unconscious [[Bias|biases]] of executives, managers, teams, and organizations in strategic [[Decision theory|decision making]]. The field is emerging following similar developments in the fields of [[behavioral economics]] and [[behavioral finance]].

'''Civil-military operations''' or '''CMO''' are activities of a military force to minimize civil interference on and maximize civil support for [[military operation]]s.  CMO is conducted in conjunction with combat operations during wartime and becomes a central part of a military campaign in [[Counter-insurgency|counter-insurgencies]].  Some militaries have specialized units dedicated to conduct CMO, such as [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]] forces or form task forces specifically for this purposes, such as a [[joint civil-military operations task force]] in the U.S. Military.  Also, some militaries have staff sections dedicated to planning and coordinating CMO for their command.  CMO is often called [[Civil-Military Co-operation|civil-military co-operation]] or CIMIC in [[NATO]] operations and [[Civil-military coordination|civil-military co-ordination]] in [[United Nations|UN]] operations.
==Official definitions==
The [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|Military activities associated with an operation that ensure that military commanders comprehend, make use of and mitigate any negative impact of the civil environment on military operations and plans.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Department of National Defence, Canadian Force Operations, National Defence Pub B-GJ-005-300/FP-000 (Ottawa: DND, August 15, 2005), p. 19-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|The activities of a commander that establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces, governmental and nongovernmental civilian organizations and authorities, and the civilian populace in a friendly, neutral, or hostile operational area in order to facilitate military operations, to consolidate and achieve operational US objectives. Civil-military operations may include performance by military forces of activities and functions normally the responsibility of the local, regional, or national government. These activities may occur prior to, during, or subsequent to other military actions. They may also occur, if directed, in the absence of other military operations. Civil-military operations may be performed by designated civil affairs, by other military forces, or by a combination of civil affairs and other forces.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Civil-Military Operations, Joint Publication (JP) 3-57 (Washington, DC: CJCS, July 08, 2008), p. GL-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Clausthalite''' is a [[lead]] [[selenide mineral]], PbSe. It forms a [[solid solution]] series with [[galena]] PbS.

==Occurrence==
It occurs in low-sulfur [[hydrothermal]] deposits with other selenides and in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] deposits. It is associated with [[tiemannite]], [[klockmannite]], [[berzelianite]], [[umangite]], [[gold]], [[stibiopalladinite]] and [[uraninite]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

It was first described in 1832 and named for the discovery locality of Clausthal-Zellerfeld in the [[Harz Mountains]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

The '''corotation circle''' is the circle around the [[galactic center]] of a [[spiral galaxy]], where the [[star]]s move at the same speed as the [[spiral arms]]. The [[radius]] of this circle is called '''corotation radius'''. Inside the circle the stars move faster and outside they move slower than the spiral arms.

The [[Sun]] is located near the corotation circle of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">A '''correlation coefficient''' is a [[numerical measure]] of some type of [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]], meaning a statistical relationship between two [[variable (mathematics)|variables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorC |title=correlation coefficient |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=NCME.org |publisher=[[National Council on Measurement in Education]] |access-date=April 17, 2014 |quote=correlation coefficient: A statistic used to show how the scores from one measure relate to scores on a second measure for the same group of individuals. A high value (approaching +1.00) is a strong direct relationship, values near 0.50 are considered moderate and values below 0.30 are considered to show weak relationship.  A low negative value (approaching -1.00) is similarly a strong inverse relationship, and values near 0.00 indicate little, if any, relationship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variables may be two [[column (database)|column]]s of a given [[data set]] of observations, often called a [[sample (statistics)|sample]], or two components of a [[multivariate random variable]] with a known [[distribution (statistics)|distribution]].

Several types of correlation coefficient exist, each with their own definition and own range of usability and characteristics. They all assume values in the range from −1 to +1, where +1 indicates the strongest possible agreement and −1 the strongest possible disagreement. As tools of analysis, correlation coefficients present certain problems, including the propensity of some types to be distorted by [[outliers]] and the possibility of incorrectly being used to infer a [[causal relationship]] between the variables.&lt;ref name="Boddy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boddy|first1=Richard |last2=Smith|first2=Gordon |title=Statistical methods in practice: for scientists and technologists |date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-74664-6|pages=95-96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
=== Pearson ===

The [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]], also known as ''r'', ''R'', or Pearson's ''r'', is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables that is defined as the [[covariance]] of the variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. This is the best known and most commonly used type of correlation coefficient; when the term "correlation coefficient" is used without further qualification, it usually refers to the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient

=== Intra-class ===

[[Intraclass correlation]] (ICC) is a descriptive statistic that can be used when quantitative measurements are made on units that are organized into groups; it describes how strongly units in the same group resemble each other.

=== Rank ===

[[Rank correlation]] is a measure of the relationship between the rankings of two variables or two rankings of the same variable:
*[[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] is a measure of how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonic function.
*The [[Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient]] is a measure of the portion of ranks that match between two data sets.
*[[Goodman and Kruskal's gamma]] is a measure of the strength of association of the cross tabulated data when both variables are measured at the ordinal level.

==See also==
*[[Distance correlation]]
*[[Goodness of fit]], any of several measures that measure how well a statistical model fits observations by summarizing the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model
*[[Coefficient of determination]]

'''Dynamicism''', also termed the ''dynamic hypothesis'' or the ''dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science'' or ''dynamic cognition'', is a new approach in [[cognitive science]] exemplified by the work of philosopher [[Tim van Gelder]]. It argues that [[differential equations]] are more suited to modeling [[cognition]] than more traditional [[computer]] models. Cf also [[dynamical systems theory]].

An '''engineering apprenticeship''' in the [[United Kingdom]] is an [[apprenticeship]] in [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]] or [[aeronautical engineering]] to train craftsmen, technicians, senior technicians, [[Incorporated Engineer]]s and [[Chartered Engineer]] for vocational oriented work and professional practice. Chartered Engineers are usually formed through a university degree programme at the Masters Engineering level and may undertake a short form of post graduate apprenticeship. A typical example is the apprenticeships formerly available at the [[British Thomson-Houston]] and [[English Electric]] companies at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] in England. Subjects covered included mathematics, engineering sciences, [[limits and fits]], [[metallurgy]], [[foundry]] technology, [[engineering drawing]], [[design]], [[materials science]] for engineering materials, [[metalworking]] by hand, operating [[machine tool]]s, and basic features of engineering design. Also refer to [[apprenticeship]] and the UK and German section. Elite technical apprenticeships (4-6 years long) have been a decades long tradition at UK companies such as [[BAE Systems]], [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[Short Brothers]]), and  [[Babcock International]].

As a member of the group I of the [[Baltimore classification]], ''Enterobacteria phage Wphi'' is a [[dsDNA virus]]es. All the members of family Myoviridae share a nonenveloped morphology consisting of a head and a tail separated by a neck. Its [[genome]] is linear. The propagation of the virions includes the attaching to a host cell (a [[bacterium]], as ''Enterobacteria phage Wphi'' is a [[bacteriophage]]) and the injection of the double stranded DNA; the host transcribes and translates it to manufacture new particles. To replicate its genetic content requires host cell [[DNA polymerases]] and, hence, the process is highly dependent on the cell cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4329869|year=1971|last1=Baltimore|first1=D|title=Expression of animal virus genomes|volume=35|issue=3|pages=235–41|pmc=378387|journal=Bacteriological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">'''Financial risk modeling''' is the use of formal [[econometric]] techniques to determine the aggregate [[financial risk|risk]] in a financial [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]. Risk modeling is one of many subtasks within the broader area of [[financial modeling]].

Risk modeling uses a variety of techniques including [[market risk]], [[value at risk]] (VaR), [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulation]] (HS), or [[extreme value theory]] (EVT) in order to analyze a portfolio and make forecasts of the likely losses that would be incurred for a variety of risks.  Such risks are typically grouped into [[credit risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[market risk]], and [[operational risk]] categories.

Many large financial intermediary firms use risk modeling to help portfolio managers assess the amount of [[Capital requirement|capital reserves]] to maintain, and to help guide their purchases and sales of various classes of [[assets|financial assets]].  

Formal risk modeling is required under the [[Basel II]] proposal for all the major international banking institutions by the various national depository institution regulators. In the past, risk analysis was done qualitatively but now with the advent of powerful computing software, quantitative risk analysis can be done quickly and effortlessly.

Modeling the changes by distributions with finite variance is now known to be inappropriate. [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] found in the 1960s that changes in prices in financial markets do not follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], but are rather modeled better by [[Levy function|Lévy stable distributions]]. The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time interval to a [[power law|power]] a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down, also called ''[[Fat-tailed distribution|fat tails]]'', are more likely than what one would calculate using a Gaussian distribution with an estimated [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref name=BlackSwan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot&gt;{{cite book|title=The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence|publisher=Basic Books|year=2006|isbn=978-0-465-04357-6|author=[[Benoît Mandelbrot]] and Richard L. Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Quantitative [[Risk analysis (Business)|risk analysis]] and its modeling have been under question in the light of [[corporate scandals]] in the past few years (most notably, [[Enron]]), [[Basel II]], the revised FAS 123R and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], and for their failure to predict the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crash of 2008]].&lt;ref name=BlackSwan&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4000-6351-2|author=[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2008/03/we-will-never-have-a-perfect-model-of-risk/|title=We will never have a perfect model of risk|author=[[Alan Greenspan]]|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14030296|title=Financial economics: Efficiency and beyond|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-07-18}} From The Economist print edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, he worked on the guidance and control system for the [[Aggregate series#A3|A3 test rocket]], the [[Aggregate series#A5|A5]], and the A4 ([[V-2 rocket|V-2]]) ballistic missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnoZTbVLx0MC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=fritz+mueller+guidance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C3y5VQOZP-&amp;sig=U1BI7qtZsdzr2Tf3mOcKEi8YeUw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ybZ7TNZ1gsaVB-bc5esL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=fritz%20mueller%20guidance&amp;f=false| title= Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicle| author= Roger E.

Under [[Project Paperclip]], Mueller emigrated to the United States on 16 November 1945 with the Argentina group. There, he worked on developing guidance systems for the [[PGM-11 Redstone]], [[PGM-19 Jupiter]], [[MGM-31 Pershing]], and the [[Saturn I]] missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07hgJbzQrt0C&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=fritz+mueller+guidance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z8HXZ93mYK&amp;sig=2z9oHh0w-vHbTfm5UPegE-APGzk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ybZ7TNZ1gsaVB-bc5esL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=fritz%20mueller%20guidance&amp;f=false| title=Von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War| author=Michael J.

'''''Imagining the Elephant: A Biography of Allan MacLeod Cormack''''' is a 2008 biography of physicist and Nobel laureate [[Allan MacLeod Cormack]] written by biomedical engineer and author Christopher [[Kit Vaughan]] and published by [[Imperial College Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p539 | location=London | first=Christopher | last=Vaughan | work=Imperial College Press | title=Imagining the Elephant: A Biography of Allan MacLeod Cormack | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book won the [[University of Cape Town]] Book Award in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2010-03-29-medical-biography-picks-up-uct-book-award | title=Medical biography picks up UCT book award | date=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; an honour shared with Nobel laureate [[J.M. Coetzee]] who won the award in 1984 for [[Waiting for the Barbarians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.uct.ac.za/main/research/awards/book-awards | title=UCT Book Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cormack shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979 with [[Godfrey Hounsfield]] “for the development of computer assisted tomography.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1979/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book’s title is inspired by the parable of six [[blind men and an elephant]], in which the men, by approaching the animal from different angles, imagine it to be an elephant. This is analogous to computed tomography – or [[CT scan]] – in which a series of two-dimensional X-rays taken from different angles are used to construct a three-dimensional image of the object.

==Overview==

The book is divided into nine chapters: (1) From John O'Groats to Jo'burg; (2) On the Slopes of Table Mountain; (3) Physics and Friends at Cambridge; (4) Return to the Fairest Cape; (5) A New Beginning in Boston; (6) Finding Radon and His Transform; (7) On the Road to Stockholm; (8) Citizen of the World; and (9) At Home in Massachusetts. In addition, there are five appendices: (A) Allan Cormack's Publications; (B) Nobel Lecture; (C) Presentation of Nobel Prize; (D) Man and Science in the 21st Century; and (E) A Teenager's Odyssey. Appendix D is an essay written by Cormack for ''The Mainichi Newspapers'', while Appendix E is a mini-biography with cartoons written for ''The Weekly Shonen Jump'', a magazine for teenagers. Neither of these essays, which were originally published in Japanese, had previously been published in English.

==Reviews==
Writing in ''The New England Journal of Medicine'', Reginald Greene commented: “Those interested in the history of science are indebted to Vaughan for producing this wonderful biography of Allan Cormack and for creating an expert and vivid description of one of the two streams of discovery that led to the invention of computed tomography.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMbkrev0805111 | work=The New England Journal of Medicine | first=Reginald | last=Greene | title=Imagining the Elephant: A Biography of Allan MacLeod Cormack | date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Cherry, who was one of Cormack’s students in the early 1950s, said: “A prodigious effort has gone into this book, and the result is a comprehensive work of reference which will be a valuable source for those interested in the history of science and medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archive.sajs.co.za/index.php/SAJS/article/view/6/5 | work=South African Journal of Science | first=Robin | last=Cherry | title=The man behind the CAT scanner | date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lisfranc injury''', also known as '''Lisfranc fracture''', is an [[Trauma (medicine)|injury]] of the [[foot]] in which one or more of the [[Metatarsus|metatarsal bones]] are [[Displacement (orthopedic surgery)|displaced]] from the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]].&lt;ref name=WhoNamedIt3053&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3053|Lisfranc's fracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Lisfranc's fracture|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=|location=|year=|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Lisfranc%27s+fracture|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury is named after [[Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin]] (2 April 1790{{ndash}}13 May 1847), a [[French people|French]] [[surgeon]] and [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]] who described an amputation of the foot through the tarsometatarsal articulation, in 1815, after the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].&lt;ref name=Lisfranc1815&gt;{{cite book|last=Lisfranc|first=J|authorlink=Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin|title=Nouvelle méthode opératoire pour l'amputation partielle du pied dans son articulation tarso-métatarsienne: méthode précédée des nombreuses modifications qu'a subies celle de Chopart|pages=1–52|publisher=L’imprimerie de Feuguery|location=Paris|year=1815|language=French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw1bAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22m%C3%A9thode+pr%C3%A9c%C3%A9d%C3%A9e+des+nombreuses+modifications+qu'a+subies+celle+de+Chopart%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22m%C3%A9thode%20pr%C3%A9c%C3%A9d%C3%A9e%20des%20nombreuses%20modifications%20qu'a%20subies%20celle%20de%20Chopart%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
In humans, the [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|midfoot]] consists of five bones that form the [[arches of the foot]] (the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[Navicular bone|navicular]], and three [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] bones) and their articulations with the bases of the five metatarsal bones. Lisfranc injuries are caused when excessive [[kinetic energy]] is applied either directly or indirectly to the midfoot and are often seen in  [[traffic collision]]s or [[Occupational injury|industrial accidents]].&lt;ref name=Smith2005&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith BR, Begeman PC, Leland R, Meehan R, Levine RS, Yang KH, King AI |title=A Mechanism of Injury to the Forefoot in Car Crashes|journal=Traffic Injury Prevention|volume=6|issue=2|pages=156–69|year=2005|issn=1538-9588|doi=10.1080/15389580590931635|pmid=16019401|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389580590931635#preview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct Lisfranc injuries are usually caused by a crush injury, such as a heavy object falling onto the midfoot, or the foot being run over by a car or truck, or someone landing on the foot after a fall from a significant height.&lt;ref name=Chan2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=SCF|last2=Chow|first2=SP|title=Current concept review on Lisfranc injuries|journal=Hong Kong Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery|volume=5|issue=1|pages=75–80|year=2001|pmid=|pmc=|doi=|url=http://hkoa.org/hkjos/2001-1/75_80.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect Lisfranc injuries are caused by a sudden [[Torque|rotational force]] on a [[Plantarflexion|plantar flexed]] (downward pointing) forefoot.&lt;ref name=Smith2005/&gt; Examples of this type of trauma include a [[Equestrianism|rider]] falling from a horse but the foot remaining trapped in the [[stirrup]], or a person falling forward after stepping into a [[storm drain]].&lt;ref name=Chan2001/&gt;

In athletic trauma, Lisfranc injuries occur commonly in activities such as [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[wakeboarding]], or [[snowboarding]] (where appliance [[Snowboard#Bindings|bindings]] pass directly over the metatarsals).&lt;ref name=Lievers2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lievers WB, Frimenko RE, McCullough KA, Crandall JR, Kent RW |title=Etiology and biomechanics of midfoot (Lisfranc) injuries in athletes|journal=Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering|volume=43|issue=2-3|pages=213–238|year=2015|doi=10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.v43.i2-3.60|pmid=27278743}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American football]] players occasionally acquire this injury, and it most often occurs when the athlete's foot is plantar flexed and another player lands on the heel. This can also be seen in pivoting athletic positions such as a baseball catcher or a ballerina spinning.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Lisfranc fracture.jpg|thumb|Lisfranc fracture (marked by the oval). This case also has [[Bone fracture|fractures]] of the distal [[Second metatarsal bone|second]] (marked by the arrow), [[Third metatarsal bone|third]], and [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth]] [[metatarsus|metatarsal bones]].]]
In a high energy injury to the midfoot, such as a fall from a height or a motor vehicle accident, the diagnosis of a Lisfranc injury should, in theory at least, pose less of a challenge. There will be deformity of the midfoot and X-ray abnormalities should be obvious.  Further, the nature of the injury will create heightened clinical suspicion and there may even be disruption of the overlying skin and compromise of the blood supply.  Typical X-ray findings would include a gap between the base of the first and second toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intercuneiform instability and the "gap" sign |vauthors=Davies MS, Saxby TS | date=September 1999 | journal=Foot Ankle Int | volume=20 | pages=606–9 | pmid=10509690 | issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis becomes more challenging in the case of low energy incidents, such as might occur with a twisting injury on the racquetball court, or when an American Football lineman is forced back upon a foot that is already in a fully [[Plantarflexion|plantar flexed]] position.  Then, there may only be complaint of inability to bear weight and some mild swelling of the forefoot or midfoot.  Bruising of the arch has been described as diagnostic in these circumstances but may well be absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Plantar ecchymosis sign: a clinical aid to diagnosis of occult Lisfranc tarsometatarsal injuries |vauthors=Ross G, Cronin R, Hauzenblas J, Juliano P | year=1986 | journal=J Orthop Trauma | volume=10 | pages=119–122 | pmid=8932671 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Typically, conventional radiography of the foot is utilized with standard non-weight bearing views, supplemented by weight bearing views which may demonstrate widening of the interval between the first and second toes, if the initial views fail to show abnormality.  Unfortunately, radiographs in such circumstances have a sensitivity of 50% when non-weight bearing and 85% when weight bearing, meaning that they will appear normal in 15% of cases where a Lisfranc injury actually exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The diagnostic accuracy of radiographs in Lisfranc injury and the potential value of a craniocaudal projection |vauthors=Rankine JJ, Nicholas CM, Wells G, Barron DA | date=April 2012 | journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol | volume=198 | pages=W365-9 | pmid=22451574 | doi=10.2214/AJR.11.7222 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of apparently normal x-rays, if clinical suspicion remains, advanced imaging such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) or [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT) is a logical next step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Imaging of Lisfranc Injury and Midfoot Sprain | author=Hatem SF | date=November 2008 | journal=Radiologic Clinics of North America | volume=46 | pages=1045–1060 | pmid=19038612 | doi=10.1016/j.rcl.2008.09.003 | issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
There are three classifications for the fracture:&lt;ref name=Wheeless&gt;{{cite web|author=Wheeless CR|title=Lisfranc's Fracture / TarsoMetatarsal Injuries|work=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics online|publisher=Duke Orthopaedics|location=Durham, North Carolina|year=2011|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/lisfrancs_fracture_tarsometatarsal_injuries|accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Homolateral: All five metatarsals are displaced in the same direction.  Lateral displacement may also suggest [[Cuboid bone|cuboidal]] fracture.
# Isolated: one or two metatarsals are displaced from the others.
# Divergent: metatarsals are displaced in a [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] or [[Coronal plane|coronal]] plane and may also involve the [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|intercuneiform]] area and include a [[Navicular bone|navicular]] fracture.

==Treatment==
Options include operative or non-operative treatment.  If the dislocation is less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm, the fracture can be managed with casting for six&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Practical management of Lisfranc injury in athletes |vauthors=Lattermann C, Goldstein JL, Wukich DK, Lee S, ((Bach BR Jr)) | date=July 2007 | journal=Clin J Sport Med | volume=17 | pages=311–51 | pmid=17620787 | doi=10.1097/JSM.0b013e31811ed0ba | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient's injured limb cannot [[Weight-bearing|bear weight]] during this period.  For severe Lisfranc injuries, [[Internal fixation#Open Reduction Internal Fixation .28ORIF.29|open reduction with internal fixation]] (ORIF) and temporary screw or [[Kirschner wire]] (K-wire) fixation is the treatment of choice.&lt;ref name=Mulier1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulier|first=T|last2=Reynders|first2=P|last3=Sioen|first3=W|last4=Van Den Bergh|first4=J|last5=De Reymaeker|first5=G|last6=Reynaert|first6=P|last7=Broos|first7=P|title=The Treatment of Lisfranc Injuries|journal=Acta Orthopaedica Belgica|volume=63|issue=2|pages=82–90|year=1997|pmid=9265792|pmc=|issn=0001-6462|doi=|url=http://actaorthopaedicabelgica.be/acta/download/1997-2/9265792.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105045103/http://actaorthopaedicabelgica.be/acta/download/1997-2/9265792.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foot cannot be allowed to bear weight for a minimum of six weeks.  Partial weight-bearing may then begin, with full weight bearing after an additional several weeks, depending on the specific injury.

When a Lisfranc injury is characterized by significant displacement of the tarsometatarsal joint(s), nonoperative treatment often leads to severe loss of function and long-term disability secondary to [[chronic pain]] and sometimes to a [[Valgus deformity|planovalgus deformity]].  In cases with severe pain, loss of function, or progressive deformity that has failed to respond to nonoperative treatment, mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal [[arthrodesis]] (operative fusion of the bones) may be indicated.&lt;ref name=Mann1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=RA|last2=Prieskorn|first2=D|last3=Sobel|first3=M|title=Mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal arthrodesis for primary degenerative osteoarthrosis or osteoarthrosis after trauma|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

==History==
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin]] encountered a soldier who suffered from vascular compromise and secondary [[gangrene]] of the foot after a fall from a horse.&lt;ref name=Lisfranc1815/&gt; Subsequently, Lisfranc performed an [[amputation]] at the level of the [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|tarsometatarsal joints]],&lt;ref name=Lisfranc1815/&gt; and that area of the foot has since been [[eponym]]ously referred to as the "Lisfranc joint".&lt;ref name=WhoNamedIt3055&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3055|Lisfranc's joint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lisfranc did not describe a specific mechanism of injury or classification scheme, a Lisfranc injury has come to mean a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the tarsometatarsal joints.&lt;ref name=DiDomenico2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiDomenico|first=LA|last2=Cross|first2=D|title=Tarsometatarsal/Lisfranc Joint|journal=Clinics in Podiatric Medicine and Surgery|volume=29|issue=2|pages=221–42|year=2012|pmid=22424486|pmc=|doi=10.1016/j.cpm.2012.01.003|url=http://www.ankleandfootcare.com/pdf/tarsometatarsal-lisfranc-joint-article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''[[gene family|gene families]]''' or '''[[gene complex]]es''', that is sets of genes which occur across a number of different [[species]] which often serve similar biological functions.  These gene families typically encode functionally related [[protein]]s, and sometimes the term gene families is a shorthand for the sets of proteins that the genes encode.  They may or may not be physically adjacent on the same [[chromosome]].

This is an incomplete list of [[incurable diseases]]. It includes both physical and mental diseases.
&lt;!-- Any letter that doesn't have any entries should be hidden (like this comment is) --&gt;
{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes}}

==A==
* [[Allergic disease|Allergic diseases]] – Allergies, or Allergic diseases, are conditions in which [[Histamine|histamines]]. Types of allergy include [[Food allergy|food allergies]] (not to be confused with [[Food intolerance|Food Intolerances]] or [[Food-poisoning|Food Poisoning]]), [[atopic dermatitis]], [[allergic asthma]], [[anaphylaxis]], and [[allergic rhinitis]] (also known as hay fever, which is the most common), for example. No cure exists for allergies, but several treatments exist such as [[Antihistamine|antihistamines]], [[Corticosteroid|corticosteroids]], avoiding the [[allergen]], and [[allergen immunotherapy]] (also known as desensitization.){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* [[Asthma]] – Asthma is a disease that makes the [[bronchial tubes]] more susceptible to inflammation and irritation. There is no way to cure it, but there are ways to treat it so the person is not as likely to have an asthmatic episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asthma |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ |website=World Health Organization |accessdate=31 May 2016 |language=en-GB |date=November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629035454/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Adrenocortical carcinoma]] – A form of cancer that originates in the [[adrenal cortex|cortex]] of the [[adrenal gland]] and has no definitive cure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* [[Alzheimer's disease]]
* [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]] – Also known as motor neurone disease or Lou Gehrig's Disease
* [[Arthritis]] – Arthritis is a condition where one feels joint pain. There is no known cure, but there are treatments that help.
* [[Ataxia]] – is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality. Ataxia is a non-specific clinical manifestation implying dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum.

==C==

* [[Cancer]]

* [[Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy]] – Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy is a disease in the body's [[blood vessels]] that causes a buildup of a protein that can cause the blood vessels in the brain to burst, resulting in headaches. It is commonly brought on by [[dementia]], but can occur in a person who never had dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Godefroy |first1=Olivier |title=The Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology of Stroke |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107310896 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdMgAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA397 |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[ Factor V Leiden Mutation ]] -  is a variant (mutated form) of human factor V (one of several substances that helps blood clot), which causes an increase in blood clotting (hypercoagulability). With this mutation, the anticoagulant protein secreted (which normally inhibits the pro-clotting activity of factor V) is not able to bind normally to Factor V, leading to a hypercoagulable state, i.e., an increased tendency for the patient to form abnormal and potentially harmful blood clots. Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability (prone to clotting) disorder amongst ethnic Europeans. It is named after the Dutch city Leiden, where it was first identified in 1994 by Prof R. Bertina et al. Suspicion of factor V Leiden being the cause for any thrombotic event should be considered in any Caucasian patient below the age of 45, or in any person with a family history of venous thrombosis.

*[[Pulmonary hypertension|Pulmonary Hypertension]] – a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350697|title=Mayo Clinic Pulmonary Hypertension|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [The gold standard for diagnosing Pulmonary Hypertension is a right heart cath procedure.] In a right-heart cath, your doctor guides a special catheter (a small, hollow tube) called a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter to the right side of your heart.

* [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] – Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?|url=http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/rheumatoid-arthritis/what-is-rheumatoid-arthritis.php|website=Arthritis Foundation|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rabies]] – Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure, followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, the time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel along nerves to reach the central nervous system. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Once the patient becomes symptomatic, treatment is almost never effective and mortality is over 99%. Rabies may also inflame the spinal cord, producing transverse myelitis.

* [[Rett syndrome]] (RTT) – an X-linked genetic brain disorder, which typically becomes apparent after 6 to 18 months of age in females. Symptoms include problems with language, coordination, and repetitive movements. Often there is slower growth, problems walking, and a smaller head size. Complications can include seizures, scoliosis, and sleeping problems. There is no known cure for Rett syndrome, treatment is directed at improving symptoms. Anticonvulsants may be used to help with seizures, and special education, physiotherapy, and braces may also be useful.

==S==
* [[Schizophrenia]] – Many treatments are available and proven to improve the condition, however, there is no definitive cure for this mental disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schizophrenia Treatment &amp; Recovery: Getting the Help and Support You Need |url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-treatment-and-recovery.htm |publisher=HelpGuide.org |accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schizophrenia fact sheet |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs397/en/ |website=World Health Organization |accessdate=31 May 2016 |language=en-GB |date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scoliosis]]
* [[Spinocerebellar Ataxia]] – This is a genetic disorder that inhibits the person's ability to use their nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ataxias and Cerebellar or Spinocerebellar Degeneration Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/ataxia/ataxia.htm |website=NINDS |accessdate=31 May 2016 |date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] – (SARS) is a respiratory illness that first infected people in parts of Asia, North America, and Europe in late 2002 and early 2003. SARS is caused by a type of coronavirus, which can cause mild to moderate upper respiratory illness, such as the common cold.
* [[Sickle cell disease]] – A disorder that cause red blood cells to become misshapen and break down. It is very rare and has no cure.

==T==
* [[Trigeminal Neuralgia]] – A chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal or 5th cranial nerve, one of the most widely distributed nerves in the head. There is no true cure for the disease, but it can be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Trigeminal Neuralgia Fact Sheet |url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Trigeminal-Neuralgia-Fact-Sheet |website=NINDS |accessdate=5 December 2017 |date= 4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Toxoplasmosis]] – A zoonotic disease spread from cat feces, undercooked meat and fresh unwashed vegetables.

{{main article|Systems biology}}
[[Systems biology]] is a biological study field that focuses on the systematic study of complex interactions in [[biological system]]s, thus using a new perspective (integration instead of [[reductionist|reduction]]) to study them. Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the term is used widely in the [[biosciences]].

The field has generated interest among scientists, resulting in regular and one-time conferences and meetings. Below is a partial list.

This is a list of [[volcano]]es in [[Chile]]. The [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Global Volcanism Program]] lists 105 volcanoes in Chile that have been active during the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcano.si.edu/search_volcano.cfm Search database GVP] using Chile, Chile-Peru, Chile-Bolivia and Chile-Argentina options, retrieved on 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[SERNAGEOMIN]] lists 90 active volcanoes in Chile.&lt;ref name="SERNA90"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sernageomin.cl/archivos/Ranking-de-Volcanes.pdf | title=Ranking de los 90 volcanes activos de Chile | publisher=[[SERNAGEOMIN]] | accessdate=24 August 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211080024/http://www.sernageomin.cl/archivos/Ranking-de-Volcanes.pdf | archivedate=11 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Pacific islands of Chile are of volcanic origin. They have been formed from magma coming from three distinct [[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], [[Easter hotspot|Easter]], [[Juan Fernández hotspot|Juan Fernández]] and [[San Felix hotspot]]s. The westernmost part of the ridges formed by these hotspots contain the most recently active volcanoes.

Some volcanoes or groups of volcanoes are under surveillance of [[OVDAS]] because of their critical activity or proximity to big cities.

This list does not include Chilean claims in the [[Antarctic]].

'''''Microbes and Man''''' is a popularising book by the English microbiologist [[John Postgate (microbiologist)|John Postgate FRS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Postgate, John |authorlink=John Postgate (microbiologist) |date=2000 |title=Microbes and Man |edition=4th |isbn=0-521-66579-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Microbes in human culture|role of microorganisms in human society]], first published in 1969, and still in print in 2017. Critics called it a "classic"&lt;ref name=Hogg/&gt; and "a pleasure to read".&lt;ref name=NewScientist/&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Guardian]]'' described the book as "a passionate case for the importance of micro-organisms".&lt;ref name="GuardianObit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Barry |title=John Postgate obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/10/john-postgate |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=8 February 2017 |date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his textbook ''Essential Microbiology'', Stuart Hogg recommends the book to readers who want a general overview of [[Microbes in human culture|microbes and their uses]], stating "there can be no better starting point than John Postgate's classic".&lt;ref name=Hogg&gt;{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Stuart |title=Essential Microbiology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yRRtGJxP7YC&amp;pg=PT497 |year=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-68814-4 |pages=497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Scientist]]'' described the book as "a pleasure to read from first page to last. It is a literal statement. Start to read it and the first page, describing the astonishing dispersion of microbes, from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the sea, will provide any reader with enough wonder and excitement to take them through to the last page and the surface of Venus."&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite book |author=Reed Business Information |title=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZDUtqfi1LsC&amp;pg=PA48 |date=7 August 1986 |publisher=Reed Business Information |page=48 |ISSN=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine commented that Postgate's "admirable, elegantly written and painlessly informative book" came close to losing its [[alliteration|alliterative]] title, at the hands of "militant [[feminism|feminists]]" at [[Penguin Books]] editing the paperback version in 1986.{{efn|The review noted that they replaced all suspect terms with gender-neutral forms, ignoring the context, so "every schoolboy" became "every schoolchild", wrong because Postgate was actually writing about unequal provision of science education. Worse, and "hilariously" in the reviewer's opinion, "backroom boy" became "students in backrooms", showing "ignorance of idiom and insensitivity to the nuances of language".&lt;ref name=NewScientist2&gt;{{cite news |author=Reed Business Information |title=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWmKGnwBffwC&amp;pg=PA88 |date=22 May 1986 |publisher=Reed Business Information |page=88 |ISSN=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=NewScientist2/&gt;

Schneider, reviewing the 3rd edition in 1992 for ''Cell'', described the book as having "succinctly and carefully explained examples of how [[microorganism]]s affect our lives ... one of the classics of popular science", standing alongside classics like Rosebury's ''Life of Man'' and De Kruif's ''Microbe Hunters''. Schneider wrote that the book's [[British English|Britishness]] "'colours' the text", but Postgate's emphasis on the beneficial and not just the harmful effects of microbes was welcome and admirably explored. He noted few errors, but objected to Postgate's assertion that [[AIDS]] "originated by transmission from a [[primate]]", for which there was at that time no evidence. Schneider would have liked a "better and longer" account of [[molecular biology]]. His chief criticism, however, was that by the 1990s the book no longer had an audience, since "the Victorial ideal of the educated middle class has vanished into the wasteland of broken families, double digit unemployment and a damaged educational system". All the same, he found the book "of value and beauty (except perhaps to the publisher)".&lt;ref name=Cell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=Dennis R. |title=Microbes and man (3rd edn) by John Postgate |journal=Cell |date=1993 |volume=1|issue=7 |pages=283 |doi=10.1016/0966-842X(93)90053-T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles W. Kim, reviewing the 3rd edition for ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', stated that "If the author's intent was to present the impact of the ubiquitous microorganisms on the environment and humans, he has succeeded admirably", describing Postgate's style as "unique".&lt;ref name=QRBiol&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Charles W.|title=Reviews and Brief Notices Microbes and Man.

D. Roy Cullimore, in his ''Practical Atlas for Bacterial Identification'', comments that all four editions were "easy reading", addressing the challenges that microbes presented to human society. He suggests that "ideally" all four books be read in sequence for an overiew of the development of [[microbiology]] in half a century.&lt;ref name=Cullimore&gt;{{cite book |last=Cullimore |first=D.

'''Nucleonica''' is a [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] science [[web portal]]. The company Nucleonica GmbH was founded by Dr. Joseph Magill in 2011 as a spin-off from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, [[Institute for Transuranium Elements]]. In addition to providing user friendly access to nuclear data, the main focus of Nucleonica is to provide professionals in the nuclear industry with a suite of validated scientific applications for everyday calculations. The portal is also suitable for education and training in the nuclear field.

Nucleonica GmbH is also responsible for the management and development of the [[Karlsruhe Nuclide Chart]] print and online versions.

==User access==
Users can register for free access to Nucleonica. This free access gives the user access to most applications but is restricted to a limited number of nuclides. For full access to all nuclides and applications, the user can upgrade to Premium for which there is an annual user charge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">'''Open data indices''' are indicators which assess and evaluates the general openness of an open government data portal. Open data indices not only show how open a data portal is, but also encourage citizens and government officials alike, to participate in their local open data communities, particularly in advocating for local open data and local open data policies.

There are two mainstream methodologies, which are Global Open Data Index and Open Data Barometer. The Global Open Data Index evaluates an open data portal from 11 different aspects based on the [[The Open Definition|Open Definition]] of open data, while the Open Data Barometer adds two more indices compared to the previous one.

== Scoring standard ==
According to the service offered by [[Open Knowledge International]], they run a measurement called "Global Open Data Index" which is "an annual effort to measure the state of open government data around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://index.okfn.org/about/|title=Open Data Index - Open Knowledge|last=Knowledge|first=Open|website=Open Data Index|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; And they evaluate the openness of an open dataset according to the following questions:

=== 1. Does the data exist? (5 marks) ===

The Open Knowledge Foundation specifically indicates that the data of an open data portal should be directly comes from the official government department or a third party with the permission of the government that they can fully represent the government. And if so, the third party should explicitly states the permission.

=== 2. Is data in digital form? (5 marks) ===

This question does not examines if the data can be accessed online or by public but if the data exists in any digital format.

=== 3. Publicly available? (5 marks) ===

A data could be considered as publicly available when it can be accessed without any permission or password by every individual (not just government officers) and there is no restrictions for the amount of photocopies can be made if the data is in the paper form. For this question, it does not matter if the data is in paper form or digital form.

=== 4. Is the data available for free? (15 marks) ===

The data is available for free if the access of the data does not require any forms of charges.

=== 5. Is the data available online? (5 marks) ===

The data is available online if it can be accessed through the Internet from an official source.

=== 6. Is the data machine-readable? (15 marks) ===

This question addresses whether the data is in a form that can be easily processed by the computer. File types such as XLS, CSV, JSON, XML are considered as machine-readable, while PDF, or HTML are not.

=== 7. Available in bulk? (10 marks) ===

If the whole dataset can be easily downloaded, it can be considered as available in bulk.

=== 8. Openly licensed? (30 marks) ===

This question addresses whether the data can be freely used, reused, and redistributed by everyone without any restrictions. A list of types of licenses that meet the requirements is listed at http://opendefinition.org/licenses/.

=== 9. Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis? (10 marks) ===

This question examines if the data is updated on a regular basis. It requires personal judgement with rationale.

Each of these questions evaluates different aspects of a dataset, and each question is weighted differently based on the importance. There is in total 13 types of datasets. The final score is calculated according to following equation: sum of all datasets scores/1300 ( (the maximum possible score that a country can get) - sum (13 dataset)/1300 = index percentage. The Global Open Data Index  ranks each country according to their percentage of openness.

In addition, the [http://opendatabarometer.org/2ndEdition/about/method.html Open Data Barometer] adds two more question for their evaluation of the open data portal, and they are:

=== 10. Is the publication of the dataset sustainable? ===

=== 11. Are (linked) data URIs provided for key elements of the data? ===

An '''orbital replacement unit''' or '''orbital replaceable unit''' is a [[Line-replaceable unit|modular component]] of spacecraft that can be replaced upon failure either by robot or by [[extravehicular activity]]. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) was designed with 70 such parts,&lt;ref name=HST-ORU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://setas-www.larc.nasa.gov/HUBBLE/HARDWARE/hubble_ORU.html |title=Returned Hardware: Orbital Replacement Units |work=Hubble Space Telescope Archive System |publisher=NASA{{\}}Langley Research Center |first=William H. |last=Kinard |date= |accessdate=27 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219022932/http://setas-www.larc.nasa.gov/HUBBLE/HARDWARE/hubble_ORU.html |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including scientific instruments and limited-life items such as batteries.&lt;ref name=HST-ORU/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4797">'''Place theory''' is a [[theory]] of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] that states that our perception of sound depends on where each component [[frequency]] produces [[vibrations]] along the [[basilar membrane]].  By this theory, the [[pitch (psychophysics)|pitch]] of a sound, such as a human voice or a musical tone, is determined by the places where the membrane vibrates, based on frequencies corresponding to the [[tonotopic]] organization of the primary auditory neurons.&lt;ref name=mather&gt;{{cite book | title = Foundations of perception | author = George Mather | publisher = Psychology Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-86377-834-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oUNfSjS11ggC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=pitch+%22place+theory%22#PPA123,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite book | title = An introduction to the psychology of hearing | author = Brian C.

More generally, schemes that base attributes of auditory perception on the neural firing rate as a function of place are known as '''rate–place schemes'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Auditory Neural Processing of Speech | title = The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences | author = Bertrand Delgutte |editor1=William J.

The main alternative to the place theory is the [[temporal theory]],&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; also known as timing theory.&lt;ref name=mather/&gt;  These theories are closely linked with the volley principle or [[volley theory]],&lt;ref name=gelfand&gt;{{cite book | title = Essentials of Audiology | author = Stanley A. Gelfand | publisher = Thieme | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-58890-017-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UqXS8CLJML4C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22temporal+theory%22+%22volley+theory%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanism by which groups of neurons can encode the timing of a sound waveform.  In all cases, [[neural firing]] patterns in time determine the perception of pitch.  The combination known as the '''place–volley theory''' uses both mechanisms in combination, primarily coding low pitches by [[temporal pattern]] and high pitches by rate–place patterns.&lt;ref name=gelfand/&gt;  It is now generally believed that there is good evidence for both mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Pitch Perception Models | author = Alain d'Cheveigné | title = Pitch |editor1=Christopher J.

The place theory is usually attributed to [[Hermann Helmholtz]], though it was widely believed much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Practical Acoustics | author = Charles Lightfoot Barnes | pages = 160 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1897 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TQIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=cochlea+Corti+Helmholtz+intitle:acoustics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Young Gentleman and Lady's Philosophy: In a Continued Survey of the Works of Nature and Art by Way of Dialogue | author = Benjamin Martin | publisher = W.

Experiments to distinguish between place theory and rate theory are difficult to devise, because of the strong correlation: large vibrations with low rate are produced at the apical end of the basilar membrane while large vibrations with high rate are produced at the basal end. The two can be controlled independently using [[cochlear implant]]s: pulses with a range of rates can be applied via electrodes distributed along the membrane. Experiments using implant recipients showed that, at low stimulation rates, ratings of pitch on a pitch scale were proportional to the log of stimulation rate, but also decreased with distance from the round window. At higher rates, the effect of rate was weaker, but the effect of place was strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fearn R, Carter P, Wolfe J |title=The perception of pitch by users of cochlear implants: possible significance for rate and place theories of pitch |journal=Acoustics Australia |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=41–43 |year=1999 | url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/Fearnetal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reciprocal determinism''' is the theory set forth by [[psychologist]] [[Albert Bandura]] which states that a person's behavior both influences and is influenced by [[personality psychology|personal factors]] and the [[social environment]]. Bandura accepts the possibility that an individual's behavior may be [[operant conditioning|conditioned]] through the use of consequences. At the same time he asserts that a person's behavior (and personal factors, such as cognitive skills or attitudes) can impact the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; These skill sets result in an under- or overcompensated ego that, for all creative purposes, is too strong or too weak to focus on pure outcome. This is important because Bandura was able to prove the strong correlation between this with experiments.

Bandura was able to show this when he created the Bandura's Box experiment.  As an example, Bandura's reciprocal determinism could occur when a child is acting out in school. The child doesn't like going to school; therefore, he/she acts out in class. This results in teachers and administrators of the school disliking having the child around. When confronted by the situation, the child admits he/she hates school and other peers don't like him/her. This results in the child acting inappropriately, forcing the administrators who dislike having him/her around to create a more restrictive environment for children of this stature. Each behavioral and environmental factor coincides with the child and so forth resulting in a continuous battle on all three levels.

Reciprocal determinism is the idea that behavior is controlled or determined by the individual, through cognitive processes, and by the environment, through external social stimulus events.  The basis of reciprocal determinism should transform individual behavior by allowing subjective thought processes transparency when contrasted with cognitive, environmental, and external social stimulus events.

Actions do not go one way or the other, as it is affected by repercussions, meaning one's behavior is complicated and can't be thought of as individual and environmental means. Behavior consist of environmental and individual parts that interlink together to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/108107398127355 | volume=3 | title=Perpetuating Passivity: Reliance and Reciprocal Determinism in Physician-Patient Interaction | journal=Journal of Health Communication | pages=233–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies showed reciprocal associations between people and their environments over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeronimus et al.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laceulle et al. | year = 2015 | title = Why Not Everyone Gets Their Fair Share of Stress: Adolescent's Perceived Relationship Affection Mediates Associations Between Temperament and Subsequent Stressful Social Events | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1989/full| journal = European Journal of Personality| volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1002/per.1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research conducted in this field include the study of doctor-patient relationships where one group of patients are termed 'physician-reliant' and the other group 'self-reliant'. The physician-reliant patients tend to be more passive in their decision making and rely on their physicians to make their choices for them. Self-reliant patients take a more active role in deciding which health options would better suit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akoul|first=Gregory M.|title=Perpetuating Passivity: Reliance and Reciprocal Determinism in Physician-Patient Interaction|journal=Journal of Health Communication: Internal Perspectives|volume=3|series=3|pages=233–259|doi=10.1080/108107398127355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===

Another relevant research is regarding the reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and mathematical performance. It shows that reciprocal determinism may not be the appropriate model in all cultures but does take place in most. Self-efficacy is a conceptualized assessment of the person's competence to perform a specific task. Self-efficacy results from success or failures that arise in attempts to learn a task. Self-efficacy, measure by a personal confidence level before each question, and the mathematical scores were obtained in 41 countries for the study by Kitty and Trevor Williams. The reciprocal determinism of mathematics self-efficacy and achievement was found in 26 of the 30 nations. They suggest that this might be a fundamental psychological process that takes place across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Williams et al.|title=Self-Efficacy and Performance in Mathematics: Reciprocal Determinism in 33 Nations|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|pages=453–466|doi=10.1037/a0017271|volume=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Albert Bandura, [[self-efficacy]] is defined as a person's belief in their capability to accomplish a certain task. Another study looked at the relationship of self-efficacy and job culture with job satisfaction among athletic trainers. The study used Bandura's triadic reciprocal causation model as a template to label job satisfaction as the behavioural factor, self-efficacy as the personal factor, and job culture as the environmental factor.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/305027215&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;!--Please clarify what is meant by "reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and performance" and in what way this may not be the appropriate model in all cultures.--&gt;

==Triadic reciprocal causation==
'''Triadic reciprocal causation''' is a term introduced by [[Albert Bandura]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rU9MRvYIh5YC&amp;pg=PA473&amp;lpg=PA473&amp;dq=triadic+reciprocal+causation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=W1H85MGefi&amp;sig=DbAABuTNweBRbLSL6jQ15Pk7bAA ''Psychology: An International Perspective'' by Michael W. Eysenck, p. 473].&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the mutual influence between three sets of factors:
* personal factors (e.g., [[cognitive]], [[affective]] and [[biological]] events),
* the environment,
* [[behavior]]

==Interaction of genes and environment==
[[Behavioral genetics]] is a relatively new field of study attempting to make sense of both [[Heredity|genetic]] and environmental contributions to individual variations in human behavior. Genes can be turned on and off. Multiple genes are factors in forming behavior traits.

===Aggression in abused boys===
Researchers believe there is a genetic link to impulsive aggression through the impact of a gene on the production of an [[enzyme]] called [[Monoamine oxidase A]] (MAOA).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer-Lindenberg, Andreas, et al. December 30, 2005. [http://intramural.nimh.nih.gov/research/pubs/lindenberg01.pdf Neural mechanisms of genetic risk for impulsivity and violence in humans.] NIMH. Accessed August 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The MAOA gene reduces the production of MAOA, leading to increased incidents of impulsive aggression. A 26-year study in [[New Zealand]] found strong correlation between experience of [[childhood abuse]] and criminal or violent behavior in males with the MAOA gene.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/01/health/main517241.shtml Study: Abuse And Genetics = Aggression] August 1, 2002. Accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In that study, impulsive aggression was found to be nine times more likely to manifest in males with the gene who were [[abused]] than in abused males without the gene or males with the gene who had not been abused.

'''Robert Edwards Carter Stearns'''  (1 February 1827, [[Boston]] – 27 July 1909, Los Angeles) was an American [[conchologist]].

Robert Stearns was passionate about [[natural history]] in his youth. Later he specialised in conchology, especially that of the [[West Coast of the United States]]. He was a member of the [[United States Fish Commission|Fisheries Commission]] (1882–1884) and Secretary of the [[University of California]] (Berkeley) (1874–1882). He became Assistant Curator of Molluscs at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] (1885–1892). Stearns married Mary Ann Libby on 28 March 1850.They had one child, a daughter.

{{about|the rule of succession in probability theory|monarchical and presidential rules of succession|Order of succession}}
{{redirect|Laplace–Bayes estimator|statistical estimators that maximize posterior expected utility or minimize posterior expected loss|Bayes estimator}}

In [[probability theory]], the '''rule of succession''' is a formula introduced in the 18th century by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in the course of treating the [[sunrise problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, Pierre-Simon (1814). Essai philosophique sur les probabilités. Paris: Courcier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula is still used, particularly to estimate underlying probabilities when there are few observations, or for events that have not been observed to occur at all in (finite) sample data.  Assigning events a [[zero probability]] contravenes [[Cromwell's rule]]; such contravention can never be strictly justified in physical situations, albeit sometimes must be assumed in practice.

==Statement of the rule of succession==
If we repeat an experiment that we know can result in a success or failure, ''n'' times independently, and get ''s'' successes, then what is the probability that the next repetition will succeed?

More abstractly: If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; are [[conditional independence|conditionally independent]] [[random variable]]s that each can assume the value 0 or 1, then, if we know nothing more about them,

:&lt;math&gt;P(X_{n+1}=1 \mid X_1+\cdots+X_n=s)={s+1 \over n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretation==
Since we have the prior knowledge that we are looking at an experiment for which both success and failure are possible, our estimate is as if we had observed one success and one failure for sure before we even started the experiments.  In a sense we made ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 observations (known as [[pseudocount]]s) with ''s''+1 successes. Although this may seem the simplest and most reasonable assumption, which also happens to be true, it still requires a proof. Indeed, assuming a pseudocount of one per possibility is one way to generalise the binary result, but has unexpected consequences — see [[rule of succession#Generalization to any number of possibilities|Generalization to any number of possibilities]], below.

Nevertheless, if we had '''not''' known from the start that both success and failure are possible, then we would have had to assign

:&lt;math&gt;P'(X_{n+1}=1 \mid X_1+\cdots+X_n=s)={s \over n}.&lt;/math&gt;

But see [[rule_of_succession#Mathematical_details|Mathematical details]], below, for an analysis of its validity.  In particular it is not valid when &lt;math&gt;s=0&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;s=n&lt;/math&gt;.

If the number of observations increases, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt; get more and more similar, which is intuitively clear: the more data we have, the less importance should be assigned to our prior information.

==Historical application to the sunrise problem==
Laplace used the rule of succession to calculate the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has risen every day for the past 5000 years.  One obtains a very large factor of approximately 5000 &amp;times; 365.25, which gives odds of 1826251:1 in favour of the sun rising tomorrow.

However, as the mathematical details below show, the basic assumption for using the rule of succession would be that we have no prior knowledge about the question whether the sun will or will not rise tomorrow, except that it can do either.  This is not the case for sunrises.

Laplace knew this well, and he wrote to conclude the sunrise example: “But this number is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle regulating the days and seasons, realizes that nothing at the present moment can arrest the course of it.”{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Yet Laplace was ridiculed for this calculation; his opponents{{Who?|date=April 2013}} gave no heed to that sentence, or failed to understand its importance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In the 1940s, [[Rudolf Carnap]] investigated a probability-based theory of [[inductive reasoning]], and developed measures of degree of confirmation, which he considered as alternatives to Laplace's rule of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy of Science| year=1945| volume=12| issue=2| pages=72–97| url=http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/philosophische_fakultaet/iph/thph/braeuer/lehre/induktion_projektion/CarnapOnInductiveLogic.pdf| doi=10.1086/286851}}; here: p.86, 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920| jstor=2102920}}; here: p.145&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[New riddle of induction#Carnap]].

==Mathematical details==
The proportion ''p'' is assigned a uniform distribution to describe the uncertainty about its true value. (This proportion is not random, but uncertain.  We assign a probability distribution to ''p'' to express our uncertainty, not to attribute randomness to&amp;nbsp;''p''.  But this amounts, mathematically, to the same thing as treating ''p as if'' it were random).

Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be 1 if we observe a "success" on the ''i''th [[Bernoulli trial|trial]], otherwise 0, with probability ''p'' of success on each trial.  Thus each ''X'' is 0 or 1; each ''X'' has a [[Bernoulli distribution]].  Suppose these ''X''s are [[conditional independence|conditionally independent]] given ''p''.

[[Bayes' theorem]] says that to find the conditional probability distribution of ''p'' given the data ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'', one multiplies the "[[Prior probability|prior]]" (i.e., marginal) probability measure assigned to ''p'' by the [[likelihood function]]

:&lt;math&gt;L(p)=P(X_1=x_1, \ldots, X_n=x_n \mid p)=\prod_{i=1}^n p^{x_i}(1-p)^{1-x_i}=p^s (1-p)^{n-s}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of "successes" and ''n'' is of course the number of trials, and then [[normalizing constant|normalizes]], to get the "posterior" (i.e., conditional on the data) probability distribution of ''p''.  (We are using capital ''X'' to denote a random variable and lower-case ''x'' either as the [[bound variable|dummy]] in the definition of a function or as the data actually observed.)

The prior [[probability density function]] that expresses total ignorance of ''p'' except for the certain knowledge that it is neither 1 nor 0 (i.e., that we know that the experiment can in fact succeed or fail) is equal to 1 for 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and equal to 0 otherwise.  To get the normalizing constant, we find

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 p^s(1-p)^{n-s}\,dp={s!(n-s)! \over (n+1)!}&lt;/math&gt;

(see [[beta function]] for more on integrals of this form).

The posterior probability density function is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;f(p)={(n+1)! \over s!(n-s)!}p^s(1-p)^{n-s}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[beta distribution]] with [[expected value]]

::&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 p f(p)\,dp = {s+1 \over n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the conditional probability for success in the next experiment, given the value of ''p'', is just ''p'', the [[law of total probability]] tell us that the probability of success in the next experiment is just the expected value of ''p''.  Since all of this is conditional on the observed data ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;P(X_{n+1}=1 \mid X_i=x_i\text{ for }i=1,\dots,n)={s+1 \over n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The same calculation can be performed with the prior that expresses total ignorance of ''p'', including ignorance with regards to the question whether the experiment can succeed, or can fail.  This prior, except for a normalizing constant, is 1/(''p''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'')) for 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and 0 otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.org.uk/priors/noninformative/Smith.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  If the calculation above is repeated with this prior, we get

:&lt;math&gt;P'(X_{n+1}=1 \mid X_i=x_i\text{ for }i=1,\dots,n)={s \over n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, with the prior specifying total ignorance, the probability of success is governed by the observed frequency of success.  However, the posterior distribution that led to this result is the Beta(''s'',''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''s'') distribution, which is not proper when ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' or ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (i.e. the normalisation constant is infinite when ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'').  This means that we cannot use this form of the posterior distribution to calculate the probability of the next observation succeeding when ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''.  This puts the information contained in the rule of succession in greater light: it can be thought of as expressing the prior assumption that if sampling was continued indefinitely, we would eventually observe at least one success, and at least one failure in the sample.  The prior expressing total ignorance does not assume this knowledge.

To evaluate the "complete ignorance" case when ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' can be dealt with by first going back to the [[hypergeometric distribution]], denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hyp}(s|N,n,S)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the approach taken in Jaynes(2003).  The binomial &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Bin}(r|n,p)&lt;/math&gt; can be derived as a limiting form, where &lt;math&gt;N,S \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that their ratio &lt;math&gt;p={S \over N}&lt;/math&gt; remains fixed.  One can think of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as the number of successes in the total population, of size &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent prior to &lt;math&gt;{1 \over p(1-p)}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{1 \over S(N-S)}&lt;/math&gt;, with a domain of &lt;math&gt;1\leq S \leq N-1&lt;/math&gt;.  Working conditional to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; means that estimating &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to estimating &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and then dividing this estimate by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  The posterior for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be given as:

: &lt;math&gt;P(S|N,n,s) \propto {1 \over S(N-S)} {S \choose s}{N-S \choose n-s}
\propto {S!(N-S)! \over S(N-S)(S-s)!(N-S-[n-s])!}
&lt;/math&gt;

And it can be seen that, if ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' or ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then one of the factorials in the numerator cancels exactly with one in the denominator.  Taking the ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 case, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;P(S|N,n,s=0) \propto {(N-S-1)! \over S(N-S-n)!} = {\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-S-j) \over S}
&lt;/math&gt;

Adding in the normalising constant, which is always finite  (because there is no singularities in the range of the posterior, and there are a finite number of terms) gives:

: &lt;math&gt;P(S|N,n,s=0) = {\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-S-j) \over S \sum_{R=1}^{N-n}{\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-R-j) \over R}}
&lt;/math&gt;

So the posterior expectation for &lt;math&gt;p={S \over N}&lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;E\left({S \over N}|n,s=0,N\right)={1 \over N}\sum_{S=1}^{N-n}S P(S|N,n=1,s=0)={1 \over N}{\sum_{S=1}^{N-n}\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-S-j) \over \sum_{R=1}^{N-n}{\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-R-j) \over R}}
&lt;/math&gt;

An approximate analytical expression for large ''N'' is given by first making the approximation to the product term:

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-R-j)\approx (N-R)^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and then replacing the summation in the numerator with an integral

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{S=1}^{N-n}\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-S-j)\approx \int_1^{N-n}(N-S)^{n-1} \, dS = {(N-1)^n-n^n \over n}\approx {N^n \over n}&lt;/math&gt;

The same procedure is followed for the denominator, but the process is a bit more tricky, as the integral is harder to evaluate

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{R=1}^{N-n}{\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}(N-R-j) \over R} &amp; \approx \int_1^{N-n}{(N-R)^{n-1}\over R} \, dR \\
&amp; = N\int_1^{N-n} {(N-R)^{n-2}\over R} \, dR - \int_1^{N-n}(N-R)^{n-2} \, dR \\
&amp; = N^{n-1}\left[\int_1^{N-n}{dR\over R}-{1\over n-1} + O\left({1\over N}\right)\right]
\approx N^{n-1}\ln(N)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ln is the [[natural logarithm]] plugging in these approximations into the expectation gives

: &lt;math&gt;E\left({S \over N}|n,s=0,N\right)\approx {1 \over N}{{N^n \over n}\over N^{n-1}\ln(N)}={1 \over n [\ln(N)]}={\log_{10}(e) \over n [\log_{10}(N)]}={0.434294 \over n [\log_{10}(N)]}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the base 10 [[logarithm]] has been used in the final answer for ease of calculation.  For instance if the population is of size ''10''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; then probability of success on the next sample is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;E\left({S \over N} \mid n,s=0,N=10^k \right)\approx {0.434294 \over nk}&lt;/math&gt;

So for example, if the population be on the order of tens of billions, so that ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10, and we observe ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10 results without success, then the expected proportion in the population is approximately 0.43%.  If the population is smaller, so that ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10, ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 (tens of thousands), the expected proportion rises to approximately 0.86%, and so on.  Similarly, if the number of observations is smaller, so that ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10, the proportion rise to approximately 0.86% again.

This probability has no positive lower bound, and can be made arbitrarily small for larger and larger choices of ''N'', or ''k''.  This means that the probability depends on the size of the population from which one is sampling.  In passing to the limit of infinite ''N'' (for the simpler analytic properties) we are "throwing away" a piece of very important information.  Note that this ignorance relationship only holds as long as only no successes are observed.  It is correspondingly revised back to the observed frequency rule &lt;math&gt;p={s \over n}&lt;/math&gt; as soon as one success is observed.  The corresponding results are found for the ''s=n'' case by switching labels, and then subtracting the probability from&amp;nbsp;1.

== Generalization to any number of possibilities ==
This section gives a heuristic derivation to that given in ''Probability Theory: The Logic of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E.T. (2003), Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of succession has many different intuitive interpretations, and depending on which intuition one uses, the generalisation may be different.  Thus, the way to proceed from here is very carefully, and to re-derive the results from first principles, rather than to introduce an intuitively sensible generalisation.  The full derivation can be found in Jaynes' book, but it does admit an easier to understand alternative derivation, once the solution is known.  Another point to emphasise is that the prior state of knowledge described by the rule of succession is given as an enumeration of the possibilities, with the additional information that it is possible to observe each category. This can be equivalently stated as observing each category once prior to gathering the data.  To denote that this is the knowledge used, an ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is put as part of the conditions in the probability assignments.

The rule of succession comes from setting a binomial likelihood, and a uniform prior distribution.  Thus a straightforward generalisation is just the multivariate extensions of these two distributions: 1)Setting a uniform prior over the initial m categories, and 2) using the [[multinomial distribution]] as the likelihood function (which is the multivariate generalisation of the binomial distribution).  It can be shown that the uniform distribution is a special case of the [[Dirichlet distribution]] with all of its parameters equal to 1 (just as the uniform is Beta(1,1) in the binary case).  The Dirichlet distribution is the [[conjugate prior]] for the multinomial distribution, which means that the posterior distribution is also a Dirichlet distribution with different parameters.  Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the probability that category ''i'' will be observed, and let ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the number of times category ''i'' (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m'') actually was observed.  Then the joint posterior distribution of the probabilities ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by;

: &lt;math&gt;
f(p_1,\ldots,p_m \mid n_1,\ldots,n_m,I) =  
 \begin{cases} { \displaystyle 
 \frac{\Gamma\left( \sum_{i=1}^m (n_i+1) \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^m \Gamma(n_i+1)}
p_1^{n_1}\cdots p_m^{n_m}
}, \quad &amp;
 \sum_{i=1}^m p_i=1 \\  \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

To get the generalised rule of succession, note that the probability of observing category ''i'' on the next observation, conditional on the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is just ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, we simply require its expectation.  Letting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the event that the next observation is in category ''i'' (''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''), and let ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be the total number of observations made.  The result, using the properties of the dirichlet distribution is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A_i | n_1,\ldots,n_m, I_m)={n_i + 1 \over n + m}. &lt;/math&gt;

This solution reduces to the probability that would be assigned using the principle of indifference before any observations made (i.e. ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), consistent with the original rule of succession.  It also contains the rule of succession as a special case, when ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, as a generalisation should.

Because the propositions or events ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are mutually exclusive, it is possible to collapse the ''m'' categories into&amp;nbsp;2.  Simply add up the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; probabilities that correspond to "success" to get the probability of success.  Supposing that this aggregates ''c'' categories as "success" and ''m-c'' categories as "failure".  Let ''s'' denote the sum of the relevant ''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; values that have been termed "success". The probability of "success" at the next trial is then:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{success}| n_1,\ldots,n_m, I_m)={s + c \over n + m}, &lt;/math&gt;

which is different from the original rule of succession.  But note that the original rule of succession is based on ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the generalisation is based on ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This means that the information contained in ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is different from that contained in ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This indicates that mere knowledge of more than two outcomes we know are possible is relevant information when collapsing these categories down to just two.  This illustrates the subtlety in describing the prior information, and why it is important to specify which prior information one is using.

== Further analysis ==
A good model is essential (i.e., a good compromise between accuracy and practicality). To paraphrase [[Laplace]] on the [[sunrise problem]]: Although we have a huge number of samples of the sun rising, there are far better models of the sun than assuming it has a certain probability of rising each day, e.g., simply having a half-life.

Given a good model, it is best to make as many observations as practicable, depending of the expected reliability of prior knowledge, cost of observations, time and resources available, and accuracy required.

One of the most difficult aspects of the rule of succession is not the mathematical formulas, but answering the question: When does the rule of succession apply? In the generalisation section, it was noted very explicitly by adding the prior information ''I''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; into the calculations.  Thus, when all that is known about a phenomenon is that there are ''m'' known possible outcomes prior to observing any data, only then does the rule of succession apply.  If the rule of succession is applied in problems where this does not accurately describe the prior state of knowledge, then it may give counter-intuitive results.  This is not because the rule of succession is defective, but that it is effectively answering a different question, based on different prior information.

In principle (see [[Cromwell's rule]]), no possibility should have its probability (or its pseudocount) set to zero, since nothing in the physical world should be assumed strictly impossible (though it may be)—even if contrary to all observations and current theories. Indeed, [[Bayes rule]] takes ''absolutely '' no account of an observation previously believed to have zero probability—it is still declared impossible.  However, only considering a fixed set of the possibilities is an acceptable route, one just needs to remember that the results are conditional on (or restricted to) the set being considered, and not some "universal" set.  In fact Larry Bretthorst &lt;ref&gt;Page 55 – G. Larry Bretthost.  Bayesian Spectrum Analysis and parameter estimation.  PhD thesis 1988.  available at http://bayes.wustl.edu/glb/book.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; shows that including the possibility of "something else" into the hypothesis space makes no difference to the relative probabilities of the other hypothesis - it simply renormalises them to add up to a value less than 1.  Until "something else" is specified, the likelihood function conditional on this "something else" is indeterminate, for how is one to determine &lt;math&gt; Pr(\text{data} | \text{something else},I) &lt;/math&gt;?.  Thus no updating of the prior probability for "something else" can occur until it is more accurately defined.

However, it is sometimes debatable whether prior knowledge should affect the relative probabilities, or also the total weight of the prior knowledge compared to actual observations.  This does not have a clear cut answer, for it depends on what prior knowledge one is considering.  In fact, an alternative prior state of knowledge could be of the form "I have specified ''m'' potential categories, but I am sure that only one of them is possible prior to observing the data.  However, I do not know which particular category this is."  A mathematical way to describe this prior is the dirichlet distribution with all parameters equal to ''m''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which then gives a pseudocount of ''1'' to the denominator instead of ''m'', and adds a pseudocount of ''m''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; to each category.  This gives a slightly different probability in the binary case of &lt;math&gt;\frac{s+0.5}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Prior probabilities are only worth spending significant effort estimating when likely to have significant effect. They may be important when there are few observations — especially when so few that there have been few, if any, observations of some possibilities – such as a rare animal, in a given region. Also important when there are many observations, where it is believed that the expectation should be heavily weighted towards the prior estimates, in spite of many observations to the contrary, such as for a roulette wheel in a well-respected casino. In the latter case, at least some of the [[pseudocount]]s may need to be very large. They are not always small, and thereby soon outweighed by actual observations, as is often assumed. However, although a last resort, for everyday purposes, prior knowledge is usually vital. So most decisions must be subjective to some extent (dependent upon the analyst and analysis used).

'''Samuel Stevens''' (11 March 1817 – 29 August 1899) was a natural history agent in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artaug09/bs-stevens.html Article in Micscape Magazine, August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/106453#page/3/mode/1up Obituary in Science Gossip v66,pp.161-162 (1899)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens was a keen entomological collector for much of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/42961#page/298/mode/1up Obituary in The Entomologist, 1899]&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a natural history agency from his shop at 24 Bloomsbury Street, London, from 1848 until 1867. Two of his earliest, and best known, clients were [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Henry Walter Bates]], supporting their joint collecting expedition to the Amazon and then Wallace's  journeys in the 'Malay Archipelago' by buying their specimens and displaying them to learned societies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/123052#page/509/mode/1up Obituary in The Zoologist, 1899]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is remembered in the specific name of the Jamaican snail,  ''Petitia stevensiana'' (now ''Fadyenia stevensiana''), named by [[Edward Chitty]] in 1857 “in compliment to the naturalist’s universal friend, S. Stevens, Esq., Bloomsbury Street, London.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/100996#page/196/mode/1up Proc.Zool.Soc.Lon. (1857), p184]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

ShelXle can display electron density maps like the macro molecular program [[Coot (program)]] but is more intended for smaller molecules.
A number of excellent graphical user interfaces (GUIs) exist for small molecule crystal structure refinement with SHELX (e.g., WINGX,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farrugia|first=Louis J.|title=WinGX suite for small-molecule single-crystal crystallography|journal=Journal of Applied Crystallography|date=1 August 1999|volume=32|issue=4|pages=837–838|doi=10.1107/S0021889899006020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olex2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dolomanov|first=Oleg V.|author2=Bourhis, Luc J. |author3=Gildea, Richard J. |author4=Howard, Judith A.

ShelXle is [[free software]], distributed under the GNU LGPL. It is available from the [http://www.shelxle.org/index.php ShelXle] web site or from [[SourceForge]] http://sourceforge.net/projects/shelxle/ . Binaries are available for Windows, macOS  and the Linux distributions [[SUSE Linux|SuSE]], [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].
The Windows binary is distributed with the [[Nullsoft Scriptable Install System|NSIS Installer]].

== Features ==

* Editor featuring [[Syntax highlighting]] and [[Code completion]] for the SHELX instructions.
* Clicking on an atom in the structure view sets the text cursor to the line that contains this atom.
* Locating atoms in structure view from the editor.
* '''Rename mode''' with support of '''residues''' and disordered '''parts''' and '''free variables'''.

== Program architecture ==

ShelXle uses the [[Qt (framework)]]. It is written entirely in [[C++]] and does not use any [[Scripting language]]. For the refinement it calls the external binary of SHELXL which might also be SHELXH, SHELXLMP from [[George M. Sheldrick]] or XL from [[Bruker]].

== SHELX ==

SHELX&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; is developed by [[George M. Sheldrick]] since the late 1960s. Important releases are SHELX76 and SHELX97. It is still developed but releases are usually after ten years of testing.  
Academic users can download the SHELX programs freely after registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shelx.uni-goettingen.de/|title=The SHELX homepage|website=shelx.uni-goettingen.de|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sulfur]]''' is an essential [[chemical element|element]] for growth and [[physiological]] functioning of [[plant]]s. However, its content strongly varies between plant [[species]] and it ranges from 0.1 to 6% of the plants' dry weight.

[[Sulfates]] taken up by the [[root]]s are the major sulfur source for growth, though it has to be reduced to [[sulfide]] before it is further metabolized. Root [[plastids]] contain all [[sulfate]] reduction [[enzymes]], but the reduction of sulfate to [[sulfide]] and its subsequent incorporation into cysteine predominantly takes place in the shoot, in the [[chloroplasts]].

[[Cysteine]] is the precursor or reduced sulfur donor of most other organic sulfur compounds in plants. The predominant proportion of the organic sulfur is present in the [[protein]] fraction (up to 70% of total sulfur), as [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]] (two amino acids) residues.

[[Cysteine]] and [[methionine]] are highly significant in the structure, conformation and function of [[proteins]]. Plants contain a large variety of other organic sulfur compounds, as [[thiols]] ([[glutathione]]), [[sulfolipid]]s and secondary sulfur compounds ([[alliin]]s, [[glucosinolate]]s, [[phytochelatins]]), which play an important role in [[physiology]] and protection against [[environmental stress]] and [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s.

Sulfur compounds are also of great importance for [[food quality]] and for the production of phyto-[[pharmaceutics]]. Sulfur deficiency will result in the loss of plant production, fitness and resistance to [[environmental stress]] and [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s.

==Sulfate uptake by plants==
[[Sulfate]] is taken up by the [[root]]s that have high affinity. The maximal sulfate uptake rate is generally already reached at sulfate levels of 0.1 mM and lower. The uptake of sulfate by the roots and its transport to the shoot is strictly controlled and it appears to be one of the primary regulatory sites of sulfur assimilation.

Sulfate is actively taken up across the [[plasma membrane]] of the [[root]] cells, subsequently loaded into the [[xylem]] vessels and transported to the shoot by the [[transpiration]] stream. The uptake and transport of sulfate is energy dependent (driven by a [[proton gradient]] generated by [[ATPases]]) through a proton/sulfate [[co-transport]]. In the shoot the sulfate is unloaded and transported to the chloroplasts where it is reduced. The remaining sulfate in plant tissue is predominantly present in the [[vacuole]], since the concentration of sulfate in the [[cytoplasm]] is kept rather constant.

Distinct sulfate transporter proteins mediate the uptake, transport and subcellular distribution of sulfate. According to their cellular and subcellular [[gene expression]], and possible functioning the sulfate [[Membrane transport protein|transporters]] [[gene family]] has been classified in up to 5 different groups. Some groups are expressed exclusively in the roots or shoots or expressed both in the roots and shoots.

* Group 1 are 'high affinity sulfate transporters', which are involved in the uptake of sulfate by the roots. 
* Group 2 are [[Vascular tissue|vascular]] transporters and are 'low affinity sulfate transporters'.
* Group 3 is the so-called 'leaf group', however, still little is known about the characteristics of this group. 
* Group 4 transporters are involved in the efflux of sulfate from the [[vacuole]]s, whereas the function of Group 5 sulfate transporters is not known yet, and likely function only as molybdate transporters.

Regulation and expression of the majority of sulfate transporters are controlled by the sulfur [[nutrition]]al status of the plants. Upon sulfate deprivation, the rapid decrease in root sulfate is regularly accompanied by a strongly enhanced expression of most sulfate transporter genes (up to 100-fold), accompanied by a substantially enhanced sulfate uptake capacity. The nature of these transporters is not yet fully solved, whether sulfate itself or metabolic products of the sulfur assimilation ([[O-acetylserine]], [[cysteine]], [[glutathione]]) act as signals in the regulation of sulfate uptake by the root and its transport to the shoot, and in the expression of the sulfate transporters involved.

==Sulfate reduction in plants==
Even though [[root]] [[plastids]] contain all sulfate reduction [[enzymes]], sulfate reduction predominantly takes place in the leaf [[chloroplast]]s. The reduction of [[sulfate]] to [[sulfide]] occurs in three steps. Sulfate needs to be activated to [[adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate]] (APS) prior to its reduction to [[sulfite]].

The activation of sulfate is catalyzed by [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] sulfurylase, which affinity for sulfate is rather low (Km approximately 1 mM) and the in situ sulfate concentration in the chloroplast is most likely one of the limiting/regulatory steps in sulfur reduction. Subsequently, APS is reduced to sulfite, catalyzed by APS reductase with likely [[glutathione]] as [[reductant]].

The latter reaction is assumed to be one of the primary regulation points in the sulfate reduction, since the activity of APS reductase is the lowest of the enzymes of the sulfate reduction pathway and it has a fast turnover rate. [[Sulfite]] is with high affinity reduced by [[sulfite reductase]] to [[sulfide]] with [[ferredoxin]] as a reductant. The remaining sulfate in plant tissue is transferred into the [[vacuole]]. The remobilization and redistribution of the vacuolar sulfate reserves appear to be rather slow and sulfur-deficient plants may still contain detectable levels of sulfate.

==Synthesis and function of sulfur compounds in plants==

===Cysteine===
[[Sulfide]] is incorporated into [[cysteine]], catalyzed by O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase, with O-acetylserine as substrate. The synthesis of O-acetylserine is catalyzed by [[serine]] acetyltransferase and together with O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase it is associated as enzyme complex named [[cysteine synthase]].

The formation of cysteine is the direct coupling step between sulfur ([[sulfur metabolism]]) and [[nitrogen assimilation]] in plants. This differs from the process in yeast, where sulfide must be incorporated first in [[homocysteine]] then converted in two steps to cysteine.

Cysteine is sulfur donor for the synthesis of [[methionine]], the major other sulfur-containing amino acid present in plants. This happens through the [[transsulfuration pathway]] and the methylation of [[homocysteine]].

Both cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing [[amino acids]] and are of great significance in the structure, conformation and function of [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]], but high levels of these amino acids may also be present in seed storage proteins. The thiol groups of the cysteine residues in proteins can be oxidized resulting in [[disulfide]] bridges with other cysteine [[side chain]]s (and form [[cystine]]) and/or linkage of [[polypeptides]].

Disulfide bridges ([[disulfide bond]]s) make an important contribution to the structure of proteins. The [[thiol]] groups are also of great importance in substrate binding of enzymes, in metal-sulfur clusters in proteins (e.g. [[ferredoxin]]s) and in regulatory proteins (e.g. [[thioredoxin]]s).

===Glutathione===

[[Glutathione]] or its homologues, e.g. homoglutathione in [[Fabaceae]]; hydroxymethylglutathione in [[Poaceae]] are the major water-soluble non-protein [[thiol]] compounds present in plant tissue and account for 1-2% of the total sulfur. The content of glutathione in plant tissue ranges from 0.1 - 3 mM. Cysteine is the direct precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (and its homologues). First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from cysteine and glutamate catalyzed by [[gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase]]. Second, glutathione is synthesized from γ-glutamylcysteine and [[glycine]] (in glutathione homologues, [[beta-Alanine|β-alanine]] or [[serine]]) catalyzed by glutathione synthetase. Both steps of the synthesis of glutathione are ATP dependent reactions. Glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by an [[NADPH]]-dependent [[glutathione reductase]] and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) generally exceeds a value of 7.
Glutathione fulfils various roles in plant functioning. In sulfur metabolism it functions as reductant in the reduction of APS to sulfite. It is also the major transport form of reduced sulfur in plants. Roots likely largely depend for their reduced sulfur supply on shoot/root transfer of glutathione via the [[phloem]], since the reduction of sulfur occurs predominantly in the chloroplast. Glutathione is directly involved in the reduction and assimilation of [[Selenite (ion)|selenite]] into [[selenocysteine]]. Furthermore, glutathione is of great significance in the protection of plants against oxidative and environmental stress and it depresses/scavenges the formation of toxic [[reactive oxygen species]], e.g. [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and lipid [[hydroperoxide]]s. Glutathione functions as reductant in the enzymatic detoxification of reactive oxygen species in the glutathione-[[ascorbate]] cycle and as thiol buffer in the protection of proteins via direct reaction with reactive oxygen species or by the formation of mixed disulfides. The potential of glutathione as protectant is related to the pool size of glutathione, its redox state (GSH/GSSG ratio) and the activity of [[glutathione reductase]]. Glutathione is the precursor for the synthesis of phytochelatins, which are synthesized enzymatically by a constitutive phytochelatin synthase. The number of γ-glutamyl-cysteine residues in the phytochelatins may range from 2 - 5, sometimes up to 11. Despite the fact that the [[phytochelatins]] form complexes which a few heavy metals, viz. [[cadmium]], it is assumed that these compounds play a role in heavy metal [[homeostasis]] and detoxification by buffering of the cytoplasmatic concentration of essential heavy metals. Glutathione is also involved in the detoxification of [[xenobiotic]]s, compounds without direct nutritional value or significance in metabolism, which at too high levels may negatively affect plant functioning. Xenobiotics may be detoxified in conjugation reactions with glutathione catalyzed by [[glutathione S-transferase]], which activity is constitutive; different xenobiotics may induce distinct [[isoform]]s of the enzyme. Glutathione S-transferases have great significance in [[herbicide]] detoxification and tolerance in agriculture and their induction by herbicide [[antidotes]] ('[[safeners]]') is the decisive step for the induction of herbicide tolerance in many crop plants. Under natural conditions glutathione S-transferases are assumed to have significance in the detoxification of lipid [[hydroperoxide]]s, in the conjugation of endogenous metabolites, [[hormones]] and [[DNA]] degradation products, and in the transport of [[flavonoids]].

===Sulfolipids===

[[Sulfolipid]]s are sulfur containing lipids. [[Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol]]s are the predominant sulfolipids present in plants. In leaves its content comprises up to 3 - 6% of the total sulfur present. This sulfolipid is present in [[plastid]] [[cell membrane|membrane]]s and likely is involved in [[chloroplast]] functioning. The route of [[biosynthesis]] and physiological function of sulfoquinovosyl [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] is still under investigation. From recent studies it is evident that [[sulfite]] it the likely sulfur [[wiktionary:Precursor|precursor]] for the formation of the [[sulfoquinovose]] group of this lipid.

===Secondary sulfur compounds===
[[Brassica]] species contain [[glucosinolate]]s, which are sulfur-containing [[secondary compounds]]. Glucosinolates are composed of a β-thioglucose moiety, a sulfonated oxime and a side chain. The synthesis of glucosinolates starts with the oxidation of the parent amino acid to an [[aldoxime]], followed by the addition of a thiol group (through conjugation with glutathione) to produce [[thiohydroximate]]. The transfer of a [[glucose]] and a sulfate moiety completes the formation of the glucosinolates.

The physiological significance of glucosinolates is still ambiguous, though they are considered to function as sink compounds in situations of sulfur excess. Upon tissue disruption glucosinolates are enzymatically degraded by [[myrosinase]] and may yield a variety of biologically active products such as [[isothiocyanate]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s, [[nitrile]]s and oxazolidine-2-thiones. The glucosinolate-myrosinase system is assumed to play a role in plant-[[herbivore]] and plant-[[pathogen]] interactions.

Furthermore, glucosinolates are responsible for the flavor properties of [[Brassicaceae]] and recently 
have received attention in view of their potential anti-[[carcinogenic]] properties.
[[Allium]] species contain γ-[[glutamylpeptides]] and [[alliin]]s (S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulfoxides). The content of these sulfur-containing [[secondary compound]]s strongly depends on stage of development of the plant, temperature, water availability and the level of nitrogen and sulfur nutrition. In onion [[bulbs]] their content may account for up to 80% of the organic sulfur fraction. Less is known about the content of secondary sulfur compounds in the seedling stage of the plant.

It is assumed that alliins are predominantly synthesized in the leaves, from where they are subsequently transferred to the attached bulb scale. The biosynthetic pathways of synthesis of γ-glutamylpeptides and alliins are still ambiguous. γ-Glutamylpeptides can be formed from cysteine (via γ-glutamylcysteine or glutathione) and can be metabolized into the corresponding alliins via oxidation and subsequent hydrolyzation by γ-glutamyl [[D-glutamyl transpeptidase|transpeptidase]]s.

However, other possible routes of the synthesis of γ-glutamylpeptides and alliins may not be excluded. Alliins and γ-glutamylpeptides are known to have therapeutic utility and might have potential value as phytopharmaceutics. The alliins and their breakdown products (e.g. [[allicin]]) are the flavor precursors for the odor and taste of species. Flavor is only released when plant cells are disrupted and the enzyme alliinase from the vacuole is able to degrade the alliins, yielding a wide variety of volatile and non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] sulfur-containing compounds. The physiological function of γ-glutamylpeptides and alliins is rather unclear.

== Sulfur metabolism in plants and air pollution ==
The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of [[air pollutant]]s including [[sulfur dioxide]] (see also [[acid rain]]) and [[hydrogen sulfide]], which may affect plant [[metabolism]]. Sulfur gases are potentially [[phytotoxicity|phytotoxic]], however, they may also be metabolized and used as sulfur source and even be beneficial if the sulfur [[fertilization]] of the roots is not sufficient.

Plant shoots form a sink for atmospheric [[sulfur]] gases, which can directly be taken up by the foliage (dry deposition). The foliar uptake of sulfur dioxide is generally directly dependent on the degree of opening of the [[stoma (botany)|stoma]]tes, since the internal resistance to this gas is low. Sulfur is highly soluble in the [[apoplast]]ic water of the [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]], where it [[dissociate]]s under formation of [[bisulfite]] and [[sulfite]].

Sulfite may directly enter the sulfur reduction pathway and be reduced to [[sulfide]], incorporated into cysteine, and subsequently into other sulfur compounds. Sulfite may also be oxidized to [[sulfate]], extra- and intracellularly by [[peroxidase]]s or non-enzymatically catalyzed by metal ions or [[superoxide]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] and subsequently reduced and assimilated again. Excessive sulfate is transferred into the vacuole; enhanced foliar sulfate levels are characteristic for exposed plants.
The foliar uptake of hydrogen sulfide appears to be directly dependent on the rate of its metabolism into cysteine and subsequently into other sulfur compounds. There is strong evidence that O-acetyl-serine (thiol)lyase is directly responsible for the active fixation of atmospheric hydrogen sulfide by plants.

Plants are able to transfer from sulfate to foliar absorbed atmospheric sulfur as sulfur source and levels of 60 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] or higher appear to be sufficient to cover the sulfur requirement of plants. There is an interaction between atmospheric and pedospheric sulfur utilization. For instance, hydrogen sulfide exposure may result in a decreased activity of APS reductase and a depressed sulfate uptake.

Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; known as "Madame Documentation,"&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Suzanne Briet, 1894-1989: 'Madame Documentation'." http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/briet.html. Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was a librarian, author, historian, poet, and visionary best known for her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' (''What is Documentation?''), a foundational text in the modern study of [[information science]]. She is also known for her writings on the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' offers a vision of documentation that moves beyond [[Paul Otlet]]'s emphasis on fixed forms of documents, such as the book, toward "an unlimited horizon of physical forms and aesthetic formats for documents and an unlimited horizon of techniques and technologies (and of 'documentary agencies' employing these) in the service of multitudes of particular cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many early [[Information science#European documentation|European Documentalists]], Briet embraced [[modernism|modernity]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; However, her work made a difference to modernism and science through the influence of [[French people|French]] [[post-structuralist]] theorists and her strong orientation toward humanistic scholarship. She subsequently ushered in a second generation of European Documentation and introduced humanistic methods and concerns, especially [[semiotics]] and [[cultural studies]], to [[information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in ''What Is Documentation?''." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Briet had been highly regarded throughout much of her career—the Grand Cross of the [[Légion d'honneur]] was conferred on her in 1950 — she was largely forgotten in her later life, until her death in 1989, when scholars found a renewed interest in her ideas. Today scholars often credit Briet as a visionary, having laid the foundation for contemporary frameworks and methodologies in information science roughly 50 years earlier. "Her modernist perspective," writes [[Michael Buckland]], "combined with semiotics, deserves attention now because it is different from, and offers an alternative to, the scientific, [[Positivism|positivist]] view that has so dominated information science and which is increasingly questioned."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Suzanne Briet was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 1 February 1894, coming of age at a time of great social change and economic loss in France after [[World War I]]. Although Briet grew up in [[Paris]], she remained attached to her birthplace and ancestral home. Briet was only 20 at the outbreak of the war. Ardennes was the pathway of German armies invading France, and during the hostilities her uncle was deported, his village was invaded, and her grandfather's house was destroyed. Historians have suggested that perhaps because of her experiences during the war, as well as her travels to [[England]] as a child, Briet took an early interest in the [[League of Nations]], sitting in on some of the sessions held in Paris, and the founding of other international organizations.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Briet's mother expected her to become a teacher. Briet's family sent her to Ecole de Sèvres, an elite women's school for training secondary school teachers, where she earned a degree in history and qualified to teach English and history. After teaching in Algeria from 1917 to 1920, Briet pursued a career in librarianship.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied with Louis Barrau-Dihigo at the [[Sorbonne]], who was apparently so taken with Briet's talents that "when Briet explained that she could only participate on Saturday, he changed the time of the course to accommodate her."&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At age 30 in 1924, Briet was one of the first of three women appointed as professional librarians at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]].&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"/&gt;

==Career==
Briet's career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale witnessed major changes in the library profession. Briet played a central role in the "modern library" movement, which eschewed elitist traditions that had dominated many libraries in favor of "modern" ideas of librarianship. In addition to technological innovations, Briet saw the emergence of documentation as a distinct profession with its own techniques, standards and training.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Women also entered the professional classes in France in increasing numbers during [[World War II]], growing from only 10% of the library profession in 1927 to 50% by the end of the war.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Her main achievements during these years were symbolic of her interest in service and moderninzation. Between 1934 and 1954, Briet created and supervised the Salle des Catalogues et Bibliographies, making available materials throughout France that had been previously restricted to most patrons. By 1931 she co-founded (with chemist [[Jean Gérard]]) the Union Française des Organismes de Documentation, the French analogue of the American Documentation Institution, today known as the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]].

During [[World War II]], Briet witnessed many of her colleagues deported during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of Paris]] and others arrested as communists. Despite a climate of fear, censorship, oppression and physical hardship, Briet made sure to carry out the catalog and bibliographic services of the Bibliothèque  Nationale. During the war, Briet continued her interest in Documentation, even attending a conference in [[Salzburg]], [[Germany]], which was organized by German Documentalists.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At the end of the war, Briet took on a larger role in a growing international documentation movement. In 1950, she prepared an international survey of education for librarians and documentalists commissioned by [[UNESCO]] and was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]]. In 1951 Briet helped establish the Institut National de Techniques de la Documentation at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]]. She was the founding Director of Studies and eventually the Vice-President of the [[International Federation for Documentation]].

That same year, Briet published her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'', in which she outlines, in 48 pages, her philosophy of documentation, "pushing boundaries of the field beyond texts to include any material form of evidence. ('Is a living animal a document?' she asked.)"&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Her thirty-year career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale often put Briet in close contact with major French thinkers of the day, including scientists, historians, linguists, and philosophers, which had a significant impact on her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Briet retired from the Bibliothèque  Nationale in 1954 at age 60. She wrote her last essays on documentation in 1955.&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Checklist of Writings" http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/Brietwebbib.pdf Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her retirement concentrating on other interests, including the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. Her memoirs were published in 1979.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"/&gt; She died in [[Boulogne]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt;

==Impact on information science==
Briet published roughly 100 essays, books, and reports on documentation, [[library science]], and [[history]]&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"/&gt; She took up many of the pressing issues of documentation in her day: [[internationalization]], [[institutionalization]], [[information overload|information or documentary overload]], [[scholarly communication]], [[science and technology studies]], [[world peace]], and [[international development]]. Briet had been deeply engaged in the documentation movement from the 1920s onward, bringing to it a deep understanding of culture and the humanities. Expanding on the techniques and technological ideas of earlier European Documentalists, such as [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]], "Briet understood that technology and culture were deeply connected. She saw society and, therefore, culture, as being re-shaped by technology. The techniques of documentation in aiding and shaping intellectual work were, in her view, both a symptom of, and contributing force within the 'industrialization' of knowledge workers. We can now see, in the impact of computers and telecommunications, how right she was."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar notes, "Not again -- until [[Actor-network theory]] at the end of the twentieth century -- would a social network account of technical production, and specifically, documentary production, be articulated."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Briet's body of work points to the necessity to understand cultural categories, historical lineages, and the social forces that create and sustain information, urging scholars and information professionals to explore beyond the boundaries of their cultural specialization. Paul Otlet problematized the definition of document when he opened the possibility of any object, independent of the human intention behind its creation, to be a considered a document. Briet solves this problem with her argument that a document must be defined by its intentional use as such. She gives the example of an antelope -- running wild in the plains, it is not a document, but captured and placed in a zoo, it becomes an object of study and thus a document. It operates, as Briet says it must, as “evidence in support of a fact”.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a 'document'?" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 48, no. 9 (Sept 1997): 804-809.&lt;/ref&gt; An object’s treatment as evidence is contingent not only on its own properties but on its very framing as a source of information. It must be organized into a meaningful relationship with other evidence in order to have the indexical power of evidence.

According to one scholar, "One of Briet's most important insights was that individual documents may be interpreted in different ways by different people wishing to put them to different uses for different purposes. This variability of interpretation is characteristic of documents even at the level of individual words, and the different decisions made by different translators at the word level can have significant consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Furner, Jonathan. (2008). "Review: What Is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. By Suzanne Briet. Translated and edited by Ronald E. Day and Laurent Martinet with Hermina G. B. Anghelescu." Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record 43.1, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Briet developed the notion of ''indice'' (literally "index") as not only pointing to an object but also reflective of the networks in which that object appears as a named thing, leading to a semiotics-inspired definition of "document." Furthermore, Briet argued that techniques and technologies are expressions of a networked culture. One scholar explains the idea this way: "Information and communication technologies may introduce a 'new rhythm' to society and culture, but they themselves are a "symptom" of Western social development."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, technique and technology are historically specific and symptomatic of culture. Briet argues that documentation must respond by incorporating these symptoms and specificities of Western culture but also must incorporate "Western modernity's opposite trend toward global expansion."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"/&gt; Briet also saw knowledge as embedded and emergent in cultural and social production and saw modernity as the growth of networks of knowledge. Indeed, in an increasingly globalized world, Briet argued for documentation to take up the call of material necessity rather than be put into the service of culture or any one culture; that is, "documentation marks the importance of particular, more 'localized' or specialized cultures in terms of their material needs, their specialized vocabularies, and the techniques and technologies needed to provide documentary services to these groups."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society hosts regular talks at the [[Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge)|Centre for Mathematical Sciences]], including in the past by many well-known speakers in the field of mathematics. It publishes two magazines, [[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|''Eureka'']] and ''QARCH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archim.org.uk/|title=The Archimedeans|last=|first=|date=|website=www.archim.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of several aims of the society, as laid down in its constitution, is to encourage co-operation between the existing mathematical societies of individual [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge colleges]], which at present are just the Adam's society of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] and the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]], but in the past have included many more.

The society is mentioned in [[G. H. Hardy]]'s essay [[A Mathematician's Apology]].

== Activity ==
The main focus of the society's activities are the regular talks, which generally concern topics from mathematics or theoretical physics, and are accessible to students on an undergraduate level. Among the list of recent speakers are [[Fields Medal|Fields medalists]] [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Wendelin Werner]] and [[Alain Connes]], as well as authors [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Simon Singh]]. Many of the speakers are international, and are hosted by The Archimedeans during their visit.

After exams and University-wide project deadlines, the society is also known to organise social events, which have shown to be highly popular.

== Publications ==
''Eureka'' is a mathematical journal that is published annually by The Archimedeans. It includes articles on a variety of topics in mathematics, written by students and academics from all over the world, as well as a short summary of the activities of the society, [[Problem set|problem sets]], puzzles, artwork and book reviews. The magazine has been published 60 times since 1939, and authors include many famous mathematicians and scientists such as [[Paul Erdős]], [[Martin Gardner]], [[Douglas Hofstadter]], [[Godfrey Hardy]], [[Béla Bollobás]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], Fields Medallist [[Timothy Gowers]] and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Paul Dirac]].

The journal is distributed free of charge to all current members of the Archimedeans. In addition, there are many subscriptions by other students, alumni and libraries. Subscriptions to ''Eureka'' are the society's main source of income.

The Archimedeans also publish ''QARCH'', a magazine containing problem sets and solutions or partial solutions submitted by readers. It is published on an irregular basis and distributed free of charge.

"'''The Future's So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades'''" is a song by [[Timbuk3]]. It is the opening track from their debut album, ''[[Greetings from Timbuk3]]''. Released as the album's first single in 1986, it was the band's only significant mainstream hit.

==Background==
The inspiration for the song, and the title specifically, came when [[Barbara Kooyman|Barbara MacDonald]] said to her husband singer/songwriter [[Pat MacDonald (musician)|Pat MacDonald]], "The future is looking so bright, we'll have to wear sunglasses!" But, while Barbara had made the comment in earnest – it was the early '80s, the two had met and married and were starting a family, their first EP was coming, their book was filling up with gigs – Pat heard the comment as an ironic quip and wrote down instead, "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades."&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;{{cite news|first= Margaret |last= Moser |title= The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades |newspaper= [[The Austin Chronicle]] |date= February 23, 2007 |accessdate= March 9, 2011 |url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2007-02-23/449447/ |quote= "'Oh, the future's so bright, we'll have to wear sunglasses!'" Kooyman teased. "Pat heard me say it, but he heard it with irony so he wrote down, 'The future's so bright I gotta wear shades.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, the lyrics to the song were born, but not the song as it ended up in the minds of popular culture. While Pat wrote a song of a young nuclear scientist and his rich future,&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; listening audiences heard a graduation theme song.

Pat revealed on VH1's ''[[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s]]'' that the meaning of the song was widely misinterpreted as a positive perspective in regard to the near future. Pat somewhat clarified the meaning by stating that it was, contrary to popular belief, a "grim" outlook. While not saying so directly, he hinted at the idea that the bright future was in fact due to impending [[nuclear holocaust]]. The "job waiting" after graduation signified the demand for nuclear scientists to facilitate such events. Pat drew upon the multitude of past predictions which transcend several cultures that foreshadow the world ending in the 1980s, along with the nuclear tension at the height of the [[Cold War]] to compile the song.

Two verses were written more explicitly portraying the ironic intent of the song. One went:

{{poemquote|Well I'm well aware of the world out there,
getting blown all to bits, but what do I care?}}

The other referred to a supporter of [[Ronald Reagan]] as "a flaming fascist". However, they were omitted from the final recording because MacDonald felt they were too heavy-handed and obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Gary |last= Graff |authorlink= Gary Graff |title= Timbuk 3's anti-nuke 'Shades' turns into misunderstood hit |newspaper= [[Orlando Sentinel]] |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-05-03/entertainment/0120430268_1_timbuk-3-future-so-bright-gotta-wear |date= May 3, 1987 |accessdate= October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they performed the song on ''[[The Joan Rivers Show]]'' in 1989, the third verse they sang was similar to the former omitted verse.

Similarly, the group's EP ''Looks Like Dark to Me'' contains a slower version of the song with an additional verse, making clear the dark nature of the song's intent:

{{poemquote|
Blowin' up the lab,
[[fellatio|Blowin']] the professor,
Torn between two evils,
I always pick the lesser.}}

That same EP's title track also refers back to this song:

{{quote|The future's been bright for so long now, it looks like dark to me}}

==Chart performance==
The song was the group's only major hit, reaching number 19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 14 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt; Additionally, the song reached number 21 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt;

'''''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science''''' is a general guide to the sciences written by [[Isaac Asimov]].  It was first published in 1960 by [[Basic Books]]. Revised versions were published as ''The New Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'' (1965), ''Asimov's Guide to Science'' (1972), and ''Asimov's New Guide to Science'' (1984). The book received positive reviews, praising it as a well-written work on science.

==Background==
Asimov was first contacted by Leon Svirsky of Basic Books in 1959 about the possibility of writing a book that would provide an overview of [[science]], and the two met at Asimov's home on 13 May to discuss the details.  Six days later, Asimov received a contract for the book, along with a $1500 advance.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|page=162}} At this point in his life, it had been just over a year since Asimov had given up his teaching duties at [[Boston University]] and taken up writing full-time.  He had published 11 nonfiction books, including books on [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], a college-level [[biochemistry]] textbook, and a collection of science essays.  However, he was momentarily daunted by the prospect of writing a major book on all of science, and he delayed signing the contract until 15 July, after receiving encouragement from his friend (and future wife) Janet Jeppson.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=165–166}}

The book's title was Svirsky's, chosen as a deliberate homage to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism]]'' (1928).  Asimov feared the title would be seen as elitist and condescending, and he suggested ''Everyone's Guide to Science'' as an alternative, but Svirsky refused.  Years later, when he was confronted by annoyed feminists who asked why the book was restricted to men, Asimov would claim that the "intelligent man" of the title referred to himself;{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=179–180}} thus anticipating the title ''Asimov's Guide to Science'' adopted for the third edition. Svirsky also wanted the book confined to scientific advances made in the 20th century.  Asimov, however, preferred to approach each field in a historical manner, starting with the ancient Greeks or, at the very least, [[Galileo Galilei]].  As often happened when Asimov was given editorial directions he disagreed with, he ignored them, and wrote the book just as he wanted to.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|page=183}} In organizing the various fields of science, Asimov chose to begin with the universe as a whole and work inward in narrowing circles until he was inside the brain at the end.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=179–180}}

Asimov began work on the book on 2 October, and found that he had no trouble with it at all, writing anywhere from 6000 to 10,000 words a day without any sense of strain.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=183–184}} By 27 January 1958, Asimov was able to deliver the first half of the completed manuscript to Basic Books,{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=185–186}} but at a meeting a month later, Svirsky suggested cutting the book in half so it could fit in one volume.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=188–189}} At that point, Asimov was only two chapters shy of finishing the book, but saw no reason to complete it if it would be subjected to such radical abridgment, and halted work.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|page=190}} He resumed work after being informed on 11 March that Svirsky would not try to reduce the book by half, but would instead publish it in two volumes.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=190–191}} Svirsky also insisted that the book include an introduction by the geneticist [[George Beadle]]. Asimov felt that his work didn't need an introduction by anyone else, and even though he found Beadle's introduction to be very elegant, he still resented its inclusion.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|page=195}} Asimov delivered the final chapters to Basic Books on 21 April,{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=193–194}} and the appendices on 4 May.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|page=194}}

When he began proofing the book's galleys, Asimov was horrified to find that Svirsky still cut out some 30% of the book's material.  Asimov reinserted as much information into the galley proofs as he could, but he remained unhappy with the book.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=195–196}}

==Publication history==
''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'' was first published in 1960 by [[Basic Books]]. It was published in revised editions as ''The New Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'' in 1965, ''Asimov's Guide to Science'' in 1972, and ''Asimov's New Guide to Science'' in 1984.{{sfn|Asimov|1984|pages=iv, xv–xvi}}

==Reception==
{{additional citations|section|date=January 2018}}
''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'' received positive reviews from the physicist [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and Floyd C. Gale in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'',{{sfn|Gale|1961|pages=144–147}} and a mixed review from John Pfeiffer in ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Price considered Asimov's work a novelty in popular science writing. He credited Asimov with surveying the whole of modern science. Gale credited Asimov with writing well and making difficult concepts easy to understand.{{sfn|Gale|1961|pages=144–147}} Gale considered the book well-written and credited Asimov with helping to make even difficult concepts easy to understand.{{sfn|Gale|1961|pages=144–147}} Pfeiffer wrote that Asimov tried to discuss too many aspects of science in the limited space available to him and compressed material "to a point where the result is almost a listing of developments with inadequate transitions in between". He concluded that Asimov had "prepared a good introduction to modern research" that "would have been better if he had allowed himself more space for the unique, imaginative writing of which he is so obviously capable."

''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'' was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in the nonfiction category, losing to the journalist [[William L. Shirer]]'s ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960).{{sfn|Asimov|1980|page=224}} Asimov has stated that ''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'' led to his recognition as a major figure in the field of science writing.{{sfn|Asimov|1980|pages=239–241}}

''Asimov's Guide to Science'' was reviewed by John Cheney in ''[[Contemporary Physics]]''.{{sfn|Cheney|1977|page=222}} ''Asimov's New Guide to Science'' received positive reviews from Paul Stuewe in ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'',{{sfn|Stuewe|1985|page=29}} Margrett J. McFadden in ''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'',{{sfn|McFadden|1985|page=205}} and Robert H. Bell in ''Science Books &amp; Films'',{{sfn|Bell|1985|page=293}} and a mixed review from E. L. Williams in ''Choice''.{{sfn|Williams|1985|page=1012}} The book was also reviewed by Jim Pirie in ''Chemical Engineer'',{{sfn|Pirie|1985|page=45}} and the geneticist [[H. Bentley Glass]] in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''.{{sfn|Glass|1986|pages=161–163}}

Stuewe considered the book well-written, and credited Asimov with covering developments in technology since the publication of ''Asimov's Guide to Science''.{{sfn|Stuewe|1985|page=29}} McFadden considered the book enjoyable to read, and praised Asimov for presenting new information "from dinosaurs to robots, the solar system to new physics discoveries".{{sfn|McFadden|1985|page=205}} Bell considered the book thorough and engaging, crediting Asimov with "encyclopedic knowledge of astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry" and "considerable understanding and knowledge of organic chemistry, cellular function and theory, microbiology, the human body and its needs, evolution, and the mind", and providing useful "figures, sketches, and maps".{{sfn|Bell|1985|page=293}} Williams complimented Asimov for his updated treatment of artificial intelligence, computers, cancer, the solar system, quasars, black holes, evolution, and the energy crisis, but considered it disappointing that there was no update on genetic engineering. Williams also commented that, "There are fewer photographs and their quality is not as good as in the 1972 edition. The table of contents has been divided into very helpful subheadings, making it easy to use as a quick reference. The name and subject indexes are good."{{sfn|Williams|1985|page=1012}}

'''''The Relaxation Response''''' is a book written in 1975 by [[Herbert Benson]], a Harvard physician, and Miriam Z. Klipper.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, copyright page&lt;/ref&gt; The response is a simple, secular version of [[Transcendental Meditation]] ("TM"), presented for people in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Benson writes in his book, "We claim no innovation but simply a scientific validation of age-old wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;Benson, pp. xxxii, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; People from the [[Transcendental Meditation]] movement, who felt they could reduce [[blood pressure]] using TM, visited [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1968, asking to be studied. The school, which at the time was studying the relationship of monkeys' behavior and blood pressure, told them "No, thank you." But when they persisted, Benson told them he would study them. He met with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] first to find out if he could agree in advance to any outcome, which Mahesh did. Benson mentions in his book that independent studies were already underway by then-PhD candidate R. Keith Wallace working with Archie Wilson at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], but that no published studies of TM existed.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, pp. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eliciting the response==
The Benson-Henry Institute at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] teaches how to elicit the response in nine steps. Benson's website and his book describe four steps.&lt;ref name=Forth&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Bring Forth the Relaxation Response|url=http://www.relaxationresponse.org/howto.htm|publisher=Herbert Benson|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those steps are essential: a mental device (a simple word, phrase or activity to repeat to keep the mind from wandering) and a passive attitude.&lt;ref name=Forth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mass&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliciting the Relaxation Response|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/bhi/basics/eliciting_rr.aspx|publisher=Benson Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital|accessdate=December 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130192936/http://www.massgeneral.org/bhi/basics/eliciting_rr.aspx|archivedate=November 30, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to activate the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], which causes humans to [[Relaxation technique|relax]].

==Fight-or-flight==
Benson developed the idea of the response, which counters the [[fight-or-flight response]] described during the 1920s by [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] at the Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=MacDonald, Ann|title=Using the relaxation response to reduce stress|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/using-the-relaxation-response-to-reduce-stress-20101110780|date=November 10, 2010|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benson more than 60 percent of all visits to healthcare providers are related to stress. It causes the “fight or flight” hormones, epinephrine and norepinephrine, to secrete into the bloodstream. This incites or exacerbates a number of conditions. They include hypertension, headaches, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic low back pain, as well as heart disease, stroke and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://giving.massgeneral.org/taking-charge-wellness-boston/ Taking Charge], Massachusetts General Hospital Magazine, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A physician with [[ABC News]] adds that the [[immune system]] works best when relaxed. He said about twenty [[Diaphragmatic breathing|deep breath]]s per day, done "with intention", can accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Dr. David Rakel|title=What Is The Relaxation Response?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/video/relaxation-response-9362175|date=December 17, 2009|publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a 1986 US national survey, reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'', this best-seller was the number one [[self-help book]] that clinical psychologists recommended to their patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Goleman, Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Goleman|title=Health: Feeling Gloomy?

The '''UK Household Longitudinal Study''' ('''UKHLS''') is now known as '''Understanding Society'''.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/|title=Homepage: understandingsociety.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest [[panel study|panel survey]] in the world, supporting social and economic research. Its sample size is 40,000 households from the [[United Kingdom]] or approximately 100,000 individuals.

==Structure==
Data collection, or fieldwork, began in January 2009 and the plan is to follow and interview annually the members of the original households (and their newly formed households, if applicable). The fieldwork period is 24 months, but each person is still interviewed annually, i.e., the fieldwork for consecutive waves overlap.

The study is mainly funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], and led by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)&lt;ref name="Iser.essex.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.iser.essex.ac.uk Iser.essex.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Essex]].

As a [[panel study|panel survey]], Understanding Society is a form of [[longitudinal study]] which means that the survey consists of information about the same individuals at regular intervals and so can be used to track changes in people's lives and attitudes over time. It can also be used to measure phenomena such as poverty persistence, unemployment duration, duration of marriage or cohabitation and analyze the factors that affect these durations. The study allows for deeper analysis of a wide range of sections of the population as they respond to regional, national and international change. Understanding Society will enhance our insight into the pathways that influence peoples longer term occupational trajectories; their health and well-being, their financial circumstances and personal relationships.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

From its second wave (starting in 2010) onwards the ''Understanding Society'' incorporates the [[British Household Panel Survey]], which has been carried out at ISER&lt;ref name="Iser.essex.ac.uk"/&gt; since 1991.

The ''Understanding Society'' is one of the first longitudinal surveys in UK to put ethnicity at the heart of the survey and include an ''Ethnic Minority Boost Sample'' (approximately 1000 adults from each of the five main ethnic minority groups: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African plus members of other minorities as identified in the screening).&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

The study will capture biomedical data on 20,000 participants and place this alongside rich social histories, helping us weigh the extent to which people's environment influences their health relative to their genetic make-up.

This study also consists of a methodological survey called the ''Innovation Panel'' which is conducted in the year prior to the main survey to enable research in key methodological issues such as the quality of new questions, methods to improve response rates, mode effects. This sample consists of 1500 households.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

The study hosts a ''biennial conference''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2014/12/08/call-for-abstracts-2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">'''Vladimir Jurko Glaser''' (April 21, 1924 – January 22, 1984) was a [[Croatia]]n [[theoretical physicist]] working on [[quantum field theory]] and the canonization of the analytic [[S-matrix]].

==Biography==
Glaser was born in [[Gorizia]], [[Italy]]. He graduated [[physics]] from the [[University of Zagreb]] in 1949 and later was attending seminar of [[Werner Heisenberg]] (1951-52) at [[Göttingen]]. Based on work carried out in [[Göttingen]] under [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] he received a doctorate degree from the [[University of Zagreb]]. Being a part of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] group at [[Göttingen]] he later worked with many famous physicists such as [[Harry Lehmann]], [[Wolfhart Zimmermann]] (on extensions of [[LSZ reduction formula|LSZ formalism]]) and [[Walter Thirring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | authors=V. Glaser; H. Lehmann; W. Zimmermann | title=Field operators and retarded functions | journal=Il Nuovo Cimento | year=1957 | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=1122-1128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Walter Thirring | title=The Joy of Discovery: Great Encounters Along the Way | publisher=University of Vienna, Austria &amp; CERN, Switzerland | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1957 he was head of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the [[Ruđer Bošković Institute]] in [[Zagreb]]. In 1957 he found a [[permanent employment]] at the Department  of Theoretical  Physics of [[CERN]], [[Geneva]]. He died in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio2"/&gt;

In 1955, he published one of the first monographs on [[quantum electrodynamics]], ''Kovarijantna kvantna elektrodinamika'' (in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Vladimir Glaser | title=Kovarijantna kvantna elektrodinamika | publisher=Yugoslav Academy of Arts and Sciences | year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[French people|French]] physicists [[Jacques Bros]] and [[Henri Epstein]] he worked on setting up analyticity properties required for the use of dispersion relations in high energy collisions.&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt; [[Henri Epstein|Epstein]], Glaser and [[Arthur Jaffe]] proved  that (Wightman) quantum fields can necessarily have negative energy density values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | authors=H. Epstein; V. Glaser; A. Jaffe | title=Nonpositivity of the Energy Density in Quantized Field Theories | journal=Nuovo Cimento | year=1965 | volume=36 | pages=1016-1022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Henri Epstein]], he found a new approach to [[renormalization]] theory called [[causal perturbation theory]], where [[ultraviolet divergence]]s are avoided in the calculation of [[Feynman diagrams]] by using mathematically well-defined quantities only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | authors=Epstein, H; Jurko, Vladimir Glaser | title=The role of locality in perturbation theory | journal=Ann. Inst. Henri Poincare, Sect. A | year=1973 | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=211-295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
