The '''866''' is a [[Mercury-arc valve|mercury vapor]] [[Rectifier#Half-wave rectification|half-wave rectifier]] intended for [[high-voltage]] applications. The voltage drop is approximately 15&amp;nbsp;volts up to 150&amp;nbsp;Hz. To avoid unwanted shorts the tube must be operated in a vertical position and the [[Heating element|filament]] preheated for at least 30 seconds before applying the plate voltage.

==Construction==
Structurally, it consists of a linear [[electrode]] arrangement; a cup shaped anode with top cap and a cylindrical [[cathode]]. The socket is a medium 4 pin bayonet [[Tube socket#Early bases|UX-4]] and the glass envelope is ST-19. The 2.5 volt/ 5 Amp filament is connected to pins 1 and 4.

==Operation==
Under normal operating conditions the tube glows blue and mercury droplets are visible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10992">'''Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant and Wildlife Sanctuary''' is an innovative [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] [[management system]] employed by the city of [[Arcata, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofarcata.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=47 City of Arcata - Arcata Marsh &amp;amp; Wildlife Sanctuary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017122805/http://www.cityofarcata.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=47 |date=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of oxidation ponds, [[treatment wetland]]s and enhancement [[marshes]] are used to filter sewage waste. The marshes also serve as a [[wildlife refuge]], and are on the [[Pacific Flyway]]. The Arcata Marsh is a popular destination for birders. The marsh has been awarded the Innovations in Government award from the [[Ford Foundation]]/[[Harvard University]] [[Kennedy School of Government]]. Numerous holding pools in the marsh, called "lakes," are named after donors and citizens who helped start the marsh project, including [[Humboldt State University]] professors [[George Allen (ichthyologist)|George Allen]] and [[Robert A. Gearheart]] who were instrumental in the creation of the Arcata Marsh. In 1969 Allen also started an aquaculture project at the marsh to raise salmonids in mixtures of sea water and partially treated wastewater. Despite being effectively a sewer, the series of open-air lakes do not smell, and are a popular destination for [[birdwatching]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humboldt.edu/~ere_dept/marsh/birds.html Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant &amp; Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary - Birds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085003/http://www.humboldt.edu/~ere_dept/marsh/birds.html |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cycling]] and [[jogging]].
[[File:Arcata Marsh.JPG|thumb|right|View over southern end of Arcata Marsh.]]

==Sewage treatment==
The [[sewage treatment]] process takes place in stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humboldt.edu/arcatamarsh/overview.html|title=The Arcata Wastewater Plant Process Overview|publisher=Humboldt State University|accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Primary Treatment]] (completed in 1949): Sewage is held in sedimentation tanks where the sludge is removed and processed for use as fertilizer.
#[[Secondary Treatment]] (completed in 1957): Primary effluent is pumped into oxidation ponds (here bacteria break down the waste).
#Disinfection (completed in 1966): Secondary effluent is chlorinated to kill [[pathogen]]s and dechlorinated to avoid damage to natural environments.
#[[Tertiary Treatment]] (competed in 1986): Disinfected secondary effluent is put into artificial marshes where it is cleansed by reeds, cattails, and bacteria.
#Disinfection: Tertiary effluent is chlorinated to kill pathogens from bird droppings and dechlorinated to avoid damage to natural environments.&lt;ref name="usepa"&gt;Oppelt, E. Timothy ''Manual: Constructed Wetlands Treatment of Municipal Wastewaters'' (2000) United States Environmental Protection Agency pp.18,61&amp;139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and enhancement==
Sewage from the City of Arcata is treated and released to [[Humboldt Bay]] via complex flow routing through a number of contiguous ponds, wetlands, and marshes.  Resemblance of treatment features to natural bay environments may cause potential ambiguity about where wastewater ceases to be considered partially treated sewage and meets enhancement objectives of the [[California Bays and Estuaries Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Esuaries of California'' (1995) State of California&lt;/ref&gt;  The wastewater treatment system includes both '''treatment wetlands''' and '''enhancement marshes'''.  Treatment wetlands improve oxidation pond effluent quality to meet the federal definition of [[secondary treatment]].  Disinfection and dechlorination is the final step of the wastewater treatment process.  Disinfected wastewater may be discharged either to Humboldt Bay or to enhancement marshes.&lt;ref name="hsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humboldt.edu/arcatamarsh/overview.html|title=Arcata's Wastewater Treatment Plant &amp; The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary|publisher=Humboldt State University|accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enhancement marshes purify the wastewater and provide wetland habitat.  Enhancement marsh effluent is disinfected to improve [[coliform index]] changes from birds using tertiary treatment enhancement marsh habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/usa-california-arcata-constructed-wetland-wastewater.html|title=USA - California (Arcata) - Constructed Wetland: A Cost-Effective Alternative for Wastewater Treatment|publisher=The EcoTipping Points Project|accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After leaving the treatment wetlands the effluent is mixed with water returning from the [http://www2.humboldt.edu/arcatamarsh/enhancement.html enhancement marshes]. Wild bird [[feces]] contain [[coliform bacteria]] similar to those found in human sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerrs.noaa.gov/Doc/SiteProfile/ACEBasin/html/modules/watqual/wmbiopol.htm|title=Biopollutants|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recreational access is limited to areas where effluent has received secondary treatment and disinfection.&lt;ref name="usepa"/&gt;

==Conventional pollutants or wetland detritus==
Wetland plants use the energy of sunlight to produce five to ten times as much carbohydrate biomass per acre as a [[wheat]] field. [[Detritus]] from decomposing wetlands vegetation forms the base of a [[food chain]] for aquatic organisms, birds and [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceres.ca.gov/ceres/calweb/coastal/wetlands.html|title=California's Coastal Wetlands|publisher=California Natural Resources Agency|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317014010/http://ceres.ca.gov/ceres/calweb/coastal/wetlands.html|archivedate=2011-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who value wetland environments may not realize the effluent characteristics necessary for release of treated wastewater to Humboldt Bay.  Although there is no evidence of harm to wildlife, some regulators suggest potential risk to wildlife using [[constructed wetland|treatment wetlands]] because of an absence of significant research on wildlife exposure to partially treated effluent and to potential accumulation of chemicals being removed from effluent in wetland treatment processes.&lt;ref name="usepa"/&gt;  Ongoing research at Humboldt State University minimizes potential risk to Humboldt Bay wetlands and wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humboldt.edu/arcatamarsh/research.html|title=Arcata's Wastewater Treatment Plant &amp; The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary|publisher=Humboldt State University|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Arcata generates an average volume of {{convert|2.3|e6USgal|m3}} of sewage per day.  Winter rainfall onto the large surface area of treatment ponds and marshes increases the volume of effluent discharged from the wetland treatment system to as much as {{convert|16.5|e6USgal|m3}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency ''Arcata, California -- A Natural System for Wastewater Reclamation and Resource Enhancement'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] regulations&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr133_07.html "Secondary Treatment Regulation."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' 40 CFR Part 133.&lt;/ref&gt; require monthly average effluent concentrations of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] and of [[total suspended solids]] to be no greater than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/L,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/northcoast/board_decisions/adopted_orders/pdf/2014/12_0031_ArcataWWTF_revisedNPDES.pdf |title=Waste Discharge Requirements for City of Arcata Municipal Wastewater Treatment Facility |last= |first= |website= |publisher=State of California |accessdate=1 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an additional requirement for removal of 85 percent of the quantities measured in untreated sewage from the City of Arcata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/northcoast/board_decisions/adopted_orders/pdf/102504-0036ArcataWDRs.pdf|title=Waste Discharge Requirements for City of Arcata Municipal Wastewater Treatment Facility|publisher=State of California|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, when measuring concentrations leaving treatment wetlands, neither of these analytical methods can distinguish between unremoved [[conventional pollutant]]s originally arriving in sewage, or detritus of decomposing wetland vegetation; so the limitations may apply to the sum of both.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th Edition (1976) American Public Health Association {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} pp.89-95&amp;543-544&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
The Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary encompasses 307 acres of land situated along the [[Pacific Flyway]]. Over 327 species of birds have been recorded at the sanctuary. Numerous plant, [[mammal]], [[fish]], [[insect]], [[reptile]] and [[amphibian]] species inhabit the marsh. These include [[North American river otter|river otter]]s, [[gray fox]]es, [[red-legged frog]], [[tidewater goby]], [[bobcat]], [[striped skunk]], [[Mantidae|praying mantis]] and [[Red-sided Garter Snake|red-sided garter snake]].

==Arcata Marsh Interpretive Center==
The Friends of the Arcata Marsh (FOAM)  operate the '''Arcata Marsh Interpretive Center''' that contains exhibits about the operations of the treatment plant, the importance of the marsh, and about the plants and animals that live there.  Volunteer docents give tours of the marsh.  Education programs are offered for school, scout and other groups, as well as summer camp programs.

[[File:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Dickinsonia|Dickinsonia costata]]'' is one of the enigmatic [[fossil]]s, possibly an early [[animal]], in the [[Precambrian]] [[Ediacaran biota]].]]
The '''Avalon explosion''', named from the [[Precambrian]] fauna of the [[Avalon Peninsula]], is a proposed [[evolutionary radiation]] in the history of the [[Animalia]], about 575 million years ago, some 33 million years earlier than the [[Cambrian explosion]].

==Evidence==
[[File:Ediacaran trace fossil.jpg|thumb|Ediacaran trace fossil]]

Trace fossils of these Avalon organisms have been found worldwide, and represent the earliest known complex [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Simple multicellular organisms such as [[red alga]]e evolved at least {{Ma|1200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avalon explosion produced the [[Ediacaran biota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080103144451.htm |title=Two Explosive Evolutionary Events Shaped Early History Of Multicellular Life |publisher=Virginia Tech|date=January 4, 2008|via=ScienceDaily |language=en |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shen2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shen |first=Bing |last2=Dong |first2=Lin |last3=Xiao |first3=Shuhai |last4=Kowalewski |first4=Michał |date=4 January 2008 |title=The Avalon Explosion: Evolution of Ediacara Morphospace |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5859/81 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |language=en |volume=319 |issue=5859 |pages=81–84 |bibcode=2008Sci...319...81S |doi=10.1126/science.1150279 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=18174439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biota largely disappeared contemporaneously with the rapid increase in [[biodiversity]] known as the Cambrian explosion.

The Avalon explosion appears similar to the Cambrian explosion in the rapid increase in diversity of [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] in a relatively small time frame, followed by diversification within the established body plans,&lt;ref name="Shen2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiao2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xiao |first=Shuhai |last2=Laflamme |first2=Marc |date=January 2009 |title=On the eve of animal radiation: phylogeny, ecology and evolution of the Ediacara biota |journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.07.015 |pmid=18952316}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pattern similar to that observed in other evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="Xiao2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1398">'''CEB VER''' is a quality standard for voluntary carbon offset industry created by [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava]]. Based on the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s [[Clean Development Mechanism]], CEB VER establishes criteria for validating, measuring, and monitoring carbon offset projects with option to trade carbon credits and use them for surrendering for individuals, organizations or companies that want to be [[carbon neutral]].

'''Climate inertia''' describes the widespread inherent characteristic of the climate, ecological, and socio-economic systems. Inertia from [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts may be slow to become apparent, or could be irreversible if climate change crosses associated thresholds. Melting [[ice sheet]]s in [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctica]] take time to respond to the emissions of [[fossil fuel]] carbon in the climate system.&lt;ref name=HansenEtal2013&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648|title=Assessing "Dangerous Climate Change": Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature|date=3 December 2013| first1 = James | last1 = Hansen | first2 = Pushker | last2 = Kharecha | first3 = Makiko | last3 = Sato | first4 = Valerie | last4 = Masson-Delmotte| authorlink4 = Valerie Masson-Delmotte | first5 = Frank | last5 = Ackerman | first6 = David J. | last6 = Beerling |authorlink6 = David Beerling| first7 = Paul J. | last7 = Hearty | first8 = Ove | last8 = Hoegh-Guldberg | first9 = Shi-Ling | last9 = Hsu | first10 = Camille | last10 = Parmesan | first11 = Johan | last11 = Rockstrom | first12 = Eelco J. | last12 = Rohling | first13 = Jeffrey | last13 = Sachs | first14 = Pete | last14 = Smith | first15 = Konrad | last15 = Steffen | first16 = Lise | last16 = Van Susteren | first17 = Karina | last17 = von Schuckmann | first18 = James C. | last18 = Zachos|journal=PLOS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648 | volume=8 | pages=e81648 | pmid=24312568 | pmc=3849278| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...881648H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[global warming]] also causes [[thermal inertia]], thermal expansion of the oceans, which contributes to [[current sea level rise|sea level rise]].&lt;ref name=IPCC2001&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/vol4/011.htm|title=Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report|year=2001|work=IPCC|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 meters for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/34/13745.abstract?sid=26fd1d37-7276-46e2-9192-0931e6ebf6ab|title=The multimillennial sea-level commitment of global warming| first1 = Anders | last1 = Levermann | first2 = Peter U. | last2 = Clark | first3 = Ben | last3 = Marzeion | first4 = Glenn A. | last4 = Milne | first5 = David | last5 = Pollard | first6 = Valentina | last6 = Radic | first7 = Alexander | last7 = Robinson|date=13 June 2013|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | doi=10.1073/pnas.1219414110 | volume=110 | pages=13745–13750|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11013745L | pmid=23858443 | pmc=3752235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|IPCC synthesis report from 2001]] (AR3) states ''"Inertia" means a delay, slowness, or resistance in the response of climate, biological, or human systems to factors that alter their rate of change, including continuation of change in the system after the cause of that change has been removed.''&lt;ref name=IPCC2001 /&gt;

==Thermal inertia==
{{See also|Volumetric heat capacity#Thermal inertia}}
The ocean’s thermal inertia delays some global warming for decades or centuries. It is accounted for in [[global climate model]]s, and has been confirmed via measurements of [[Earth’s energy balance]].&lt;ref name=HansenEtal2013 /&gt; [[Permafrost]] takes longer to respond to a warming planet because of thermal inertia, due to ice rich materials and permafrost thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | last = M. W. | first = Smith | date = 1988 | title = The significance of climatic change for the permafrost environment | citeseerx = 10.1.1.383.5875 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observed transient [[climate sensitivity]] and the equilibrium climate sensitivity are proportional to the thermal inertia time scale. Thus, Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity adjusts over time until a new steady state equilibrium has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | arxiv = 1307.6821|title=The Earth's Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity and Thermal Inertia|publisher=Cornell University Library|date=25 July 2013| first1 = B. S. H. | last1 = Royce | first2 = S. H. | last2 = Lam |bibcode = 2013arXiv1307.6821R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice sheet inertia==
Even after [[Carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions are lowered, the melting of ice sheets would continue, and further increase sea-level rise for centuries. Because of slow transport of heat into the oceans and the slow response time of [[ice sheets]] until the new system equilibrium has been reached.&lt;ref name=IPCC2001 /&gt;

==Ecological  inertia==
Depending on the ecosystem, effects of climate change could show quickly, while others take more time to respond. For instance, [[coral bleaching]] can occur in a single warm season, while trees may be able to persist for decades under a changing climate, but be unable to regenerate. Changes in the frequency of extreme weather events could disrupt ecosystems as a consequence, depending on individual response times of species.&lt;ref name=IPCC2001 /&gt;

==Policy implications of inertia==
The IPCC concluded, that the inertia and uncertainty of the climate system, ecosystems, and socio-economic systems implies that margins for safety should be considered. Thus, setting strategies, targets, and time tables for avoiding dangerous interference through climate change. Further the IPCC concluded in their 2001 report that the stabilization of atmospheric {{CO2}} concentration, temperature, or sea level is affected by:&lt;ref name=IPCC2001 /&gt;

*The inertia of the climate system, which will cause climate change to continue for a period after [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] actions are implemented. 
*Uncertainty regarding the location of possible thresholds of irreversible change and the behavior of the system in their vicinity. 
*The time lags between adoption of mitigation goals and their achievement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">A '''disjunctive population''', in [[ecology]], is a colony of plants or animals, whose geographical locus is severed from the continuous range of the bulk of the species distribution. Although a disjunctive population may sometimes occur on an island,&lt;ref&gt;A.W.D. Larkum, Robert Joseph Orth and Carlos M. Duarte. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which creates physical separation via water, a large percentage of disjunctive populations are separated from their main range simply by landmass. In some cases a disjunctive population represents a relatively small outlier population from the main range, but in other cases, such as for the [[painted hunting dog]], ''Lycaon pictus'', the entire population is scattered (throughout much of Africa) and is intrinsically disjunctive.

'''''Dongfanghong I''''' ({{zh|s=东方红一号|t=東方紅一號|p=Dōngfānghóng Yīhào|l=The East is Red 1}}) was the first space [[satellite]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), launched successfully on 24 April 1970 as part of the PRC's [[Dong Fang Hong|Dongfanghong]] space satellite program. At {{convert|173|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}, it was heavier than the first satellites of other countries. The satellite carried a [[radio transmitter]] which broadcast the song of the same name, ''Dōngfānghóng'' or "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]]"; the broadcast lasted for 20 days while in orbit.

It was developed under the direction of [[Qian Xuesen]] ('''Tsien Hsue-shen'''), dean of the [[China Academy of Space Technology|Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST)]]. At the time, a total of five identical satellites were created. The first satellite launched successfully. The academy formulated a "Three-Satellite Plan" consisting of ''Dongfanghong I'', re-entry satellites, and [[geosynchronous orbit]] [[communications satellite]]s. [[Sun Jia-Dong]] was responsible for the ''Dongfanghong I'' technology. In 1967, [[Dang Hongxin]] chose a copper antenna membrane that resolved the difficulties of broadcasting on an ultra-short wave antenna between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and −100&amp;nbsp;°C. Engineers installed a music player playing "The East is Red" on the satellite.

== Launch ==
[[File:Dongfanghong-1.ogg|thumb|''Dongfanghong I'' broadcasting "[[The East is Red (song)|East is Red]]" and telemetry data]]
While ''Dongfanghong I'' was transported to the launch site by train, armed guards were placed between every two electricity poles.  On 24 April 1970 at 9:35 pm, a [[Long March rocket|Long March I rocket]] (CZ-1) lifted off from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]], placing the ''Dongfanghong I'' satellite in orbit at 9:48 pm.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Objectives ==
The primary purpose of the ''Dongfanghong I'' satellite was to perform tests of satellite technology and take readings of the ionosphere and atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Satellite design ==
The satellite was similar in shape to a symmetrical 72-faced polyhedron, had a mass of 173&amp;nbsp;kg (381&amp;nbsp;lb), and had a diameter of approximately one meter (39&amp;nbsp;in).  It spun 120 times per minute for stabilization.  The outer surface was coated with a processed aluminum alloy for temperature control. The main body of the sphere had four ultrashortwave whip antennas of at least two meters (6½ ft) in length. The lower section was connected to a stage containing a rocket motor. It had a shiny metallic ring added to the bottom, with brightness magnitude from +5 to +8.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Orbit ==
The satellite remains in orbit; as of {{Orbit|epoch|24 January 2015}} it was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|{{Orbit|perigee|442}}|km|mi}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|{{Orbit|apogee|2046}}|km|mi}} and [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of {{Orbit|inclination|68.42}}&amp;nbsp;degrees.{{Orbit|ref|&lt;ref name="n2yo"/&gt;}} This near-earth elliptical orbit was 114.09 minutes per orbit. It has [[Satellite Catalog Number]] 4382 and [[International Designator]] 1970-034A.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|work=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dongfanghong I'' had a design life of 20 days. During that time, it transmitted telemetry data and space readings to the Earth. On 14 May, its signal stopped.

== Reaction ==
With the successful launch of ''Dongfanghong I'', China became the fifth country after the Soviet Union, United States, France, and Japan to independently launch a satellite. Although ''Dongfanghong I'' was launched 13 years after ''[[Sputnik I]]'', its mass exceeded the combined masses of the first satellites of the other four countries. After this launch, Qian Xuesen proposed to the Chinese government that China should develop a manned space program and submitted a manned space undertaking report. [[Mao Zedong]] himself signed "approved" to the report.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On 21 April 2005, the Chinese Academy of Space Technology gathered the science and technology personnel who participated in the design, manufacture, production, and supervision of ''Dongfanghong I''. The birthplace of ''Dongfanghong I'', the Beijing Satellite Manufacturing Plant, was used as a monument. The manufacturing plant, in coordination with the [[Shenzhou 5]] manned spacecraft anniversary, created a 1:1 scale replica of the ''Dongfanghong I'' satellite. It was exhibited in the Beijing Planetarium.

The '''Eastern Hemisphere''' is a [[geography|geographical]] term for the half of [[Earth]] which is east of the [[prime meridian (Greenwich)|prime meridian]] (which crosses [[Greenwich]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]) and west of the [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (which crosses the [[Pacific Ocean]] and relatively little land from pole to pole). It is also used to refer to [[Afro-Eurasia]] ([[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]]) and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], in contrast with  the [[Western Hemisphere]], which includes mainly [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. The Eastern Hemisphere may also be called the "Oriental Hemisphere". In addition, it may be used in a [[cultural geography|cultural]] or [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] sense as a synonym for the "[[Old World]]".

== Geography ==
The almost perfect circle (the earth is an [[oblate spheroid]] that is fatter around the equator), drawn with a line, demarcating the Eastern and Western Hemispheres must be an arbitrarily decided and published convention, unlike the [[equator]] (an imaginary line encircling [[Earth]], equidistant from its [[geographical pole|poles]]), which divides the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]] Hemispheres. The [[prime meridian]] at 0° [[longitude]] and the [[180th meridian|antimeridian]], at 180° longitude, are the conventionally accepted boundaries, since they divide eastern longitudes from western longitudes. This convention was established (predominantly by Europeans and Americans) in 1884 at the [[International Meridian Conference]] held in [[Washington, D.C.]] where the [[standard time]] concepts of [[Canadians|Canadian]] railroad engineer Sir [[Sandford Fleming]] were adopted. The Hemispheres agreed do not correspond with exact continents. Portions of [[Western Europe]], [[West Africa]], [[Oceania]], and extreme northeastern [[Russia]] are in the Western Hemisphere, divorcing it from the continents which form the touchstone for most geopolitical constructs of "the East" and "the West".

Consequently, the meridians of [[20th meridian west|20°W]] and the diametrically opposed [[160th meridian east|160°E]] are often used outside of matters of physics and navigation,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Judy M.  "[http://www.gis.psu.edu/projection/chapter4.html Projecting the hemisphere] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814165725/http://www.gis.psu.edu/projection/chapter4.html |date=2007-08-14 }}", ch. 4 from ''[http://www.gis.psu.edu/projection/ Matching the map projection to the need] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818200906/http://www.gis.psu.edu/projection/ |date=2007-08-18 }}''; Robinson, Arthur H. &amp; Snyder, John P., eds. 1997.  Bethesda, MD: Cartography and Geographic Information Society, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Eastern Hemisphere".  ''Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary,'' 3rd ed.  2001.  Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Inc., p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes all of the European and African mainlands, but also includes a small portion of northeast [[Greenland]] (typically reckoned as part of [[North America]]) and excludes more of eastern Russia and Oceania (e.g., [[New Zealand]]). Prior to the global adoption of standard time, numerous [[prime meridian]]s were decreed by various countries where time was defined by local noon (thereby, local meridian).

The center of the Eastern Hemisphere is located in the [[Indian Ocean]] at the intersection of the equator and the [[90th meridian east]], 910 km west of [[Indonesia]] in the [[Ninety East Ridge]]. The nearest land is [[Simeulue]] Island at {{coord|2|35|N|96|05|E|display=inline}}.

The land mass of the Eastern Hemisphere is larger than that of the Western Hemisphere and has a wide variety of [[habitat]]s.

== Demographics ==
82% of [[human]]s live in the Eastern Hemisphere, and 18% in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brilliantmaps.com/human-hemisphere/ How Much of Humanity is in Your Hemisphere? - Brilliant Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''''Ehon Hyaku Monogatari'''''|絵本百物語|extra="Picture Book of a Hundred Stories"}}, also called the {{nihongo|'''''Tōsanjin Yawa'''''|桃山人夜話|extra="Night Stories of Tōsanjin"}} is a book of ''[[yōkai]]'' illustrated by Japanese artist [[Takehara Shunsensai]], published about 1841. The book was intended as a followup to [[Toriyama Sekien]]'s ''[[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]]'' series. Like those books, it is a supernatural [[bestiary]] of ghosts, monsters, and spirits which has had a profound influence on subsequent yōkai imagery in Japan.

The author's pen name is {{nihongo|Tōsanjin|桃山人}}; however, in the preface it is written as {{nihongo|Tōka Sanjin|桃花山人}}. According to the ''[[Kokusho Sōmokuroku]]'' ([[Iwanami Shoten]]) this is considered to be a [[gesaku]] author from the latter half of the [[Edo period]], {{nihongo|Tōkaen Michimaro|桃花園三千麿}}. 

It can be said that this is a kind of hundred-tale ''[[kaidan]]'' (ghost story) book popular in the Edo period, as "100 Tales" is part of the title, but rather than being tales with story titles, yōkai names are printed with illustrations of yōkai, so it could be said that this work is a fusion of kaidan book and picture book.

This book is also known by the title ''Tōsanjin Yawa'' because the title on the first page of each volume is "Tōsanjin Yawa, Volume [#]." Scholar of Japanese manners and customs  Ema Tsutomu (''Nihon Yōkai Henka-shi'', 1923) and folklorist Fujisawa Morihiko (''Hentai Densetsu-shi'', 1926), as well as magazines at that time, introduced this book by the name ''Tōsanjin Yawa'', and so this title became famous. On the other hand, [[Mizuki Shigeru]], in his 1979 ''Yōkai 100 Monogatari'' describes it in his references as "''Ehon Hyaku Monogatari (Author: Tōsanjin, Year of publication: Unknown)."

It has also been recognized that a book with completely the same contents, titled ''Ehon Kaidan Zoroe'', was published in 2005 by Yumoto Kōichi. The preface's title is changed, and the title of each volume is ''Ehon Kaidan Zoroe Volume [#]'' rather than ''Tōsanjin Yawa Volume [#]''. Upon examination, it appears to be an earlier publication than ''Ehon Hyaku Monogatari'', with the relationship that the inscriptions of "Tōsanjin" and "Tōka Sanjin" are mixed, and it also is generally suggested that the first edition of ''Ehon Hyaku Monogatari'' may have been published before 1841.

'''El Morro National Monument''' is located on an ancient east-west trail in western New Mexico.  The main feature of this [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]] is a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base.

As a shaded oasis in the western U.S. desert, this site has seen many centuries of travelers.    The remains of a mesa top pueblo are atop the promontory where between about 1275 to 1350 AD, up to 1500 people lived in this 875 room pueblo.  The Spaniard explorers called it '''El Morro'''  (''The Headland'').  The [[Zuni Indians]] call it "A'ts'ina" (''Place of writings on the rock'').   Anglo-Americans called it '''Inscription Rock'''.  Travelers left signatures, names, dates, and stories of their treks.  While some of the inscriptions are fading, there are still many that can be seen today, some dating to the 17th century.  Among the Anglo-American emigrants who left their names there in 1858 were several members of the [[Rose-Baley Party]], including [[Leonard John Rose|Leonard Rose]] and [[John Udell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marta Weigle|Weigle, Marta]] and White, Peter (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Yqb9DeJEkMC&amp;pg=PA56 ''The Lore of New Mexico''], p. 56. University of New Mexico Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Some petroglyphs and carvings were made by the [[Ancestral Puebloan]] centuries before Europeans started making their mark.  In 1906, U.S. federal law prohibited further carving.

The many inscriptions, water pool, pueblo ruins, and top of the promontory are all accessible via park trails.

It is on the [[Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway (New Mexico)|Trails of the Ancients Byway]], one of the designated [[New Mexico Scenic Byways]].&lt;ref name="NM TOA"&gt;[http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ Trail of the Ancients.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821002106/http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ |date=August 21, 2014 }} New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

El Morro National Monument has been featured in the film ''[[Four Faces West]]'' (1948) starring [[Joel McCrea]].&lt;ref&gt;Maddrey, Joseph (2016). ''The Quick, the Dead and the Revived: The Many Lives of the Western Film''. McFarland. Page 181. {{ISBN|9781476625492}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrokinetics remediation''', also termed '''electrokinetics''', is a technique of using direct [[electric current]] to remove organic, inorganic and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] particles from the soil by [[electric potential]].&lt;ref name="Iyer"&gt;R. Iyer, "Electrokinetic Remediation," Particulate Science and Technology: An International Journal,  vol. 19, 2001, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Wada"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wada | first1 = Shin-Ichiro | last2 = Umegaki | first2 = Yuki | year = 2001 | title = Major Ion and Electrical Potential Distribution in Soil under Electrokinetic Remediation | doi = 10.1021/es001335j | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 35 | issue = 11| pages = 2151–2155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = Yalcin B. | last2 = Alshawabkeh | first2 = Akram N. | year = 1993 | title = [10.1021/es00049a002 Principles of electrokinetic remediation] | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 27 | issue = 13| pages = 2638–2647 | doi = 10.1021/es00049a002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this technique provides an approach with minimum disturbance to the surface while treating subsurface [[contaminant]]s.

==System Components==
A basic electrokinetics remediation site contains an external [[direct current]] source, a [[positively charged]] [[electrode]] (or [[anode]]) and a [[negatively charged]] electrode (or a [[cathode]]) placed into the ground. Placement of electrodes are based on size and shape of known contaminant plumes. The removal of contaminants and prevention of plume migration are big influences in determining the arrangement of electrodes. Each electrode is encased in a reservoir well in which an [[Electrolyte|electrolytic]] solution can be injected.&lt;ref name ="sharma"&gt;H.D. Sharma, Geoenvironmental Engineering: Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies,  Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The electrolytic solutions serve both as a conducting media (or pore fluid) and as a means to extract contaminants and introduce [[chemical]]s or biological entities.&lt;ref name="Basic"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acar | first1 = Y.B. | last2 = Gale | first2 = R.J. | last3 = Alshawabkeh | first3 = A.N. | last4 = Marks | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Puppala | first5 = S. | last6 = Bricka | first6 = M. | last7 = Parker | first7 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Electrokinetic remediation: Basics and technology status | url = | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 117–137 | doi=10.1016/0304-3894(94)00066-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another use of the electrolytic solution is for control and/or [[depolarization]] of electrode reactions. Immersed in a solution the electrodes can result in [[oxidation]] at the anode site and the reduction at the cathodic site.&lt;ref name="Iyer"/&gt;  The oxidation and formation of an acidic front are by products of the process and cause varying degree of influence to the system. By pumping, processing and testing the electrolytic solution at each electrode site you can extend the life and efficiency of the system.

==Method==
When current is applied, by the direct power source, to the electrodes, migrations occur beneath the [[soil]] surface.  Although there are many types of migrations that occur in tandem with the current there are two driving migrations within electrokinetics; ionic migration and [[electrophoresis]]. When the electrolytic solution is injected within the soil part of the [[ionic solution]] forms a diffuse double layer with soils and contaminants. This diffused double layer will aid in the ionic drift that will occur as the current passes though the soil and surrounding liquid, this process is called [[electroosmosis]].&lt;ref name="Iyer"/&gt; The thickness of the diffused double layer is a function of ionic composition of bulk solution and the average [[charge density]] of [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] products.&lt;ref name="Principles"/&gt; As the electrolyte concentration increases the diffuse double layer thickness decreases.
Electrophoresis is the mass flux of [[charged particle]]s under an [[electric field]].&lt;ref name ="sharma"/&gt; Both processes work at the same time but in a counter current manner. The charged particles driven by  electrophoresis flow from the cathode to the anode while electrolytic solution flows from the anode to the cathode. Of the two main processes electrophoresis (or electromigration) is more dominant than electroosmosis.&lt;ref name ="Wada"/&gt; Electrophoresis servies as the driving factor that induces the flow of electroosmosis in the opposite direction. Electromigration also serves as the major component for ionic contaminant removal. For electromigration to occur absorbed material must be dissolved to an ionic form whether they are metals, organic or inorganic particles.&lt;ref name="Iyer"/&gt; Electroosmotic flow between the electrodes promotes the development of a low-pH environment in the soil. This low pH environment inhibits metallic contaminants from being sorbed onto soil particle surfaces which aids in the formation of compounds making electrokinetics possible.&lt;ref name ="Virkutyte"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Virkutyte | first1 = J. | last2 = Sillanpää | first2 = M. | last3 = Latostenmaa | first3 = P. | year = 2002 | title = Electrokinetic soil remediation -- critical overview | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 97–121 | doi=10.1016/s0048-9697(01)01027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this thought it is possible to acidify the soil and induce the release of absorbed heavy metals.&lt;ref name ="Wada"/&gt;

==Applications==
Electrokinetic remediation is applied to many contaminants that can be dissolved within [[groundwater]]. Heavy metals are one of the main contaminants that are removed by the electrokinetics process. Some metals like [[cadmium]] (II) can be removed with  high consequences on energy expenditure. Chromium (III) can be removed but with low efficiency because of the ease of [[hydrolysis]] allowing it to sorb to other substances. Chromium (IV)  is also a candidate for electrokinetics removal although chromium (IV) migration is retarded in the presence of [[sulfur]] because it will break down into [[chromium]] (III).&lt;ref name="Iyer"/&gt;  Other heavy metal species that are tested and reported to be treatable include; [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]], [[iron]], [[lead]], [[copper]], and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Virkutyte"/&gt;
 
Electrokinetics is also possible with [[alkali]] and alkaline earth metals which travel faster in most mediums than heavy metals. At tests between 20 to 30 volts, alkali metals were known to move between 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;cm per day per volts whereas heavy metal moved at velocities between 10 and 20&amp;nbsp;cm per day per volts.&lt;ref name ="Wada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baraud"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baraud | first1 = F. | last2 = Tellier | first2 = S. | last3 = Astruc | first3 = M. | year = 1997 | title = Ion velocity in soil solution during electrokinetic remediation | url = | journal = Journal of Hazardous Materials | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 315–332 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3894(97)00073-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this difference could be because of the slow [[desorption]] and dissolution of heavy metals.  Electrokinetics can also be used to treat polar organic compounds ([[phenol]] and [[acetic acid]]) and [[Nucleotide|radionucleotide]]s ([[radium]]), toxic anions (nitrates and sulfates), dense, non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), [[cyanide]], petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel fuel, [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]] and lubricating oils), halogenated pollutants, explosives, halogenated and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;

==Advantages==
One of the advantages of electrokinetics is that the remediation can be conducted in situ (within the remediation site) to treat contaminants in low [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] zones to overcome accessibility of contaminants or delivery of treatment.&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ho | first1 = S.V. | last2 = Sheridan | first2 = P.W. | last3 = Athmer | first3 = C.J. | last4 = Heitkamp | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Brackin | first5 = J.M. | last6 = Weber | first6 = D. | last7 = Brodsky | first7 = P.H. | year = 1995 | title = Integrated In Situ Soil Remediation Technology: The Lasagna Process | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 2528–2534 | doi=10.1021/es00010a011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remediation can also occur ex situ (removed from the natural site) to have contaminants tested and treated within a [[laboratory]]. This versatility of treatment location can be very cost effective. Electrokinetics has the advantage of use in saturated or unsaturated soils because of the insertion of pore fluid. Remediation can also occur despite soil stratifications or [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneity]].&lt;ref name ="sharma"/&gt; For soils that are low in permeability like [[kaolite]] and clayey sands it is possible to remove up to 90% of heavy metal contaminants.  In many cases pretreatment of soil should be made to determine appropriate working conditions of the soil.&lt;ref name ="Virkutyte"/&gt;

One thing to note is that the potential profile in soils can be determined by the ionic distribution of pore fluid. Because ion distribution effects the efficiency of the electrokinetics system, engineers like John Dzenitis have done comprehensive study to find key reactions around the electrodes that can be used to create models for ionic flowrate prediction.&lt;ref name ="Wada"/&gt; These models can then be interpreted to determine if electrokinetics remediation is the best choice for a given site.

==Limitations==
A major limitation of electrokinetics is the introduction of an external fluid into the soil. If the contaminant cannot be dissolved it is not possible to extract the contaminant of interest.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt; Electrolysis near the electrodes can alter the pH of the soil especially if the current is induced for an extended period of time. Extended use of electrokinetics system can also cause acidic conditions around the electrodes sometimes reacting with contaminants. If increased acidification of the soil is not environmentally acceptable the use of electrokinetics should be reevaluated.&lt;ref name ="Virkutyte"/&gt; Large metal objects that are buried underground also pose as a limitation to electrodes because they offer a path to short circuit the system. Buried metal objects can also change the voltage gradient and decrease or stop the flow.  The removal of [[volatile organic compound]]s from the soils can increase the soil vapor concentration. Counterintuitively, highly permeable soils lower the efficiency of electrokinetics. Where a low permeable soil like clay can receive up to 90% initial contaminant removal a low permeable soil like peat achieves about 65% removal of initial contaminants.

Another major limitation of the electrokinetics process is the decrease the electric potential of the system. Different polarization effects can decrease how the system runs.  For instance:
Activation polarization can occur during the electrokinetic remediation process removing gas bubbles that form on the surface of the electrodes during conductivity. Resistance polarization can occur after the electrokinetic remediation process has started a white layer can be observed.  Just like in hard water stains this layer may be the insoluble salt and other impurities that inhibit conductivity. [[Concentration polarization]] happens when hydrogen ions generated at the anode are attracted to the cathode and the hydroxide ions generated at the cathode are attracted to the anode. If neutralization occurs the potential between the system drops.&lt;ref name ="Virkutyte"/&gt;   Local flattening of the electrical potential profile can also cause the difference in migration.&lt;ref name ="Wada"/&gt;

==Case Studies==
In many cases the study of specific site occurrences with electrokinetics remediation can lead to new advancements in the technology. 
Many times electrokinetics remediation will be coupled with other remediation forms to handle site specific issues. At a Danish Wood Perseveration copper was a heavy metal that polluted the soil in two forms; ionic solution with different complexes within the soil or a crystal lattice of soil minerals.&lt;ref name="Ottosen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ottosen | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = H.K. | last3 = Laursen | first3 = S. | last4 = Villumsen | first4 = A. | year = 1997 | title = Electrodialytic Remediation of Soil Polluted with Copper from Wood Preservation Industry† | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1711–1715 | doi=10.1021/es9605883}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this site soil pH was a parameter of great importance because of an increased amount of copper present as ionic solution. By creating active barriers or exchange membranes that prevent ions from traveling from the electrode compartment into the soil.&lt;ref name="Ottosen"/&gt; The separation of the soil from the electrode is designed to deter the acidification of the cathode and the current loss as highly mobile ions pass from electrode site through the soil.&lt;ref name="Ottosen"/&gt; 
 
In 1995 at the Paducah site, in Kentucky, USA a new technique was developed for removing heavy metals from soils. Called the Lasagna Process, it simply is the creation of several  horizontal permeable zones used  to provide treatment through the contaminated soil matrix by adding different admixtures to the electrolytic solution.  Admixtures like sorbents, catalytic reagents, buffering solutions, oxidizing agents in this system are applied through a vertical system with the anode near the bottom and the cathode near the top.&lt;ref name ="Virkutyte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ho | first1 = S.V. | last2 = Athmer | first2 = C. | last3 = Sheridan | first3 = P.W. | last4 = Hughes | first4 = B.M. | last5 = Orth | first5 = R. | last6 = McKenzie | first6 = D. | last7 = Brodsky | first7 = P.H. | last8 = Shapiro | first8 = A. | last9 = Thornton | first9 = R. | last10 = Salvo | first10 = J. | last11 = Schultz | first11 = D. | last12 = Landis | first12 = R. | last13 = Griffith | first13 = R. | last14 = Shoemaker | first14 = S. | year = 1999 | title = The Lasagna Technology for In Situ Soil Remediation. 1. Small Field Test | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1086–1091 | doi=10.1021/es980332s}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The orientation of vertical anode and cathode system make recycling of fluid and system treatment easier. The formation of the lasagna layers is due to fracturing  in over-consolidated clays because of  horizontal electrodes. Coupling of the horizontal electrodes with a vertical pressuring system make this method especially effective in removing contaminants from deeper layers of the soil. The first test of this process proved 98% effective of removing [[trichloroethylene]] from the Paducah site.

Eurythermy is an aspect of thermoregulation in organisms. It is in contrast with the idea of [[stenothermic]] organisms, which can only operate within a relatively narrow range of ambient temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Hill R, Wyse G, Anderson A. Animal Physiology. 2004. Sinaur Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Through a wide variety of thermal coping mechanisms, eurythermic organisms can either provide or expel heat for themselves in order to survive in cold or hot, respectively, or otherwise prepare themselves for extreme temperatures. Certain species of eurytherm have been shown to have unique protein synthesis processes that differentiate them from relatively stenothermic, but otherwise similar, species.

== Examples ==

* Tardigrades, known for their ability to survive in nearly any [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], are extreme examples of eurytherms. Certain species of tardigrade, including ''Mi. tardigradum'', are able to withstand and survive temperatures ranging from –273&amp;nbsp;°C (near [[absolute zero]]) to 150&amp;nbsp;°C in their [[Anhydrobiosis|anhydrobiotic]] state.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The desert pupfish, a rare bony fish that occupies places like the [[Colorado River Delta]] in [[Baja California]], small ponds in [[Sonora|Sonora, Mexico]], and drainage sites near the [[Salton Sea]] in [[California]], can function in waters ranging from 8º to 42&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The green crab is a common species of [[Littoral zone|littoral]] crab with a range that extends from [[Iceland]] and Central [[Norway]] in the north to [[South Africa]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]] in the south, including more temperate regions like [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]] in between.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The green crab has been shown to survive in waters at least as cold as 8&amp;nbsp;°C, and at least as warm as 35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Folco22"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li href="Category:Animal physiology"&gt;[[Subarctic climate|Boreal]] [[deciduous]] [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (genus ''[[Larch|Larix]]'') are the primary plants occupying the [[Taiga|boreal forests]] of [[Siberia]] and North America.

== Advantages over Stenotherms ==
It is thought that adaptations to cold temperatures (cold-eurythermy) in animals, despite the high cost of [[Adaptation|functional adaptation]], has allowed for mobility and agility. This cold eurythermy is also viewed as a near necessity for survival of the evolutionary crises, including ice ages, that occur with relative frequency over the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|evolutionary timescale]]. Due to its ability to provide the excess energy and aerobic scope required for [[endotherm]]y, eurythermy is considered to be the "missing link" between [[ectotherm]]y and endothermy.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Portner|first=Hans O.|date=2004|title=Climate Variability and the Energetic Pathways of Evolution: The Origin of Endothermy in Mammals and Birds on JSTOR|jstor=10.1086/423742|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology: Ecological and Evolutionary Approaches,|volume=77|pages=959–981|doi=10.1086/423742.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The green crab's success demonstrates one example of eurythermic advantage. Although [[invasive species]] are typically considered to be detrimental to the environment in which they are introduced, and even considered to be a leading cause of animal [[extinction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clavero|first=Miguel|last2=Garcia-Berthou|first2=Emili|date=2005|title=Invasive species are a leading cause of animal extinctions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2005.01.003|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=20|issue=3|pages=110–110|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.01.003|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ability of an animal to thrive in various environmental conditions is a form of [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]], and therefore is typically a characteristic of successful species. A species' relative eurythermality is one of the main factors in its ability to survive in different conditions. One example of eurythermic advantage can be seen in the failure of many of the world's [[Coral reef|coral reefs.]] Most species of coral are considered to be stenothermic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-01-15|title=Ecospace variability along a carbonate platform at the northern boundary of the Miocene reef belt (Upper Langhian, Austria)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018212006979|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|language=en|volume=370|pages=232–246|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.12.015|issn=0031-0182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide increase in oceanic temperatures has caused many coral reefs to begin bleaching and dying because the coral have begun to expel the [[zooxanthellae]] algae that live in their tissues and provide them with their food and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glynn|first=P.

==Thermal Coping Mechanisms==
The ability to maintain [[homeostasis]] at varying temperatures is the most important characteristic in defining an endothermic eurytherm, whereas other, thermoconforming eurytherms like tardigrades are simply able to endure significant shifts in their internal body temperature that occur with ambient temperature changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramloy|first=UB|date=2000|title=Aspects of natural cold tolerance in ectothermic animals.|url=|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=15|pages=26–46|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurythermic animals can be either conformers or regulators, meaning that their internal physiology can either vary with the external environment or maintain consistency regardless of the external environment, respectively.  It is important to note that endotherms do not solely rely on internal thermogenesis for all parts of homeostasis or comfort; in fact, in many ways, they are equally as reliant upon behavior to regulate body temperature as ectotherms are.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Harshaw|first=Christopher|title=Thermoregulation, Energetics, and Behavior.|date=2017-01-16|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307453574_Thermoregulation_Energetics_and_Behavior|last2=Blumberg|last3=Alberts|first2=Mark|first3=Jeffrey|accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reptiles are ectotherms, and therefore rely upon [[Thermotaxis|positive thermotaxis]], basking (heliothermy), burrowing, and crowding with members of their species in order to regulate their body temperature within a narrow range and even to produce fevers to fight infection.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similarly, humans rely upon clothing, housing, air conditioning, and drinking to achieve the same goals, although humans are not considered indicative of endotherms on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-02-01|title=The energetic cost of locomotion: humans and primates compared to generalized endotherms|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248402002099|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=255–262|doi=10.1016/S0047-2484(02)00209-9|issn=0047-2484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered an invasive species, the green crab's ability to function in a wide range of water and air temperatures allows it to vary widely in its range.]]
The sustained supply of oxygen to body tissues determines the body temperature range of an organism. Eurytherms that live in environments with large temperature changes adapt to higher temperatures through a variety of methods. In green crabs, the process of initial warming results in an increase of oxygen consumption and heart rate, accompanied by a decrease in [[stroke volume]] and [[haemolymph]] oxygen [[partial pressure]]. As this warming continues, dissolved oxygen levels decrease below the threshold for full haemocyanin [[oxygen saturation]]. This heating then progressively releases [[haemocyanin]]-bound oxygen, saving energy in oxygen transport and resulting in an associated leveling off of [[metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name="Folco22"/&gt;

Key to maintaining homeostasis, individual thermoregulation is the ability to maintain internal body temperature in humans, the most recognizable eurytherm. In humans, deep-body temperature is regulated by [[Human skin|cutaneous]] [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]], which maintains this temperature despite changes in the external environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895500922|title=Human Physiology|last=Ira|first=Stuart Fox|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=9780077836375|edition= 14th|location=New York, NY|pages=450–492|chapter=Cardiac Output, Blood Flow, and Blood Pressure|oclc=895500922}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homo sapiens|Homo Sapiens]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ability to survive in different ambient temperatures is a key factor in the species success, and one cited reason for why ''Homo sapiens'' eventually outcompeted Neanderthals (''[[Homo neandertalensis|Homo neanderthalensis]]).''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998|title=Environmental Hypotheses of Hominin Evolution|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=107|pages=93–136|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have two major forms of [[thermogenesis]]. The first is [[shivering]], in which a [[warm-blooded]] creature produces involuntary contraction of [[skeletal muscle]] in order to produce heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/4-4-muscle-tissue-and-motion/|title=4.4 Muscle Tissue and Motion – Anatomy and Physiology|website=opentextbc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, shivering also signals the body to produce [[FNDC5|irisin]], a hormone that has been shown to convert [[White adipose tissue|white fat]] to [[Brown adipose tissue|brown fat]], which is used in non-shivering thermogenesis, the second type of human thermogensis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/shivering-activates-brown-fat/|title=Shivering Activates Fat to Keep You Warm|last=Intagliata|first=Christopher|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in the brown fat, which contains the [[uncoupling protein]] [[thermogenin]]. This protein decreases the proton gradient generated in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] during the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], uncoupling the [[Electron transport chain|electron transport]] in the [[mitochondrion]] from the production of chemical energy (ATP). This creation of a gradient across the [[Cell membrane|mitochondrial membrane]] causes energy to be lost as heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/brown-adipose-tissue#ref1182545|title=Brown adipose tissue {{!}} anatomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, humans have only one method of cooling themselves, biologically speaking: [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]]. Cutaneous [[Merocrine|eccrine]] sweat glands produce sweat, which is made up of mostly water with a small amount of ions. Evaporation of this sweat helps to cool the blood beneath the skin, resulting in a cooling of deep-body temperature.

While some organisms are eurythermic due to their ability to regulate internal body temperature, like humans, others have wildly different methods of extreme temperature tolerance. Tardigrades are able to enter an anhydrobiotic state, often called a tun, in order to both prevent [[desiccation]] and endure extreme temperatures. In this state, tardigrades decrease their bodily water to about 1–3% wt./wt.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Although this state allows certain tardigrades to endure temperatures at the extremes of –273° and 150&amp;nbsp;°C at the extremes, tardigrades in their hydrated state are able to withstand temperatures as low as  –196&amp;nbsp;°C. This displayed [[Extremophile|extremotolerance]] has led scientists to speculate that tardigrades could theoretically survive on [[Mars]], where temperatures regularly fluctuate between –123° and 25&amp;nbsp;°C, as well as even possibly the near absolute zero of [[Outer space|interplanetary space]]. The tardigrade's ability to withstand extremely cold temperatures as a tun is a form of [[cryptobiosis]] called cryobiosis. Although the high temperature endurance of tardigrades has been significantly less studied, their cryobiotic response to low temperatures has been well-documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-01|title=Recovery and reproduction of an Antarctic tardigrade retrieved from a moss sample frozen for over 30 years|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011224015300134|journal=Cryobiology|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=78–81|doi=10.1016/j.cryobiol.2015.12.003|issn=0011-2240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møbjerg|first=N.|last2=Halberg|first2=K.

In addition to other organisms, plants ([[Plant]]ae) can be either stenothermic or eurythermic. Plants inhabiting the [[Subarctic climate|boreal]] and [[Polar climate|polar]] climates generally tend to be cold-eurythermic, enduring temperatures as cold as –85°, and as warm as at least 20&amp;nbsp;°C, such as boreal deciduous conifers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Box|first=Elgene O.|date=1996|title=Plant Functional Types and Climate at the Global Scale|jstor=3236274|journal=Journal of Vegetation Science|volume=7|issue=3|pages=309–320|doi=10.2307/3236274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more [[Tropics|tropical]] or [[Montane ecosystems|montane]] regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10° and 25&amp;nbsp;°C, such as the [[Banyan|banyan tree]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:Common carp.jpg|alt=An illustration of the carp.|thumb|The common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'') has shown higher protein synthesis rates at high temperatures.]]

== Eurythermal Protein Adaptation ==
The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]], therefore avoiding possible cell death.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dietz|first=T. J.|last2=Somero|first2=G.

Rainbow trout''[[Rainbow trout|(Salmo gairdneri]]'') have shown constant protein synthesis rates &lt;math&gt;\left(Q_{10}\right)&lt;/math&gt; over temperatures ranging from 5° to 20&amp;nbsp;°C, after acclimating to any temperature in this range for 1 month. In contrast, carp [[Common carp|(C''yprinus carpio'']]'')'' have shown significantly higher protein synthesis rates after acclimating to higher water temperatures (25&amp;nbsp;°C) than after acclimating to lower water temperatures (10&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loughna|first=P.

A similar example is given by the Senegalese sole (''[[Solea senegalensis]]''), which, when acclimated to temperatures of 26&amp;nbsp;°C, produced a significantly higher amount of [[taurine]], [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[glycine]] compared to acclimation to 12&amp;nbsp;°C. This may mean that the aforementioned compounds aid in antioxidant defense, osmoregulatory processes, or energetic purposes at these temperatures.

'''Fog Houses''' are a special type of pleasure or [[Summer house|summer]] house popular in Scotland and at one time commonly found on many country estates as a feature in the pleasure gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Page 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buxbaum (1989), 152&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Fog' derives from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word for the [[moss]] that was a major feature of the building, mainly used to line the walls and roof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/fog Dictionary of the Scots Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
One definition states that 'Fog Houses' were 'Pleasure Houses', small shelters lined with mossy turf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/fog Dictionary of the Scots Language]&lt;/ref&gt; They were often thatched with materials such as heather. Contents typically included a curved bench placed against the walls with other features such as the example at Bonnington Isle that had its table and bench neatly covered with moss,&lt;ref&gt;Buxbaum (1987), Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; and the one at Ballochmyle in Ayrshire that had the verses of a Robert Burns song hanging from the walls.&lt;ref&gt;Dougal, Page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fog House on Bonnington Isle, River Clyde.JPG|thumb|Foundations of the Bonnington Isle Fog House.]]

==Examples of Fog Houses==
*'''Ballochmyle Estate''' - Destroyed by fire by vandals in 1944, the Ballochmyle Fog House is said to have been built by Claude Alexander, the brother of [[Wilhelmina Alexander]], on the site of the where Robert Burns' first saw his 'Bonnie Lass o' Ballochmyle'.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors state that it was a nephew who built it.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; In surviving photographs the two support poles at the front of the building appear to be cut fir trees, however they were actually made of iron. The roof is thatched and the flimsy walls appear to be made of heather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayrshirehistory.com/mauchline_ballochmyle_estate.html The Fog House in the Ballochmyle Estate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buxbaum (1989), Page 152&lt;/ref&gt; The OS maps show that it was located on one of the many woodland walks to the west of the stables. The Jacob's Ladders Steps gave access to it for visitors approaching from the direction of [[Catrine]]. The metal 'tree trunk' supports were rescued and now adorn a garden in the locality.

Ballochmyle lies near [[Mauchline]] and Robert Burns' [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Mossgeil Farm]] where Robert lived for a time. Whilst walking in the private estate he saw [[Wilhelmina Alexander]], sister of the owner, walking alone and this inspired him to compose a romantic song. Burns wrote to her, enclosing the song, seeking her permission to allow him to publish it. Wilhelmina was 30 years old at the time and no great beauty, so thinking that Robert was teasing her and being aware of his reputation she never replied. The correspondence was however in later life one of her most prized possessions and, as stated, the Ballochmyle Fog House was built in honour of the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/collections/object_detail/3.6275.c Burns Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Page 246&lt;/ref&gt;

These verses were hung on the walls of the fog house&lt;ref&gt;Dougal, Page 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
|}&lt;/div&gt;

Cuthbertson visited in the 1940s and comments on the winding mossy paths by which the 'heather house' was reached, confirming that it was built on the site where the poet first espied [[Wilhelmina Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbertson, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to mention the rarely visited 'Poet's Seat', a vantage point where Burns would sit and think over his poems and songs. The seat was the branch of an oak that grew horizontally at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbertson, page 103&lt;/ref&gt; 

The building that overlooked Gaans Holm was octagonal and nine feet wide. It was originally open on three sides however it was later altered to have a doorway and two windows. It had symbols such as hearts and cupid's arrows in addition to the aforementioned verses.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; The board with the verses was stolen and only recovered twenty years later from an address in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Mauchline in Times Past. p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas refers to the fog house as a rustic grotto and states that the two verses were recorded on a tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fog house. - geograph.org.uk - 91762.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the old New Mar Lodge Fog House]]
*'''Bonnington Estate''' - The cast iron bridge here is presumed to be that built for Lady Mary Ross who replaced or adapted the dovecot which stood on Bonnington Isle, to which the bridge leads, with a 'Fog House', lined with moss. The Wordsworths visited the site in 1803 and Dorothy Wordsworth described the interior of the fog house as being 'as snug as a bird's nest' and resembling a scooped out haystack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/228186/bonnington-linn-foot-bridge Canmore RCAHMS]&lt;/ref&gt; It had a domed roof and the walls, roof and furniture were neatly covered with moss. It reminded her of huts illustrated in the book of Captain Cook's Voyages.&lt;ref&gt;Buxbaum (1989), Page 151&lt;/ref&gt; The building had a lockable door and was reached as mentioned via a cast iron bridge that replaced an earlier wooden one. Dorothy was however far from impressed by the view from this fog house and saw it as being too close to the path frequented by visitors. She did however regard it as being the finest example of a fog house that she saw during her tour in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; The fog house here no longer exists although the stone foundations are still visible and the bridge, although still present, cannot be used.
*'''Craufurdland Estate''' - A fog house is shown in the 1856 [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] map on the northern side of the Craufurdland Water close to Mount Tarbor however it is no longer marked in 1897.
*'''Invercauld Estate''' - A fog house in 2010 was located above [[Invercauld Castle]] on a woodland walk overlooking the park. It is featured in the photograph above.
*'''New Mar Lodge''' - locally known as [[Mar Lodge|Corriemulzie Cottage]], New Mar Lodge is situated near Linn of Corriemulzie at the top of Mar Lodge Brae. The Fog House is now a ruin with only the drystone walls surviving. 
*'''Penicuik Estate''' (NT 21728 58916) - In the 1990s a ruinous fog house was recorded on the Pencuik Estate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/collection/1447224 RCAHMS Canmore]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fullarton Estate''' - At the [[Crosbie Castle and the Fullarton estate|Fullarton Estate]] near [[Troon]] in South Ayrshire had thatched lodge called 'Heather House' that stood at the entrance to the house until it burned down in the 1950s.
*'''Castle Semple''' - The old OS maps show that a Fog House once stood on Courtshaw Hill close to Lochwinnoch and the site of the old mansion house and its cascades feature. A [[Moot hill|moot hill]] was also once located here.

The '''Ganges''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|n|dʒ|iː|z}} {{respell|GAN|jeez}}), or '''Ganga''' ({{IPA-hns|ˈɡəŋɡaː|lang}}; {{lang-sa|गंगा}}), is a [[trans-boundary river]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] which flows through the nations of [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. The {{convert|2525|km|mi|abbr=on}} river rises in the western [[Himalayas]] in the Indian [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Uttarakhand]], and flows south and east through the [[Gangetic Plain]] of [[North India]].  After entering West Bengal, it divides into two rivers: the [[Hooghly River]] and the [[Padma]] River. The Hooghly, or Adi Ganga, flows through several districts of [[West Bengal]] and into the [[Bay of Bengal]] near [[Sagar Island]]. The other, the Padma, also flows into and through Bangladesh, and also empties into the Bay of Bengal. 

The Ganga is one of the most sacred rivers to [[Hindus]].&lt;ref name="Alter2001"&gt;{{citation|last=Alter|first=Stephen|title=Sacred Waters: A Pilgrimage Up the Ganga River to the Source of Hindu Culture| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qb9yQgAACAAJ|accessdate=30 July 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Trade &amp; Reference Publishers |isbn=978-0151005857}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a lifeline to millions of Indians who live along its course and depend on it for their daily needs.

The main stream of the Ganges begins at the [[confluence]] of the [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]] and [[Alaknanda]] rivers in the town of [[Devprayag]] in the [[Garhwal division]] of the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].  The Bhagirathi is considered to be the [[Source (river or stream)|source]] in Hindu culture and mythology, although the Alaknanda is longer, and, therefore, hydrologically the source stream.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Ganges River |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition=Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library |url=http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48077 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penn2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Penn |first=James R. |title=Rivers of the world: a social, geographical, and environmental sourcebook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=koacGt0fhUoC |accessdate=23 April 2011 |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576070420 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headwaters of the Alakananda are formed by snowmelt from peaks such as [[Nanda Devi]], [[Trisul]], and [[Kamet]]. The Bhagirathi rises at the foot of [[Gangotri Glacier]], at [[Gomukh]], at an elevation of {{convert|3892|m|ft|abbr=on}}, being mythologically referred to as, residing in the matted locks of [[Shiva]], symbolically Tapovan, being a meadow of ethereal beauty at the feet of Mount Shivling, just {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gangotri-tapovan-trek.com/|title=Gangotri Tapovan Trekking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}}

Although many small streams comprise the headwaters of the Ganges, the six longest and their five confluences are considered sacred. The six headstreams are the [[Alaknanda]], [[Dhauliganga River|Dhauliganga]], [[Nandakini]], [[Pindar River|Pindar]], [[Mandakini River|Mandakini]], and [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]] rivers. The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form the Ganges River proper.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

After flowing 250&amp;nbsp;km (155.343&amp;nbsp;mi) {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.

The Ganges follows an {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} The Ganges joins the [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism. At their confluence the Yamuna is larger than the Ganges, contributing about {{convert|2950|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} or about 58.5% of the combined flow.{{sfn|Gupta|2007|page=347}}

Now flowing east, the river meets the [[Tamsa River]] (also called ''Tons''), which flows north from the [[Kaimur Range]] and contributes an average flow of about {{convert|190|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.

Along the way between [[Allahabad]] and [[Malda, Bihar|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Hajipur]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Saidpur, Ghazipur|Saidpur]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Pakur]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bhāgirathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of the Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Jalangi River]] at [[Nabadwip]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126–27}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].

After entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]]. The Padma is joined by the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna River]], the largest distributary of the [[Brahmaputra]]. Further downstream, the Padma joins the [[Meghna River]], the second largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, and takes on the Meghna's name as it enters the Meghna Estuary, which empties into the Bay of Bengal. Here it forms the {{convert|1430|by|3000|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Bengal Fan]], the world's largest [[submarine fan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Shanmugam, G. | title=Submarine fans: A critical retrospective (1950–2015) | year=2016 | journal= Journal of Palaeogeography | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=110–184 | doi=10.1016/j.jop.2015.08.011 | bibcode=2016JPalG...5..110S }}&lt;/ref&gt; which alone accounts for 10–20% of the global burial of [[organic carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Galy, V.; O.

The [[hydrology]] of the Ganges River is very complicated, especially in the Ganges Delta region. One result is different ways to determine the river's length, its [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]], and the size of its [[drainage basin]].

The name ''Ganges'' is used for the river between the confluence of the [[Bhagirathi]] and Alaknanda rivers, in the Himalayas, and the India-Bangladesh border, near the [[Farakka Barrage]] and the first [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]] of the river. The length of the Ganges is frequently said to be slightly over {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|2505|km|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Merriam-WebsterInc1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster|title=Merriam-Webster's geographical dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA412|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1997|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0877795469|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; to {{convert|2525|km|mi|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|pp=334–342}}{{sfn|Gupta|2007|p=347}} or perhaps {{convert|2550|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Berga|2006| p=1304}} In these cases the river's source is usually assumed to be the source of the Bhagirathi River, [[Gangotri Glacier]] at [[Gomukh]], and its mouth being the mouth of the Meghna River on the Bay of Bengal.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|pp=334–342}}{{sfn|Gupta|2007|p=347}}&lt;ref name="Merriam-WebsterInc1997"/&gt;{{sfn|Berga|2006| p=1304}} Sometimes the source of the Ganges is considered to be at [[Haridwar]], where its Himalayan headwater streams debouch onto the Gangetic Plain.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=210}}

In some cases, the length of the Ganges is given for its Hooghly River distributary, which is longer than its main outlet via the Meghna River, resulting in a total length of about {{convert|2620|km|mi|abbr=on}}, from the source of the Bhagirathi,{{sfn|Parua|2009}} or {{convert|2135|km|mi|abbr=on}}, from Haridwar to the Hooghly's mouth.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009}} In other cases the length is said to be about {{convert|2240|km|mi|abbr=on}}, from the source of the Bhagirathi to the Bangladesh border, where its name changes to ''Padma''.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}}

For similar reasons, sources differ over the size of the river's drainage basin. The basin covers parts of four countries, [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and [[Bangladesh]]; eleven Indian states, [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], Madhya Pradesh, [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], Haryana, [[Rajasthan]], West Bengal, and the Union Territory of [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Ganges Water Machine|author1=Roger Revelle |author2=V.

The Ganges basin ranges from the [[Himalaya]] and the [[Transhimalaya]] in the north, to the northern slopes of the [[Vindhya]] range in the south, from the eastern slopes of the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] in the west to the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]] and the [[Sunderbans]] delta in the east.

The discharge of the Ganges also differs by source. Frequently, discharge is described for the mouth of the Meghna River, thus combining the Ganges with the [[Brahmaputra]] and Meghna. This results in a total average annual discharge of about {{convert|38000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Arnold|2000}} or {{convert|42470|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} In other cases the average annual discharges of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna are given separately, at about {{convert|16650|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} for the Ganges, about {{convert|19820|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} for the Brahmaputra, and about {{convert|5100|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} for the Meghna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|pp=334–342}}

[[File:Hardinge Bridge Bangladesh (4).JPG|thumb|[[Hardinge Bridge]], Bangladesh, crosses the Ganges-Padma River. It is one of the key sites for measuring streamflow and discharge on the lower Ganges.]]
The maximum peak discharge of the Ganges, as recorded at [[Hardinge Bridge]] in Bangladesh, exceeded {{convert|70000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=10}} The minimum recorded at the same place was about {{convert|180|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, in 1997.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}

The hydrologic cycle in the Ganges basin is governed by the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|Southwest Monsoon]]. About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}

In the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.

Before the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126–27}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.&lt;ref name="Catling1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&amp;pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Brahmaputra"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

==History==
[[File:The Birth of Gangā.jpg|thumb|upright|The birth of Ganges]]
The [[Indus Valley Civilization#Late Harappan|Late Harappan]] period, about 1900–1300 BCE, saw the spread of Harappan settlement eastward from the [[Indus River]] basin to the Ganges-Yamuna [[doab]], although none crossed the Ganges to settle its eastern bank. The disintegration of the Harappan civilisation, in the early [[2nd millennium BC]], marks the point when the centre of Indian civilisation shifted from the Indus basin to the Ganges basin.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=The ancient Indus Valley: new perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=25 April 2011|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1576079072|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be links between the Late Harappan settlement of the Ganges basin and the [[archaeological culture]] known as "[[Cemetery H culture|Cemetery H]]", the [[Indo-Aryan people]], and the [[Vedic period]].

The first European traveller to mention the Ganges was [[Megasthenes]] (ca. 350–290 BCE). He did so several times in his work [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]]: "India, again, possesses many rivers both large and navigable, which, having their sources in the mountains which stretch along the northern frontier, traverse the level country, and not a few of these, after uniting with each other, fall into the river called the Ganges. Now this river, which at its source is 30&amp;nbsp;stadia broad, flows from north to south, and empties its waters into the ocean forming the eastern boundary of the [[Gangaridai]], a nation which possesses a vast force of the largest-sized elephants." (Diodorus II.37)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Alexander and the Ganges| author=W. W. Tarn| journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies| year=1923| volume=43 | issue = 2 | pages=93–101| jstor=625798}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the rainy season of 1809, the lower channel of the Bhagirathi, leading to Kolkata, had been entirely shut; but in the following year it opened again, and was nearly of the same size with the upper channel; both however suffered a considerable diminution, owing probably to the new communication opened below the Jalanggi on the upper channel.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In 1951 a [[Sharing the water of the Ganges|water sharing dispute]] arose between India and East Pakistan (now [[Bangladesh]]), after India declared its intention to build the [[Farakka Barrage]]. The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136–37}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem. One plan is for another barrage to be built in Bangladesh at [[Pangsha Upazila|Pangsha]], west of [[Dhaka]]. This barrage would help Bangladesh better utilise its share of the waters of the Ganges.{{efn|1= {{harvtxt|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=172, 178–87, 387–91}}Treaty Between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh on Sharing of the Ganga/Ganges Waters at Farakka.

===Embodiment of sacredness===
[[File:IndianWomanFloatingLampsGanges.jpg|thumb|right|Chromolithograph, "Indian woman floating lamps on the Ganges," by William Simpson, 1867.]]
The Ganges is a sacred river to Hindus along every fragment of its length. All along its course, Hindus bathe in its waters,&lt;ref name=eck1982-p212&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; paying homage to their ancestors and to their gods by cupping the water in their hands, lifting it and letting it fall back into the river; they offer flowers and rose petals and float shallow clay dishes filled with oil and lit with wicks (diyas).&lt;ref name=eck1982-p212/&gt; On the journey back home from the Ganges, they carry small quantities of river water with them for use in rituals (Ganga jal, literally water of the Ganges).&lt;ref name=eck1982-p212-213&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|pp=212–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ganges is the embodiment of all sacred waters in [[Hindu mythology]].&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local rivers are said to be ''like'' the Ganges, and are sometimes called the local Ganges (Ganga).&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214/&gt; The [[Kaveri River|Kaveri river]] of [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] in Southern India is called the Ganges of the South; the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], is the Ganges that was led by the sage [[Gautama Maharishi|Gautama]] to flow through Central India.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214/&gt; The Ganges is invoked whenever water is used in Hindu ritual, and is therefore present in all sacred waters.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214/&gt; In spite of this, nothing is more stirring for a Hindu than a dip in the actual river, which is thought to remit sins, especially at one of the famous [[Tirtha and Kshetra|tirthas]] such as [[Gangotri]], [[Haridwar]], [[Triveni Sangam|Prayag]], or [[Varanasi]].&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214/&gt; The symbolic and religious importance of the Ganges is one of the few things that Hindu India, even its skeptics, are agreed upon.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214-215&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|pp=214–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jawaharlal Nehru, a religious iconoclast himself, asked for a handful of his ashes to be thrown into the Ganges.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p214-215/&gt; "The Ganga," he wrote in his will, "is the river of India, beloved of her people, round which are intertwined her racial memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of triumph, her victories and her defeats.

===''Avatarana''  Descent of the Ganges===
[[File:Ravi Varma-Descent of Ganga.jpg|thumb|upright|Descent of Ganga – painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]

In late May or early June every year, Hindus celebrate the ''karunasiri'' and rise of the Ganges from earth to heaven.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the celebration, ''Ganga Dashahara'', the ''dashami'' (tenth day) of the [[waxing moon]] of the [[Hindu calendar]] month [[Jyestha]], brings throngs of bathers to the banks of the river.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144/&gt; A dip in the Ganges on this day is said to rid the bather of ten sins (dasha = Sanskrit "ten"; hara = to destroy) or alternatively, ten lifetimes of sins.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144/&gt; Those who cannot journey to the river, however, can achieve the same results by bathing in any nearby body of water, which, for the true believer, in the Hindu tradition, takes on all the attributes of the Ganges.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144/&gt;

The ''karunasiri'' is an old theme in Hinduism with a number of different versions of the story.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144/&gt; In the [[Vedas|Vedic]] version, [[Indra]], the Lord of [[Svarga]] ([[Heaven]]) slays the celestial serpent, [[Vritra]], releasing the celestial liquid, the ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]'', or the nectar of the gods which then plunges to the earth and waters it with sustenance.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144/&gt;

In the [[Vaishnava]] version of the myth, the heavenly waters are now a river called ''Vishnupadi'' (''padi'': Skt. "from the foot of").&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144/&gt; As Lord Vishnu completes his celebrated three strides—of earth, sky, and heaven—Vishnu as [[Vamana]] stubs his toe on the vault of heaven, punches open a hole, and releases the ''Vishnupadi'', which until now had been circling around the cosmic egg within.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144-145&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|pp=144–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowing out of the vault, she plummets down to Indra's heaven, where she is received by [[Dhruva]], the once steadfast worshipper of Vishnu, now fixed in the sky as the [[Pole star|polestar]].&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144-145/&gt; Next, she streams across the sky forming the [[Milky Way]] and arrives on the moon.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144-145/&gt; She then flows down earthwards to [[Brahma]]'s realm, a divine lotus atop [[Mount Meru]], whose petals form the earthly continents.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144-145/&gt; There, the divine waters break up, with one stream, the [[Alaknanda River|Alaknanda]], flowing down one petal into Bharatvarsha (India) as the Ganges.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p144-145/&gt;

It is [[Shiva]], however, among the major deities of the Hindu pantheon, who appears in the most widely known version of the ''avatarana'' story.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Told and retold in the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]] and several [[Puranas]], the story begins with a sage, [[Kapila]], whose intense meditation has been disturbed by the sixty thousand sons of King [[Sagara (Vedic king)|Sagara]]. Livid at being disturbed, Kapila sears them with his angry gaze, reduces them to ashes, and dispatches them to the netherworld. Only the waters of the Ganges, then in heaven, can bring the dead sons their salvation. A descendant of these sons, King [[Bhagiratha]], anxious to restore his ancestors, undertakes rigorous penance and is eventually granted the prize of Ganga's descent from heaven. However, since her turbulent force would also shatter the earth, Bhagiratha persuades Shiva in his abode on [[Mount Kailash]] to receive Ganga in the coils of his tangled hair and break her fall. Ganga descends, is tamed in Shiva's locks, and arrives in the Himalayas. She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganga Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145/&gt; In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, "of Bhagiratha").&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145/&gt;

===Redemption of the Dead===

Since Ganga had descended from heaven to earth, she is also the vehicle of ''ascent'', from earth to heaven.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145-146&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|pp=145–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''Triloka-patha-gamini'', (Skt. ''triloka''= "three worlds", ''patha'' = "road", ''gamini'' = "one who travels") of the Hindu tradition, she flows in [[Svarga|heaven]], [[Prithvi|earth]], and the [[Patala|netherworld]], and, consequently, is a "tirtha," or crossing point of all beings, the living as well as the dead.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145-146/&gt; It is for this reason that the story of the ''avatarana'' is told at ''[[Śrāddha|Shraddha]]'' ceremonies for the deceased in Hinduism, and Ganges water is used in [[Vedic rituals after death]].&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145-146/&gt; Among all hymns devoted to the Ganges, there are none more popular than the ones expressing the worshipers wish to breathe his last surrounded by her waters.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145-146/&gt; The ''Gangashtakam'' expresses this longing fervently:&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145-146/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;O Mother! ... Necklace adorning the worlds! &lt;br&gt; Banner rising to heaven! &lt;br&gt; I ask that I may leave of this body on your banks,&lt;br&gt; Drinking your water, rolling in your waves, &lt;br&gt; Remembering your name, bestowing my gaze upon you.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: {{Harvnb|Eck|1998|pp=145–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
No place along her banks is more longed for at the moment of death by Hindus than Varanasi, the Great Cremation Ground, or ''[[Shmashana|Mahashmshana]]''.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p145-146/&gt; Those who are lucky enough to die in Varanasi, are cremated on the banks of the Ganges, and are granted instant salvation.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p215&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the death has occurred elsewhere, salvation can be achieved by immersing the ashes in the Ganges.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p215/&gt; If the ashes have been immersed in another body of water, a relative can still gain salvation for the deceased by journeying to the Ganges, if possible during the lunar "fortnight of the ancestors" in the Hindu calendar month of [[Ashwin]] (September or October), and performing the ''Shraddha'' rites.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p215/&gt;

Hindus also perform ''[[Pinda (riceball)|pinda]] pradana'', a rite for the dead, in which balls of rice and sesame seed are offered to the Ganges while the names of the deceased relatives are recited.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p215-216&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|pp=215–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every sesame seed in every ball thus offered, according to one story, assures a thousand years of heavenly salvation for the each relative.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p215-216/&gt; Indeed, the Ganges is so important in the rituals after death that the ''Mahabharata'', in one of its popular ''ślokas'', says, "If only (one) bone of a (deceased) person should touch the water of the Ganges, that person shall dwell honoured in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: {{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; As if to illustrate this truism, the ''Kashi Khanda'' (Varanasi Chapter) of the [[Skanda Purana]] recounts the remarkable story of ''Vahika'', a profligate and unrepentant sinner, who is killed by a tiger in the forest. His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below. Blessed by this happenstance, Vahika, on his way to hell, is rescued by a celestial chariot which takes him instead to heaven.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p216&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Purifying Ganges===
[[File:Ganga Dashara, at Haridwar.jpg|thumb|Devotees taking holy bath during festival of ''Ganga Dashahara'' at [[Har Ki Pauri]], [[Haridwar]]]]
Hindus consider the waters of the Ganges to be both pure and purifying.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p216-217&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|pp=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing reclaims order from disorder more than the waters of the Ganges.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p217&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving water, as in a river, is considered purifying in Hindu culture because it is thought to both absorb impurities and take them away.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p217/&gt; The swiftly moving Ganges, especially in its upper reaches, where a bather has to grasp an anchored chain in order to not be carried away, is considered especially purifying.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p217/&gt; What the Ganges removes, however, is not necessarily physical dirt, but symbolic dirt; it wipes away the sins of the bather, not just of the present, but of a lifetime.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p217/&gt;

A popular paean to the Ganges is the ''Ganga Lahiri'' composed by a seventeenth century poet Jagannatha who, legend has it, was turned out of his Hindu [[Brahmin]] caste for carrying on an affair with a Muslim woman. Having attempted futilely to be rehabilitated within the Hindu fold, the poet finally appeals to Ganga, the hope of the hopeless, and the comforter of last resort. Along with his beloved, Jagannatha sits at the top of the flight of steps leading to the water at the famous ''Panchganga'' [[Ghat]] in Varanasi. As he recites each verse of the poem, the water of the Ganges rises up one step, until in the end it envelops the lovers and carry them away.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p217/&gt; "I come to you as a child to his mother," begins the ''Ganga Lahiri''.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p218&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; I come as an orphan to you, moist with love. &lt;br&gt; I come without refuge to you, giver of sacred rest. &lt;br&gt; I come a fallen man to you, uplifter of all. &lt;br&gt; I come undone by disease to you, the perfect physician. &lt;br&gt; I come, my heart dry with thirst, to you, ocean of sweet wine. &lt;br&gt; Do with me whatever you will.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p218/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ganga is a consort to all three major male deities of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1982|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Brahma]]'s partner she always travels with him in the form of water in his [[kamandalu]] (water-pot).&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; She is also [[Vishnu]]'s consort.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; Not only does she emanate from his foot as ''Vishnupadi'' in the ''avatarana'' story, but is also, with [[Sarasvati]] and [[Lakshmi]], one of his co-wives.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; In one popular story, envious of being outdone by each other, the co-wives begin to quarrel. While Lakshmi attempts to mediate the quarrel, Ganga and Sarasvati, heap misfortune on each other. They curse each other to become rivers, and to carry within them, by washing, the sins of their human worshippers. Soon their husband, Vishnu, arrives and decides to calm the situation by separating the goddesses. He orders Sarasvati to become the wife of Brahma, Ganga to become the wife of Shiva, and Lakshmi, as the blameless conciliator, to remain as his own wife. Ganga and Sarasvati, however, are so distraught at this dispensation, and wail so loudly, that Vishnu is forced to take back his words. Consequently, in their lives as rivers they are still thought to be with him.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p146&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shiva Bearing the Descent of the Ganges River, folio from a Hindi manuscript by the saint Narayan LACMA M.86.345.6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shiva]], as ''Gangadhara'', bearing the Descent of the [[Ganges river|Ganges]], as the goddess [[Parvati]], the sage [[Bhagiratha]], and the bull [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] look on (circa 1740).]]
It is [[Shiva]]'s relationship with Ganga, that is the best-known in Ganges mythology.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p147&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her descent, the ''avatarana'' is not a one time event, but a continuously occurring one in which she is forever falling from heaven into his locks and being forever tamed.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p147/&gt; Shiva, is depicted in Hindu iconography as ''Gangadhara'', the "Bearer of the Ganga," with Ganga, shown as spout of water, rising from his hair.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p147/&gt; The Shiva-Ganga relationship is both perpetual and intimate.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p147/&gt; Shiva is sometimes called ''Uma-Ganga-Patiswara'' ("Husband and Lord of Uma (Parvati) and Ganga"), and Ganga often arouses the jealousy of Shiva's better-known consort [[Parvati]].&lt;ref name=eck1998-p147/&gt;

Ganga is the ''[[shakti]]'' or the moving, restless, rolling energy in the form of which the otherwise recluse and unapproachable Shiva appears on earth.&lt;ref name="eck1982-p219"/&gt; As water, this moving energy can be felt, tasted, and absorbed.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; The war-god [[Kartikeya|Skanda]] addresses the sage [[Agastya]] in the ''Kashi Khand'' of the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' in these words:&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; One should not be amazed ... that this Ganges is really Power, for is she not the Supreme Shakti of the Eternal Shiva, taken in the form of water?&lt;br&gt; This Ganges, filled with the sweet wine of compassion, was sent out for the salvation of the world by Shiva, the Lord of the Lords. &lt;br&gt; Good people should not think this Triple-Pathed River to be like the thousand other earthly rivers, filled with water.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ganges is also the mother, the ''Ganga Mata'' (''mata''="mother") of Hindu worship and culture, accepting all and forgiving all.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p218/&gt; Unlike other goddesses, she has no destructive or fearsome aspect, destructive though she might be as a river in nature.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p218/&gt; She is also a mother to other gods.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p149&gt;{{Harvnb|Eck|1998|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepts Shiva's incandescent seed from the fire-god [[Agni]], which is too hot for this world, and cools it in her waters.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p149/&gt; This union produces Skanda, or Kartikeya, the god of war.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p149/&gt; In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', she is the wife of [[Shantanu]], and the mother of heroic warrior-patriarch, [[Bhishma]].&lt;ref name=eck1998-p149/&gt; When Bhishma is mortally wounded in battle, Ganga comes out of the water in human form and weeps uncontrollably over his body.&lt;ref name=eck1998-p149/&gt;

The Ganges is the distilled lifeblood of the Hindu tradition, of its divinities, holy books, and enlightenment.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; As such, her worship does not require the usual rites of invocation (''avahana'') at the beginning and dismissal (''visarjana'') at the end, required in the worship of other gods.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt; Her divinity is immediate and everlasting.&lt;ref name=eck1982-p219/&gt;

Early in ancient Indian culture, the river Ganges was associated with fecundity, its redeeming waters and its rich silt providing sustenance to all who lived along its banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blurton|1993|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A counterpoise to the dazzling heat of the Indian summer, the Ganges came to be imbued with magical qualities and to be revered in anthropomorphic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wangu|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 5th century CE, an elaborate mythology surrounded the Ganges, now a goddess in her own right, and a symbol for all rivers of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wangu|2003|p=90}}, {{Harvnb|Pal|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu temples all over India had statues and reliefs of the goddess carved at their entrances, symbolically washing the sins of arriving worshippers and guarding the gods within.&lt;ref name=pal-1997-p43&gt;{{Harvnb|Pal|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; As protector of the [[sanctum sanctorum]], the goddess soon came to depicted with several characteristic accessories: the ''[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]'' (a crocodile-like undersea monster, often shown with an elephant-like trunk), the ''[[kumbha]]'' (an overfull vase), various overhead parasol-like coverings, and a gradually increasing retinue of humans.&lt;ref name=darian2001-p114&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the goddess's visual identification is the ''makara'', which is also her ''[[vahana]]'', or mount. An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art.&lt;ref name=darian2001-p114/&gt; The ''makara'' has a dual symbolism. On the one hand, it represents the life-affirming waters and plants of its environment; on the other, it represents fear, both fear of the unknown it elicits by lurking in those waters and real fear it instils by appearing in sight.&lt;ref name=darian2001-p114/&gt; The earliest extant unambiguous pairing of the ''makara'' with Ganga is at [[Udayagiri Caves]] in Central India (circa 400 CE). Here, in [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).&lt;ref name=darian2001-p114/&gt;

The ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p118&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p118/&gt; The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself. Although she has provided sustenance to millions, she has also brought hardship, injury, and death by causing major floods along her banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|pp=119–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess Ganga is also accompanied by a dwarf attendant, who carries a cosmetic bag, and on whom she sometimes leans, as if for support.&lt;ref name=pal-1997-p43/&gt; (See, for example, frames 1, 2, and 4 above.)

The ''purna kumbha'' or full pot of water is the second most discernible element of the Ganga iconography.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p125&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing first also in the relief in Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p125/&gt; By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, the [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh#Dashavatara temple|Dashavatara temple]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]] (seventh century), the [[Badoli Temples|Trimurti temple]], Badoli, [[Chittor Fort|Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan, and at the [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh#Tourist attractions|Lakshmaneshwar temple]], [[Kharod]], [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]],&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p125/&gt; (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames. Worshipped even today, the full pot is emblematic of the formless [[Brahman]], as well as of woman, of the womb, and of birth.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p126&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, The river goddesses Ganga and Saraswati were both born from Brahma's pot, containing the celestial waters.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p126/&gt;

In her earliest depictions at temple entrances, the goddess Ganga appeared standing beneath the overhanging branch of a tree, as seen as well in the Udayagiri caves.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p130&gt;{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, soon the tree cover had evolved into a ''[[chatra]]'' or parasol held by an attendant, for example, in the seventh-century Dasavatara temple at Deogarh.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p130/&gt; (The parasol can be clearly seen in frame 3 above; its stem can be seen in frame 4, but the rest has broken off.) The cover undergoes another transformation in the temple at Kharod, Bilaspur (ninth or tenth century), where the parasol is lotus-shaped,&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p130/&gt; and yet another at the Trimurti temple at Badoli where the parasol has been replaced entirely by a lotus.&lt;ref name=darian-2001-p130/&gt;

As the iconography evolved, sculptors in the central India especially were producing animated scenes of the goddess, replete with an entourage and suggestive of a queen en route to a river to bathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Pal|1988|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relief similar to the depiction in frame 4 above, is described in {{Harvnb|Pal|1997|p=43}} as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt; A typical relief of about the ninth century that once stood at the entrance of a temple, the river goddess Ganga is shown as a voluptuously endowed lady with a retinue. Following the iconographic prescription, she stands gracefully on her composite ''makara'' mount and holds a water pot. The dwarf attendant carries her cosmetic bag, and a ... female holds the stem of a giant lotus leaf that serves as her mistress's parasol. The fourth figure is a male guardian. Often in such reliefs the ''makara'''s tail is extended with great flourish into a scrolling design symbolizing both vegetation and water.&lt;ref name=pal-1997-p43/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kumbh Mela===
[[File:Kumbh Mela2001.JPG|thumb|A procession of [[Akhara]]s marching over a makeshift bridge over the Ganges River. Kumbh Mela at [[Allahabad]], 2001.]]
{{main|Kumbh Mela}}
Kumbh Mela is a mass Hindu [[pilgrimage]] in which Hindus gather at the Ganges River. The normal Kumbh [[Mela]] is celebrated every 3 years, the ''Ardh'' (half) Kumbh is celebrated every six years at Haridwar and Prayag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828666,00.html |title=The Urn Festival] |publisher=TIME |date=8 February 1960 |accessdate=10 May 2013}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Purna'' (complete) Kumbh takes place every twelve years&lt;ref name=hydro/&gt; at four places ([[Prayag]] (Allahabad), [[Haridwar]], [[Ujjain]], and [[Nashik]]). The ''Maha'' (great) Kumbh Mela which comes after 12 'Purna Kumbh Melas', or 144 years, is held at Prayag (Allahabad).&lt;ref name=hydro&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JI65-MygMm0C&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Kumbh+Mela |title=The Basis of Civilization: Water Science? |publisher= International Association of Hydrological Science |page=165 |isbn= 978-1901502572 |year=2004 |accessdate=10 May 2013 |author=J.

The major event of the festival is [[Ritual purification|ritual bathing]] at the banks of the river. Other activities include religious discussions, devotional singing, mass feeding of holy men and women and the poor, and religious assemblies where doctrines are debated and standardized. Kumbh Mela is the most sacred of all the pilgrimages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-UwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=kumbh+is+most+sacred+pilgrimage#v=onepage&amp;q=kumbh%20is%20most%20sacred%20pilgrimage&amp;f=false | title=''Life'' | journal=A Million Hindus Wash Away Their Sins |date=1 May 1950 | volume=18 | pages=25–29| publisher=Time Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/columnist/2012-10-25/kumbh-mela-most-sacred-hindu-pilgrimages | title=Kumbh Mela, most sacred of Hindu pilgrimages | work=Guardian| date=25 October 2012 | accessdate=10 May 2013 | author=Maharaj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of holy men and women attend, and the auspiciousness of the festival is in part attributable to this.

==Irrigation==
The Ganges and its all tributaries, especially the Yamuna, have been used for irrigation since ancient times.{{sfn|Singh|2005|pp=69–79}} Dams and canals were common in gangetic plain by fourth century BCE.{{sfn|Hill|2008}} The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin has a huge [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] potential, on the order of 200,000 to 250,000 megawatts, nearly half of which could be easily harnessed. As of 1999, India tapped about 12% of the hydroelectric potential of the Ganges and just 1% of the vast potential of the Brahmaputra.{{sfn|Elhance|1999|p=163}}

===Canals===
[[File:Headworks ganges canal haridwar1860.jpg|thumb|Head works of the [[Ganges canal]] in [[Haridwar]] (1860). photograph by [[Samuel Bourne]].]]
[[Megasthenes]], a Greek ethnographer who visited India during third century BCE when Mauryans ruled India described the existence of canals in the gangetic plain. Kautilya (also known as [[Chanakya]]), an advisor to [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of [[Maurya Empire]], included the destruction of dams and levees as a strategy during war.{{sfn|Hill|2008}} [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]] had many canals built, the longest of which, {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}}, was built in 1356 on the Yamuna River. Now known as the Western Yamuna Canal, it has fallen into disrepair and been restored several times. The [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] built an irrigation canal on the Yamuna River in the early 17th century. It fell into disuse until 1830, when it was reopened as the Eastern Yamuna Canal, under British control. The reopened canal became a model for the Upper Ganges Canal and all following canal projects.{{sfn|Singh|2005|pp=69–79}}
[[File:GangesCanal2.jpg|thumb|The Ganges Canal highlighted in red stretching between its headworks off the Ganges River in [[Haridwar]] and its confluences with the [[Yamuna River|Jumna River]] in [[Etawah]] and with the Ganges in [[Cawnpore]] (now Kanpur).]]
The first British canal in India—with no Indian antecedents—was the [[Ganges Canal]] built between 1842 and 1854.&lt;ref name="stone2002-p16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Contemplated first by Col. [[John Russell Colvin]] in 1836, it did not at first elicit much enthusiasm from its eventual architect Sir [[Proby Thomas Cautley]], who balked at idea of cutting a canal through extensive low-lying land in order to reach the drier upland destination. However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837–38]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal. The Court of Directors, moreover, considerably enlarged the scope of the projected canal, which, in consequence of the severity and geographical extent of the famine, they now deemed to be the entire [[Doab]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ce8FpJzR-4C&amp;pg=PA103|title=Uttar Pradesh General Knowledge|first=Dr C. L.|last=Khanna|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Upkar Prakashan|via=Google Books|isbn=9788174824080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enthusiasm, however, proved to be short lived. Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General. Canal construction, under Cautley's supervision, now went into full swing. A {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} long canal, with another {{convert|300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of branch lines, eventually stretched between the headworks in [[Haridwar]], splitting into two branches below [[Aligarh]], and its two confluences with the Yamuna (Jumna in map) [[Mainstem (hydrology)|mainstem]] in [[Etawah]] and the Ganges in [[Kanpur]] (Cawnpore in map). The Ganges Canal, which required a total capital outlay of £2.15 million, was officially opened in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie.{{sfn|Prakash|1999|p=162}} According to historian Ian Stone: &lt;blockquote&gt;It was the largest canal ever attempted in the world, five times greater in its length than all the main irrigation lines of [[Lombardy]] and Egypt put together, and longer by a third than even the largest USA navigation canal, the [[Pennsylvania Canal]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dams and barrages===
A major [[Barrage (dam)|barrage]] at [[Farakka]] was opened on 21 April 1975,{{sfn|Brichieri-Colombi|Bradnock|2003}} It is located close to the point where the main flow of the river enters Bangladesh, and the tributary Hooghly (also known as Bhagirathi) continues in West Bengal past
Kolkata. This barrage, which feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a {{convert|26|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip|abbr=on}} long feeder canal, and its water flow management has been a long-lingering source of dispute with Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Ganges Water Dispute: An Appraisal of a Third Party Settlement| author=M. Rafiqul Islam| journal=Asian Survey| year=1987| volume=27 | issue = 8| pages=918–34| doi=10.1525/as.1987.27.8.01p0082a}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharing the water of the Ganges|Indo-Bangladesh Ganges Water Treaty]] signed in December 1996 addressed some of the water sharing issues between India and Bangladesh.{{sfn|Brichieri-Colombi|Bradnock|2003}}

[[Tehri Dam]] was constructed on [[Bhagirathi]] River, tributary of the Ganges. It is located 1.5&amp;nbsp;km downstream of Ganesh Prayag, the place where Bhilangana meets Bhagirathi. Bhagirathi is called Ganges after Devprayag.{{sfn|Sharma|Bahuguna|Chauan|2008}} Construction of the dam in an earthquake prone area{{sfn|Brune|1993}} was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The dam that should not be built|author1=Fred Pearce |author2=Rob Butler | journal=New Scientist| date=26 January 1991| url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917534.600--the-dam-that-should-not-be-built-india-is-building-the-largest-dam-in-asia-in-a-valley-beset-by-earthquakes-and-landslips-seismologists-say-the-site-is-too-dangerous-but-engineers-are-using-discredited-data-to-push-ahead-with-construction--.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bansagar Dam]] was built on the [[Son River]], a tributary of the Ganges for both irrigation and [[hydroelectric]] power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mowr.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/anu228556756739.pdf |title=Bansagar Dam project |accessdate=27 April 2011 |publisher=Government of India Ministry of Water Sources |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008223133/http://mowr.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/anu228556756739.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganga flood waters along with [[Brahmaputra]] waters can be supplied to most of its right side basin area along with central and south India by constructing a [[coastal reservoir]] to store water on the [[Bay of Bengal]] sea area.&lt;ref name=bgm&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/390880621/Feasibility-of-coastal-reservoir-to-harness-Brahmaputra-and-Ganga-surplus-waters |title=Feasibility of coastal reservoir to harness Brahmaputra and Ganga surplus waters|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:A girl selling plastic containers for carrying Ganges water, Haridwar.jpg|thumb|upright|A girl selling plastic containers for carrying Ganges water, Haridwar.]]

The [[Ganges Basin]] with its fertile soil is instrumental to the agricultural economies of India and Bangladesh. The Ganges and its tributaries provide a perennial source of irrigation to a large area. Chief crops cultivated in the area include rice, [[sugarcane]], [[lentil]]s, [[oil seed]]s, potatoes, and wheat. Along the banks of the river, the presence of [[swamp]]s and lakes provide a rich growing area for crops such as legumes, chillies, mustard, sesame, sugarcane, and jute. There are also many fishing opportunities along the river, though it remains highly polluted. Also the major industrial towns of [[Unnao]], [[Kanpur]], situated on the banks of the river with the predominance of tanning industries add to the pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/pollution%20caused%20by%20leather%20tannery%20industry%20in%20Unnao%20district.pdf|title=Report of the committee on pollution caused by leather tanning industry to the water bodies / ground water in Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh|type=PDF|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
Tourism is another related activity.

==Ecology and environment==

[[File:Bangladesh tmo 2011313.jpg|thumb|''Ganges from Space'']]
Human development, mostly agriculture, has replaced nearly all of the original natural vegetation of the Ganges basin. More than 95% of the upper Gangetic Plain has been degraded or converted to agriculture or urban areas. Only one large block of relatively intact habitat remains, running along the Himalayan foothills and including [[Rajaji National Park]], [[Jim Corbett National Park]], and [[Dudhwa National Park]].&lt;ref name=wwf0166&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0166 |name= Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as the 16th and 17th centuries the upper Gangetic Plain harboured impressive populations of wild [[Asian elephant]]s (''Elephas maximus''), [[Bengal tiger]]s (''Panthera t. tigris''), [[Indian rhinoceros]] (''Rhinoceros unicornis''), [[gaur]]s (''Bos gaurus''), [[barasingha]]s (''Rucervus duvaucelii''), [[sloth bear]]s (''Melursus ursinus'') and [[Indian lion]]s (''Panthera leo persica'').&lt;ref name=wwf0166/&gt; In the 21st century there are few large wild animals, mostly deer, [[wild boar]]s, [[wildcat]]s, and small numbers of [[Indian wolf|Indian wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and [[Red fox|red]] and [[Bengal fox]]es. Bengal tigers survive only in the [[Sundarbans]] area of the Ganges Delta.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The Sundarbands freshwater swamp ecoregion, however, is nearly extinct.&lt;ref name=wwf0162&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0162 |name= Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Threatened species|Threatened]] mammals in the upper Gangetic Plain include the tiger, elephant, sloth bear, and [[four-horned antelope]] (''Tetracerus quadricornis'').&lt;ref name=wwf0166/&gt;

[[File:Florican, 1781.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Lesser florican]] (''Sypheotides indicus'')]]

Many types of birds are found throughout the basin, such as [[myna]], ''[[Psittacula]]'' parakeets, [[crow]]s, [[Kite (bird)|kites]], [[partridge]]s, and [[fowl]]s. [[Duck]]s and [[snipe]]s migrate across the Himalayas during the winter, attracted in large numbers to wetland areas.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; There are no [[Endemism|endemic]] birds in the upper Gangetic Plain. The [[great Indian bustard]] (''Ardeotis nigriceps'') and [[lesser florican]] (''Sypheotides indicus'') are considered globally threatened.&lt;ref name=wwf0166/&gt;

The natural forest of the upper Gangetic Plain has been so thoroughly eliminated it is difficult to assign a natural vegetation type with certainty. There are a few small patches of forest left, and they suggest that much of the upper plains may have supported a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist deciduous forest]] with sal (''[[Shorea robusta]]'') as a [[climax species]].&lt;ref name=wwf0166/&gt;

A similar situation is found in the lower Gangetic Plain, which includes the lower Brahmaputra River. The lower plains contain more open forests, which tend to be dominated by ''[[Bombax ceiba]]'' in association with ''[[Albizzia procera]]'', ''[[Duabanga grandiflora]]'', and ''[[Sterculia vilosa]]''. There are early [[seral]] forest communities that would eventually become dominated by the climax species sal (''Shorea robusta''), if forest succession was allowed to proceed. In most places forests fail to reach climax conditions due to human causes.&lt;ref name=wwf0120&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0120 |name= Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests of the lower Gangetic Plain, despite thousands of years of human settlement, remained largely intact until the early 20th century. Today only about 3% of the ecoregion is under natural forest and only one large block, south of Varanasi, remains. There are over forty protected areas in the ecoregion, but over half of these are less than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=wwf0120/&gt; The fauna of the lower Gangetic Plain is similar to the upper plains, with the addition of a number of other species such as the [[smooth-coated otter]] (''Lutrogale perspicillata'') and the [[large Indian civet]] (''Viverra zibetha'').&lt;ref name=wwf0120/&gt;

===Fish===
[[File:Catla catla India.jpg|thumb|The [[catla]] (''Catla catla'') is one of the Indian carp species that support major fisheries in the Ganges]]

It has been estimated that about 350 fish species live in the entire Ganges drainage, including several [[Endemism|endemics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors=Allen, D.J.; S. Molur; and B.A. Daniel | title=The Status and Distribution of Freshwater Biodiversity in the Eastern Himalaya | year=2010 | publisher=IUCN | page=23 | isbn=978-2-8317-1324-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a major 2007–2009 study of fish in the Ganges basin (including the river itself and its tributaries, but excluding the Brahmaputra and Meghna basins), a total of 143 fish species were recorded, including 10 non-native [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Sarkar; Pathak; Sinha; Sivakumar; Pandian; Pandey; Dubey; and Lakra | title=Freshwater fish biodiversity in the River Ganga (India): changing pattern, threats and conservation perspectives | year=2012 | journal=Rev Fish Biol Fisheries | volume=22 | pages=251–272 | doi=10.1007/s11160-011-9218-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most diverse orders are [[Cypriniformes]] (barbs and allies), [[Siluriformes]] (catfish) and [[Perciformes]] (perciform fish), each comprising about 50%, 23% and 14% of the total fish species in the drainage.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt;

There are distinct differences between the different sections of the river basin, but [[Cyprinidae]] is the most diverse throughout. In the upper section (roughly equalling the basin parts in Uttarakhand) more than 50 species have been recorded and Cyprinidae alone accounts for almost 80% those, followed by [[Balitoridae]] (about 15.6%) and [[Sisoridae]] (about 12.2%).&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt; Sections of the Ganges basin at altitudes above {{convert|2400-3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level are generally without fish. Typical genera approaching this altitude are ''[[Schizothorax]]'', ''[[Tor (genus)|Tor]]'', ''[[Barilius]]'', ''[[Nemacheilus]]'' and ''[[Glyptothorax]]''.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt; About 100 species have been recorded from the middle section of the basin (roughly equalling the sections in Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar) and more than 55% of these are in family Cyprinidae, followed by [[Schilbeidae]] (about 10.6%) and [[Clupeidae]] (about 8.6%).&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt; The lower section (roughly equalling the basin in parts of Bihar and West Bengal) includes major floodplains and is home to almost 100 species. About 46% of these are in the family Cyprinidae, followed by Schilbeidae (about 11.4%) and [[Bagridae]] (about 9%).&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt;

The Ganges basin supports major fisheries, but these have declined in recent decades. In the [[Allahabad]] region in the middle section of the basin, catches of carp fell from 424.91 metric tons in 1961–1968 to 38.58 metric tons in 2001–2006, and catches of catfish fell from 201.35 metric tons in 1961–1968 to 40.56 metric tons in 2001–2006.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt; In the [[Patna]] region in the lower section of the basin, catches of carp fell from 383.2 metric tons to 118, and catfish from 373.8 metric tons to 194.48.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt; Some of the fish commonly caught in fisheries include [[catla]] (''Catla catla''), [[golden mahseer]] (''Tor putitora''), [[tor mahseer]] (''Tor tor''), [[rohu]] (''Labeo rohita''), [[walking catfish]] (''Clarias batrachus''), [[pangas catfish]] (''Pangasius pangasius''), [[Bagarius|goonch catfish]] (''Bagarius''), [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]] (''Channa''), [[bronze featherback]] (''Notopterus notopterus'') and [[milkfish]] (''Chanos chanos'').&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt;

The Ganges basin is home to about 30 fish species that are listed as threatened with the primary issues being [[overfishing]] (sometimes illegal), pollution, water abstraction, [[siltation]] and [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt; Among the threatened species is the [[critically endangered]] [[Ganges shark]] (''Glyphis gangeticus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fishbase.org/summary/SpeciesSummary.php?genusname=Glyphis&amp;speciesname=gangeticus |title= Glyphis gangeticus, Ganges shark |publisher= [[FishBase]] |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several fish species [[Fish migration|migrate]] between different sections of the river, but these movements may be prevented by the building of dams.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2012/&gt;

===Crocodilians and turtles===
[[File:Gavialis gangeticus, ZOO Praha 045.jpg|thumb|The threatened [[gharial]] (''Gavialis gangeticus'') is a large fish-eating [[crocodilian]] that is harmless to humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gharial biology | publisher=Gharial Conservation Alliance | url=http://www.gharialconservationalliance.org/?page_id=216 | accessdate=12 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among the numerous aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles in the Ganges basin are the [[northern river terrapin]] (''Batagur baska''; only in the lowermost section of the basin), [[three-striped roofed turtle]] (''B. dhongoka''), [[red-crowned roofed turtle]] (''B. kachuga''), [[black pond turtle]] (''Geoclemys hamiltonii''), [[Brahminy river turtle]] (''Hardella thurjii''), [[Indian black turtle]] (''Melanochelys trijuga''), [[Indian eyed turtle]] (''Morenia petersi''), [[brown roofed turtle]] (''Pangshura smithii''), [[Indian roofed turtle]] (''Pangshura tecta''), [[Indian tent turtle]] (''Pangshura tentoria''), [[Indian flapshell turtle]] (''Lissemys punctata''), [[Indian narrow-headed softshell turtle]] (''Chitra indica''), [[Indian softshell turtle]] (''Nilssonia gangetica''), [[Indian peacock softshell turtle]] (''N. hurum'') and [[Cantor's giant softshell turtle]] (''Pelochelys cantorii''; only in the lowermost section of Ganges basin).&lt;ref name=turtles&gt;{{cite book | editors=Rhodin; Pritchard; Dijk; Saumure; Buhlmann; Iverson; and Mittermeier | title=Conservation Biology of Freshwater Turtles and Tortoises: A Compilation Project of the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group | authors=van Dijk; Iverson; Rhodin; Shaffer; and Bour | chapter=Turtles of the World, 7th Edition: Annotated Checklist of Taxonomy, Synonymy, Distribution with Maps, and Conservation Status | year=2014 | publisher=IUCN | pages= | volume=5 | doi=10.3854/crm.5.000.checklist.v7.2014 | series=Chelonian Research Monographs | isbn=978-0965354097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are seriously threatened.&lt;ref name=turtles/&gt;

===Ganges river dolphin===
[[File:GangeticDolphin.jpg|thumb|The Gangetic dolphin in a sketch by Whymper and P. Smit, 1894.]]
The river's most famed fauna is the freshwater [[Ganges river dolphin]] (''Platanista gangetica gangetica''),&lt;ref name=wwf0166/&gt; which has been declared India's [[List of national animals|national aquatic animal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://wildpolitics.net/2010/01/19/ganges-river-dolphin-declared-indias-national-aquatic-animal/ | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110902103154/http://wildpolitics.net/2010/01/19/ganges-river-dolphin-declared-indias-national-aquatic-animal/ | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2 September 2011 | title= Ganges River Dolphin Declared India's National Aquatic Animal | publisher= WildPolitics.net | accessdate= 6 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dolphin used to exist in large schools near to urban centres in both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, but is now seriously threatened by pollution and dam construction. Their numbers have now dwindled to a quarter of their numbers of fifteen years before, and they have become extinct in the Ganges' main tributaries.{{efn|name=puttick|1= {{harvtxt|Puttick|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;"Sacred ritual is only one source of pollution. The main source of contamination is organic waste—sewage, trash, food, and human and animal remains. Around a billion litres of untreated raw sewage are dumped into the Ganges each day, along with massive amounts of agricultural chemicals (including DDT), industrial pollutants, and toxic chemical waste from the booming industries along the river. The level of pollution is now 10,000 percent higher than the government standard for safe river bathing (let alone drinking). One result of this situation is an increase in waterborne diseases, including cholera, hepatitis, typhoid, and amoebic dysentery. An estimated 80 percent of all health problems and one-third of deaths in India are attributable to waterborne illnesses." (p. 247)&lt;br /&gt;"There have been various projects to clean up the Ganges and other rivers, led by the Indian government's Ganga Action Plan launched in 1985 by Rajiv Gandhi, grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru. Its relative failure has been blamed on mismanagement, corruption, and technological mistakes, but also on lack of support from religious authorities. This may well be partly because the Brahmin priests are so invested in the idea of the Ganges' purity and afraid that any admission of its pollution will undermine the central role of the water in ritual, as well as their own authority. There are many temples along the river, conducting a brisk trade in ceremonies, including funerals, and sometimes also the sale of bottled Ganga jal. The more traditional Hindu priests still believe that blessing Ganga jal purifies it, although they are now a very small minority in view of the scale of the problem." (p. 248)&lt;br /&gt;"Wildlife is also under threat, particularly the river dolphins. They were one of the world's first protected species, given special status under the reign of Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. They're now a critically endangered species, although protected once again by the Indian government (and internationally under the CITES convention). Their numbers have shrunk by 75 per cent over the last 15 years, and they have become extinct in the main tributaries, mainly because of pollution and habitat degradation." (p. 275)

=== Effects of climate change ===
The [[Tibetan Plateau]] contains the world's third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, said that the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term; but issued a strong warning:

{{quote|Temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in China, and the Tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world.... In the short term, this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows... In the long run, the glaciers are vital lifelines for Asian rivers, including the Indus and the Ganges. Once they vanish, water supplies in those regions will be in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP  |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1eE4Xw3njaW1MKpJRYOch4hOdLQ |title=Global warming benefits to Tibet: Chinese official|date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123192540/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1eE4Xw3njaW1MKpJRYOch4hOdLQ |archivedate=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

----}} In its statement, the IPCC stands by its general findings relating to the Himalayan glaciers being at risk from global warming (with consequent risks to water flow into the Gangetic basin). Many studies have suggested that the climate change will affect the water resources in the Ganges river basin including increased summer (monsoon) flow, and peak runoff could result in an increased risk of flooding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07900627.2015.1030494 Nepal, S., &amp; Shrestha, A.

----}}{{efn|1= {{harvtxt|Dudgeon|2005}}&lt;br /&gt;"To reduce the water pollution in one of Asia's major rivers, the Indian Government initiated the Ganga Action Plan in 1985. The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions."
----}} a "major failure".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}&lt;br /&gt;"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries—Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna—were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}"
----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}&lt;br /&gt;"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985." (pa.166)
----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}&lt;br /&gt;"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams."

According to one study,&lt;ref name=mandal&gt;{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R. B.|title=Water Resource Management|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=2006|isbn=978-8180693182}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
The Ganga Action Plan, which was taken on priority and with much enthusiasm, was delayed for two years. The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to "environmental planning without proper understanding of the human–environment interactions,"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}&lt;br /&gt;"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human–environment interactions. The bibliography of selected environmental research studies on the Ganga River is, therefore, an essentially first step for preserving and maintaining the Ganga River ecosystem in future."
----}} Indian "traditions and beliefs,"{{efn|1= {{harvtxt|Tiwari|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;"Many social traditions and customs are not only helping in environmental degradation but are causing obstruction to environmental management and planning. The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment. These and many other rituals need rethinking and modification in the light of contemporary situations." (p. 92)
----}} "corruption and a lack of technical knowledge"{{efn|name=sheth|1= {{harvtxt|Sheth|2008}}&lt;br /&gt;"But the Indian government, as a whole, appears typically ineffective. Its ability to address itself to a national problem like environmental degradation is typified by the 20-year, $100 million Ganga Action Plan, whose purpose was to clean up the Ganges River. Leading Indian environmentalists call the plan a complete failure, due to the same problems that have always beset the government: poor planning, corruption, and a lack of technical knowledge. The river, they say, is more polluted than ever." (pp. 67–68)

In November 2008, the Ganges, alone among India's rivers, was declared a "National River", facilitating the formation of a [[National Ganga River Basin Authority]] that would have greater powers to plan, implement and monitor measures aimed at protecting the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081105/jsp/nation/story_10065466.jsp "Ganga gets a tag: national river – Vote whiff in step to give special status"], ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'', 5 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of water-borne and [[enteric]] diseases—such as [[gastrointestinal disease]], cholera, [[dysentery]], [[hepatitis A]] and [[typhoid]]—among people who use the river's waters for bathing, washing dishes and brushing teeth is high, at an estimated 66% per year.{{sfn|Abraham|2011}}

Recent studies by [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR) say that the river is so full of killer pollutants that those living along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal are more prone to cancer than anywhere else in the country. Conducted by the National Cancer Registry Programme under the ICMR, the study throws up shocking findings indicating that the river is thick with heavy metals and lethal chemicals that cause cancer. According to Deputy Director General of NCRP A. Nandkumar, the incidence of cancer was highest in the country in areas drained by the Ganges and stated that the problem would be studied deeply and with the findings presented in a report to the health ministry.&lt;ref&gt;"Ganga is now a deadly source of cancer, study says", ''Anirban Ghosh' 17 October 2012, http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-18/patna/34554229_1_gall-bladder-cancer-cancer-patients-prostate&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from that, many NGOs have came forward to rejuvenate river Ganga. Vikrant Tongad, an Environmental specialist from SAFE Green filed a petition against Simbhaoli Sugar Mill (Hapur UP) to NGT. NGT slapped a fine of Rs. 5 crore to Sugar Mill also, a fine of 25 Lakhs to Gopaljee Dairy for discharging untreated effluents into the Simbhaoli drain.[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ngt-slaps-rs-5-cr-fine-on-sugar-mills/article6509417.ece]

===Water shortages===
Along with ever-increasing pollution, water shortages are getting noticeably worse. Some sections of the river are already completely dry. Around Varanasi, the river once had an average depth of {{convert|60|m|ft}}, but in some places, it is now only {{convert|10|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;"How India's Success is Killing its Holy River." Jyoti Thottam. ''Time Magazine''. 19 July 2010, pp. 12–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To cope with its chronic water shortages, India employs electric groundwater pumps, diesel-powered tankers, and coal-fed power plants. If the country increasingly relies on these energy-intensive short-term fixes, the whole planet's climate will bear the consequences. India is under enormous pressure to develop its economic potential while also protecting its environment—something few, if any, countries have accomplished. What India does with its water will be a test of whether that combination is possible.&lt;ref&gt;"How India's Success is Killing its Holy River." Jyoti Thottam. ''Time Magazine''. 19 July 2010, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mining===
[[Illegal mining in India#Illegal mining and stone crushing in the Ganges river bed|Illegal mining in the Ganges river bed]] for stones and sand for construction work has long been a problem in [[Haridwar district]], Uttarakhand, where it touches the plains for the first time. This is despite the fact that quarrying has been banned in [[Kumbh Mela]] area zone covering 140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area in Haridwar.&lt;ref name=tri&gt;{{cite news |title=Looting the Ganga shamelessly |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110616/main5.htm |publisher= [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage and pricing of gasoline (or ''petrol'') results from factors such as [[petroleum|crude oil]] prices, processing and distribution costs, local demand, the strength of local currencies, local taxation, and the availability of local sources of gasoline (supply).  Since fuels are traded worldwide, the trade prices are similar.  The price paid by consumers largely reflects national pricing policy.  Some regions, such as Europe and Japan, impose high [[fuel tax|taxes]] on gasoline (petrol); others, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Venezuela]], subsidize the cost.&lt;ref name="gtz2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Fuel Prices 2010/11|author=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for International Cooperation)|url=http://www.giz.de/Themen/en/dokumente/giz-en-IFP2010.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western countries have among the highest usage rates per person. The largest consumer is the United States, which used an average of 368 million [[US liquid gallon#Liquid volume|US gallons]] (1.46 [[gigalitre]]s) each day in 2011.&lt;ref name=key&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2012/Pages/StatisticsDefinitions.aspx Fueling America: A Snapshot of Key Facts and Figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608055828/http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2012/Pages/StatisticsDefinitions.aspx |date=2012-06-08 }} Retrieved 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel prices in the United States==

[[File:US gas prices July 2012.png|thumb|Percentage of cost for gasoline and diesel in the United States.]]
In 2008 a report by [[Cambridge Energy Research Associates]] stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the United States, and that record energy prices would cause an "enduring shift" in energy consumption practices.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the report, in April fuel consumption had been lower than a year before for the sixth straight month, suggesting 2008 would be the first year US usage declined in 17 years.  The total annual distance driven in the US began declining in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/business/19gas.html?ref=business |title=Driving Less, Americans Finally React to Sting of Gas Prices, a Study Says |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=19 June 2008 |author=Clifford Krauss |accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average price per US gallon in 2012 ({{as of|2012|12|31|lc=y}}) was $3.618 (96¢/L), the highest ever for a year. {{As of|2012|12|31}}, the average price of gasoline was $3.298/gal (87¢/L),{{contradiction inline |reason=Two different "average prices" given for the same date in the region |date=May 2014}} with New York at $3.70/gal (98¢/L) for the highest in the US, and [[Colorado]] at $2.987/gal (79¢/L) for the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_a_epmr_pte_dpgal_w.htm |publisher=US EIA |title=Weekly Retail Gasoline and Diesel Prices |accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finished motor gasoline amounts to 44% of the total US consumption of petroleum products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US Product Supplied for Crude Oil and Petroleum Products |author=US Energy Information Administration |accessdate=25 May 2007|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_psup_dc_nus_mbblpd_a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to 18.5 [[exajoules]] per year. {{As of|2012}}, the cost of crude oil accounted for 62% of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in the United State while refining accounted for just 12%. Taxes and distribution/marketing accounted for 12% and 14% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=22&amp;t=10 What do I pay for in a gallon of regular gasoline?] US Energy Information Administration. Retrieved 7 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], gas prices started rising. They became record high levels. In terms of the aggregate economy, increases in crude oil prices significantly predict the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), but increases in natural gas prices do not.&lt;ref name="Kliesen, Kevin L 2006"&gt;Kliesen, Kevin L. "Rising Natural Gas Prices And Real Economic Activity". Review (00149187) 88.6 (2006): 511-526. Academic Search Premier. Web. 12 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
After the damages from the hurricanes ran up gas prices. By 30 August, a day after Katrina’s landfall, prices in the spot market, which typically include a premium above the wellhead price, had surged past $11 per gigajoule ($12 per million British thermal units), and on 22 September 2005, the day before Rita’s landfall, the spot price had risen to $14/GJ ($15 per million BTU).&lt;ref name="Kliesen, Kevin L 2006"/&gt;

In the fifteen years prior to the [[1973 oil crisis]], gasoline prices in the U.S. had lagged well behind inflation.&lt;ref name=gpcutinf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1t1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A9gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4393%2C4881980 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=Gas prices catch up to inflation |date=February 24, 1974 |page=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crude oil ===
[[File:Oil_prices_to_gas_prices_graph.png|500px|thumb|right|[[West Texas Intermediate|Crude oil]] prices to gas prices]]
[[Crude oil]] is the greatest contributing factor when it comes to the price of gasoline. This includes the resources it takes for exploration, to remove it from the ground, and transport it. Between 2004 and 2008, there was an increase in fuel costs due in large part to a worldwide increase in demand for crude oil. Prices leapt from {{convert|35|to|140|$/oilbbl|$/m3}}, causing a corresponding increase in gas prices.&lt;ref&gt;Rittenberg and Tregarthen. [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON101-2.4.4.pdf Principles of Microeconomics]: Chapter 4. Retrieved 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On the supply side, [[OPEC]] (or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) has a great deal to do with the price of gasoline, both in the United States and around the world. The speculation of oil commodities can also affect the gasoline market.

=== Taxes ===
{{main article|Fuel taxes in the United States}}
Taxes are the next biggest contributor to gasoline prices at around 12%. In the United States, both state and federal taxes apply to gasoline. In addition, other taxes may be placed on gas including applicable state sales taxes, gross receipts taxes, oil inspection fees, underground storage tank fees and other miscellaneous environmental fees.

=== Marketing and distribution ===

Distribution and marketing makes up the remaining 5%. The price of transporting crude oil to a refinery then gasoline to a point of distribution is passed on to the consumer. In addition the price to market the fuel brand is passed on.

=== Other factors ===

Aside from this breakdown, many other factors affect gasoline prices. Extreme weather, war or natural disaster in areas where oil is produced can also in turn raise the price of a gallon of gasoline. Legislation by several states for cleaner burning fuel also affects certain areas' prices of gasoline.

Balance between [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]] directly affects the price of gasoline. U.S. consumption of gasoline follows a seasonal pattern, where every year it is more expensive during the summer months when more people are driving. The long-term trend of consumption has been to increase year over year since 1950, with dips around the introduction of [[corporate average fuel economy]] standards and the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[early 1990s recession]] and [[Gulf War]], and the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/09/02/492271953/u-s-gasoline-use-hits-a-record-but-that-may-not-last U.S. Gasoline Use Hits A Record, But That May Not Last] (with chart)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petrol usage and pricing in Europe==
[[Image:Benzinpreis ch monatlich.png|thumb|250px|Gasoline and Diesel nominal price development 1993-2014 in Switzerland (CHF/l).]]
Most European countries have high [[fuel tax]]es. The prices have traditionally been three to four times the price in the United States, with prices during 2000–2005 of €1.00/litre&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Benzinpreis.png]]&lt;/ref&gt; (about US$1.42/L or $5.40/US gallon) while the US had prices around $1.50/gal or $0.40/L.
After a large increase until the summer of 2008, the end of 2008 experienced a strong decline linked with a sharp economic downturn, with the average price of fuel in the US at $1.613/gal (29 December 2008). However, the price of fuel in Europe is still more than double the US price at $1.85/litre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benzin.sk/obr/europske_priemerne_ceny_2008-11-17_benzin_sdanou.jpg "European Prices in Chart"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]] and some neighboring countries have a much smaller tax, with fuel prices similar to the US.&lt;ref name="gtz2010"/&gt;

Competitive petrol pricing in the UK is led by supermarkets with their own forecourts. Generally each supermarket tends to match the other's prices; the lead players being [[Asda]], [[Tesco]], [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Morrisons]]. In recent years the [[The Automobile Association|AA]] has criticized the speculators as being the prime reason for fuel fluctuations in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Deo|first=Ritwik|title=Petrol prices on the slide|url=http://www.myfamilyclub.co.uk/news/petrol-prices-on-the-slide-what-does-it-mean-for-you-27325|newspaper=My Family Club|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries with subsidised gasoline==
A number of countries subsidize the cost of petrol/gasoline and other petroleum products. Subsidies make transport of people and goods cheaper, but discourage fuel efficiency. In some countries, the soaring cost of crude oil since 2003 has led to these subsidies being cut, moving inflation from the government debt to the general populace, sometimes resulting in political unrest.

Fuel subsidies are common in oil-rich nations. Countries with subsidized fuel include [[United States of America]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], [[Egypt]], [[Burma]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Brunei]] and [[Bolivia]].

In February 2010, the Iranian government implemented an energy price reform by which the energy subsidies were to be removed in five years; the most important price hike was in gasoline, as the price went up from 100 rials ($0.10 US) to 400 rials ($0.40 US) per litre, with a ration of 100 litres per month for private passenger cars (later reduced to 60 litres per month).

On 26 December 2010, the Bolivian government issued a decree removing subsidies which had fixed petrol/gasoline and diesel prices for the past seven years. Arguing that illegal exports (contraband) of gasoline and diesel fuel to neighboring countries by individuals for personal profit was harming the economy, Bolivia eliminated the subsidies and raised gasoline prices as much as 83%. After widespread labor strikes, the Bolivian government canceled all future planned price hikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/giz2011-fuel-price-reform-bolivia-december-2010.pdf|title=Fuel Price Reform in Bolivia|publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela used to have the cheapest gasoline in the world for decades, however on 19 February 2016 president Nicolás Maduro used decree powers to raise fuel prices by 6000%. This was the first rise in petrol prices in 20 years and he also set in place a sharp devaluation of the currency which he said aimed to shore up the country's failing economy, hard hit by falling oil prices which make up 95% of foreign income. Prices at the pump in Venezuela jumped as much as 6,086% for 95 octane gasoline, from 0.097 bolivars to 6 bolivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/venezuela-president-raises-fuel-price-by-1300-and-devalues-bolivar-to-tackle-crisis|title=Venezuela president raises fuel price by 6,000% and devalues bolivar to tackle crisis|first=Sibylla|last=Brodzinsky|date=17 February 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
{{See also|Smuggling in Iran|2007 Gasoline Rationing Plan in Iran}}
The Iranian government introduced [[Iranian subsidy reform plan|an energy price reform]] in February 2010. The reform was brought forward by the government and approved with some changes by the parliament. The major aim of the policy was to slow down the increasing trend of energy consumption in Iran by removing the energy subsidies. The plan included electricity, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel subsidies. According to the plan, all energy prices were to increase by 20 percent annually. The price reform was particularly important in gasoline, as consumption had been increasing dramatically creating a huge burden on government budget. Furthermore, to meet demand, Iran had to import gasoline from other countries, which made the country vulnerable to possible sanctions by the US and European countries. The gas price prior to reform was $0.10 US per liter with the quota of 100 liters per month per passenger car. The reform raised the price to $0.40 US per liter and later reduced the ration to 60 liters per month. The price for over-quota consumption and the imported cars were $0.70 US per liter. The energy price reform included a cash-rebate program through which each person received 455,000 rials ($15 US) per month from the government. The overall consumption of gasoline after the reform decreased from about 65 million liters per day to about 54 million liters per day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iranian targeted subsidy plan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of gasoline based on the official USD to IRR rate is 0.29 USD/Litre in 2018 which is the second cheapest price in the world after Venezuela. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
On 1 January 2012, the Nigerian government headed by president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, tried to cease the subsidy on petrol and deregulate the oil prices by announcing the new price for petrol as USD 0.88/litre from the old subsidised price of USD 0.406/litre (LAGOS), which in areas distant from Lagos petrol was priced at USD 1.25/litre. This led to the longest general strike (eight days), riots, Arab spring like protests and on 16 January 2012 the government capitulated by announcing a new price of USD 0.60/litre with an envisaged price of USD 2.0/litre in distant areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21699171-petrol-prices-are-now-bit-more-realistic-will-naira-be-next-fuel-and&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2016 the Buhari administration increased fuel prices again to NGN 145 per litre ($0.43 at black market rates for the currency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16382286|title=Nigeria fury as fuel prices double after subsidy ends|date=2 January 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
PEMEX, a government company in charge of selling oil in Mexico is subsidized by the Mexican government.  This serves to quell inflationary pressures in Mexico.  Mexico buys much of its gasoline and diesel from the United States and resells it at US$98 per barrel.  Many residents of US border communities cross the border to buy fuel in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20081127-9999-1b27gas.html&lt;/ref&gt; thereby enjoying a cheaper fuel subsidy at the expense of Mexican taxpayers. This has caused frequent supply shortages at a number of filling stations along the border for Mexican drivers, especially truck and bus drivers who use diesel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB121426584632198453-_wjnmFYCNcbM6jFvYcx2zPf03Xs_20080723.html|title=Fill 'er Up: Gas Is Cheap in Tijuana, So Californians Buy Big Fuel Tanks|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|author1=JOEL MILLMAN|author2=ANA CAMPOY|date=24 June 2008|p=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Mexico ended its oil industry subsidies, leading to increased prices and [[2017 Mexican protests|widespread protests]] throughout the country.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okeowo|first1=Alexis|title=The Gas-Price Protests Gripping Mexico|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-gas-price-protests-gripping-mexico|website=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=14 February 2018|date=24 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Trinidad and Tobago through its national energy agencies [[Petrotrin]] and Trinidad and Tobago National Petroleum Marketing Company Limited (NP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.np.co.tt/about-us/company-profile/|title=Company Profile - NP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers petroleum fuels at varying subsidised prices to the users within the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.tt/index.php?categoryid=355&amp;p2001_articleid=1233&lt;/ref&gt; Unleaded Gasoline is offered at two grades - Ron 91 at US$0.43/Litre and Ron 95 at US$0.91/Litre. Diesel is offered at US$0.24/Litre making this fuel some of the cheapest in the world.

There are an estimated 791,086 cars in the country as at February 2015 and they consume 1.2 billion litres of liquid fuel annually
The Government of Trinidad and Tobago spent an estimated US$173.2 million in subsidies for gasoline and diesel in half year period October 2014 - March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/business/2015-05-11/fuel-subsidy-lower-912m|title=Fuel subsidy lower at $912m|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[Energy subsidies|The oil industry receives subsidies]] through the United States tax code, which include Percentage Depletion Allowance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-oil-and-gas-industry-still-need-tax-breaks-1479092522
&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic Manufacturing Tax Deduction, the Foreign Tax Credit and Expensing Intangible Drilling Costs.  It is estimated that these tax deductions are worth $4 billion annually and are currently being debated by the government for reform.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Although such subsidies exist, the sale of fuel is also taxed at rates that far exceed the sales tax rates for other goods, to help pay for bridge and road repair. It is thus unclear whether the tax impact on fuel is a net subsidy or not.

===Venezuela===
Today, [[PDVSA]], Venezuelan state-owned company, spends US$1.7 billion in direct costs of importation of gasoline, and subsidizes all sales of gasoline in the internal Venezuelan market. The sale price of gasoline is US$0.015{{update inline|reason=Venezuelan currency loses about half its value every month so this figure needs to be updated every week.|date=December 2017}} per liter, on a fixed price in the local currency that has been in effect since 1997. Given the low price of gasoline, it is distributed free of charge to gas stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.es/internacional/20130515/abci-venezuela-gasolina-201305142039.html Venezuela is going bankrupt for having the cheapest gasoline in the world (ABC Spain - in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries which had formerly subsidised gasoline==

===Indonesia===
In March 2005, [[Indonesia]] increased the price of gasoline and diesel by 29%, causing widespread protests. The price of gasoline was raised from [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]]  (US$0.20) per litre to Rp 2,400 (US$0.25) per litre, while diesel rose from Rp 1,650 (US$0.18) to Rp 2,100 (US$0.23). Prices were increased again in October to Rp (US$0.48) a litre, for gasoline, while diesel was increased to Rp 4,300 (US$0.46), and [[kerosene]], used for cooking, increased from Rp 700 (US$0.08) to Rp 2,000 (US$0.22) per litre. The price increases came as oil prices threatened to increase the government's oil subsidy to US$14 billion per year, and caused further protests.

With oil reaching over US$145 a barrel, Indonesia further increased prices on 24 May 2008 to Rp 6,000 (approx. US$0.65) per litre, and diesel to Rp 5,500 (approx. US$0.60) per litre, while kerosene was raised to Rp 2,500 (approx. US$0.28), moves which caused widespread protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtG3zfKzch9BNr7LEMc70IkR5qsg AFP: Indonesian police, protesters clash over fuel price hike: reports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was suggested that private car owners, who are wealthy in Indonesian terms, would eventually be excluded from subsidies entirely, with the cheap fuel limited to public transport and motorcycles.

In June 2013, the government raised the price of low-octane gasoline 44% to 6,500 rupiah ($0.66) per liter and of diesel 22% to 5,500 rupiah per liter to help close a widening budget deficit. The move caused violent protest in some areas.

Furthermore, in November 18, 2014, the new government led by President [[Joko Widodo]] reallocated the government subsidy for gasoline and diesel into nation's infrastructure, education and health budget, hence raised the price of subsidized gasoline and diesel by Rp 2,000 each, so the price of gasoline and diesel became Rp 8,500 and Rp 7,500 respectively. This decision created inflation and protest throughout the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-21/indonesian-rupiah-heads-for-weekly-gain-after-fuel-subsidies-cut.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Andrew | last=Janes | title=Indonesian Rupiah Completes Weekly Gain After Fuel Subsidies Cut | date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have been encouraged to switch to [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] for cooking, as Indonesia is the world's largest exporter, whereas its oil industry is in decline, and it is now a net importer.

===Malaysia===
[[Malaysia]] had been subsidising gasoline since 1983&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/ffs_malaysia_czguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and recently had been spending US$6.7 billion on subsidising gasoline, diesel and gas each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/malaysia-axes-fuel-subsidies-oil-prices-drop-27075677|title=International News: Latest Headlines, Video and Photographs from Around the World -- People, Places, Crisis, Conflict, Culture, Change, Analysis and Trends|first=ABC|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=AP |title=Malaysia to lift fuel price controls |date={{date|2008-06-03}}| work=Associated Press For Petrol price : old price = rm$1.92/litre (US$0.59/litre or US$2.22/Gallon) increase to new price rm$270.00/litre (US$0.83/litre = US$3.12/Gallon, base on US$1 = MYR$3.27); For Diesel price : old price = MYR$1.58/litre (US$0.48/litre or US$1.83/Gallon) increase to new price MYR$2.58/litre (US$0.79/litre = US$2.98/Gallon, base on US$1 =MYR$3.27); |accessdate={{date|2008-07-20}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 June 2008 gasoline prices increased by 40% to [[MYR]]2.70/litre (US$3.30 a gallon), from MYR1.92/litre (US$2.32 a gallon). Diesel prices rose by MYR1.00/litre to MYR2.58 (US$3.04 per gallon), a 63% increase. It was announced that price increases were planned to bring fuel prices in line with global market cost, suggesting that it may hit US$3.80 per gallon by August. The Malaysian government has also announced a one-off cash rebate of MYR625 per year to Malaysian citizens who own cars with an engine capacity of 3,000 cc or less and MYR200 tax rebate to cars with an engine capacity of 3,000 cc and above to offset the increased costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=AP |title=Malaysia considers cash handouts as fuel hike looms |date={{date|2008-06-04}}| url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/04/news/international/gas_subsidies.ap/index.htm | work=Associated Press |accessdate={{date|2008-06-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government introduced a temporary ban on buying fuel within 50&amp;nbsp;km of the country border, but the ban was suspended following a price increase on 7 June 2008 for petrol of 41% (to [[MYR]]2.70 a litre) and for diesel of 63% (to [[MYR]]2.58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Reuters |title=Malaysia lifts ban on fuel sales to foreigners |date={{date|2008-06-05}}| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKKLR46220080605 | work=Reuters UK |accessdate={{date|2008-06-05}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2008, the Malaysian government announced plans to set up separate pumps at its border petrol stations to sell fuel to foreigners at market rates so that only locals can benefit from subsidised petrol. The new pumps will target Singaporeans and Thais who make day trips across the border to fill their tanks with cheaper fuel there, although Singapore-registered cars must have their tanks at least three-quarters full before they will be permitted to leave Singapore in any case. Petrol stations within {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the country's northern border with Thailand or southern border with Singapore would be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Channel Newsasia |title=Malaysia to set up separate border petrol pumps for foreigners |date={{date|2008-06-22}}|url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/355701/1/.html | work=Channel Newsasia |accessdate={{date|2008-06-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the fuel price has dropped to MYR 2.45 and it has dropped for the second time. A further reduction was made on 1 November 2008. RON97 petrol was reduced from MYR2.30 per litre (MYR8.7/US&amp;nbsp;gal) to MYR2.15 a litre, RON92 petrol from MYR2.20 to MYR2.05 a litre (MYR8.3/US&amp;nbsp;gal to MYR7.8/US&amp;nbsp;gal), and diesel from MYR2.20 to MYR2.05 per litre The Government revealed that it had ceased subsidizing petrol as of 1 November 2008 when the price of oil dipped below US$65 per barrel. However subsidies were still being paid for diesel and natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Malaysian Insider|title= Malaysians are now paying petrol tax |date={{date|2008-11-18}}| url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/12622-malaysians-are-now-paying-petrol-tax- | work=Malaysian Insider |accessdate={{date|2008-11-18}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 2008, the Malaysian government made further reductions in the price of gasoline cut pump prices by seven per cent to MYR2.00 ringgit per litre and diesel by 15 sen to MYR1.90 per litre. The government said that at current prices they were making about 30 sen per litre in sales. Then again on 3 December, petrol prices were reduced further. Gasoline prices were reduced 10 sen to MYR 1.90 per litre and as for diesel, they were reduced 10 sen to MYR 1.80 per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Straits Times|title= M'sia to dump petrol subsidy? |date={{date|2008-11-19}}| url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_303779.html |accessdate={{date|2008-11-19}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 2008 the price of RON97 petrol was reduced further to MYR1.80, while RON92 is selling at MYR1.70 per litre (MYR6.4/US&amp;nbsp;gal).

From 1 September 2009 however, the price for RON97 increased to MYR2.05, while RON92 has been discontinued and replaced with RON95, at a price of MYR1.80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= RON95 price up 5 sen to MYR1.80 |date={{date|2009-09-01}}| url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/9/1/nation/4625659&amp;sec=nation |accessdate={{date|2009-09-01}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2010, petrol prices across the board was raised by 5 sen, which brought the prices of RON95, RON97 and diesel to MYR1.85, MYR2.10 and MYR1.75 per litre respectively. Since then, RON97 floats with government controlled revision reflecting the global crude oil prices. {{As of|2010|8|1}} only Malaysian-registered petrol vehicles may purchase RON95 fuel; foreign-registered vehicles (mainly from Singapore and Thailand) by law can only purchase RON97 (or diesel) at Malaysian service stations.

On 1 April 2011, RON97 increased from MYR2.50 to MYR2.70. In May 2011, RON97 further increased to MYR2.90, another record high for RON97 in Malaysia. A drop of MYR0.10 in June 2011 brings it to MYR2.80 per litre, the first price reduction since RON97 was floated at market rates.

On 3 September 2013, the price for RON 95 increased from MYR1.90 to MYR2.10, RON97 from MYR2.70 to MYR2.85, and diesel from MYR1.80 to MYR2.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/09/04/ron-97-price-hike.aspx|title=RON 97 petrol to cost 15 sen more per litre - Nation - The Star Online|first=Nicholas|last=Cheng|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/impact-of-fuel-price-hike-on-consumers-will-be-widespread-warns-fomca&lt;/ref&gt; This was further increased on 2 October 2014, whereby RON 95 would cost MYR2.30 and diesel would cost MYR2.20 per litre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/petrol-diesel-prices-up-by-20-sen-from-midnight&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/fuel-prices-at-pumps-up-after-midnight|title=Fuel prices at pumps up after midnight|date=1 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting on 1 December 2014, Malaysia abolished fuel subsidies and began using a managed float system, in order to control the country's large current account deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30140728|title=Malaysia to end petrol and diesel subsidies|date=21 November 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/11/21/putrajaya-scraps-subsidies-for-ron95-diesel/|title=Putrajaya scraps subsidies for RON95, diesel|date=21 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Somalia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Somalia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
[[Somalia]] is a country located in the [[Horn of Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Ethiopia]] to the west, [[Djibouti]] to the northwest, the [[Gulf of Aden]] to the north, the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Guardafui Channel]] to the east, and [[Kenya]] to the southwest. With a land area of 637,657 square kilometers, Somalia's terrain consists mainly of [[plateau]]s, [[plain]]s and [[highland]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html |title=Somalia |accessdate=2009-05-31 |date=2009-05-14 |work=[[World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coastline of Somalia|Its coastline]] is more than 3,333 kilometers in length, the longest of mainland Africa and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=FactbookCoastline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html|title=Coastline|accessdate=2013-08-03|work=[[World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as being roughly shaped "like a tilted number seven".&lt;ref&gt;Ganzglass, Martin R. "The Somali Refugees-Africa's Open Wound Refuses to Heal." Hum. Rts. 8 (1979): 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the far north, the rugged east-west ranges of the [[Ogo Mountains]] lie at varying distances from the Gulf of Aden coast. Hot conditions prevail year-round, along with periodic [[monsoon]] winds and irregular rainfall.&lt;ref name="ClimateSom"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://countrystudies.us/somalia/34.htm |publisher=countrystudies.us |title=Somalia – Climate |date=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geology suggests the presence of valuable mineral deposits.

==Climate==
Due to Somalia's proximity to the [[equator]], there is not much seasonal variation in its climate. However, there are some very unpredictable rainfalls that occur sometimes. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with monsoon (periodic seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation) winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from {{convert|30|to|40|°C|°F}}, except at higher elevations and along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. In Mogadishu, for instance, average afternoon highs range from {{convert|28|°C|°F}} to {{convert|32|°C|°F}} in April. Some of the highest mean annual temperatures in the world have been recorded in the country; [[Berbera]] on the northwestern coast has an afternoon high that averages more than {{convert|38|°C|°F}} from June through September. Nationally, mean daily minimums usually vary from about {{convert|15|to|30|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="Hadden"&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. 2007. [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA464006 "The Geology of Somalia: A Selected Bibliography of Somalian Geology, Geography and Earth Science."] Engineer Research and Development Laboratories, Topographic Engineering Center&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest range in climate occurs in northern Somalia, where temperatures sometimes surpass {{convert|45|°C|°F}} in July on the littoral plains and drop below the freezing point during December in the highlands.&lt;ref name="ClimateSom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt; In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40 percent in the mid-afternoon to 85 percent at night, changing somewhat according to the season.&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt;

Unlike the climates of most other countries at this latitude, conditions in Somalia range from [[arid]] in the northeastern and central regions to [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]] in the northwest and south. In the northeast, annual rainfall is less than {{convert|4|in|mm}}; in the central plateaus, it is about {{convert|8|to|12|in|mm}}. The northwestern and southwestern parts of the nation, however, receive considerably more rain, with an average of {{convert|20|to|24|in|mm}} falling per year. Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically dry and hot.&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt;

Most of the country receives less than {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain annually, and a large area encompassing the northeast and much of northern Somalia receives as little as {{convert|50|to|150|mm|in|2|sp=us}}. Certain higher areas in the north, however, record more than {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} a year, as do some coastal sites. The southwest receives {{convert|330|to|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. Generally, rainfall takes the form of showers or localized torrential rains and is extremely variable. Mean daily maximum temperatures throughout the country range from {{convert|30|to|40|°C|°F}}, except at higher elevations and along the Indian Ocean coast. Mean daily minimum temperatures vary from {{convert|20|°C}} to more than {{convert|30|°C}}. Northern Somalia experiences the greatest temperature extremes, with readings ranging from below freezing in the highlands in December to more than {{convert|45|°C}} in July in the coastal plain skirting the Gulf of Aden. The north's relative humidity ranges from about 40 percent in midafternoon to 85 percent at night, varying somewhat with the season. During the colder months, December to February, visibility at higher elevations is often restricted by fog. Temperatures in the south are less extreme, ranging from about {{convert|20|to|40|°C|°F}}. The hottest months are February through April. Coastal readings are usually five to ten degrees cooler than those inland. The coastal zone's relative humidity usually remains about 70 percent even during the dry seasons.

There are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. From December to March is the ''Jilal'', the harshest dry season of the year. The main rainy season, referred to as the ''Gu'', lasts from April to June. This period is characterized by the southwest monsoons, which rejuvenate the pasture land, especially the central plateau, and briefly transform the desert into lush vegetation. From July to September is the second dry season, the ''Xagaa'' (pronounced "Hagaa"). The  ''Dayr'', which is the shortest rainy season, lasts from October to December.&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt; The ''tangambili'' periods that intervene between the two monsoons (October–November and March–May) are hot and humid.&lt;ref name="Hadden"/&gt;

==Terrain, vegetation and drainage==
{{MapLibrary|Somalia sat.png|Somalia}}
[[File:Somalia Topography en.png|thumb|Topography of Somalia]]
Physio-graphically, Somalia is a land of limited contrast. In the north, a maritime semidesert plain parallels the Gulf of Aden coast, varying in width from roughly twelve kilometers in the west to as little as two kilometers in the east. Scrub-covered, this plain, known as the [[Guban]] (scrub land), is crossed by broad, shallow watercourses that are beds of dry sand except in the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the vegetation, which is a combination of low bushes and grass clumps, is quickly renewed, and for a time the guban provides some grazing for nomad livestock. This coastal strip is part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]].

Inland from the gulf coast, the plain rises to the precipitous northward-facing cliffs of the dissected highlands. These form the rugged Karkaar mountain ranges that extend from the northwestern border with Ethiopia eastward to the tip of the Horn of Africa, where they end in sheer cliffs at [[Caseyr]]. The general elevation along the crest of these mountains averages about 1,800 meters above sea level south of the port town of [[Berbera]], and eastward from that area it continues at 1,800 to 2,100 meters almost to Caseyr. The country's highest point, [[Shimber Berris]], which rises to 2,460 meters, is located near the town of [[Erigavo]].

Southward the mountains descend, often in scarped ledges, to an elevated plateau devoid of perennial rivers. This region of broken mountain terrain, shallow plateau valleys, and usually dry watercourses is known to the Somalis as the Ogo.

In the Ogo's especially arid eastern part, the plateau&amp;mdash;broken by several isolated mountain ranges&amp;mdash;gradually slopes toward the [[Indian Ocean]] and in central Somalia constitutes the [[Mudug]] Plain. A major feature of this eastern section is the long and broad [[Nugaal]] Valley, with its extensive network of intermittent seasonal watercourses. The Nugaal river enters the Indian Ocean at [[Eyl]]. The eastern area's population consists mainly of pastoral nomads eking a living in a zone of low and erratic rainfall.

The western part of the Ogo plateau region is crossed by numerous shallow valleys and dry watercourses. Annual rainfall is greater than in the east, and there are flat areas of arable land that provide a home for dryland cultivators. Most important, the western area has permanent wells to which the predominantly nomadic population returns during the dry seasons. The western plateau slopes gently southward and merges imperceptibly into an area known as the [[Haud]], a broad, undulating terrain that constitutes some of the best grazing lands for Somali nomads, despite the lack of appreciable rainfall more than half the year. Enhancing the value of the Haud are the natural depressions that during periods of rain become temporary lakes and ponds.

The Haud zone continues for more than sixty kilometers into Ethiopia, and the vast Somali Plateau, which lies between the northern Somali mountains and the highlands of southeast Ethiopia, extends south and eastward through Ethiopia into central and southwest Somalia. The portion of the Haud lying within Ethiopia was the subject of an agreement made during the colonial era. In 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis,&lt;ref name="Federal"&gt;Federal Research Division, ''Somalia: A Country Study'', (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2004), p.38&lt;/ref&gt; the British "returned" the Haud (an important Somali grazing area that was presumably 'protected' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886) and the [[Ogaden]] to Ethiopia, based on [[Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897|an 1897 treaty]] in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor [[Menelek II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] in exchange for his help against plundering by [[Somali clan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Laitin, ''Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience'', (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Britain included the proviso that the Somali nomads would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over them.&lt;ref name="Zolberg"&gt;Zolberg, Aristide R., et al., ''Escape from Violence: Conflict and the Refugee Crisis in the Developing World'', (Oxford University Press: 1992), p.106&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over.&lt;ref name="Zolberg"/&gt; The stretch of land has since been a considerable source of regional strife.

Southwestern Somalia is dominated by the country's only two permanent rivers, the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and the [[Shabeelle River|Shabeelle]]. With their sources in the Ethiopian highlands, these rivers flow in a generally southerly direction, cutting wide valleys in the Somali Plateau as it descends toward the sea; the plateau's elevation falls off rapidly in this area. The adjacent coastal zone, which includes the lower reaches of the rivers and extends from the Mudug Plain to the [[Kenya]]n border, averages 180 meters above sea level.

The Jubba River enters the Indian Ocean at [[Kismaayo]]. Although the Shabeelle River at one time apparently also reached the sea near [[Merca]], its course is thought to have changed in prehistoric times. The Shabeelle now turns southwestward near [[Balcad]] (about thirty kilometers north of [[Mogadishu]]) and parallels the coast for more than eighty-five kilometers. The river is perennial only to a point southwest of Mogadishu; thereafter it consists of swampy areas and dry reaches and is finally lost in the sand east of [[Jilib]], not far from the Jubba River. During the flood seasons, the Shabeelle River may fill its bed to a point near Jilib and occasionally may even break through to the Jubba River farther south. Favorable rainfall and soil conditions make the entire riverine region a fertile agricultural area and the center of the country's largest sedentary population.

In most of northern, northeastern, and north-central Somalia, where rainfall is low, the vegetation consists of scattered low trees, including various acacias, and widely scattered patches of grass. This vegetation gives way to a combination of low bushes and grass clumps in the highly arid areas of the northeast and along the Gulf of Aden.

As elevations and rainfall increase in the maritime ranges of the north, the vegetation becomes denser. [[Aloe]]s are common, and on the higher plateau areas of the Ogo are woodlands. At a few places above 1,500 meters, the remnants of [[juniper]] forests (protected by the state) and areas of [[Euphorbia candelabrum]] (a chandelier-type spiny plant) occur. In the more arid highlands of the northeast, ''[[Boswellia]]'' and ''[[Commiphora]]'' trees are sources, respectively, of the [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] for which Somalia has been known since ancient times.

[[Image:Naasa Hablood2.jpg|left|thumb|290px|[[Hargeisa]] and much of northwestern Somalia is desert or hilly terrain. Here, the thelarchic-shaped [[Naasa Hablood]] hills are shown.]]

A broad plateau encompassing the northern city of [[Hargeisa|Hargeysa]], which receives comparatively heavy rainfall, is covered naturally by woodland (much of which has been degraded by [[overgrazing]]) and in places by extensive grasslands. Parts of this area have been under cultivation since the 1930s, producing [[sorghum]] and [[maize]]; in the 1990s it constituted the only significant region of sedentary cultivation outside southwestern Somalia.

The Haud south of Hargeysa is covered mostly by a semiarid woodland of scattered trees, mainly [[acacia]]s, underlain by grasses that include species especially favored by livestock as forage. There vegetation forms spatially periodic patterns reminiscent of a tiger skin when viewed from above and therefore knowns as "[[tiger bush]]".&lt;ref&gt;MacFadyen W.A. (1950). Vegetation patterns in the semi-desert plains of British Somaliland. Geographical Journal, 116, 199-210.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Haud merges into the Mudug Plain in central Somalia, the aridity increases and the vegetation takes on a subdesert character. Farther southward the terrain gradually changes to semiarid woodlands and grasslands as the annual precipitation increases.

The region encompassing the Shabeelle and Jubba rivers is relatively well watered and constitutes the country's most arable zone. The lowland between the rivers supports rich pasturage. It features arid to subarid savanna, open woodland, and thickets that include frequently abundant underlying grasses. There are areas of grassland, and in the far southwest, near the Kenyan border, some dry evergreen forests are found.

Along the Indian Ocean from [[Hobyo]] southwestward to near Mogadishu lies a stretch of dry coastal sand dunes, the [[Hobyo grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]]. This area is covered with scattered scrub and grass clumps where rainfall is sufficient although unpredictable. Much of this coast is thinly populated but overgrazing, particularly south of Mogadishu, has resulted in the destruction of the protective vegetation cover and the gradual movement of the once-stationary dunes inland. The original flora of this coast contains a number of endemic species and beginning in the early 1970s, efforts were made to stabilize these dunes by replanting. Endemic mammals are the [[silver dik-dik]] (''Madoqua piacentinii''), one of the world's smallest antelopes, and the [[Somali golden mole]] (''Calcochloris tytonis''). Other endemic species include two reptiles, a [[skink]]'' [[Haackgreerius miopus]]'' and a lizard ''[[Latastia cherchii]]'' and two birds, [[Ash's lark]] (''Mirafra ashi'') and the [[Obbia lark]] (''Spizocorys obbiensis''). The long-term political strife in Somalia has meant the coast is poorly studied and the state of the habitat unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1307|name=Hobyo grasslands and shrublands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other vegetation includes plants and grasses found in the swamps into which the Shabeelle River empties most of the year and in other large swamps in the course of the lower Jubba River. Swamps of [[East African mangroves]] are found at points along the coast, particularly from Kismaayo to near the Kenyan border. Uncontrolled exploitation appears to have caused some damage to forests in that area. Other mangroves are located near Mogadishu and at a number of places along the northeastern and northern coasts.

[[Image:Water cycle.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[water cycle]], the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth affects how much water evaporates from oceans, and how long it is retained on land]]

The '''Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)''' is a research program of the [[World Climate Research Programme]] intended to observe, comprehend and [[model (abstract)|model]] the Earth's [[water cycle]]. The experiment also observes how much energy the [[Earth]] receives, studies how much of that energy reaches surfaces of the Earth and how that energy is transformed. [[Sunlight]]'s energy [[evaporate]]s water to produce [[cloud]]s and [[rain]], and  dries out land masses after rain. Rain that falls on land becomes the water budget which can be used by people for [[agricultural]] and other processes.

GEWEX is a collaboration of researchers worldwide to find better ways of studying the water cycle and how it transforms energy through the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/gewex_overview.html About GEWEX], Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment, World Climate Research Programme , Access date 06-22-2008&lt;/ref&gt; If the Earth's climates were identical from year to year, then people could predict when, where and what crops to plant. However, instability created by solar variation, weather trends, and chaotic events create weather that is unpredictable on seasonal scales. Through weather patterns such as [[drought]]s and higher rainfall these cycles impact [[ecosystem]]s and human activities.  GEWEX is designed to collect a much greater amount of data, and see if better models of that data can forecast weather and climate change into the future.

GEWEX is organized into several structures. As GEWEX was conceived projects were organized by participating factions, this task is now done by the International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO). IGPO oversees major initiatives and coordinates between national projects in an effort to bring about communication of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;NASA is the primary sponsor of IGPO&lt;/ref&gt; IGPO claims to support communication exchange between 2000 scientist and is the instrument for publication of major reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/igpo.html International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO)]  GEWEX WCRP&lt;/ref&gt; The Scientific Steering Group organizes the projects and assigns them to panels, which oversee progress and provide critique. The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP) the 'Hydrology Project' is a major instrument in GEWEX.&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt;  This panel includes geographic study areas such as the [[Climate Prediction Program for the Americas]] operated by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]],&lt;ref&gt;(CPPA integrates what was formally GEWEX American Prediction Project - GAPP and Climate Variability and Predictability, U.S. CLIVAR.) [http://www.climate.noaa.gov/cpo_pa/cppa/ Climate Program Office], National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/ref&gt; but also examines several types of climate zones (e.g. high altitude and semi-arid).&lt;ref name = "CEOP"&gt;[http://www.ceop.net/ Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Another panel, the GEWEX Radiation Panel oversees the coordinated use of satellites and ground-based observation to better estimate energy and water fluxes. One recent result GEWEX's Radiation panel has assessed data on rainfall for the last 25 years and determined that global rainfall is 2.61&amp;nbsp;mm/day with a small [[statistic]]al variation. While the study period is short, after 25 years of measurement regional trends are beginning to appear.&lt;ref name="Precip"&gt;Gruber A and Levizzani V. [http://wcrp.wmo.int/documents/AssessmentGlobalPrecipitationReport.pdf Assessment of Global Precipitation Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718163512/http://wcrp.wmo.int/documents/AssessmentGlobalPrecipitationReport.pdf |date=2008-07-18 }} A project of the [[World Climate Research Programme]] Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Radiation Panel, WCRP-128 WMO/TD-No. 1430, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel takes current models and analyzes the models when [[climate forcing]] phenomena occur (global warming as an example of a 'climate forcing' event). GEWEX is now the core project of WCRP.&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"/&gt;

==Goals and design==
[[Image:Solar-cycle-data.png|thumb|right|To determine energy budget and flux, scientists need to know the amount of radiation reaching the Earth.]]
Predicting weather change requires [[accurate]] data that is collected over many years, and the application of [[computational model|model]]s. GEWEX was conceived to respond to the need for observations of the Earth's [[radiation]] budget and clouds. Many preexisting techniques were limited to observations taken from land and populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kandel R.S.  |title= Satellite observation of the Earth Radiation Budget and clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=52 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–32 |date=February 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00704238 |url= |bibcode=1990SSRv...52....1K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ignored the large amount of weather that occurs over the oceans and unpopulated regions, with key data missing from these areas. Since satellites orbiting the earth cover large areas in small time frames, they can better estimate climate where measurements are infrequently taken.  GEWEX was initiated by [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP) to take advantage of environmental satellites such as [[TRMM]], but now uses information from newer satellites as well as collections land based instruments, such as [[Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]].&lt;ref name = "GEWEX"/&gt; These land based instruments can be used to verify information interpreted from satellite.  GEWEX studies the long-term and regional changes in climate with a goal of predicting important [[seasonal]] weather patterns and climate changes that occurs over a few years.

| '''Sunlight and rain'''
|-
| column width = "350px" | The earth is made of matter, including water, which absorbs and emits energy into space. Should the earth not orbit a star, the water would freeze solid and little precipitation would occur because the rate of evaporation would be very low. If the earth were devoid of water, it would heat to great temperatures in the daytime and cool off more quickly at night. Therefore, water modulates heat energy by transitioning between ice, water, and steam. When heat is applied, ice becomes water and water becomes vapor-steam, absorbing heat energy. When cooling is applied, vapor condenses into water and water freezes into ice, releasing heat. While these are simple examples, rainfall results from a complex set of processes. When '''sunlight''' hits the oceans it forces liquid water into the vapor state at a rate dependent on surface temperatures, humidity, winds and pressure. At equilibration, water reaches 100% humidity, and during the day, the temperature rises, allowing more moisture to accumulate in the air. At night the temperature falls and water tends to form clouds, often resulting in ground fog in coastal areas.

At 100% humidity any loss of radiant energy from water causes vapor to condense into water. Circulation and convection can carry moist air upward in the air column, and this often cools moist air. The air forms water droplets, even in the heat of daytime, creating clouds. As the density of droplets in the clouds increase, the air can no longer support droplets and they fall as '''rain'''. More moist air can be drawn into clouds as energy is released, allowing the development of large thunderstorms. Prevailing winds are a factor in storm formation, particularly when changes occur. Tropical waves that develop in westerly flows around the Earth's semitropical and tropical region can organize into horizontal circles over the water, creating a cyclone. [[Image:Hurricane profile.svg|right|thumb|A cyclone showing the flow of moist air as it dissipates energy into the tropopause]]

A cyclone is a stereotype energy transfer system. It gathers steam off of warm water, and quickly moves it upwards releasing the energy into space. This causes the characteristic rain bands. The energy transferred is so great it gives rise to catastrophic winds, which disturb surface waters, increasing steam release, and also increase the rate at which moisture is drawn into the center. The heat of the water under the storm drops. Cyclones demonstrate how much latent energy is stored in the world's oceans.
&lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Fluxes, radiation and aerosols'''
|-
| column width = "350px" | The moisture for a cyclone can be defined as the warm water below the storm. As the cyclone leaves warm water its energy dissipates quickly. Less powerful, long-term rainfall generators can rely on moisture driven by warm waters far from greatest region of rainfall. In the tropics the energy came from, stored heat in ocean currents and moving thermoclines can provide sources far away, such as is seen in El-Nino. [[Image:Mississippi Flood 1993.PNG|thumb|left|Soil moisture as a factor in the great flood of 1993]] Another example is the floods that hit the Midwest U.S. in 1993. The energy that drove moisture into the air occurred in the Gulf, and strong winds and lack of cooling in coastal regions permitted the moisture to travel 1000 miles until conditions were ripe for rain. As the rain fell it cooled the air and dissipated heat, and as new moisture arrived, the process continued. When the sun did come out, it heated wet ground, which created more rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dirmeyer | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Brubaker | first2 = K.L. | year = 1999 | title = Contrasting evaporative moisture          sources during the [[drought of 1988]] and the flood of 1993 | url = | journal = J.

When the air reaches land, which may be warmer, there may be inadequate convection and other processes to create rains, and this can cause droughts. To better see these events progress, scientists need data and models to see what elements of the data are most useful in determining rainfall.

===Research goals===

The research interest of GEWEX is to study [[wikt:flux|fluxes]] of radiation at the Earth's surface, predict seasonal hydration levels of soils and develop accurate models of predicting energy and water budgets around the world. The project sets its goal as to improve, by an order of magnitude, the ability to model and therefore prediction hydration (rainfall and evaporation) patterns&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"/&gt; GEWEX is linked to other WCRP projects such as Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Project, and the Climate and Cryosphere Project through WCRP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/SPARC/index.html Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clic.npolar.no/ Climate and Cryosphere (CliC)] World Climate Research Program and Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research&lt;/ref&gt; and thus shares information and goals with other WCRP projects. The goal becomes more important with the newer WCRP project, the [[Coordinated Observation and Prediction of the Earth System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcrp.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ WCRP STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 2005-2015] World Climate Research Program,      WCRP Strategic Support Unit, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complexity of the experiment====
Aside from fluctuations of solar radiation, the sunlight that is transformed by the earth can vary greatly, some have concluded for instance, that ice-ages self-perpetuate once enough ice has accumulated in the polar regions to reflect enough radiation at high elevations to lower the global average temperature, whereas it takes an unusually warm period to reverse this state. Water usage by plants, herbivore activities can change albedo in the temperate and tropical zones. These trends in reflection are subject to change. Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology.&lt;ref name="ams.allenpress.com"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kinter III JL and Shukla, J | title = The global hydrologic and energy cycles: suggestions for studies in the Pre-GEWEX period | journal = Bull.

There are oscillations in oceanic currents, such as El-Niño and North Atlantic Oscillation, which alter the parts of the Earth's ice mass and land water availability. The experiment takes a sampling of climate, with some trends lasting a million years, and as paleo-climatology shows, can abruptly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/abrupt/index.html|title=A Paleo Perspective Abrupt Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
GEWEX is being implemented in phases. The first phase comprises information gathering, modeling, predictions, and advancement of observation techniques and is complete. The second phase addresses several scientific questions such as prediction capacity, changes in Earth's water cycle, and impact on water resources.

====First phase====
Phase I (1990–2002), also called the "Build-Up Phase", was designed to determine the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes by means of global measurements of atmospheric and surface properties. GEWEX was also designed to model the global hydrological cycle and its impact on the atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces. Phase I processes were to develop the ability to predict the variations of global and regional hydrological processes &amp; water resources, and their response to environmental change. It was also to advance the development of observing techniques, data management, and assimilation systems for operational application to long-range weather forecasts, hydrology, and climate predictions.

During Phase I GEWEX projects were divided into the three overlapping sectors.
# '''GEWEX Radiation Panel''' ('''GRP''') used satellite and ground-based sensing over long periods to determine to delineate natural variation and climate changing forces.
# '''GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel''' ('''GMPP'''): Model the energy and water budget of the earth and determine the predictability. Apply modeling to determine climate forcing events, or respond to climate forcing events by analysis of predictions.
# '''GEWEX Hydrometeorology Panel''' ('''GHP''') - Modeled and predicted changes in water cycle events on longer time scales (up to annual) using intensive regional studies to determine efficacy of data gathering and predictions. The Continental-Scale Experiments (CSEs) relied heavily on the following study areas that would eventually form the basis of the  '''Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period''' ('''CEOP'''):
::* Canada - Mackenzie river basin study area (MAGS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Special Issue on the Mackenzie Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Studies 1994/95 Water Year|journal=Atmosphere-Ocean |volume=40 |issue=2– (Special Issue) |pages=91–278 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; -completed
::* United States - North American study area or GEWEX American Prediction Project(GAPP).
::* Brazil - Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)
::* Scandinavia - Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX)
::* Southern Africa - African Monsoon Multidisciplinary  Analysis  Project (AMMA)
::* Indopacific and Asia - GEWEX Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME) - completed in 2005
::* Australia - Murray-Darling Basin Water Budget Project (MDB)
::But also:
::* Continental-scale - International Project (GCIP)
::* International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP)
CEOP projects interacted with other non-GEWEX projects like CLIVAR and CLiC

=====Results=====
The results of the build-up phase include 15 to 25 years of study, measured the indirect effects of [[aerosol]]s, compiled a correlated data set, some reductions in uncertainty&lt;ref name = "PI_res_Overview"&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/GEWEXAccompBroc.pdf GEWEX Phase I Overview] GEWEX, WCRP&lt;/ref&gt;  GEWEX claims the following accomplishments:  A long period data set of [[cloud]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rain fall]], [[water vapor]], surface radiation, and aerosols with no indication of large global trends, but with evidence of regional variability, models showing increased precipitation, and showed the importance of regional factors, such as water and soil conservation in regional climate change. The Phase I also claims to have produced over 200 publications and 15 review articles.

The Mississippi watershed was part of the GEWEX Continental scale International Projects and as a result was well situated for the  analysis of the Great Flood of 1993 ([[Mississippi River]] and [[Red River Valley|Red River]] water sheds). The coordination between ground sensing observations and satellite information allowed more thorough analysis of events that led up to the flood. Researchers at the [[Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies]] (COLA) found that upstream [[soil moisture]] and a multifold increase of [[humidity|moist]] air flow from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the flooded regions was a major factor in excessive rainfall. The Global Land/Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) gave GEWEX investigators the ability to observe soil wetness over much of the worlds surface by correlating observations on the ground with information obtained by satellites. While the ability to show cause is important, the different conditions (soil wetness, global patterns) that were permissive for weather anomalies are the focus of Phase I, gathering information and learning how to use satellite information better.

[[Image:Aerosol mod 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Aerosol map from 2006 showing increased aerosols, likely fires, in developing countries]]

One of the biggest impact of the Aerosol analysis has been the demonstration of the fairly large impact of anthropogenic aerosols, smoke patterns, even daily ripples of aerosols can be observed off the coasts of some developing nations and extend hundreds of miles over surrounding oceans. Some have questioned whether this aerosol pollution is partly to blame for long-term drought in places like the African [[Sahel]].

=====Critique=====
One critique of the Build-up Phase data and predictions is that there needs to be better error descriptions. The global estimate of rainfall indicates that the [[confidence interval|confidence range]] is large relative to possible [[Trend estimation|trend]]s. The number of ground sensing stations (currently around 40) in the [[#Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]] is rather limited for global observation this affected the measurement of aerosols which are regionally dominant. The best measurements of aerosol pollution are obtained when cloud types are identified properly by satellite observation, therefore better cloud sensing strategies and models are need to provide the clearest real time data. Certain projects like GCIP allow have focused on continental scale observations provide better prediction for project areas; however, areas outside these project areas may lag in receiving forecasting improvements. Many of the deficiencies in Phase I are improvement areas within the objectives of Phase II of the project.&lt;ref name = "PI_res_Overview"/&gt; Currently scientist use NASA Aqua's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) to evaluation soil moisture from space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2004/0729soilshowdown.html  ''Scientists' showdown with soil moisture at the O.K. corral''] Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, July 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, except for focused observations the satellites data is not useful for global weather prediction. The proposed [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite]] would provide the detail of soil moisture information on a daily basis may provide the data needed for real time forecasting.&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A.

Geophysical Research Abstracts, Vol. 10, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second phase====
Phase II, "Full Implementation" (2003–2012) of GEWEX is to "exploit new capabities" developed during phase I such as new satellite information and, increasingly, new models. These include changes in the Earth's energy budget and water cycle, contribution of processes in climate feedback, causes of natural variability, predicting changes on a seasonal or annual  timescales, and how changes impact water resources. Phase II of is designed to be active models that have use to regional resource managers in real time. Some phases, such as the GAME (GEWEX Asia Monsoon Experiment) are already completed .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyarc.nagoya-u.ac.jp/game/ GEWEX Asia Monsoon Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; GEWEX has become an umbrella program for the coordination of studies and experiments around the world. Reports from the phase I are still being produced and it will be some time before the results of the second phase are available. The experiment is still in progress.

==Panels==
There are three panels in GEWEX: The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project(CEOP), GEWEX Radiation Panel(GRP), and GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel(GMPP)

==Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project==
The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project ('''CEOP''') is the largest of the panel projects. There are several regional project areas  most of these are now covered by CEOP

===Areas===
For CEOP which survey the hydroclimate for southern African (AMMA), Baltic Sea area (BALTEX), North America (CPPA), Eastern Amazonia (LBA), La Plate Basin (LBB), Asia (MAHASRI), Australia (MDB), and Northern Eurasia (NEEPSI).&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt; In addition, CEOP coordinates the study of region types, such as cold, high altitude, monsoon, and semiarid climates&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt; and collects and formulates modeling on global, regional scale including land surface and surface hydrology  modeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/islscp.html International Satellite Land         Surface Climatology Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEWEX is an international cooperation it can utilize information from existing and planned satellites.

===Objectives===
The CEOP project has a number of energy budget and water cycle objectives. First is to produce more consistent research with better error definitions. Second is to better determine how energy flux and water cycles involve in feedback mechanisms. Third is to the predictability of important variables and improved parametric analysis to better model these processes. Forth, to collaborate with other hydrological science projects to create tools for assessing the water-system consequences of predictions and global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceop.net/ See Objectives CEOP/GEWEX]&lt;/ref&gt;

===GEWEX Radiation Panel===
GEWEX Radiation panel ('''GRP''') is a collaborative organization with a goal of reviewing theoretical and experimental knowledge of radiative processes within the climate system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grp.giss.nasa.gov/objectives.html  Objectives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705113459/http://grp.giss.nasa.gov/objectives.html |date=2008-07-05 }} Gewex Radiation Panel&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the energy that comes to Earth from the Sun is transformed by the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515125716/http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ |date=2008-05-15 }} Baseline Surface Radiation Network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiehl, J. T., and K. E.

Bull. Amer. Met. Soc., 78, 197-208&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of this collaboration is to determine how energy is transformed as it inevitably is radiated back into space.

====Global precipitation climatology project====
GPCP task was to estimate precipitation using satellites that was global including places where people were not present to take measurements. Secondarily the project was tasked with studying regional precipitation on seasonal to between year time scales. As the study period of the project increased past 25 years a third objective was added analyze long-term variation, such as that caused by [[global warming]]. Also, in a renewed effort for better data and with more observation satellites, the GPCP, hopes to gain insights to rainfall variation on 'weather'-scale, or 4-hour periods to daily time scales.&lt;ref name = "Precip" /&gt;

=====Precipitation Assessment Group=====
The Precipitation Assessment Group was assigned by the panel to evaluate data on precipitation emphasizing data in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) product (GRP project).  The GRP prepares to assimilate data from GPCP diurnal variation data for better estimation of the global precipitation products.&lt;ref name="Precip" /&gt; The result of 25 years of measurement the global average precipitation rate is 2.61&amp;nbsp;mm per/day (about 0.1&amp;nbsp;inch/day) with about 1% uncertainty. The finding suggests there is no significant variation in mean annual rainfall.&lt;ref name="Precip" /&gt; Regional variation was separated from land and ocean and the land variation of received precipitation was greater than the ocean. Satellites used to train the dataset analysis have the flaw of not having inaccurate measurements of drizzle and snow, and lack measurements in isolated places and over oceans. The rainfall maps show the greatest absolute rainfall error over the tropical oceans in regions with the highest estimated rainfall. The report self-critiques two aspects: the lack of polar-crossing satellites at the beginning of the study and the inability to correlate new information and older information (ground-based measurements). The noticeable trends in the dataset were deemed insignificant with regard to issues like global warming, but some stand-out positive trends over the Indopacific region were notable (Bay of Bengal and Indochina) and negative trends over South Central [[Africa]].
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A goal of GEWEX is to monitor radiation that is released at the '''top of the atmosphere''' and model how energy flows from earth surfaces back into space.]]

====Surface Radiation Budget project====
The SRB project under NASA/GEWEX took global radiation measurements to determine radiative energy fluxes. The energy that comes from the sun strikes the atmosphere and scatters, clouds and is reflected, the earth or water where heat and light are radiated back into the atmosphere or space. When water is struck heated surface water can evaporate carrying energy back into space through cloud formation and rain. The SRB project measured these processes by measuring fluxes at the Earth's surface, top-of-atmosphere with shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation.

====Baseline Surface Radiation Network====
At the onset of GEWEX there was inadequate information on how radiation redistributed, both horizontally and vertically.

[[Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]] is a global system of less than 40 widely spread radiation measuring devices designed to measure changes in radiation at the Earth's surface. The information obtained is stored at the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) at the ETH (Zurich).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ Baseline Surface Radiation Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515125716/http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Aerosol Climatology Project====
Established by Radiation Sciences Program(NASA) and GEWEX in 1998 to analyze satellite and field data to determine the distribution of aerosols, how they are formed, transformed and transported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gacp.giss.nasa.gov/ Global Aerosol Climatology Project] Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

====GEWEX Cloud Assessment Project====
The GEWEX cloud assessment was initiated by the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP) in 2005 to evaluate the reliability of available, global, long-term cloud data products, with a special emphasis on ISCCP. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stubenrauch|first=Claudia|author2=GEWEX Cloud Assessment Team|title=Assessment of Global Cloud Datasets from Satellites: Project and Database Initiated by the GEWEX Radiation Panel|journal=Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc.|date=2013|volume=94|pages=1031–1049|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00117.1|doi=10.1175/bams-d-12-00117.1|bibcode = 2013BAMS...94.1031S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel===
The GEWEX modeling and prediction panel ('''GMPP''') is charged with the task of finding better ways to use the data by other projects and other agencies. It oversees GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS), GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS),  and  Global Land/Atmosphere System Study(GLASS).  Climate forcing is a process of study which observes the contribution of irregular events, such a volcano eruption, greenhouse warming, solar variation, fluctuations in the Earth's orbit, long-term variation in the oceans circulation. The GMPP exploits these natural perturbations to test models developed that should predict what happens to global energy and water budgets with the perturbations.

====GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study====
GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study ('''GABLS''') is a more recent addition to GEWEX. The study is tasked with understanding the physical properties of the atmospheric boundary layers for better models which include representation of boundary layers.

====GEWEX Cloud System Study====
GEWEX Cloud System Study ('''GCSS''') task is to individualize modeling for different types of cloud systems. GCSS identifies 5 types of cloud systems:boundary layer, cirrus, extra tropical layer, precipitating convective, and polar. These cloud systems are generally too small to be rationalized in large scale climate modeling, this results in inadequate development of equations resulting in greater statistical uncertainty in results. In order to rationalize these process the study observes cloud systems at single fixed positions on earth in order to better estimate their parameters. These four areas are: Azores and Madeira Islands, Barbados, Equatorial Western Pacific, and Atlantic Tropics. The initial data collection is complete, methods developed for land and aircraft based observations can be compared with satellite observations to that better models of cloud system identification can be made at smaller scales.

====Global Land/Atmosphere System Study====
Global Land/Atmosphere System Study('''GLASS''') tries to understand the impact on land surface parameters on atmosphere.  Changes in land as a result of natural and man-made activities results in the ability to alter local climate and affect wind and cloud formation.

===Critique===
 [[File:Winter-NAO-Index.svg|thumb|left|350px|The period of the North Atlantic Oscillation lasts several times longer than the length of the proposed time frame of the GEWEX study]]
The study period for GEWEX is 22 years, and while some climate oscillations are short, such as El-Nino, some climate oscillations last for decades, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;''The North Atlantic Oscillation Climate Significance and Environmental Impacts'', J.W. Hurrell, Y. Kushnir, G. Ottersen, and M. Visbeck (Eds), Geophysical Monograph Series, 134, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology.&lt;ref name="ams.allenpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940030849_1994030849.pdf ''Production of Global Long-Term Water data. Annual report'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The MAGS project, located in Northwestern Canada utilized indigenous peoples traditional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Woo M  | title = Science Meets Traditional Knowledge: Water and Climate in the Sahtu (Great Bear Lake) Region, Northwest Territories, Canada | journal = Arctic | issue = 1 | pages = 37–46 | date = 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.14430/arctic263 |name-list-format=vanc| author2 = Modeste P | author3 = Blondin  | url = http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3143/Arctic60-1-37.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in other parts of the GEWEX study, these oscillations are an aspect of climate forcing, which allow testing of predictions and models. This modeling may be complicated by the fact that the North Atlantic Oscillation in switching state (see graph) as the effects of global warming are becoming more prominent. For example, 2006 and 2007 saw one of the most dramatic declines in Arctic Sea ice, a decline that was largely unpredicted and can shift the late summer albedo in the northern hemisphere. In 2008, sea ice extent decline has backed off from the previous years' trend, and researchers had forecast a strong La Nina event for late 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.the-environmentalist.org/2008/01/2008-temperature-prediction.html ''2008 Temperature Prediction''] Climate on The Environmentalist. The Environmentalist&lt;/ref&gt; However, unexpectedly the surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific have already begun to rise to El-Nino temperature ranges, indicating the La Nina event may terminate unexpectedly. With this the loss of Northern Polar sea ice has begun to accelerate back toward the earlier trend. Such rapid and unexpected changes in climate-forcing events eventually suggest that modelers need to include parameters such as ocean temperature thermoclines, energy accumulation in the tropical oceans, sea ice extents in the polar regions, land glacial ice retraction in Greenland, and sheet ice and shelf ice remodeling in Antarctica. When multiple climate-forcing influences are acting simultaneously in which one of the events will eventually take dominance, lack of precedents from the past study of similar confluences of events, as well as knowledge of the uncertainty of sensitive 'switches' in the oceanic/atmospheric switches may affect the ability to provide accurate models and predictions. In addition, sampling points may be spread to monitor leading indicators in one common scenario may be useless during an oscillation where the pool of energy shifts to an unmonitored region so that the magnitude of the shift avoids computation.

[[Image:La Nina and Pacific Decadal Anomalies - April 2008.png|thumb|right|350px|Anomalies in April 2008. Note while the central Pacific tropics are under La-Nina, the Eastern Pacific is warming]] 
An example of climate-forcing anomalies might be used to describe the events of 1998 to 2002, a strong El-Nino/La Nina cycle. The onset of the cycle can be influenced by global warming, which facilitated a larger increase of warm water in the tropics, rapidly enough that the thermocline was tolerant. A thermocline is a sharp temperature drop at depth; it varies during the year, with location, and over long periods of time. As the thermocline depth increases El-Nino events are more likely; however, during the peak of the event energy is dissipated and the thermocline decreases depth, possibly to below normal levels so the a strong La-Nina event can results. The world's oceans, particularly the depths of the Atlantic, are believed to be a sink for {{CO2}} that is adsorbed at the polar regions, as this builds into the Pacific the upwelling and warming of water can bring {{CO2}}-rich waters trapped in the cold pressurized bottom layers to the surface. Local increases of {{CO2}} occur which allow more heat trapping; the La-Nina may be mild or aborted early in the process. However, if the return of the thermocline has enough momentum it could propel a strong La-Nina event that last for a few years. However, rapid cooling in the Arctic can allow for more {{CO2}} trapping and offset release of {{CO2}} during La-Nina in a specific area. The Pacific Decadal Anomaly (PDA See image) may influence the source, direction or momentum of rise of the cold water component of the thermocline.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=18012 La Nina and Pacific Decadal Oscillation Cool the Pacific] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602054936/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=18012 |date=2008-06-02 }} Earth Observatory Newsroom, NASA&lt;/ref&gt; The extent and duration of the PDA are yet unpredictable, and its modulating effects on El-Nino/La-Nina patterns can only be speculated. These unknowns affect the ability for climate modelers to predict and indicate climate-forcing models need to accurate a wider sampling of data to be predictive.

[[Image:Milankovitch Variations.png|thumb|left|350px|Scientist still don't know which of these cycles determines the onset of ice-ages and interglacial, were we headed into an ice-age or 50,000 years from now, see [[Milankovitch cycles]]]] There are also longer term cycles, the [[mini ice-age]] that preceded the [[medieval warm period]] may have been a transition to an ice age, the last ice-age lasted from ~130,000 years ago until the onset of the Holocene. This ice-age may have been aborted by other factors including global warming. Such a stalling of long-term cycles is believed to be a factor in the Dryas period, a warming interrupted by surface impacts of extraterrestrial origin may have occurred over hundreds of years.  But the anthropogenic greenhouse effects and changing insolation patterns may have unpredictable long-term effects. Reductions of glacial ice on land masses can cause isotatic rebounds, and may affect earthquakes and volcanism over a wide range. Rising sea levels can also affect patterns, and was seen in Indonesia, simply drilling a gas well in the wrong place may have touched off a mud volcano and there are some signs that this may precede a new caldera formation for a volcano. Over the very long term, the change in temperature of the Earth's crust on geothermal and volcanic processes is unknown. How this plays into climate-forcing events with magnitudes that are unpredictable is unknown.

The critiques at GEWEX can only be thrust at current results, which have added much more information about climate modeling that have created critiques, the major thrust of modeling was originally intended to be part of Phase II which will, after 4 years, produce its results. One of the major critiques of GEWEX phase I was land based measurements, which are now increasing. The other major critique is the inability to capture decadal rainfall events, events that frequently occur over a few hours. Therefore, more measurements documenting shorter time frames may provide essential data for almost continuous data set. Therefore, Phase II is mainly modeling with addition of more data as deemed lacking in Phase I. Many of the critiques above may be compensated for with better data requiring better models including insolation and changes in reflection. The problem with variation in ocean currents, particular with respect to thermocline depths requires more oceanography as part of the project, as with losses of ice and changes of climate on the ice edges.

The '''Highveld''' ([[Afrikaans]]: ''Hoëveld'') is the portion of the [[South Africa#Geography|South African]] inland [[plateau]] which has an altitude above roughly 1500 m, but below 2100 m, thus excluding the [[Lesotho]] mountain regions to the south-east of the Highveld. It is home to some of the country's most important commercial farming areas, as well as its largest concentration of metropolitan centres, especially the [[Gauteng]] [[conurbation]], which accommodates one-third of South Africa's population.

==Location and description==
The Highveld constitutes almost the whole of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], and [[Gauteng]] Provinces, and portions of the surrounding areas: the western rim of Lesotho, and portions of the [[Eastern Cape]], [[Northern Cape]], [[North West (South African province)|North West]], [[Limpopo]], and [[Mpumalanga]] Provinces of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica; Macropaedia Vol 17, p. 66. (1974) Helen Hemingway Bento Publishers, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest part of the Highveld, around 2100&amp;nbsp;m, is its northeastern well-defined boundary, where the plateau escarpment (the Mpumalanga [[Drakensberg]]) separates it from the Mpumalanga [[Veld#Lowveld|Lowveld]], (containing, amongst others, the [[Kruger National Park]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of South African English (1993) Oxford University Press, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt;Another well defined boundary is to its north where the [[Magaliesberg]] separates the Highveld from the Bushveld. The continuation of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] to the south separates the Highveld from KwaZulu-Natal.&lt;ref name= "atlas"&gt;Atlas of Southern Africa p. 13 (1984) Readers Digest &amp; the Directorate of Surveys and Mapping&lt;/ref&gt; The south-eastern portion of the Great Escarpment (that portion of the Great Escarpment most commonly referred to as ''the'' [[Drakensberg]]) rises to over 3000&amp;nbsp;m and forms the boundary between KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho. The latter mountainous region is, however, not generally referred to as Highveld, whose boundary at this point runs just inside the Lesotho-Free State border, about 2000&amp;nbsp;m. From its eastern boundary, the Highveld slopes gently downwards to be bounded by the [[Great Karoo]] to the south, the [[Kalahari]] desert to the west, the [[Bushveld]] to the north, the Mpumalanga Lowveld to the northeast, KwaZulu-Natal to the east, and the [[Geography of Lesotho|Lesotho Highlands, or Mountains]], to the southeast.&lt;ref name= "atlas"/&gt; The Highveld covers an area of almost 400,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or roughly 30% of South Africa's land area.

The Highveld terrain is generally devoid of mountains, consisting of rolling plains, especially in the Free State, sometimes interrupted by rocky ridges such as the [[Witwatersrand]], the [[Magaliesberg]], and [[Vredefort Crater|Vredefort Dome]]. The [[Vaal River]] and its tributaries form the main water drainage system of the Highveld. Tributaries of the [[Orange River]] drain the most southerly regions of the Highveld.

The Highveld [[rainy season]] occurs in summer, with substantial afternoon thunderstorms being typical occurrences in November, December, and January. Frost occurs in winter.

==Urban areas and industry==
Cities located on the Highveld include [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]], [[Bloemfontein]], [[Vereeniging]], [[Welkom]], [[Carletonville, Gauteng|Carletonville]], and the cities of the [[West Rand]] and [[East Rand]]. The diamond-mining city of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] lies on the border of the Highveld and the southeastern Kalahari.

About half of the [[gold]] ever produced in the world has been mined on the Highveld since 1880. The largest deposits are located in the Witwatersrand, which centres on Johannesburg, with smaller deposits in the northern Free State near Welkom and [[Virginia, Free State|Virginia]]. The Highveld is also exceedingly rich in [[diamonds]], [[coal]], [[vanadium]], and [[manganese]].

[[Agriculture]] on the Highveld is generally dominated by extensive [[grain]] production and the grazing of [[beef cattle]], with more intensive production of [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[citrus fruits]], [[Macrotyloma geocarpum|groundnuts]], [[sunflowers]], and [[vegetables]], occurring in irrigated areas and farmland closer to urban areas. The peat base of the [[grassland]] acts as a natural filter, providing sources of clean water.

==Flora==
Naturally occurring vegetation in the Highveld consists of different types of well-established [[grassland]] depending on the varying amounts of rainfall across the area: subtropical and temperate [[grassland]], with true [[savannah]] not dominating the ecosystem until more tropical latitudes. The major grass species are ''[[Hyparrhenia hirta]]'' and ''[[Sporobolus]] pyramidalis'' and among these are other grasses and herbs. Trees and shrubs never thrived due to the frequent fires that occurred in the dry season and the heavy grazing (once by wild animals and now by [[livestock]]).

==Fauna==
The Highveld is home to a number of endangered animals, including [[straw-coloured fruit bat]]s; Africa's largest snake, the African rock python (''[[Python sebae]]''); [[mountain zebra]]s; and South Africa's national bird, the [[blue crane]] (''Anthropoides paradiseus''). The only endemic bird species is [[Botha's lark]] (''Spizocorys fringillaris'') and the two endemic mammals - the [[Free State pygmy mouse]] (''Mus orangiae'') and the [[rough-haired golden mole]] (''Chrysospalax villosa''). As well as the python, other reptiles include the [[Nile crocodile]] (''Crocodylus niloticus''), [[Nile monitor]] (''Varanus niloticus''), rock monitor (''[[Varanus albigularis]]''), and [[giant girdled lizard]] or sungazer (''Smaug giganteus'').

==Threats and preservation==
Like so many areas of grassland all over the world, the Highveld is excellent agricultural land and most of the area has been converted for farming. The grassland areas now remaining in the natural state are in various nature reserves, which, although a small portion of the Highveld, are still the largest areas of remaining [[:Category:Grasslands of South Africa|
grassland in South Africa]]. The protected areas include [[Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gdard.gpg.gov.za/Suikerbos.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verloren Valei Nature Reserve]], [[Nooitgedacht Dam Nature Reserve]], [[Bronkhorstspruit Dam]] Nature Reserve, [[Vaal Dam]] Nature Reserve, and [[Koppies Dam Nature Reserve]]s and [[Willem Pretorius Game Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Highveld grasslands|id=at1009|accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baptism - Saint Calixte.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest depictions of baptism, [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of San Callisto|Catacombs of San Callisto]], third century]][[John the Baptist]], who is considered a forerunner to Christianity, used baptism as the central sacrament of his messianic movement. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism. The earliest Christian baptisms were probably normally by [[Immersion baptism |immersion]], though other modes may have also been used. By the third and fourth centuries, baptism involved [[catechetical]] instruction as well as [[chrismation]], [[Exorcism in Christianity |exorcism]]s, [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], and recitation of a [[creed]]. In the West, [[Affusion]] became the normal mode of baptism between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, though immersion was still practiced into the sixteenth. In the sixteenth century, [[Martin Luther]] retained baptism as a sacrament, but Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] considered baptism and the [[Lord's supper]] to be symbolic. [[Anabaptist]]s denied the validity of infant baptism, which was the normal practice when their movement started and practiced [[believer's baptism]] instead.  Several Anabaptist groups, notably the [[Baptists]] and [[Schwarzenau Brethren |Dunkards]], have always practiced baptism by immersion as following the Biblical example.{{Citation needed | date = March 2014}}

==Background in Jewish ritual==
[[File:Jerusalem 08.08.2011 14-04-17.JPG|thumb|An ancient [[Mikveh]] (bath used for ritual immersion in Judaism) on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem]]
{{Main article |Tvilah}}
Although the term "baptism" is not used to describe the Jewish rituals, the purification rites in [[Halakha|Jewish laws]] and tradition, called "[[Tvilah]]", have some similarity to baptism, and the two have been linked. The "Tvilah" is the act of immersion in natural sourced water, called a "Mikva"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theabrahamproject.com/resources/glossary-christian.html |last=Stoltz |first=Eric |title=A Christian Glossary: Baptism |publisher=The Abraham Project |year=2005 |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}{{Unreliable source? | date = March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=baptism | title = Jewish Encyclopedia | contribution = Baptism | quote = The only conception of Baptism at variance with Jewish ideas is displayed in the declaration of John, that the one who would come after him would not baptize with water, but with the Holy Ghost (Mark i. 8; John i. 27).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for ritual purification was established for restoration to a condition of "ritual purity" in specific circumstances. For example, Jews who (according to the [[Torah|Law of Moses]]) became ritually defiled by contact with a corpse had to use the [[mikvah]] before being allowed to participate in the Holy Temple. Immersion is required for [[Ger tzedek|converts to Judaism]] as part of their conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml |title= Religion &amp; Ethics – Converting to Judaism |publisher= BBC | place= [[United Kingdom|UK]] |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immersion in the mikvah represents a change in status in regards to purification, restoration, and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community, ensuring that the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Num.|19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], [[Mishnah|Tractate]] ''[[Hagigah|Chagigah]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt; It did not become customary,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/barnes/mat003.htm | title = Sacred texts}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, to immerse converts to Judaism until after the [[Babylonian Captivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Albert |last=Barnes |title=Notes on the Bible |at=Matthew 3:6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This change of status by the mikvah could be obtained repeatedly, while Christian baptism, like [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], is, in the general view of Christians, unique and not repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Christa |last=Pongratz-Lippitt |date=May 5, 2007 |title=Churches mutually recognise baptisms |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/9737 |journal=[[The Tablet]] |accessdate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the so-called [[rebaptism]] by some [[Christian denominations]] is not seen by them as a repetition of an earlier valid baptism and is viewed by them as not itself repeatable.{{Citation needed | date = March 2014}}

==Early Christianity==
{{main article |Baptism in early Christianity}}
[[File:Piero, battesimo di cristo 04.jpg|thumb|''The [[Baptism of Christ (Piero della Francesca)|Baptism of Christ]]'', 1450 ([[National Gallery, London]]).]]
[[John the Baptist]] adopted baptism as the central sacrament in his messianic movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Sacrament | year = 2009 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = May 20, 2009 | edition = online | url  = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/515366/sacrament}}.&lt;/ref&gt; seen as a forerunner of Christianity.

Baptism has been part of Christianity from the start, as shown by the many mentions in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Pauline epistles]]. Christians consider Jesus to have instituted the sacrament of baptism. How explicit Jesus' intentions were and whether he envisioned a continuing, organized Church is a matter of dispute among scholars.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 |pages=151–54, ‘Baptism’}}

There is a scholarly consensus that the earliest Christian baptism was normally by immersion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=Lexicographers universally agree that the primary meaning of baptizo G966 is 'to dip' or 'to immerse", and there is a similar consensus of scholarly opinion that both the baptism of John and of the apostles was by immersion |last=Jewett |contribution=Baptism |editor-last=Murray |title=Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible |volume=1 |page=466 |edition=rev |year=2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Schreiner | 2007 | p = 81 | ps =: ‘Most scholars agree that immersion was practiced in the NT, and it is likely that both of these texts allude to the practice, even though baptism is not the main point of either text.’}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=Furthermore, modern NT scholars generally concede, regardless of denominational affiliation, that Christian baptism in NT times was by immersion, as it was and still is in Judaism. |last=Helyer |title=Exploring Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period |page=481 |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Ferguson | 1996 | p = 201 | ps =: ‘The baptism commanded by Jesus in the making of disciples is an immersion in water. The topic formerly was warmly debated, but in these days there is general scholarly agreement. Several lines of evidence converge in support of the baptismal action as a dipping.’}} or at least that this is probable.{{Efn | Sookey says it is "almost certain" that immersion was used;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-0-8028-2748-7 | publisher = Eerdman | title = Dictionary of the Bible | page = 148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Global Dictionary of Theology'' says that it is probable that immersion was the early church's normal mode of baptism, but that it was not seen as an important issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Dyrness+%22baptism+any+less+valid%22 | editor-first = William A | editor-last = Dyrness | title = Global Dictionary of Theology | publisher = Intervarsity Press | year = 2008 | ISBN = 978-0-8308-2454-0 | page = 101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some interpret this as meaning total immersion or submersion beneath the water.  Among those who take this view are [[Thomas R. Schreiner|Thomas Schreiner]],{{Sfn | Schreiner | 2007 | p = 82 | ps =: ‘Submersion under the water in baptism – which is in Jesus' name – indicates that the persons have experienced God's judgment in Christ.’}} [[Everett Ferguson]],{{Sfn | Ferguson | 1996 | p = 202 | ps =: ‘The New Testament descriptions of baptism imply a full bath.’}}  Di Berardino,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=It seems also that the profession was articulated in responses that the one being baptized made to the questions of the one baptizing during the baptismal rite, which in general was required to take place through total immersion, in total nudity, in running water. |last=Di Berardino |title=We Believe in One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church |page=88 |year=2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tischler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=In the early days of the Church, total immersion, often in streams or rivers, seems to have been most commonly used (Mark 1:9; Acts 8:38). |last=Tischler |title=All Things in the Bible: An Encyclopedia of the Biblical World |volume=1 |year=2006 |page=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lang&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=Baptism in the Bible was by immersion, that is, the person went fully under the waters, usually in a river or lake (harking back to the practice of John in the Jordan River). |last=Lang |title=Everyday biblical literacy: the essential guide to biblical allusions in art, literature, and life |page=47 |year=2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others understand immersion as not necessarily implying submersion beneath the water. Kirsten Marie Hartvigsen distinguishes between immersion and submersion and considers both as possible early-Christian forms of baptism,{{Sfn | Hellholm | 2011 | pp = 682, 699}} as does Christian Strecker.{{Sfn | Hellholm | 2011 | pp = 1388–89, 1391, 1397, 1422}}  Laurie Guy says: "The church most likely practiced full immersion, partial immersion and affusion at various times and places in the early centuries, with sprinkling being practiced rarely (and probably only for medical reasons) during that time period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Laurie |last=Guy |title=Introducing Early Christianity |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=2011 |ISBN=978-0-83083942-1 |page=225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Robin M. Jensen describes the early Christian baptismal ritual as having for basis "immersion in water (or a thorough soaking by pouring)",{{Sfn | Jensen | 2012 | page = 30}} and describes the primitive, first-century ritual as having encompassed both "application of water (whether by immersion or by some other means) and an imposition of hands", adding that "'Baptism' originally conveyed the sense of water's application (if not also immersion) in its very definition".{{Sfn | Jensen | 2012 | page = 93}}  Other recent studies that see total immersion (submersion) as not the only form of baptism utilized by early Christians include Steven J. Schloeder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=In the early Church baptism was by one of four methods: complete submersion of the entire body, immersion of the head, affusion or pouring, or aspersion or sprinkling |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bekUBTND4q4C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=baptism+submersion+immersion+affusion |first=Steven J |last=Schloeder |title=Architecture in Communion |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=1998 |ISBN=0-89870-631-9 |page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=J.G. Davies has carefully set these out; and because they are relevant to an archaeological enquiry, we must distinguish them with the same care. The four principal modes are: 1. ''Submersion''; or total immersion, where the candidate goes briefly but entirely below the water, on the model of those baptised by John in the River Jordan; 2. ''Immersion''; where the head, as the prime seat of Man's rational and spiritual being, is in some way submerged, with or without the candidate having to stand in the same container of water; 3. ''Affusion''; … |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgkQIcRgNk0C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=baptism+submersion+immersion+affusion |first=Charles |last=Thomas |title=Christianity in Roman Britain to AD 500 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1981 |ISBN=0-520-04392-8 |page=204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley J. Grenz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote=Although the descriptions of New Testament baptisms indicate that baptism occurred with both the officiator and the candidate standing in water, they do not state specifically what happened in the act. In fact, critics argue, early Christian art may indicate that water was poured on the head of the baptismal candidate standing in a river or body of water. |first=Stanley J |last=Grenz |title=Theology for the Community of God |year=1994 |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = A method of Baptism, employed at least from the 2nd cent., whereby part of the candidate's body was submerged in the baptismal water which was poured over the remainder. ...

The theology of baptism attained precision in the 3rd and 4th centuries.&lt;ref name="ODWR" /&gt; While instruction was at first given after baptism, believers were given increasingly specific instructions before being baptized, especially in the face of heresies in the 4th century.&lt;ref name = "catechumen" /&gt; By the fourth and fifth centuries, baptism had become a several-week-long rite leading up to the actual baptismal washing on [[Easter]]. During this time, catechumens attended several meetings of intensive [[catechetical]] instruction, often by the [[bishop]] himself, and often accompanied by special prayers, [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]]s, and other rites.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | p = 3}}  Catechumens recited the Creed on [[Holy Saturday]] to show that they had completed their catechetical instruction.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | p = 7}}  At dawn following the [[Paschal Vigil]] starting the night of Holy Saturday, they were taken to the [[baptistry]] where the bishop [[holy water|consecrated the water]] with a long prayer recounting the types of baptisms.  The catechumens disrobed, were anointed with oil, renounced the devil and his works, confessed their faith in the Trinity, and were immersed in the font. They were then anointed with [[chrism]], received the [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]], clothed in white, and led to join the congregation in the Easter celebration.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | p = 3}}  By then, postponement of baptism had become general, and a large proportion of believers were merely [[catechumen]]s ([[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine]] was not baptized until he was dying); but as baptisms of the children of Christians, using an adaptation of the rite intended for adults, became more common than baptisms of adult converts, the number of catechumens decreased.&lt;ref name="catechumen"&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Catechumen | year = 2009 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = May 20, 2009 | edition = online | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99350/catechumen}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As baptism was believed to forgive sins, the issue of sins committed after baptism arose. Some insisted that apostasy, even under threat of death, and other grievous sins cut one off forever from the Church.  As indicated in the writings of Saint [[Cyprian]], others favoured readmitting the "[[lapsi (Christian)|lapsi]]" easily. The rule that prevailed was that they were readmitted only after undergoing a period of penance that demonstrated sincere repentance.

What is now generally called the [[Nicene Creed]], longer than the text adopted by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] of 325, and known also as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed because of its adoption in that form by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381, was probably the baptismal creed then in use in Constantinople, the venue of the 381 Council.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | loc = Nicene Creed}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

===Infant Baptism===
{{main article |Infant Baptism}}
Whether the earliest Christians practiced infant baptism, and thus whether modern Christians should do so, has remained a subject of debate between Christian scholars &lt;ref name="ODWR"&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Bowker |authorlink=John Bowker (theologian) |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-866242-4 |oclc=60181672 |page=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at least since the earliest clear reference to the practice by Tertullian in the early third century. Some claim that Biblical baptism can be interpreted and thus relative, others support the Biblical literal baptism as a public and personal testimony, without intermediaries, in the case of infants that cannot talk for themselves yet.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Everett |last=Ferguson |title=Baptism in the Early Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy in the First Five Centuries |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8028-2748-7 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Middle Ages==
Against Pelagius, Augustine insisted that baptism was necessary for salvation even for virtuous people and for children. The baptismal rite was significantly simplified during the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries as fewer and fewer of those baptized were converts from paganism. The rite became much less important and was conducted very quickly. Prebaptismal catechesis was abandoned, and baptism was usually conducted shortly after birth.{{Sfn | Old | 1992 | pp = 7–8}}

[[File:Baptême Cathédrale de Troyes 290308.jpg|thumb|left|Baptism of [[Augustine of Hippo]] as represented in a sculptural group in [[Troyes]] cathedral (1549)]]

==Middle Ages==
In 895, the [[Plenary council (Catholicism)#Provincial councils|provincial]] [[Council of Tribur]] commented on the traditional teaching that the triple immersion in baptism was an [[imitation of Christ]] for the three days he spent in the tomb, and the rising from the water an imitation of the [[resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia |volume=3 |first=Phyllis G |last=Jestice |year=2004 |ISBN=1-57607-355-6 |pages=393–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The linking of the baptismal immersion in and rising from the water with the burial and resurrection of Jesus arguably goes back to Saint Paul,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|6:3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the linking of the triple immersion with the three days in the tomb is found in [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 313–86) and [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – after 394).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQ0AMkkTb7IC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=triple+immersion+three+days+christ+tomb |first=Gerard |last=Lukken |title=Original Sin in the Roman Liturgy |publisher=Brill |year=1973 |ISBN=90-04-03793-4 |page=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th century saw the meaning of the word "[[sacrament]]" narrowed down and restricted to seven rites, among them that of baptism, while other symbolic rites came to be called "[[sacramentals]]".{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 | loc = Sacrament}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

In the period between the 12th and the 14th centuries, [[affusion]] became the usual manner of administering baptism in Western Europe, though immersion continued to be found in some places even as late as the 16th century.&lt;ref name = "cathen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=William |last=Fanning |title=Baptism |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm |year=1907 |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |publisher=Robert Appleton Co |location=New York City |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228172517/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm |archivedate=February 28, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages, there was therefore considerable variation in the kind of facility required for baptism, from the baptismal pool large enough to immerse several adults simultaneously of the 13th century [[Baptistry (Pisa)|Baptistery at Pisa]], to the half-metre deep basin in the 6th century baptistery of the old [[Cologne Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baptismal Font from the Cologne Baptistery |first=Sebastian |last=Ristow |publisher=[[Cologne Cathedral]] |url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/17216.html |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both East and West considered washing with water and the Trinitarian baptismal formula necessary for administering the rite. [[Scholasticism]] referred to these two elements as the matter and the form of the sacrament, employing terms taken from the then prevailing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]]. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], while teaching the necessity of both elements, nowhere uses these philosophical terms when speaking of any of the sacraments.{{Efn | The words "matter" and "form" are not found in the index, nor do they appear in the definition of the sacraments given in [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P35.HTM section 1131]. A search of the electronic form of the book finds no instance of the word "matter", and finds "form" only in the [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4B.HTM section 1434], headed "The Many Forms of Penance in Christian Life", which is not about the sacraments.}}

==Reformation==
{{Main article |Lutheranism#Baptism|Reformed baptismal theology}}
{{Lutheranism}}
In the 16th century, [[Martin Luther]] considered baptism to be a sacrament.  For the Lutherans, baptism is a "[[Means of Grace#Lutheran theology|means of grace]]" through which God creates and strengthens "saving faith" as the "washing of regeneration"{{Bibleref2c|Titus|3:5}} in which infants and adults are reborn.{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:3–7}} Since the creation of faith is exclusively God's work, it does not depend on the actions of the one baptized, whether infant or adult.  Even though baptized infants cannot articulate that faith, Lutherans believe that it is present all the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2607 |title=Baptism and Its Purpose |publisher=[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206220443/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2607 |archivedate=February 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is [[Sola fide|faith alone]] that receives these divine gifts, Lutherans confess that baptism "works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Martin |last=Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther |chapter=The Sacrament of Holy Baptism |chapterurl=http://www.bookofconcord.org/smallcatechism.html#baptism |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |title=[[Luther's Small Catechism]] |year=2009 |origyear=1529}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the special section on infant baptism in his [[Luther's Large Catechism|Large Catechism]], Luther argues that infant baptism pleases God because persons so baptized were reborn and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Martin |last=Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther |chapter=Of Infant Baptism |chapterurl=http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/6_baptism.html |accessdate=February 24, 2009 |year=2009 |origyear=1529 |title=[[Luther's Large Catechism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss Reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] differed with the Lutherans by denying that baptism conveys grace to the baptized. Zwingli identified baptism and the Lord's supper as sacraments, but in the sense of an initiatory ceremony.{{Sfn | Cross | Livingstone | 2005 |pages=151–54, ‘Baptism’}}

Anabaptists (a word that means "rebaptizers") rejected so thoroughly the tradition maintained by Lutherans as well as Catholics that they denied the validity of baptism outside their group. They "rebaptized" converts on the grounds that one cannot be baptized without wishing it, and an infant, who does not understand what happens in a baptism ceremony and who has no knowledge of the concepts of Christianity, is not really baptized. They saw as non-biblical the baptism of infants, who cannot confess their faith and who, not having yet committed any sins, are not in the same need of salvation. Anabaptists and other Baptist groups do not consider that they ''re''baptize those who have been baptized as infants, since, in their view, infant baptism is without effect. The [[Amish]], Restoration churches ([[Churches of Christ]]/[[Christian Church]]), [[Hutterite]]s, [[Baptists]], [[Mennonite]]s and other groups descend from this tradition. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], [[Charismatic (Christians)|charismatic]] and most non-denominational churches share this view as well.&lt;ref name="Brackney"&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=William H. Brackney |last=Brackney |first=William H. |title=Baptists in North America: an historical perspective |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2006 |page=22 |isbn=1-4051-1865-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Reformed baptismal theology]], starting with [[John Calvin]], baptism is seen as primarily God's offer of [[union with Christ]] and all his benefits to the baptized. This offer is believed to be intact even when it is not received in faith by the person baptized.{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=119}} Baptism also initiates one into the [[visible church]] and the [[covenant of grace]].{{sfn|Riggs|2002|p=120}}

The Holocene has seen the growth and impacts of the human species worldwide, including [[Recorded history|all its written history]], development of major civilizations, and overall significant transition toward urban living in the present. Human impacts on modern-era [[Earth]] and its [[ecosystem]]s may be considered of global significance for future evolution of living species, including approximately synchronous [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] evidence, or more recently [[Hydrosphere|hydrospheric]] and [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] evidence of human impacts. In July 2018, [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] split Holocene into three distinct subsections, [[Greenlandian]] (11,700 years ago to 8,326 years ago), [[Northgrippian]] (8,326 years ago to 4,200 years ago) and [[Meghalayan]] (4,200 years ago to the present), as proposed by [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44868527|title=Welcome to the Meghalayan Age a new phase in history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary [[stratotype]] of [[Meghalayan]] is a [[speleothem]] in [[Caves of Meghalaya#List of twenty longest caves in Meghalaya|Mawmluh cave]] in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-news-and-meetings/119-collapse-of-civilizations-worldwide-defines-youngest-unit-of-the-geologic-time-scale|title=Collapse of civilizations worldwide defines youngest unit of the Geologic Time Scale}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the global auxiliary stratotype is an [[ice core]] from [[Mount Logan]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.qpg.geog.cam.ac.uk/news/formalsubdivisionoftheholoceneseriesgeogr18.pdf  Formal subdivision of the Holocene Series/Epoch]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is accepted by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] that the Holocene started approximately 11,650 cal years [[Before present|BP]].&lt;ref name="Walker, M. 2009. pp. 3"/&gt; The Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy quotes Gibbard and van Kolfschoten in Gradstein Ogg and Smith in stating the term 'Recent' as an alternative to Holocene is invalid and should not be used and also observe that the term Flandrian, derived from marine transgression sediments on the Flanders coast of Belgium has been used as a synonym for Holocene by authors who consider the last 10,000 years should have the same stage-status as previous interglacial events and thus be included in the Pleistocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/history/chronostratigraphy/ |title=History of the stratigraphical nomenclature of the glacial period |work=Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy |access-date=June 18, 2017 |date=January 4, 2016 |publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] |last=Gibbard |first=P.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], however, considers the Holocene an epoch following the [[Pleistocene]] and specifically the [[last glacial period]].

The [[Blytt–Sernander system|Blytt–Sernander classification]] of climatic periods initially defined by plant remains in [[peat moss]]es, is currently being explored. Geologists working in different regions are studying sea levels, peat bogs and ice core samples by a variety of methods, with a view toward further verifying and refining the Blytt–Sernander sequence. They find a general correspondence across Eurasia and North America, though the method was once thought to be of no interest. The scheme was defined for [[Northern Europe]], but the [[climate change]]s were claimed to occur more widely. The periods of the scheme include a few of the final pre-Holocene oscillations of the last glacial period and then classify climates of more recent [[prehistory]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

[[Paleontologists]] have not defined any [[faunal stage]]s for the Holocene. If subdivision is necessary, periods of human technological development, such as the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age]], are usually used. However, the time periods referenced by these terms vary with the emergence of those technologies in different parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Climatically, the Holocene may be divided evenly into the [[Holocene Climatic Optimum|Hypsithermal]] and [[Neoglaciation|Neoglacial]] periods; the boundary coincides with the start of the [[Bronze Age]] in Europe. According to some scholars, a third division, the [[Anthropocene]], has now begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Pearce |date=March 15, 2007 |title=With Speed and Violence |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=rimrkFlTHn4C&amp;pg=PT21 |page=21 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |isbn=978-0-8070-8576-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Commission on Stratigraphy Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy’s working group on the 'Anthropocene' (a term coined by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000) note this term is used to denote the present time interval in which many geologically significant conditions and processes have been profoundly altered by human activities. The 'Anthropocene' is not a formally defined geological unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/|title=Working Group on the "Anthropocene"|date=January 4, 2016|work=Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy|publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]|access-date=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene glaciers and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} due to [[post-glacial rebound]] over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/6226537/England-is-sinking-while-Scotland-rises-above-sea-levels-according-to-new-study.html |title=England is sinking while Scotland rises above sea levels, according to new study |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014 |last=Gray |first=Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known, for example, from [[Vermont]] and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher-latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain, and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely [[tectonic uplift]] of non-glacial origin.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Post-glacial rebound in the [[Scandinavia]] region resulted in the formation of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]]. The equivalent event in [[North America]] was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Climate has been fairly stable over the Holocene. [[Ice core]] records show that before the Holocene there was global warming after the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] and cooling periods, but climate changes became more regional at the start of the [[Younger Dryas]]. During the transition from the last glacial to the Holocene, the [[Huelmo–Mascardi Cold Reversal]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] began before the Younger Dryas, and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. It appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] until the later date.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The [[Holocene climatic optimum]] (HCO) was a period of warming in which the global climate became warmer. However, the warming was probably not uniform across the world. This period of warmth ended about 5,500 years ago with the descent into the [[Neoglacial]] and concomitant [[Neopluvial]]. At that time, the climate was not unlike today's, but there was a slightly warmer period from the 10th–14th centuries known as the [[Medieval Warm Period]]. This was followed by the [[Little Ice Age]], from the 13th or 14th century to the mid-19th century, which was a period of cooling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Compared to glacial conditions, habitable zones have expanded northwards, reaching their northernmost point during the HCO. Greater moisture in the polar regions has caused the disappearance of [[steppe-tundra]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The temporal and spatial extent of Holocene climate change is an area of considerable uncertainty, with [[radiative forcing]] recently proposed to be the origin of cycles identified in the North Atlantic region. Climate cyclicity through the Holocene ([[Bond events]]) has been observed in or near marine settings and is strongly controlled by glacial input to the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Bond1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bond, G. |url=http://rivernet.ncsu.edu/courselocker/PaleoClimate/Bond%20et%20al.,%201997%20Millenial%20Scale%20Holocene%20Change.pdf |year=1997 |title=A Pervasive Millennial-Scale Cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and Glacial Climates |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1257–1266 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1257 |bibcode=1997Sci...278.1257B |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227192411/http://rivernet.ncsu.edu/courselocker/PaleoClimate/Bond%20et%20al.%2C%201997%20Millenial%20Scale%20Holocene%20Change.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Bond |first = G. |year = 2001 |title = Persistent Solar Influence on North Atlantic Climate During the Holocene |journal = Science |volume = 294 |issue = 5549 |pages = 2130–2136 |doi = 10.1126/science.1065680 |url =  |pmid = 11739949 |bibcode = 2001Sci...294.2130B |display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodicities of ≈2500, ≈1500, and ≈1000 years are generally observed in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Bianchi |first1 = G.G. |last2 = McCave |first2 = I.N. |year = 1999 |title = Holocene periodicity in North Atlantic climate and deep-ocean flow south of Iceland |url =  |journal = Nature |volume = 397 |issue =  6719|pages = 515–517 |bibcode = 1999Natur.397..515B |doi = 10.1038/17362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Viau |first1 = A.E. |last2 = Gajewski |first2 = K. |last3 = Sawada |first3 = M.C. |last4 = Fines |first4 = P. |year = 2006 |title = Millennial-scale temperature variations in North America during the Holocene |url =  |journal = Journal of Geophysical Research |volume = 111 |issue =  D9|page = D09102 |doi = 10.1029/2005JD006031 |bibcode = 2006JGRD..111.9102V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Debret |first1 = M. |last2 = Sebag |first2 = D. |last3 = Crosta |first3 = X. |last4 = Massei |first4 = N. |last5 = Petit |first5 = J.-R. |last6 = Chapron |first6 = E. |last7 = Bout-Roumazeilles |first7 = V. |year = 2009 |title = Evidence from wavelet analysis for a mid-Holocene transition in global climate forcing |url =  |journal = Quaternary Science Reviews |volume = 28 |issue =  25|pages = 2675–2688 |doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2009.06.005 |bibcode = 2009QSRv...28.2675D }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time spectral analyses of the continental record, which is remote from oceanic influence, reveal persistent periodicities of 1,000 and 500 years that may correspond to solar activity variations during the Holocene epoch.&lt;ref name="Krav"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Kravchinsky |first1 = V.A. |last2 = Langereis |first2 = C.G. |last3 = Walker |first3 = S.D. |last4 = Dlusskiy |first4 = K.G. |last5 = White |first5 = D. |year =  2013|title = Discovery of Holocene millennial climate cycles in the Asian continental interior: Has the sun been governing the continental climate?. |url =  |journal = Global and Planetary Change |volume = 110 |issue =  |pages = 386–396 |doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.02.011 |bibcode = 2013GPC...110..386K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1,500-year cycle corresponding to the North Atlantic oceanic circulation may have had widespread global distribution in the Late Holocene.&lt;ref name="Krav" /&gt;

Animal and plant life have not evolved much during the relatively short Holocene, but there have been major shifts in the distributions of plants and animals. A [[Pleistocene megafauna|number of large animals]] including [[mammoth]]s and [[mastodon]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s like ''[[Smilodon]]'' and ''[[Homotherium]]'', and [[giant sloth]]s disappeared in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene—especially in North America, where animals that survived elsewhere (including horses and camels) became extinct. This extinction of American [[megafauna]] has been explained as caused by the arrival of the ancestors of [[Amerindian]]s; though most scientists assert that climatic change also contributed. In addition, a controversial [[bolide impact]] over North America has been hypothesized to have triggered the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=Rex |title=Blast from the Past?

Throughout the world, ecosystems in cooler climates that were previously regional have been isolated in higher altitude ecological "islands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXAnHwHd0XgC&amp;pg=PA2 |title=One Planet, Many People: Atlas of Our Changing Environment |last=Singh |first=Ashbindu |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |year=2005 |page=4 |isbn=9789280725711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 ka event]]'', an abrupt cold spell recorded as a negative excursion in the {{delta|18|O|link}} record lasting 400 years, is the most prominent climatic event occurring in the Holocene epoch, and may have marked a resurgence of ice cover. It has been suggested that this event was caused by the final drainage of [[Lake Agassiz]], which had been confined by the glaciers, disrupting the [[thermohaline]] circulation of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barber |first=D.C |first2=A. |last2=Dyke |first3=C. |last3=Hillaire-Marcel |first4=A.E. |last4=Jennings |first5=J.T. |last5=Andrews |first6=M.W. |last6=Kerwin |first7=G. |last7=Bilodeau |first8=R. |last8=McNeely |first9=J. |last9=Southon |first10=M.D. |last10=Morehead |first11=J.-M. |last11=Gagnon |date=July 22, 1999 |title=Forcing of the cold event of 8,200 years ago by catastrophic drainage of Laurentide lakes |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6742/full/400344a0.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=400 |issue=6742 |pages=344–348 |doi=10.1038/22504 |access-date=February 11, 2018|bibcode=1999Natur.400..344B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research, however, suggested that the discharge was probably superimposed upon a longer episode of cooler climate lasting up to 600 years and observed that the extent of the area affected was unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rohling |first=Eelco J. |first2=Heiko |last2=Pälike |year=April 21, 2005 |title=Centennial-scale climate cooling with a sudden event around 8,200 years ago. |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7036/full/nature03421.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=434 |issue=7036 |pages=975–979 |doi=10.1038/nature03421 |pmid=15846336 |access-date=February 11, 2018|bibcode=2005Natur.434..975R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the Holocene corresponds with the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] age in most of [[Europe]], but in regions such as the [[Middle East]] and [[Anatolia]] with a very early [[neolithisation]], [[Epipaleolithic]] is preferred in place of Mesolithic. Cultures in this period include [[Hamburg culture|Hamburgian]], [[Federmesser culture|Federmesser]], and the [[Natufian culture]], during which [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|the oldest inhabited places still existing on Earth]] were first settled, such as [[Jericho]] in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Jericho|first=Kathleen Mary|last=Kenyon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evolving archeological evidence of [[origin of religion|proto-religion]] at locations such as [[Göbekli Tepe]], as long ago as the [[9th millennium BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/30706129.html |title=Göbekli Tepe: The World's First Temple? |last=Curry |first=Andrew |date=November 2008 |journal=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both are followed by the aceramic Neolithic ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) and the pottery [[Neolithic]]. The Late Holocene brought advancements such as the bow and arrow and saw new methods of warfare in North America. Spear throwers and their large points were replaced by the bow and arrow with its small narrow points beginning in Oregon and Washington. Villages built on defensive bluffs indicate increased warfare, leading to food gathering in communal groups for protection rather than individual hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snow |first=Dean R. |title=Archaeology of Native North America |year=2010 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |pages=384 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=iHWACgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=9780136156864}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mesoamerica, transformations of natural environments have been a common feature at least since the mid-Holocene, mostly through the exploitation of wild plants and the establishment of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe. |title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |journal=[[Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana, 70]] |pages=61–78 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''laimosphere''' is the [[microbiological]]ly enriched zone of [[soil]] that surrounds below-ground portions of plant stems; the laimosphere is analogous to the [[rhizosphere]] and spermosphere. The combining form laim- from laimos (Greek: λαιμός) denotes a connecting organ (neck) while -sphere indicates a zone of influence. Topographically, the ''laimosphere'' includes the soil around any portion of subterranean plant organs other than roots where exuded nutrients (especially sugars and amino acids) stimulate microbial activities. Subterranean [[plant organ]]s with a laimosphere include [[hypocotyl]]s, [[epicotyl]]s, [[Plant stem|stem]]s, [[stolon]]s, [[corm]]s, [[bulb]]s, and [[leaf|leaves]]. Propagules of soil-borne plant pathogens, whose germination is stimulated by a plant exudates in the laimosphere, can initiate hypocotyl and stem rots leading to "damping-off". Pathogens  commonly found to cause such diseases are species of ''Fusarium'', ''Phoma'', ''Phytopthora'', ''Pythium'', ''Rhizoctonia'' and ''Sclerotinia''.

'''Lamproite''' is an [[ultrapotassic igneous rocks|ultrapotassic]] [[earth's mantle|mantle]]-derived [[volcanic rock|volcanic]] or [[subvolcanic rock]]. It has low [[Calcium oxide|CaO]], [[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium oxide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], high K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a relatively high [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] content and extreme enrichment in [[incompatible element]]s.

Lamproites are geographically widespread yet are volumetrically insignificant. Unlike [[kimberlite]]s, which are found exclusively in [[Archean|Archaean]] [[craton]]s, lamproites are found in terrains of varying age, ranging from Archaean in Western Australia, to Palaeozoic and Mesozoic in southern Spain. They also vary widely in age, from [[Proterozoic]] to [[Pleistocene]], the youngest known example being 56,000 ± 5,000 years old.

Lamproite volcanology is varied, with both [[diatreme]] styles and [[cinder cone]] or cone edifices known.

== Petrology ==
Lamproites form from partially melted [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] at depths exceeding 150&amp;nbsp;km. The molten material is forced to the surface in [[volcanic pipe]]s, bringing with it [[xenolith]]s and diamonds from the [[harzburgite|harzburgitic]] [[peridotite]] or [[eclogite]] mantle regions where diamond formation is stabilized.

Recent research, for example on the lamproites at Gaussberg in Antarctica, and lead-lead [[isotope geochemistry]] have revealed that the source of lamproites may be transition zone melts of subducted [[lithosphere]] which has become trapped at the base of the lithospheric mantle.&lt;ref name="MirnejadBell2006"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Origin and Source Evolution of the Leucite Hills Lamproites: Evidence from Sr–Nd–Pb–O Isotopic Compositions | last=Mirnejad | first=H. | last2=Bell | first2=K. | journal=Journal of Petrology | url=https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article/47/12/2463/1564947 | year=2006 | volume=47 | issue=12 | pages=2463–2489 | doi=10.1093/petrology/egl051| bibcode=2006JPet...47.2463M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation also reconciles the depth of melting with the peculiar geochemistry, which is most easily explained by melting of already felsic material under deep mantle conditions.

== Mineralogy ==
The mineralogy of lamproites is controlled by their peculiar [[geochemistry]], with a predominance of rare silica-deficient mineral species and rare, mantle-derived minerals predominating.

Minerals typical of lamproites include: 
[[forsterite|forsteritic]] olivine; high [[iron]] [[leucite]]; [[titanium]]-rich [[aluminium]]-poor [[phlogopite]]; [[potassium]]- and titanium-rich [[richterite]]; low aluminium [[diopside]]; and iron-rich [[sanidine]]. A variety of rare trace minerals occur. The rocks are high in potassium with 6 to 8% [[potassium oxide]]. High [[chromium]] and [[nickel]] content is typical. The rocks commonly are altered to [[talc]] with [[Carbonate mineral|carbonate]] or [[serpentine group|serpentine]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and [[magnetite]]. [[Zeolite]]s and [[quartz]] may also occur.

Lamproites are characterized by the presence of widely varying amounts (5-90 vol.%) of the following primary phases (Mitchell &amp; Bergman, 1991):

* titanian (2-10 wt% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), aluminium-poor (5-12 wt% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) phenocrystic phlogopite
* titanian (5-10 wt% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) groundmass [[poikilitic]] "tetraferriphlogopite"
* titanian (3-5 wt% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) potassium (4-6 wt% K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) richterite
* forsteritic olivine
* aluminium-poor (&lt;1 wt% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), sodium-poor (&lt;1 wt% Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) diopside
* nonstoichiometric iron-rich (1-4 wt% Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) leucite, and
* iron-rich sanidine (typically 1-5 wt% Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)).
The presence of all the above phases is not required in order to classify a rock as a lamproite. Any one mineral may be dominant, and this, together with the two or three other major minerals present, suffices to determine the [[Petrography|petrographic name]].

The presence of the following minerals precludes a rock from being classified as a lamproite: primary [[plagioclase]], [[melilite]], [[monticellite]], [[kalsilite]], [[nepheline]], Na-rich [[alkali feldspar]], [[sodalite]], [[nosean]], [[hauyne]], [[melanite]], [[schorlomite]] or [[kimzeyite]].

== Geochemistry ==
Lamproites conform to the following chemical characteristics:

* molar K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &gt; 3, i.e., [[ultrapotassic igneous rocks|ultrapotassic]]
* molar K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; 0.8 and commonly &gt; 1
* molar K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/ Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; typically &gt; 1 i.e., peralkaline
* typically &lt;10 wt% each of FeO and CaO, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 1-7 wt%, &gt;2000 and commonly &gt;5000 ppm Ba, &gt;500 ppm Zr, &gt;1000 ppm Sr and &gt;200 ppm La.

== Economic importance ==
The economic significance of lamproite became known with the 1979 discovery of the [[Argyle diamond mine|Argyle diamond pipe]] in [[Western Australia]]. This discovery led to the intense study and re-evaluation of other known lamproite occurrences worldwide; previously only [[kimberlite]] pipes were considered economically viable sources of [[diamond]]s.

The Argyle diamond mine remains the only economically viable source of lamproite diamonds. This deposit differs markedly by having a high content of diamonds but low quality of most stones. Research at Argyle diamond have shown that most stones are of E-type; they originate from [[eclogite]] source rocks and were formed under high temperature ~{{Convert|1400|°C|°F|-2|abbr=on}}. The Argyle diamond mine is the main source of rare pink diamonds.

[[Olivine]] lamproite [[pyroclastic]] rocks and [[dike (geology)|dikes]] are sometimes hosts for [[diamond]]s. The diamonds occur as [[xenocryst]]s that have been carried to the surface or to shallow depths by the lamproite [[diapir]]ic [[intrusion]]s.

The diamonds of [[Crater of Diamonds State Park]] near [[Murfreesboro, Arkansas]] are found in a lamproite host.

== Nomenclature ==
Lamproites, as a group, were known by a variety of localised names due to the fact their mineralogy is quite variable and because of their rarity often few examples of the following lamproite variants were known. Modern terminology classes all as lamproites but modifies this term with the mineral abundances as per the standard IUGS rules.

{{Switzerland Glaciers Labelled Map|float=right}}
This is a non-exhaustive list of the major [[glacier]]s in [[Switzerland]]. It contains their surface area, their lengths since the start of measurement and the most current year, their height and their outflow. Most of them are retreating and many will vanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7770472.stm |title=Swiss Glaciers 'in full retreat' |newspaper=BBC News |date=19 December 2008 |author=Jonathan Amos |location=San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All glaciers are located within the [[Swiss Alps]]. Most of them are situated in the [[Pennine Alps|Pennine]] and [[Bernese Alps]]. The [[Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area]] includes the largest glaciers of the Alps.

There are glaciers in the four major drainage basins of Switzerland. The [[Rhine]] and [[Rhône]] basins are located on the northern side of the Alps while the [[Po (river)|Po]] basin is located on the south side of the Alps. The [[Danube]] basin is located on the east side of the Alps. There are no glaciers in the Swiss portion of the [[Adige]] basin.

This '''list of hills of the Schönbuch''' contains an almost complete selection of the [[hill]]s, high points and spurs or subpeaks of the [[Schönbuch]], a [[forest]] region in the south German [[Keuper Uplands]], and of the ''[[Schönbuch Nature Park]]'' within the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Baden-Württemberg]].

The table below is organised in order of height in [[metre]]s above [[Normalhöhennull|sea level]] (NHN), but some of the columns are sortable by clicking on the symbol in the respective header.

The abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and key|below]].

== Abbreviations and key ==
The abbreviations used in the table (alphabetically sorted) mean:
{|
| width="250" valign="top" |
Counties:
* BB = [[Landkreis Böblingen]]
* ES = [[Landkreis Esslingen]]
* RT = [[Landkreis Reutlingen]]
* TÜ = [[Landkreis Tübingen]]
| width="250" valign="top" |
Other:
* OT = [[observation tower]]
* ha = [[hectare]]
* NR = [[Nature reserves of Germany|Nature reserve]]
* WT = [[water tower]]
|}
The ''Part of'' column usually gives details of the local  [[Naturschutzgebiet|nature reserve]], which is almost never on the hilltop, but on its sides or at its foot. The area in [[hectare]]s, height in [[metre]]s (m) above [[Normalhöhennull]] (NHN) and the date of foundation are given.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of the [[United States]] and [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''200 [[Topographic prominence|most topographically prominent]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]'''.

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Denali is one of only three summits on Earth with more than 6000 meters (19,685 feet) of topographic prominence.  Three summits of the United States exceed 4000 meters (13,123 feet), six exceed 3500 meters (11,483 feet), ten exceed 3000 meters (9843 feet), 19 exceed 2500 meters (8202 feet), 45 exceed 2000 meters (6562 feet), [[List of the highest major summits of the United States|128 ultra-prominent summits exceed 1500 meters (4921 feet)]], and 264 major summits exceed 1000 meters (3281 feet) of topographic prominence.

==Most prominent summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Most prominent summits}}
{{see also|List of the ultra-prominent summits of the United States}}
Of these 200 most prominent summits of the United States, 84 are located in Alaska, 17 in California, 17 in Nevada, 14 in Washington, 12 in Montana, 11 in Utah, eight in Colorado, seven in Hawai{{okina}}i, seven in Arizona, six in Oregon, four in Wyoming, four in Idaho, three in New Mexico, two in North Carolina, and one each in New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee, and Maine.  Four of these peaks lie on the international border between Alaska and British Columbia, four lie on the international border between Alaska and Yukon, and one lies on the state border between Tennessee and North Carolina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8539">This page lists most '''power stations that run on [[tidal power]]'''. Since tidal stream generators are an immature technology, no technology has yet emerged as the clear standard. A large variety of designs are being experimented with, with some very close to large scale deployment. Hence, the following page lists stations of different technologies. &lt;!-- EDITORS: Please list in alphabetical order. Currently, this page lists stations of all sizes at all stages; proposed, under-construction, operational, decommissioned. Once this list reaches significant size, all proposed and decommissioned entries should be moved to regional lists; similar to what is done at similar lists. --&gt;

The '''Lopingian''' is the uppermost [[Series_(stratigraphy)|series]]/[[Epoch_(geology)|epoch]] of the [[Permian]]&lt;ref name="Chart"&gt;{{cite web |last1=International Commission on Stratigraphy |title=Chart |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is the last epoch of the [[Paleozoic]]. The Lopingian was preceded by the [[Guadalupian]] and followed by the [[Early Triassic]]. 

The name was introduced by [[Amadeus William Grabau]] in 1931 and derives from [[Leping]], [[Jiangxi]] in the then [[China#Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhang |first1=Shouxin |title=Geological Formation Names of China (1866—2000) |date=2009 |publisher=Higher Education Press/Springer |location=Beijing/Dordrecht |isbn=978-7-040-25475-4 |page=681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It consists of two [[Stage_(stratigraphy)|stages]]/[[Age_(geology)|ages]]. The earlier is the [[Wuchiapingian]] and the later is the [[Changhsingian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allaby |first1=Michael |title=A Dictionary of Geology and Earth Sciences |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=4th |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/acref/9780199653065.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The [[International Chronostratigraphic Chart]] (v2018/07)&lt;ref name="Chart" /&gt; provides a numerical age of 259.1 ±0.5 Ma. If a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP) has been approved, the lower boundary of the earliest stage determines numerical age of an epoch. The GSSP for the Wuchiapingian has a numerical age of 259.8 ± 0.4 Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=International Commission on Stratigraphy |title=GSSPs |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-gssps |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Lopingian ended with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]].

A '''multipoint ground''' is an alternate type of electrical installation that attempts to solve the [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] and [[mains hum]] problem by creating many alternate paths for electrical energy to find its way back to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]].  The distinguishing characteristic of a multipoint ground is the use of many interconnected grounding conductors into a loose grid configuration.  There will be many paths between any two points in a multipoint grounding system, rather than the single path found in a star topology ground.  This type of ground may also be known as a '''Signal Reference Grid''' or '''Ground''' (SRG) or an '''Equipotential Ground'''.

== Advantages ==

If installed correctly, it can maintain reference ground potential much better than a star topology in a similar application across a wider range of frequencies and currents.

== Disadvantages ==

A multipoint ground system is more complicated to install and maintain over the long term, and can be more expensive to install.

Star topology systems can be converted to multipoint systems by installing new conductors between old existing ones.  However, this should be done with care as it can inadvertently introduce noise onto signal lines during the conversion process.  The noise can be diminished over time as noisy and failed components are removed and repaired, but some isolation of high current (e.g. motors and lighting) and sensitive low current (e.g. amplifiers and radios) equipment may always be necessary.

== Design Considerations ==

A multipoint grounding system can solve several problems, but they must all be addressed in turn.  The size of the conductors must be designed to meet the expected load in operations and in lightning protection.  The amount of cross bonding, and the topology of the grids, is determined by the expected frequencies in the signals to be carried and the uses the installation will be put to.

A ground grid is provided primarily for safety, and the size of the conductors is probably governed by local building or [[National Electrical Code (US)|electrical code]].  One factor to keep in mind is that since the final grid will have multiple paths to ground, the final system resistance to ground will likely be lower than for a typical star ground.  But this does not change the need for adequate conductor size to any given piece of equipment in case of a fault.

[[Lightning rod|Lightning protection]] is provided by bonding the multipoint ground grid to one or more [[Ground (electricity)|grounding rods]] under or at the perimeter of the building, and then up to the lightning rods.  If the building has significant metal framing elements, these should be bonded to the lightning rods and grounding rods as well.

If the building has large motors, driving such things as fans, pumps, elevators, etc., these should also be on the multipoint grid.  However, they should not be on segments of the grid that will service equipment such as audio amplifiers, small signal radio circuits, computer networks, sensitive electrical instrumentation, etc.  Since building two grids into the same building may be prohibitively expensive, a good compromise is to connect the low frequency, high current equipment to the grid at or near the ground rods and entrance transformers, in such a way that their load 
will not flow across the segment of the grid connected to the low current equipment.  Thus the system is still an electrically continuous unit, but motor noise does not impinge directly into signal paths.

The cross bonding is governed by the frequencies and wavelengths to be protected against.  A multipoint ground is at its best when it allows currents of many different frequencies to find a path to ground.  If the system is expected to always have no more than main current present, the wavelengths involved at 50 or 60 Hz will cause the system design to become a star topology.  But if higher frequencies are present, they need to be closer.  In general, the spacing between nodes should be less than 1/8 of the shortest wavelength present.  This will guarantee that current can always flow no matter which path it tries to take.  If less than 1/8 wavelength node spacing cannot be achieved, then at least include as many cross connects as possible, as closely spaced as possible.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Orpheus''''' is a thirty-minute [[neoclassical ballet]] in three [[Scene (drama)|tableaux]] composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]] in collaboration with choreographer [[George Balanchine]]  in Hollywood, California in 1947. The work was commissioned by the [[Ballet Society]], which Balanchine founded together with [[Lincoln Kirstein]] and of which he was Artistic Director. Sets and costumes were created by [[Isamu Noguchi]].

==Structure==
The original cast consisted of 30 dancers: Orpheus; Eurydice; the Dark Angel of Death; Apollo; the leader of the Furies; the leader of the Bacchantes; eight women Bacchantes; nine women in various roles (Friends to Orpheus, Furies, Pluto, Satyr, and Nature Spirits); and seven men as Lost Souls.

The action is divided into three tableaux and twelve dance episodes: 
(I. Tableau): Orpheus Weeps for Eurydice; Air de Danse; Dance of the Angel of Death; Interlude. (II. Tableau): Pas des furies; Air de danse (Orphée)/Interlude/Air de danse, conclusion; Pas d’action; Pas de deux; Interlude; Pas d’action. 
(III. Tableau): Apothéose d'Orphée. 

==Score==
The score is among Stravinsky's most melodious. There is a wide dynamic range (reaching fortississimo, ''fff'', at the moment when the Bacchantes dismember Orpheus); but mostly the orchestra plays quietly, seldom rising above mezzoforte.

The size of the orchestra is very much "neo-classical"; like Beethoven, Stravinsky has scored for double woodwinds (except that, like Beethoven in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]], he has added a piccolo to the two flutes). This economy in the scoring is, like the quiet dynamics that predominate in ''Orpheus'', in stark contrast to the composer's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' of 35 years before. Beethoven deployed three trombones in his 5th and 9th Symphonies, importing them from the world of operatic music; the use of three trombones then became the normal orchestral practice in the 19th century and up through the present day, but in ''Orpheus'' Stravinsky needs only two.  The tuba is missing entirely. Also strikingly different from ''The Rite of Spring'' is the absence of a percussion section and the use of only one timpanist.

There is an important role for the harp in ''Orpheus''. This has a long tradition in classical music, in which the character of Orpheus is associated with that instrument, by analogy with the Ancient Greek [[Lyre |lyre]]. Two important examples of this may be mentioned: Gluck’s opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' and Liszt’s symphonic poem ''[[Orpheus (Liszt)|Orpheus]]. 

Stravinsky's Neoclassicism occasionally extends to parody; one of the most extended examples in his work is to be found in the Air de Danse (Orphée) of the second tableau, in which an elegant "Siciliana" for reduced forces of harp, timpani, strings, and oboe duet (with cor anglais replacing one of the oboes after the interlude) evokes a late Baroque concerto. It is interesting to note that Stravinsky also creates a neo-Baroque parody – for a scene that also takes place in Hades – in his ''[[Perséphone (Stravinsky)|Perséphone]]'' of 1934.

==History==
The premiere took place on April 28, 1948, at [[New York City Center|City Center of Music and Drama]], [[New York City|New York]], and directly resulted in City Center's chairman, Morton Baum, inviting Balanchine and Kirstein to establish a resident company. The new company was named (or Ballet Society renamed) [[New York City Ballet]] and Balanchine remained its ballet master until his death.

The program for City Ballet's first performance at City Center, conducted by the composer, consisted of ''Orpheus'', ''[[Concerto Barocco]]'' and ''[[Symphony in C (ballet)|Symphony in C]]'' on October 11, 1948.

Noguchi's rendition of [[Orpheus]]' [[lyre]] was adopted as – and remains – City Ballet's official symbol.

The '''Pandacan Oil Depot''' was a 33-hectare compound in [[Pandacan]], [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It housed the storage facilities and distribution terminals of three major players in the country's petroleum industry, namely [[Caltex]] (a petroleum brand name of [[Chevron Corporation]]), [[Petron Corporation|Petron]], and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. The oil depot took its roots from separate establishments by these oil companies.

The continued operation of the oil depot in a densely populated major city was a subject of various concerns, including its environmental and health impact to the residents of Manila.

== History ==
Shell established facilities in 1914. Caltex began using the Pandacan warehouse depot in 1917, when it started marketing its products in the Philippines. Eleven years later, its Pandacan warehouse depot was converted into a key distribution terminal to bring products to nearby provinces.&lt;ref name="Caltex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caltex.com/ph/about/caltex-in-philippines/ |title=Caltex in Philippines |accessdate=2014-03-03 |work=Caltex Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petron followed suit in 1922.

== Incidents and concerns ==
[[File:Oil Depot at Pasig River.jpg|thumb|One of the storage facilities in the oil depot.]]
[[File:Pandacan Oil Depot (Pasig River, Pandacan, Manila)(2014-11-24).jpg|thumb|The oil depot in 2014]]
The continued operation of the oil depot in a densely populated major city has been a subject of various concerns, including its environmental and health impact to the residents of the adjacent community surrounding the compound, as well as to the larger Manila population. International standards allow oil depots to operate within a 20-kilometer radius buffer zone, away from residential and commercial establishments which would be directly affected by the facility’s everyday operations and impending accidents in the future.

In 1997, two Shell oil tankers exploded inside the oil depot complex. In 1999, a pipeline leak was the source of fires in [[Muntinlupa|Muntinlupa City]], killing one.&lt;ref name="TV5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/65774/a-century-old-challenge--the-oil-depots-in-pandacan |title=A CENTURY-OLD CHALLENGE: The oil depots in Pandacan |accessdate=2014-03-03 |work=Interaksyon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, a tanker burst into flames at the foot of the Nagtahan fly-over. In 2005, the [[University of the Philippines College of Medicine|UP College of Medicine]] at the [[University of the Philippines Manila]] conducted the cross-sectional study which found that the number of cases of neurophysical disorders in the area surrounding the area have been progressively increasing. In the same year, a health survey proved that the air surrounding the oil depot contains high levels of [[benzene]], a chemical compound known to increase risks of cancer.

In July 2010, the leak of the underground pipeline of the First Philippine Industrial Corporation (FPIC), which carries oil from the oil refineries in the province of [[Batangas]] to Pandacan, caused the contamination of water bed table at the basement of West Tower Condominium in Bangkal in [[Makati|Makati City]].&lt;ref name="Mark Frialde"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2013/12/26/1272191/makati-fireworks-ban-3-oil-leak-barangays-stays |title=Makati fireworks ban in 3 'oil leak' barangays stays |accessdate=2014-03-03 |work=The Philippine Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Laguna Lake Development Authority]] (LLDA) General Manager [[Nereus Acosta]] fined the operator of the depot with P200,000 daily due to environmental violations in the Pasig River, which runs thru Laguna Lake.&lt;ref name="Jefferson Antiporda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manilatimes.net/llda-slaps-p200000-daily-fine-on-pandacan-oil-depot-operator/13533/ |title=LLDA slaps P200,000 daily fine on Pandacan oil depot operator |accessdate=2014-03-03 |work=The Manila Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malacañang Palace]], the official residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], is only two kilometers away from the depot.&lt;ref name="Francesca Francia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcmonitor.org/article.php?id=87 |title=BROKEN PROMISE IN MANILA: The dying and the fearful ask |accessdate=2014-03-03 |work=Global Community Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] is located directly across from the depots on the banks of the [[Pasig River]].&lt;ref name="Francesca Francia"/&gt;

== Legislative actions==
In 2001, the [[Manila City Council]] passed Ordinance No. 8027 that changed the classification of Pandacan from an industrial to a commercial area. It gave the oil depot six months to cease operating in the area.&lt;ref name="TV5"/&gt; In 2006, Ordinance No. 8119 ordered the phasing out of hazardous industries in the city, including the depot. In 2009, Ordinance 8027 was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]; while the City Council passed Ordinance No. 8187 to negate the first ordinance. This time, Pandacan was re-classified as a heavy industrial zone, allowing the depot to operate.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The ordinance was later ruled by the Supreme Court as invalid.&lt;ref name=food&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lectura|first1=Lenie|title=Petron to work with DOTr in converting Pandacan oil depot into food terminal|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/petron-work-dotr-converting-pandacan-oil-depot-food-terminal/|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=BusinessMirror|date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ordinance No. 8283 re-classified the area as a high-intensity commercial zone, thus giving the oil depot until 2016 to relocate, but was vetoed by then Mayor Alfredo Lim. The proposal instead was to transfer the facilities to the North Harbor, still in Manila.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Dismantlement==
[[File:Old oil depot site - shot from PUP (Pandacan, Manila; 2017-01-03).jpg|thumb|The site of the former oil depot, 2017.]]
Shell started dismantling the oil depot in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flores|first1=Alena Mae|title=Shell starts leaving Pandacan oil depot|url=http://manilastandard.net/business/181573/shell-starts-leaving-pandacan-oil-depot.html|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=Manila Standard|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the following month, at least three tanks has been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finally, Pandacan oil depot dismantled|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/finally-pandacan-oil-depot-dismantled/210501/|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=The Manila Times|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil depot was later dismantled completely.

In January 2017, Petron announced that it plans to establish a public market in a property within the site of the former oil depot.&lt;ref name=food/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11864">The [[United States]] is divided into five '''Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts''', or '''PADDs'''.  These were created during [[World War II]] under the '''Petroleum Administration for War''' to help organize the allocation of fuels derived from [[petroleum]] products, including [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] (or "distillate") fuel.  Today, these regions are still used for data collection purposes.

The Petroleum Administration for War was established in 1942 by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]], and abolished in 1946.  The districts are now named for the later '''Petroleum Administration for Defense''' which existed during the [[Korean War]].  It was established by the [[Defense Production Act]] of 1950, then abolished in 1954, with its role taken over by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of Interior]]'s Oil and Gas Division.

==PAD Districts==
*'''PADD I (East Coast)''' is composed of the following three subdistricts:
**'''Subdistrict A (New England)''': [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Vermont]].
**'''Subdistrict B (Central Atlantic)''': [[Delaware]], [[District of Columbia]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Pennsylvania]].
**'''Subdistrict C (Lower Atlantic)''': [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]].
*'''PADD II (Midwest)''': [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Wisconsin]].
*'''PADD III (Gulf Coast)''': [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]].
*'''PADD IV (Rocky Mountain)''': [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]].
*'''PADD V (West Coast)''': [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].


For administrative purposes the US government divides the US into five Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs). These were created during World War II to help organize the allocation of fuels, including gasoline and diesel fuel. Today, these regions are still used for data collection purposes.

===PADD 1 (East Coast)===

PADD 1 covers the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Due to their location, refineries in the central US have enjoyed cheap domestic [[tight oil]] and discounted oil sands production from Canada. Meanwhile, refineries on the East Coast have been forced to buy oil from overseas at higher world prices due to North American pipeline bottlenecks. Five refineries on the US East Coast have been forced to close since 2010, and three more were threatened with closure before they sold at discounted prices. Pipelines are the cheapest and safest method of oil transportation in North America. However, due to the lack of pipelines, East Coast refineries must bring in domestic North Dakota Bakken oil and imported Western Canadian oil sands production by rail.&lt;ref name="Robbins 2013"/&gt; Imports account for the vast majority of PADD 1 refinery feedstock, but only a small portion of it comes from Canada, mostly Canadian Atlantic offshore production. Very little comes from the Canadian oil sands. Most of the refineries can handle only sweet, light crude oil, so even heavy, sour Western Canadian Select would not be a good feedstock. Imports of heavy oil from Western Canada could rise in the next few years via deliveries by rail, but it is unlikely that much oil sands production will be processed there.&lt;ref name="CAPP2013"/&gt;

===PADD 2 (Midwest)===

PADD 2 covers the [[Midwestern United States]].  In recent years, many of the refiners in PADD 2 added [[coker unit]]s to handle heavier Canadian feedstocks to replace declining domestic oil production. Canadian oil was readily available since Canadian oil pipelines from Alberta to Ontario ran through the US Midwest, and it has almost completely backed out competing sources of imported oil due to its lower cost. US Midwest refiners have become by far the largest refiners of Canadian oil sands production. Unexpectedly, North Dakota production also increased because of [[hydraulic fracturing]] in the [[Bakken formation]], making ND the second largest US producing state after Texas. Oil production from ND was delivered through the Canadian pipeline system, so the glut of new oil forced feedstock prices to US refineries on the Canadian pipelines down and made them much more profitable than  refineries elsewhere in the US or Europe.&lt;ref name="Robbins 2013"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2014-05-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAPP2013"/&gt;

===PADD 3 (Gulf Coast)===

PADD 3 ([[United States Gulf Coast]]) has half of the oil refining capacity in the US. The vast majority of the refineries are in Texas and Louisiana. Crude oil demand by Gulf Coast refineries was almost {{convert|8000000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in 2012, of which {{convert|2200000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} was imported heavy oil.&lt;ref name="CAPP2013"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Gulf Coast refineries have the capacity to process very heavy crude oils from Venezuela and Mexico. However, exports from those countries has been declining in recent years, and more of Venezuela's exports are going to other countries, notably China. US domestic oil production has been increasing since 2010 due to [[horizontal drilling]] and [[hydraulic fracturing]] in [[tight oil]] fields, notably the [[Eagle Ford Formation]] of Texas. Some Gulf Coast refineries have completely replaced imported light and medium oil with new Texas tight oil. Unfortunately, most of it is too light for the Gulf refineries. Much new US tight oil is being exported to Canada for use as oil sands diluent and returning in blends which are a better feedstock for heavy oil refineries.

For Canadian oil sands producers this is a chance to back Venezuelan, Mexican, and Arabian heavy oil out of the Gulf Coast market and help achieve [[North American energy independence]]. The main problem has been pipeline capacity. As a result of delays in US government approval of the [[Keystone XL]] system and other pipelines, only {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of Canadian crude reached the Gulf Coast in 2012. Since Canadian heavy oil and bitumen was much lower in price than heavy oil from other countries, oil companies started buying up and reversing idle pipelines which used to carry imported oil from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest to carry Canadian oil in the other direction. Canadian exports of oil by rail increased 900% from early 2012 to late 2013. This was more expensive and arguably more hazardous than moving oil by pipeline, but cost-effective for refineries given the lower cost of heavy oil imports from Canada versus other countries.

===PADD 4 (Rocky Mountain)===

PADD 4 covers the Rocky [[Mountain States]] of the US. Refineries in the region have been in a similar position to Midwest refineries, having access to cheap Canadian imports. Recent increases in North Dakota production has also flooded the market with domestic oil and reduced prices. Although their market volumes have been  much less than in other regions, refineries in the Rocky Mountains have generally sold fuel at the lowest prices in the US due to their lower feedstock costs. If Canadian heavy oil continues to be priced at an attractive discount, refineries are expected to continue to take large volumes despite the light crude oil surplus in the region.&lt;ref name="CAPP2013"/&gt;

===PADD 5 (West Coast)===

PADD 5 ([[West Coast of the United States]]) is a large potential market for increasing Canadian oil sands output as production of oil from its historic sources in Alaska and California has declined steeply in recent decades, and it has no pipeline access to new US production in North Dakota or Texas. Imports from countries outside North America have been increasing in volume although most of it is significantly more expensive than Canadian or domestic American oil. Many of the refineries in California and Washington State are capable of processing heavy oil because much of the [[California oil and gas industry|oil production in California]] is heavy, as is much imported oil. They have also noted that a mix of 55% [[North Dakota oil boom|North Dakota Bakken oil]] and 45% [[Western Canadian Select]] is a reasonable substitute for badly diminished supplies of [[Alaska North Slope]] oil.  PADD V is physically disconnected from the pipeline systems of the rest of the United States, but the Trans Mountain Pipeline delivers oil of all types from Alberta across British Columbia to refineries in Washington, which in 2012 processed {{convert|240000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of imported oil, 60% of which came from Canada. If the Trans Mountain Expansion and Northern Gateway pipelines are completed, total capacity from Western Canada to the West Coast could exceed {{convert|1400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} by 2018.&lt;ref name="CAPP2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hackett 2013"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California has no pipeline connections that could deliver oil from other producing states or Canada, and in 2012 imported {{convert|780000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} of oil, only 5% of which came from Canada and two-thirds from Saudi Arabia. Canadian (and North Dakota) oil has been much cheaper than Arabian oil so potential exists for delivering oil sands production to California from the West Coasts of British Columbia and Washington by tanker. However, a big question mark hanging over the California refining market is the [[Low-carbon fuel standard#California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard|California Low Carbon Fuel Standard]].

It is the lowest energy state (the [[ground state]]) of the electromagnetic field when the [[Quantization of the electromagnetic field|fields are quantized]].&lt;ref name=Cao/&gt; When [[Planck's constant]] is hypothetically allowed to approach zero, QED vacuum is converted to [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|classical vacuum]], which is to say, the vacuum of classical electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=Mackay/&gt;&lt;ref name=classical/&gt;

Another field-theoretic vacuum is the [[QCD vacuum]] of the [[Standard Model]].

==Fluctuations==
{{Main|Quantum fluctuation}}

[[File:Vacuum fluctuations revealed through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.ogv|thumb|right|150px| The video of an experiment showing [[vacuum fluctuations]] (in the red ring) amplified by [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]]. ]]

The QED vacuum is subject to fluctuations about a dormant zero average-field condition:&lt;ref name=Shankar/&gt; Here is a description of the quantum vacuum:
{{quote|The quantum theory asserts that a vacuum, even the most perfect vacuum devoid of any matter, is not really empty. Rather the quantum vacuum can be depicted as a sea of continuously appearing and disappearing [pairs of] particles that manifest themselves in the apparent jostling of particles that is quite distinct from their thermal motions. These particles are ‘virtual’, as opposed to real, particles. ...At any given instant, the vacuum is full of such virtual pairs, which leave their signature behind, by affecting the energy levels of atoms.|Joseph Silk ''On the Shores of the Unknown'', p. 62&lt;ref name= Silk/&gt;}}

===Virtual particles=== 
{{Main|Virtual particles|Quantum fluctuation}}
It is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles based upon the Heisenberg [[Uncertainty principle#Energy.E2.80.93time uncertainty principle|energy-time uncertainty principle]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \, , &lt;/math&gt;
(where {{math|Δ''E''}} and {{math|Δ''t''}} are [[energy]] and [[time]] variations, and {{mvar|ħ}} the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2{{pi}}) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the "borrowing" of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;

This interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universally accepted, however.&lt;ref name=Allday/&gt;&lt;ref name=King/&gt; One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty {{math|Δ''t''}} determines a "budget" for borrowing energy {{math|Δ''E''}}.  Another issue is the meaning of "time" in this relation, because energy and time (unlike position {{mvar|q}} and momentum {{mvar|p}}, for example) do not satisfy a [[canonical commutation relation]] (such as {{math|[''q'', ''p''] {{=}} ''iħ''}}).&lt;ref name=commutation/&gt; Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy.&lt;ref name=Busch0/&gt;&lt;ref name=Busch/&gt; The many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a continuing subject of study.&lt;ref name=Busch/&gt;

===Quantization of the fields===
{{Main|Quantization of the electromagnetic field}}
The [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] does not allow a particle to exist in a state in which the particle is simultaneously at a fixed location, say the origin of coordinates, and has also zero momentum. Instead the particle has a range of momentum and spread in location attributable to quantum fluctuations; if confined, it has a [[zero-point energy]].&lt;ref name=Schwabl/&gt;

An uncertainty principle applies to all quantum mechanical operators that do not [[commutator|commute]].&lt;ref name=Petrosyan/&gt; In particular, it applies also to the electromagnetic field. A digression follows to flesh out the role of commutators for the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name=Vogel2/&gt;
:The standard approach to the quantization of the electromagnetic field begins by introducing a ''vector'' potential {{math|'''A'''}} and a ''scalar'' potential {{mvar|V}} to represent the basic electromagnetic electric field {{math|'''E'''}} and magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} using the relations:&lt;ref name=Vogel2/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathbf B &amp;= \mathbf {\nabla  \times A}\,, \\ 
\mathbf E &amp;= -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{\nabla}V \, . 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:The vector potential is not completely determined by these relations, leaving open a so-called ''gauge freedom''. Resolving this ambiguity using the [[Coulomb gauge]] leads to a description of the electromagnetic fields in the absence of charges in terms of the vector potential and the ''momentum field'' {{math|'''Π'''}}, given by:
::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf \Pi = \varepsilon_0 \frac{ \partial }{\partial t} \mathbf A \, , &lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]] of the [[SI units]]. Quantization is achieved by insisting that the momentum field and the vector potential do not commute. That is, the equal-time commutator is:&lt;ref name=Compagno/&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\bigl[\Pi_i(\mathbf{r}, t),\ A_j(\mathbf{r}', t)\bigr]=-i\hbar \delta_{ij}\delta (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\, , &lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|'''r'''}}, {{math|'''r'''′}} are spatial locations, {{mvar|ħ}} is [[Planck's constant]] over 2{{pi}}, {{mvar|δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]] and {{math|''δ''('''r''' − '''r'''′)}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The notation {{math|[ , ]}} denotes the [[commutator]].

:Quantization can be achieved without introducing the vector potential, in terms of the underlying fields themselves:&lt;ref name=Vogel/&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\left[ \hat{ E}_k (\boldsymbol r ) , \hat{ B}_{k'} (\boldsymbol r') \right] = -\epsilon_{kk'm}\frac{i \hbar}{\varepsilon_0} \frac {\partial}{\partial x_m}  \delta (\boldsymbol{r-r'})  \, , &lt;/math&gt;
:where the [[circumflex]] denotes a Schrödinger time-independent field operator, and {{mvar|ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita tensor]].

Because of the non-commutation of field variables, the variances of the fields cannot be zero, although their averages are zero.&lt;ref name=Grynberg/&gt; The electromagnetic field has therefore a zero-point energy, and a lowest quantum state. The interaction of an excited atom with this lowest quantum state of the electromagnetic field is what leads to [[spontaneous emission]], the transition of an excited atom to a state of lower energy by emission of a [[photon]] even when no external perturbation of the atom is present.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;

==Electromagnetic properties==
{{See also|Lamb shift|Casimir effect|Spontaneous emission}}
[[File:The polarisation of light emitted by a neutron star.jpg|thumb|The polarization of the observed light in the extremely strong magnetic field suggests that the empty space around the neutron star is subject to the vacuum birefringence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Signs of Weird Quantum Property of Empty Space? – VLT observations of neutron star may confirm 80-year-old prediction about the vacuum|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1641/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As a result of quantization, the quantum electrodynamic vacuum can be considered as a material medium.&lt;ref name=medium/&gt; It is capable of [[vacuum polarization]].&lt;ref name=Weisskopf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeidler/&gt; In particular, the [[Coulomb's law|force law between charged particles]] is affected.&lt;ref name=Schroeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber/&gt; The electrical permittivity of quantum electrodynamic vacuum can be calculated, and it differs slightly from the simple {{math|[[electric constant|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]}} of the [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Likewise, its permeability can be calculated and differs slightly from {{math|[[magnetic constant|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]}}. This medium is a dielectric with relative dielectric constant &gt; 1, and is diamagnetic, with relative magnetic permeability &lt; 1.&lt;ref name= Donoghue/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bertulani/&gt; Under some extreme circumstances in which the field exceeds the [[Schwinger limit]] (for example, in the very high fields found in the exterior regions of [[pulsars]]&lt;ref name=Meszaros/&gt;), the quantum electrodynamic vacuum is thought to exhibit nonlinearity in the fields.&lt;ref name=Hartemann/&gt; Calculations also indicate birefringence and dichroism at high fields.&lt;ref name=Heyl/&gt;  Many of electromagnetic effects of the vacuum are small, and only recently have experiments been designed to enable the observation of nonlinear effects.&lt;ref name=nonlinear/&gt; [[PVLAS]] and other teams are working towards the needed sensitivity to detect QED effects.

==Attainability==
A perfect vacuum is itself only attainable in principle.&lt;ref name=Longo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dirac/&gt; It is an idealization, like [[absolute zero]] for temperature, that can be approached, but never actually realized:
{{quote|One reason [a vacuum is not empty] is that the walls of a vacuum chamber emit light in the form of black-body radiation...If this soup of photons is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the walls, it can be said to have a particular temperature, as well as a pressure. Another reason that perfect vacuum is impossible is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which states that no particles can ever have an exact position ...Each atom exists as a probability function of space, which has a certain nonzero value everywhere in a given volume. ...More fundamentally, quantum mechanics predicts ...a correction to the energy called the zero-point energy [that] consists of energies of virtual particles that have a brief existence. This is called ''vacuum fluctuation''.|Luciano Boi, "Creating the physical world ''ex nihilo''?" p. 55&lt;ref name=Longo/&gt;}}

Virtual particles make a ''perfect'' vacuum unrealizable, but leave open the question of attainability of a ''quantum electrodynamic vacuum'' or QED vacuum. Predictions of QED vacuum such as [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir effect]] and the [[Lamb shift]] have been experimentally verified, suggesting QED vacuum is a good model for a high quality realizable vacuum. There are competing theoretical models for vacuum, however. For example, [[QCD vacuum|quantum chromodynamic vacuum]] includes many virtual particles not treated in quantum electrodynamics. The vacuum of [[quantum gravity]] treats gravitational effects not included in the Standard Model.&lt;ref name=gravity/&gt; It remains an open question whether further refinements in experimental technique ultimately will support another model for realizable vacuum.

'''SAOCOM''' ('''S'''atélite '''A'''rgentino de '''O'''bservación '''CO'''n '''M'''icroondas, Spanish for Argentine Microwaves Observation Satellite) is an [[Earth observation satellite]] [[satellite constellation|constellation]] of [[Argentina|Argentina's]] [[space agency]] [[Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|CONAE]]. The first of two satellites is already orbiting the Earth in a polar orbit, while the second one is planned to be launched in 2019.

The [[Argentine]] [[microwave]] observation [[satellite]] '''SAOCOM 1A''' has been designed, produced, tested and operated by Argentinians within the framework of the National Space Plan. The mission will bring into space a complex Earth observation technology and is one of the most challenging technological projects ever developed in the country.

==Configuration==
The two satellites, '''SAOCOM 1A''' and '''SAOCOM 1B''', both are  equipped with an [[L band]]  (about 1.275&amp;nbsp;GHz) full polarimetric [[Synthetic Aperture Radar]] (SAR) to help predict and monitor the mitigation of natural disasters. Each satellite has a mass of {{convert|3000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=INVAP - SAOCOM satellites |url=http://saocom.invap.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dossier-SAOCOM-1A-english.pdf|accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
[[File:SAOCOM 1A - sala de integración - CEATSA - 072018 -22 0.jpg|thumb|SAOCOM 1A at [[CEATSA]] in July 2018]]

===Launch planning history===
 

The SAOCOM mission consists of putting into orbit two constellations, SAOCOM 1 and SAOCOM 2, the second series of which will incorporate certain technological advances resulting from the experience of the first. Each constellation is composed of two satellites, called A and B respectively, which are basically similar, due to the need to obtain an adequate revisit of the monitored Earth surface.
The SAOCOM satellites, together with four satellites of the Italian Constellation COSMO-SkyMed, belonging to the Italian Space Agency (ASI, in Italian), make up the Italian-Argentine Satellite System for Emergency Management (SIASGE, in Spanish), created by the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE, in Spanish) and ASI for the benefit of society, emergency management and economic development.,&lt;ref name='LaunchDate'&gt;{{cite web | first=Nora | last= Bär | url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/915280 | title = Hoy debuta la "superconstelación" ítalo-argentina | language=Spanish | publisher=[[La Nación]] | accessdate=2007-08-31 | date= June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to delays in the satellites' development, both launches were postponed for 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref name="SAOCOM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/press/2012/12/19/spacex-signs-argentinas-space-agency-two-falcon-9-launches |title=SPACEX SIGNS ARGENTINA'S SPACE AGENCY FOR TWO FALCON 9 LAUNCHES |publisher=Space Exploration Technologies Corp. |date=16 April 2009 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further delays pushed the launch dates back tentatively towards 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref name="manifest"&gt;{{cite web | title = Launch manifest | publisher = [[SpaceX]] | year = 2012 | url = http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php | accessdate = 2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, SAOCOM 1A was scheduled for launch in December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mission Summary - SAOCOM 1A |url=http://database.eohandbook.com/database/missionsummary.aspx?missionID=405 |publisher=[[Committee on Earth Observation Satellites|CEOS]] |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SAOCOM 1B in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mission Summary - SAOCOM 1B |url=http://database.eohandbook.com/database/missionsummary.aspx?missionID=452 |publisher=[[Committee on Earth Observation Satellites|CEOS]] |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the launch dates for 1A and 1B were further pushed back to October 2017 and October 2018.&lt;ref name='CONAELaunchDateApril2016'&gt;{{cite web | first= | last=  | url= http://www.conae.gov.ar/index.php/espanol/2016/834-revision-saocom-abril2016 | title= Exitosa Revisión de la Misión SAOCOM | language=Spanish | publisher=[[CONAE]] | accessdate= 2016-04-27 | date= April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, SAOCOM 1A was scheduled for launch on 7 October 2018&lt;ref name=sfn_ls&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/ |title=Launch schedule |work=SpaceFlight Now |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=August 27, 2018 |access-date=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SAOCOM 1B some time in 2019.&lt;ref name=saocom-20170908&gt;{{cite news |title=Agencias espaciales del mundo debatieron en Buenos Aires cómo prevenir catástrofes naturales |language=es |trans-title=Space agencies of the world will debate in Buenos Aires how to predict natural disasters |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/article/cumbre-en-buenos-aires-se-pueden-anticipar-catastrofes-naturales-con-informacion-satelital |work=[[Los Andes (Argentine newspaper)|Los Andes]] |date=8 September 2017 |access-date=23 September 2017 |quote=Este sistema ítalo-argentino estará completo cuando se lancen los dos satélites SAOCOM 1A y SAOCOM 1B, que serán puestos en órbita en junio de 2018 y a comienzos de 2019, respectivamente.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both satellites were to be launched on [[Falcon 9]] rockets&lt;ref&gt;http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; together with additional secondary payloads.&lt;ref&gt;http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/itasat-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch and operations===
SAOCOM 1A was launched on 8 October 2018, 02:21 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (7 October, 19:21 [[Pacific Time Zone | PDT]]). The satellite was deployed into a [[Sun-synchronous orbit]].&lt;ref name=nsf20181002&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/10/spacex-falcon-9-for-static-fire-saocom-1a-first-west-rtls/]&lt;/ref&gt;  The same orbit is planned to be used for SAOCOM 1B on a 2019 launch.

The Falcon 9 rocket booster landed as planned at [[Landing Zone 4]] at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], making it SpaceX's first land landing for a launch occurring on the [[West coast of the United States|Pacific coast]].&lt;ref name=nsf20181002/&gt; 

===SIASGE constellation===
The two satellites, also carry four [[X band]] (~9.6&amp;nbsp;GHz) SAR-equipped [[COSMO-SkyMed]] satellites from the [[Italian Space Agency]] (ASI), that will form the ''Italian-Argentine System of Satellites for Emergency Management'' ([[SIASGE]]) constellation.&lt;ref name='SIASGE'&gt;{{cite web | first=Daniel E. | last= Arias| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/915856 | title = Ya en órbita, el satélite Cosmo-Skymed da sus primeros signos de vida | language=Spanish | publisher=[[La Nación]] | accessdate=2007-08-31 | date=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A successful design review was held at the Argentinian space centre Teófilo Tabanera near the Cordoba City on 16 and 17 October 2012. In May 2015, the two agencies decided to expand the SIAGSE system by adding two additional COSMO-SkyMed satellites and two additional SAOCOM satellites, 2A and 2B.{{CN|date=October 2018}} This would raise the SIAGSE constellation total number of satellites to 10.

The '''subsolar point''' on a [[planet]] is the point at which its [[sun]] is perceived to be directly overhead (at the [[zenith]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |editor=Ian Ridpath |editor-link=Ian Ridpath |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Astronomy |article=subsolar point |year=1997 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-211596-0 |quote=The point on the Earth, or other body, at which the Sun is directly overhead at a particular time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, where the sun's [[ray (optics)|rays]] strike the planet exactly [[perpendicular]] to its surface. It can also mean the point closest to the sun on an [[astronomical object]], even though the sun might not be visible.
 
To an observer on a planet with an [[axial tilt|orientation]] and [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] similar to those of [[Earth]], the subsolar point will appear to move westward, completing one circuit around the [[globe]] each day, approximately moving along the [[equator]]. However, it will also move [[declination|north and south]] between the [[tropics]] over the course of a year, so it is spiraling like a [[helix]].

The subsolar point contacts the [[Tropic of Cancer]] on the [[June solstice]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] on the [[December solstice]]. The subsolar point crosses the Equator on the [[March equinox|March]] and [[September equinox]]es. 
 
When the point passes through [[Hawaii]], the only [[United States|U.S. state]] in which this happens, it is known as [[Lahaina Noon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Noon sun not directly overhead everywhere |author=Nancy Alima Ali |date=May 11, 2010 |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20100511_Noon_sun_not_directly_overhead_everywhere/ |accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tenorite''' is a [[copper]] [[oxide mineral]] with the simple formula [[CuO]]. 

==Occurrence==
[[File:Kupferschwärze (Tenorit) mit Azurit - Nischne Tagilsk, Ural.jpg|thumb|left|Tenorite with azurite from Nischne Tagilsk, Urals, Russia]]
Tenorite occurs in the weathered or [[oxidized]] zone associated with deeper primary [[copper sulfide]] orebodies. Tenorite commonly occurs with [[chrysocolla]] and the copper carbonates, [[azurite]] and [[malachite]]. The dull grey-black color of tenorite contrasts sharply with the often intergrown blue [[chrysocolla]]. [[Cuprite]], [[native copper]] and [[Iron oxide|Fe]]–[[Manganese oxide|Mn oxides]] also occur in this environment.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

In addition to the hydrothermal, tenorite also occurs as a [[volcanic sublimate]] from [[Vesuvius]], [[Campania]], and [[Mount Etna|Etna]], [[Sicily]], [[Italy]]. As a sublimate it occurs with copper chlorides, alkali chlorides and [[cotunnite]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; The Vesuvian sublimate occurrence was originally named ''melaconise'' or ''melaconite'' by [[F. S. Beudant]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tenorite was named in 1841 after the Italian botanist [[Michele Tenore]] (1780–1861).&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

'''''The Life of Vertebrates''''' is a noted biology textbook by [[John Zachary Young]]. 

The book grew out of the author's attempt to define what is meant by the life of vertebrates and by the evolution of that life. It combined an account of the embryology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, palaeontology, and ecology of all vertebrates and, the author argued, he has attempted via a documentation of the "central fact of biology, that life goes on", and to combine the results of the studies of these into a single work in which this continuity is maintained. It has been listed as the Book of A Lifetime by [[Colin Tudge]] who argues that the book might help humanity recover its humility and reverence in the face of nature rather than simply inspiring "awe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Young|first= J.

'''Sir Thomas Cavendish''' (19 September 1560&lt;ref name=Judkins&gt;Judkins, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; – May 1592) was an [[English people|English]] [[explorer]] and a [[privateer]] known as "The Navigator" because he was the first who deliberately tried to emulate Sir [[Francis Drake]] and raid the Spanish towns and ships in the Pacific and return by circumnavigating the globe. While members of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s, [[García Jofre de Loaísa|Loaisa]]'s, Drake's, and [[Martín Ignacio de Loyola|Loyola]]'s expeditions had preceded Cavendish in circumnavigating the globe, it had not been their intent at the outset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Derek|title=The Circumnavigators|year=2003|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|isbn=978-0-7867-1150-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vXqQQ9oyem0C&amp;pg=PA50|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first trip and successful circumnavigation made him rich from captured Spanish gold, silk and treasure from the Pacific and the [[Philippines]]. His richest prize was the captured 600 ton [[sailing ship]] the [[Manila Galleon]] ''Santa Ana'' (also called ''Santa Anna''). He was knighted by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] after his return. He later set out for a second raiding and circumnavigation trip but was not as fortunate and died at sea at the age of 31.

==Early life==
Cavendish was born in 1560 at [[Trimley St Martin]] near [[Ipswich, Suffolk]], England. His father was William Cavendish, a descendant of Roger Cavendish, brother to Sir [[John Cavendish]] from whom the [[Duke of Devonshire|Dukes of Devonshire]] and the Dukes of Newcastle derive their family name of Cavendish.

When Thomas Cavendish was 12 he inherited a fortune from his father's estate. At the age of 15 he entered [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], remaining for two years, but did not take a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CVNS576T|name=Cavendish, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school at age 17, he spent most of the next 8 years or so in luxurious living. He was a Member of Parliament for [[Shaftesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Shaftesbury]], [[Dorset]], in 1584. In 1585 he sailed with [[Sir Richard Grenville]] to aid in the colonization of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], gaining much valuable experience but losing money on his investments. He was a member of Parliament for [[Wilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Wilton]], 1586.

==First voyage: a successful westbound circumnavigation==
By July 1586 [[Spain]] and [[England]] were in a war which would culminate with the [[Spanish Armada]] and its threatened invasion of England in 1588. Cavendish determined to follow [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] by raiding the Spanish ports and ships in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and circumnavigating the globe. After getting permission for his proposed raids, Cavendish built a 120-ton [[sailing ship]], with 18 [[cannons]], named the ''[[Desire (ship)|Desire]]''. He was joined by the 60 ton, 10 cannon, ship ''Content'', and the 40 ton ship ''Hugh Gallant''.

===Departure and Atlantic crossing===
With his three ships and 123 men he set out from [[Plymouth, England]] on 21 July 1586 and reached the [[Strait of Magellan]] on 6 January 1587.

He anchored first at the island of Santa Magdalena near present-day [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]]. There, in two hours, they killed and salted two barrelfuls of [[penguin]]s for food. After extensive exploration of the many inlets, labyrinths, and intricate channels of the islands and broken lands of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and its environs they emerged from the strait into the Pacific on 24 February and sailed up the coast of South America.

===Exploring and raiding off the west coast of South America===
There on the Pacific coast he sank or captured 9 Spanish ships and looted several towns of quantities of fresh food, supplies and treasure while intentionally sinking the ship ''Hugh Gallant'' to use her crew to replace crew members lost on his other ships. According to [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s 'Voyages' he raided an island on the coast of Ecuador (probably Isla Puna) but was repulsed with loss by local forces.

===Capturing a Manila galleon===
A pilot from one of the captured Spanish ships revealed that a [[Manila galleon]] was expected in October or November 1587 and usually stopped at [[Cape San Lucas]] on the [[Baja California]] peninsula before going on to [[Acapulco]]. The Manila galleons were restricted by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Monarch]] to one or two ships/year and typically carried all the goods accumulated in the [[Philippines]] in a year's worth of trading silver, from the Mints in [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]], with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and others, for spices, silk, gold and other expensive goods. In 1587 there were two Manila galleons: the ''San Francisco'' and the ''Santa Ana''. Unfortunately both encountered a [[typhoon]] on leaving the [[Philippines]] and were wrecked on the coast of [[Japan]]. Only the ''Santa Ana'' was salvageable and after repairs resumed her voyage.

[[File:North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The North Pacific currents and winds used by both the [[Manila Galleon]] and Cavendish to get to [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]]--the [[North Pacific Gyre]]]]
Upon reaching the [[Gulf of California]] in October 1587 Cavendish and his two ships put in at an island above [[Mazatlan]] where they [[Careening|careened]] their ships to clean their bottoms and made general repairs. They had to dig wells for water. They sailed for [[Cape San Lucas]] on the [[Baja Peninsula]] and set up patrols to see if they could spot the Manila galleon. Early on 4 November 1587 one of Cavendish's lookouts spotted the 600 ton galleon manned with over 200 men. After a several hour chase the English ships overhauled the ''Santa Ana''—which conveniently had no cannons on board, in order to carry the added cargo. After several hours of battle during which Cavendish used his cannon to fire ball and grape shot into the galleon while the Spanish tried to fight back with small arms, the ''Santa Ana'', now starting to sink, finally struck her colours and surrendered.

Because of the great disparity in size the ''Content'' and ''Desire'' had to pick and choose what rich cargo they wanted to transfer to their ships from the much larger ''Santa Ana''. One hundred and ninety Spaniards (including [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] (1548–1624), later explorer of the California coast), and Filipino crewmen, were set ashore with food and some weapons in a location where they had water and food available. Cavendish kept with him two [[Japanese people|Japanese]] sailors, three boys from [[Manila]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traveler familiar with [[China]], and a Spanish [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] ([[navigator]]). They loaded all the gold (about 100 [[Troy weight|troy pounds]] or 122,000 pesos worth) and then picked through the silks, [[damask]]s, [[musk]]s (used in [[perfume]] manufacture), [[spice]]s, wines, and ship's supplies for what they could carry. Some in Mexico claimed that the total value of the cargo was about 2,000,000 pesos. After setting fire to the ''Santa Ana'', the ''Desire'' and ''Content'' sailed away on 17 November 1587 to begin their voyage across the Pacific Ocean.

While burning, the ''Santa Ana'' drifted onto the coast where the Spanish survivors extinguished the flames, re-floated the ship and limped into Acapulco.

The ''Content'' was never heard from again. The ''Desire'' tried to avoid conflict for the rest of her voyage.

===Crossing the Pacific Ocean and exploring the islands of South-east Asia===
After crossing the Pacific Ocean, Cavendish and the ''Desire'' arrived at the island of [[Guam]] on 3 January 1588. There he traded iron tools for fresh supplies, water and wood, supplied by the natives. On further landings in the [[Philippines]], [[Java]] and other islands, he traded some of his captured linen and other goods for fresh supplies, water and wood, and collected information about the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese coasts. He hoped to use this information to augment existing English knowledge of the area and for a possible second voyage. His crew of about 48 men replaced their worn out clothing and bedding with uniforms made out of silken [[damask]].
Cavendish attacked [[Arevalo, Iloilo City |Arevalo]], the capital of the Spanish settlement in [[Iloilo]] at the time in 1587 with the raid giving the town the distinction of being the first Spanish settlement in the Philippines to be attacked by a British pirate. It was also the first recorded British incursion into Philippine waters.

===Return to England===
By 14 May 1588 Cavendish reached the coast of Africa and returned to England by way of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], stopping at the island of [[Saint Helena]] for supplies.&lt;ref&gt;http://sainthelenaisland.info/famousvisitors.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1588 the ''Desire'' sailed into the harbor at [[Plymouth, England]]. Later she paraded up the [[River Thames]] through [[London]], displaying her new sails of blue [[damask]].

Cavendish's first voyage was a huge success both financially and otherwise; Cavendish was not yet 28 at his return. The circumnavigation of the globe had been completed in two years and 49 days, nine months faster than Drake, although, like Drake, Cavendish returned with only one of his ships—the ''Desire'' with a crew of about 48 men. He was knighted by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], who was invited to a dinner aboard the ''Desire''. England celebrated both the return of the ''Desire'' and the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;

==Second voyage and death==
Cavendish sailed on a second expedition in August 1591, accompanied by the navigator [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]]. They went further south to the Strait of Magellan and then returned to [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], where they hid and reprovisioned in [[Ilhabela]] and looted [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] and [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dória|first1=Palmério|title=O Príncipe da Privataria|date=2013|publisher=[[Geração Editorial]]|location=São Paulo|isbn=978-85-8130-201-0|page=274|edition=1|language=Portuguese|chapter="Só um bobo dá a telefonia para estrangeiros"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going further north, they lost most of the crew in a battle against the Portuguese at the Village of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]] today the capital of the State of Espirito Santo. One abandoned sailor, [[Anthony Knivet]], later wrote about his adventures in Brazil. Cavendish set off across the Atlantic towards [[Saint Helena]] with the remainder of the crew, but died of unknown causes at age 31, possibly off [[Ascension Island]] in the South Atlantic in 1592. The last letter of Cavendish, written to his executor a few days before his death, accuses John Davis of being a "villain" who caused the "decay of the whole action".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Treasure, Ian Dawson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Czq-f-9cLSsC&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;ots=UVRt_iGmzK&amp;dq=cavendish%20last%20letter&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q=cavendish%20last%20letter&amp;f=false Who's who in British history: beginnings to 1901. A-H, Volume 1], Thomas Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt; John Davis continued on with Cavendish's crew and ships and discovered the [[Falkland Islands]], before returning to England with most of his crew lost to starvation and illness.

==In popular culture==
Cavendish is the central figure in the historical novel ''Captain for Elizabeth'' by [[Jan Westcott]], which follows the events of his first circumnavigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/captain-for-elizabeth/oclc/50700810?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Captain for Elizabeth|date=2014|publisher=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cavendish tobacco]], a popular pipe tobacco, is named after Sir Thomas Cavendish

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8665">A '''vacuum flange''' is a [[flange]] at the end of a tube used to connect [[vacuum chamber]]s, tubing and [[vacuum pump]]s to each other. Vacuum flanges are used for scientific and industrial applications to allow various pieces of equipment to interact via physical connections and for vacuum maintenance, monitoring, and manipulation from outside a vacuum's chamber. Several flange standards exist with differences in ultimate attainable [[pressure]], size, and ease of attachment.

==Vacuum flange types==

===KF/QF===
[[File:KF 25 Tee.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A KF-25 tee, o-ring, and clamp]]
The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard quick release flange is known by the names Quick Flange (QF), Klein Flange (KF) or NW, sometimes also as DN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_kf_1.cfm?pgid=0 |title=KF (QF) Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02 |publisher= Kurt J. Lesker Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KF designation has been adopted by ISO, [[DIN]], and [[Pneurop]]. KF flanges are made with a [[chamfer]]ed back surface that are attached with a circular clamp and an [[elastomer]]ic [[o-ring]] that is mounted in a metal centering ring. Standard sizes are indicated by the nominal inner diameter in millimeters for flanges 10 through 50&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="caburn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caburn.com/resources/downloads/pdfs/sec1.2.pdf |title=ISO KF Flanges and Fittings |accessdate=2007-09-02 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizes 10, 20 and 32 are less common sizes (see [[Preferred_number#Reynard_numbers|Reynard numbers]]). Some sizes share their flange dimensions with their respective larger neighbor and use the same clamp size. This means a DN10KF can mate to a DN16KF by using an adaptive centering ring. The same applies for DN20KF to DN25KF and DN32KF to DN40KF.
:
* DN10KF
* DN16KF
* DN20KF
* DN25KF
* DN32KF
* DN40KF
* DN50KF

===ISO===
The ISO large flange standard is known as LF, LFB, MF or sometimes just ISO flange. As in KF-flanges, the flanges are joined by a centering ring and an elastomeric o-ring. An extra spring-loaded circular clamp is often used around the large-diameter o-rings to prevent them from rolling off from the centering ring during mounting.

The ISO large flanges come in two varieties. The ISO-K (or ISO LF) flanges are joined with double-claw clamps, which clamp to a circular groove on the tubing side of the flange. The ISO-F (or ISO LFB) flanges have holes for attaching the two flanges with bolts. Two tubes with ISO-K and ISO-F flanges can be joined together by clamping the ISO-K side with single-claw clamps, which are then bolted to the holes on the ISO-F side.

ISO large flanges are available in sizes from 63 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm nominal tube diameter:&lt;ref name="caburn"/&gt;
* DN63LF (63.5&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN100LF (102&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN160LF (160&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN200LF (200&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN250LF (254&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN320LF (316&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN400LF (400&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN500LF (500&amp;nbsp;mm)

===CF (Conflat)===
[[File:Conflat Flange.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A 2¾ CF (conflat) full nipple with blank flange and [[Oxygen-free copper|OFHC]] gasket]]
[[File:60kV Feedthrough.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A 60 kV [[high-voltage]] electrical feedthrough on a 4½ inch (or DN63) conflat flange]]
Several vacuum flange [[technical standard|standard]]s exist, and the same flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and [[standards organization]]s.
CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an [[ultrahigh vacuum]] seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_conflat_1.cfm |title=CF Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ConFlat" is a registered trademark of [[Varian, Inc.]], so "CF" is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during [[bake-out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avs.org/About/Awards-Recognition/Awardee-Interviews/Interviews/William-R-Wheeler/Interview-Transcript |title=AVS Interview: 1996 Albert Nerken Award Recipient: William R. Wheeler  |author=Daniel Bills |date=1996-10-06 |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450&amp;nbsp;°C can be achieved; the temperature is limited by the choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.

ConFlat gaskets were originally invented by William Wheeler and other engineers at Varian in an attempt to build a flange that would not leak after baking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avs.org/popup.aspx?FileName=wheeler_int|title=AVS Interview: 1996 Albert Nerken Award Recipient: William R. Wheeler |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheeler===
A Wheeler flange is a large wire-seal flange often used on large vacuum chambers.&lt;ref&gt;''Metal Vacuum Joint'', William R. Wheeler, Varian Associates, {{Cite patent|US|3458221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASA===
[[ANSI]] has a flange standard called ASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_asa_1.cfm?pgid=0 |title=ASA Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These flanges are elastomeric o-ring seal and can be used for both vacuum and pressure applications.  Flange sizes are indicated by tube nominal inner diameter or by flange outer diameter (in inches):  1 (4.25 O.D.), 1.5 (5.00 O.D.), 2 (6.00 O.D.), 3 (7.50 O.D.), 4 (9.00 O.D.), 6 (11.00 O.D.), 8 (13.5 O.D.), 10 (16.00 O.D.).

==Vacuum gaskets==
To achieve a vacuum seal, a [[gasket]] is required. An elastomeric [[o-ring]] gasket can be made of [[Buna rubber]], [[viton]] fluoropolymer, [[silicone rubber]] or [[teflon]]. O-rings can be placed in a groove or may be used in combination with a centering ring or as a "captured" o-ring that is held in place by separate metal rings. Metal gaskets are used in ultra-high vacuum systems where the [[outgassing]] of the elastomer could be a significant gas load. A copper ring gasket is used with conflat flanges. Metal wire gaskets made of copper, [[gold]] or [[indium]] can be used.

==Vacuum feedthrough==
A vacuum feedthrough is a flange that contains a vacuum-tight electrical, physical or mechanical connection to the vacuum chamber. An electrical feedthrough allows voltages to be applied to components under vacuum, for example a [[Electrical filament|filament]] or [[heater]]. An example of a physical feedthrough is a vacuum-tight connection for cooling water. A mechanical feedthrough is used for [[rotation]] and [[translation_(geometry)|translation]] of components under vacuum. A wobble stick is a mechanical feedthrough device that can be used to pick up, move and otherwise manipulate objects in the vacuum chamber.
