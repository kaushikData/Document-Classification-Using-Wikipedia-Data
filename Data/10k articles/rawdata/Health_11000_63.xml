The '''2011 United States listeriosis outbreak''' was a widespread outbreak of [[Listeriosis|''Listeria monocytogenes'' food poisoning]] across 28 US states that resulted from contaminated [[cantaloupe]]s linked to Jensen Farms of [[Holly, Colorado]]. As of the final report on August 27, 2012, there were 33 deaths and 147 total confirmed cases since the beginning of the first recorded case on July 31, 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cantaloupes-jensen-farms/index.html|title=Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Linked to Whole Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms, Colorado {{!}} Listeria {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the worst [[foodborne illness]] outbreak in the United States, measured by the number of deaths, since the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] began tracking outbreaks in the 1970s, or tied with the worst, an [[1985 California listeriosis outbreak in cheese|outbreak of listeria from cheese]] in 1985, depending on which CDC report is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=JANE E.

==Origin and spread==
[[Image:Listeria monocytogenes PHIL 2287 lores.jpg|left|150px|thumb|''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', the bacterium responsible for [[listeriosis]]]]
Listeriosis is an infection caused by the bacterium ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''. The outbreak was determined to originate from Jensen Farms in [[Holly, Colorado]] after ''Listeria monocytogenes'' was found in cantaloupe samples at a Jensen Farms store in [[Denver]], Colorado and at the farm's packaging plant. The batch of cantaloupes had been shipped out over a period from July 29 through September 10 to twenty-five states, including Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Listeria-cantaloupe-linked deaths rise to 16 |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/27/health/main20112512.shtml |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak was first reported by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] on September 12, where they stated that "fifteen people in four states had been infected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cantaloupe-related outbreak of illness linked to 13 deaths |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/27/health/cantaloupe-deaths/ |publisher=CNN |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, a new report was released by the CDC, bringing the number of deaths to 13 and the number of confirmed cases to 72. The report also stated that further deaths were being investigated to determine if they had also been caused by Listeria infection. The CDC report also stated that, as Listeria "only sickens the elderly, pregnant women and others with compromised immune systems", the [[median]] age of all the people that had been infected was 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cantaloupe outbreak is deadliest in a decade |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/fitness-food/safety/story/2011-09-27/Cantaloupe-outbreak-could-be-deadliest-in-a-decade/50572084/1 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, an update was released by the CDC, reporting that as of 11&amp;nbsp;am (EDT) Sep 29, 2011 the number of confirmed cases was 84, number of deaths was 15 and the number of states involved was 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Listeriosis toll rises to 15 dead, 84 sickened |author=Elizabeth Weise |url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/fitness-food/safety/story/2011-09-30/Listeriosis-toll-rises-to-15-dead-84-sickened/50619282/1 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, the CDC updated their report to 100 infected individuals in 20 states and a total of 18 deaths from the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health officials say listeria in cantaloupe is linked to 18 deaths in 8 states |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/health-officials-say-listeria-in-cantaloupe-is-linked-to-18-deaths-in-8-states/2011/10/04/gIQAmeueLL_story.html |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak was shown to have continued to spread to new states, with the CDC update on October 7 stating that the number of cases had risen to 109 in 23 states and that three more people had died to bring the death toll to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Death toll in listeriosis outbreak now at 21 |author=Elizabeth Weise |url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/fitness-food/safety/story/2011-10-07/Death-toll-in-listeriosis-outbreak-now-at-21/50690402/1 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC update on October 12 put the number of cases at 116 with 23 deaths.&lt;ref name=suffer&gt;{{cite news |title=Listeria Deaths Confirmed In Louisiana Too |url=http://www.rttnews.com/Content/BiotechStory.aspx?Id=1730937&amp;Category=FDARecall |quote=Including the Louisiana cases, the listeria outbreak in the United States that started in late July has claimed 23 lives.

Fatalities occurred in Colorado (9), Indiana (1), Kansas (3), Louisiana (2), Maryland (1), Missouri (3), Montana (1) Nebraska (1), New Mexico (5), New York (2), Oklahoma (1), Texas (2), and Wyoming (2). Among persons who died, ages ranged from &lt;1 to 96 years, with a median age of 78 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, one woman pregnant at the time of illness had a miscarriage.&lt;ref name=latest/&gt;

Listeria infections can cause pregnant women to miscarry; the first [[miscarriage]] attributed to the 2011 outbreak was reported in early October, in a woman living in Iowa. Pregnant women often are advised to avoid foods, such as [[pasteurization|unpasteurized]] cheese and [[hot dog]]s, that are known to have the potential to carry Listeria, but fruits such as cantaloupe had not previously been identified as sources of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman's miscarriage blamed on listeria-tainted cantaloupe |author=JoNel Aleccia |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44790290/ns/health-food_safety/#.Tpd-jd5fbvM |newspaper=[[MSNBC]] |date=October 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No list of retailers selling the infected cantaloupes was released by either the government or Jensen Farms. Although the last shipment was September 10 and the fruit had a two-week shelf life, as of September 29, the number of illnesses and deaths were expected to continue rising, because the incubation period could exceed one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cantaloupe deaths and illnesses: CDC on ways to combat |author=Mary Clare Jalonick |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0929/Cantaloupe-deaths-and-illnesses-CDC-on-ways-to-combat |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDA investigation===
An investigation by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) found that the contaminated cantaloupe harvest contained four separate ''Listeria monocytogenes'' strains, which the governmental agency found to be "unusual", but was still trying to determine the reason.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; On October 20, it was reported that the FDA officials had found listeria on dirty, corroded equipment used by Jensen Farms, which had been bought used and was previously utilized for potato farming. It was stated by the government that the "equipment's past use may have played a role in the contamination".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/10/19/fda-contaminated-equipment-to-blame-for-listeria-outbreak&lt;/ref&gt; Water contaminated with listeria was also found on the floor of the packing plant and it was determined that the workers moving around the plant had spread it, as the contaminated water was also found on the cantaloupe [[conveyor belt]]. It was noted by officials that Jensen Farms had "passed a food safety audit by an outside contractor" six days before the outbreak.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Listeria Outbreak Traced to Cantaloupe Packing Shed |author=William Neuman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/business/listeria-outbreak-traced-to-colorado-cantaloupe-packing-shed.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of how the listeria bacteria first came to be in the plant remains unknown, as the soil on the farm was determined to be clear of the bacteria. It is suspected, however, that a "dump truck used to take culled melons to a cattle farm...could have brought bacteria to the facility".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lactaoen|first=Derek|title=FDA Announces Investigation Results from Listeria-Contaminated Cantaloupe|url=http://blog.consumerbell.com/2011/10/19/consumer-recall-safety-fda-announces-investigation-results-from-listeria-contaminated-cantaloupe/|publisher=ConsumerBell|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Bacteria growth may have been caused by condensation stemming from the lack of a pre-cooling step to remove field heat from the cantaloupe before cold storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/CORENetwork/ucm272372.htm#report US FDA Information on the Recalled Jensen Farms Whole Cantaloupes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation===
On October 21, the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]], a committee panel of the [[United States House of Representatives]], began its own investigation into the outbreak. The Committee "requested a staff briefing from Jensen Farms" and all of the documents they had on the incident. They also requested information from the FDA, CDC, and other governmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House panel probes listeria-tainted cantaloupes |author=Michael Muskal |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/10/house-panel-probes-listeria-tainted-cantaloupes-.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jensen Farms response==
In response to the initial reports by the CDC on the contaminated cantaloupe, Jensen Farms issued a voluntary recall on September 15 of the entire harvest crop of 300,000 cantaloupe that it had distributed to its chain stores. The FDA made the public announcement for the recall after Listeria infection was confirmed by Jensen Farms at its main Colorado branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Listeria Recall: Cantaloupes From Colorado Farm Pulled From Shelves |author=Enjoli Francis |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Food/listeria-recall-cantaloupes-colorado-farm-pulled-shelves-company/story?id=14528532 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen Farms was also forced to temporarily shut down its processing plant while the recall is ongoing.&lt;ref name="7NEWS"/&gt; Government officials have been investigating the company's main facility in Colorado to determine if there was "animal or water contamination", but there have been no results from the investigation thus far.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |title=CDC: Cantaloupe Listeria Outbreak Deadliest in a Decade |author=Christina Caron |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-listeria-outbreak-deadliest-decade/story?id=14622507 |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holly, Colorado]] residents were described as being left "reeling and in fear" because of the disaster for its local producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fear in Colo. town at heart of Listeria outbreak |author=P.

==Political responses==
The FDA has stated in response to the extensive bacterial outbreak that it is "yet another reason to fully implement the [[Food Safety Modernization Act]]." Sherri McGarry, a senior adviser for the FDA, stated that, "We're going to take these lessons learned, share that with our partners and industries, CDC and the states, and what we want to do is we want to really prevent this from happening in the future."&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

Also, in response to an auditor passing Jensen Farms food safety methods and failing to notice the listeria bacteria in the plant, the deputy commissioner of foods, Michael R. Taylor, had stated that he intended to "establish standards for how auditors should be trained and how audits should be conducted."&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
On September 15, a lawsuit was filed against Jensen Farms by the first victim of the contaminated cantaloupe crop, who had fallen ill and been kept in the hospital for several weeks. He and his wife were involved in the legal proceedings.&lt;ref name="7NEWS"&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive: Jensen Farms React To Lawsuit, Recall |author1=Deb Stanley |author2=Kim Nguyen |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/29191856/detail.html |newspaper=[[7NEWS]] |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jensen Farms, the couple also sued a [[Walmart]] branch in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], where they had bought the cantaloupe, for selling unsafe food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man sues Colo. farm, Walmart over cantaloupe Listeria |author=Jon Bowman |url=http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-colo-farm-walmart-sued-over-cantaloupe-listeria-20110915,0,5101456.story |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114095510/http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-colo-farm-walmart-sued-over-cantaloupe-listeria-20110915%2C0%2C5101456.story |archive-date=November 14, 2011 |newspaper=[[KDVR]] |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Action Damien''' (in French) or '''Damiaanactie''' (in Dutch) is a national Belgian NGO, founded in 1964 under the name '''Les amis du père Damien''' ("Friends of [[Father Damien]]"). At its first founding, people and groups in Belgium were organizing the "World Leprosy Day", created by Raoul Follereau. The organization would later be called '''Fondation Damien''', before taking its current names in January 2008. Pluralist and non-denominational, Action Damien / Damiaanactie is now active in 13 countries in the world. Thanks to its {{formatnum:1200}} local workers ( for about ten expatriates), the organization detects and gives every year a treatment to 250 000 people sick with leprosy, [[tuberculosis]], and [[leishmaniosis]].

Every year in Belgium, with the help of hundreds or even thousands of volunteers, Action Damien / Damiaanactie organizes an awareness and fund-raising campaign during the last weekend of January. The donations, received throughout the year, cover more than the half of its expenses. Action Damien / Damiaanactie works within the framework of International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP) (Action Damien contributed to its foundation). Action Damien / Damiaanactie always works at the request of local authorities.

== The big names ==
Action Damien draws its inspiration from three great people. First, [[Raoul Follereau]] (the "Advocate of the Lepers") was a journalist, a philosopher, a lawyer and a writer who spent most of his life speaking out on behalf of all those with leprosy. He initiated World Leprosy Day. Second, Frans Hemerijcks (the "Doctor of the Lepers") was a Belgian doctor, specialized in leprosy, who invented the concept of a "Clinic under the trees" (rather than isolate those with leprosy from their loved ones, it was better to treat them within their communities). Third, Father Damien (the "Apostle of the Lepers"), is without doubt the first person to have seen the human being alongside the sick one, during his life at Molokai.

[[Image:AS17-145-22157.png|thumb|right|During an Apollo 17 EVA, [[Lunar soil|lunar dusts]] is obviously seen to cling to astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] while he uses an adjustable sampling scoop to retrieve lunar samples. Efforts to understand the properties of lunar dust and to prevent its introduction into vehicles and habitats will minimize the risk of inhalation, dermal, and ocular injuries on future lunar missions.]]

The respirable fraction of [[Lunar soil|lunar dusts]] may be toxic to humans. [[NASA]] has therefore determined that an exposure standard is necessary to limit the amount of respirable airborne lunar dusts to which astronauts will be exposed. The nominal [[toxicity]] that is expected from ordinary [[mineral dust]] may be increased for [[Lunar soil|lunar dusts]] due to the large and [[chemically reactive]] surfaces of the dust grains. Human exposures to [[mineral dust]]s during industrial operations and from [[volcanic eruptions]] give researchers some sense of the relative toxicity of lunar dust, although the [[Human analog missions|Earth-based analogs]] have serious limitations. Animal and cellular studies provide further evidence that mineral dusts can be somewhat toxic. Earth-based research of mineral dust has shown that freshly fractured surfaces are chemically reactive and can elicit an increased toxic response. Since lunar dust is formed in [[space vacuum]] from highly energetic processes, the grain surfaces can be expected to be indefinitely reactive on the [[lunar surface]]. NASA predicts that this chemical reactivity will change once the dust is brought into a habitable environment.

Dust from lunar soil that was carried into spacecraft during the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]] proved to be a nuisance. The lack of [[gravity]], or the existence of [[microgravity|gravity at a small fraction of the gravitational force of the Earth]], increases the time during which dust remains airborne, thereby increasing the probability that these dust particles will be inhaled. Lunar dust particles that are generated by impaction in a deep vacuum have complex shapes and highly reactive surfaces that are coated with a thin layer of vapor-deposited mineral phase. Airborne mineral dust in a variety of forms has been shown to present a serious health hazard to ground-based workers. The health hazards that are associated with [[volcanic ash]], which is a commonly used analog of lunar dust, have not been reported to be especially serious; however, this type of ash quickly loses its reactive surfaces and is often aggregated into particles that are not readily respirable into the deep lung. Crew members who will be at a lunar outpost can be directly exposed to lunar dust in several ways. After crew members perform [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks or EVAs]], they will introduce into the habitat a large quantity of dust that will have collected on [[space suit|spacesuits]] and boots. Cleaning of the suits between EVAs and changing of the [[Life support system|Environmental Control Life Support System (ECLSS)]] filters are other operations that could result in direct exposure to lunar dusts. In addition, if the final spacesuit design is based on the current spacesuit design, EVAs may cause dermal injuries, and the introduction of lunar dusts into the suits' interior, which may enhance skin abrasions. When the crew leaves the lunar surface and returns to microgravity, the dust that is introduced into the crew return vehicle will "float," thus increasing the opportunity for ocular and respiratory injury.

==Introduction==
{{Update|section|date=December 2016}}
In 2004, [[George w bush|President George W. Bush]] unveiled a plan directing NASA to return humans to the moon by the year 2015, and to use the [[lunar outpost]] as a stepping-stone for future human trips to Mars and beyond.&lt;ref name=2015moonland&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush outlines plan for 2015 moon landing|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2004-01/15/content_299037.htm|publisher=chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet this objective, NASA will build an outpost on the [[lunar south pole|lunar surface near the south pole]] for long-duration human habitation and research. Because of the various activities that will require the [[astronauts]] to go in and out of this habitat on numerous spacewalks (EVAs), the living quarters at the lunar outpost are expected to be contaminated by lunar dust.

The president's ''[[Vision for Space Exploration]]'' and charge to return to the moon have resulted in questions about health hazards from exposure to lunar dust. Lunar dust resides in near-vacuum conditions, so the grain surfaces are covered in "unsatisfied" chemical bonds, thus making them very reactive.&lt;ref name="Taylor and James (2006)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=L|title=Potential toxicity of lunar dust|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/roundtable2006/pdf/1008.pdf|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|author2=James, J|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the reactive dust is inhaled, it can be expected to react with [[Pulmonary surfactant|lung surfactant]] and pulmonary cells. The fine, respirable lunar dust could thus be toxic if the astronauts are exposed to it during mission operations at a lunar base. Although a few early attempts were made to understand the toxicity of the lunar dust that was obtained by the Apollo astronauts or the [[Luna probes]], no scientifically defensible toxicological studies have been performed on authentic lunar dust.

Awareness of the toxicity of terrestrial dusts has increased greatly since the original Apollo flights, which occurred circa 1970, in which the crew members were exposed to lunar dust for a relatively brief time. The first National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1971 and was indexed to total suspended particles (TSP) on a mass per unit volume basis. In 1987, this NAAQS was refined to include only particles that were of less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) because this was the size that was most likely to reach the bronchial tree and deeper into the lung. Finally, in 1997, the EPA Administrator issued standards for particles that were less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) based primarily on epidemiological associations of increased mortality, exacerbation of asthma, and increased hospital admissions for cardiopulmonary symptoms. None of these standards specified the composition of the particles. In fact, the last standard was a bit contentious because mechanisms of toxic action were not understood.&lt;ref name="NRC (1998)"&gt;{{cite book|author=((National Research Council, Committee on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter, Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, Commission on Life Sciences, Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources))|title=Research priorities for airborne particulate matter|year=1998|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-06094-3|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review article, Schlesinger et al. list the properties of particulate matter that might elicit adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger et al (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlesinger|first=RB|author2=Kunzli, N|author3= Hidy, GM|author4= Gotschi, T|author5= Jerrett, M|title=The health relevance of ambient particulate matter characteristics: coherence of toxicological and epidemiological inferences.|journal=Inhalation toxicology|date=February 2006|volume=18|issue=2|pages=95–125|pmid=16393926|doi=10.1080/08958370500306016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The properties that seem pertinent to lunar dust include: size distribution, mass concentration, particle surface area, number concentration, acidity, particle surface chemistry, particle reactivity, metal content, water solubility, and geometric form. In attempting to consider each of these properties, one property emerges as the most difficult to study; particle surface chemistry may be difficult to understand because the environment on the lunar surface is unlike any on Earth, and is likely to alter the surface of dust grains in a way that will render them highly reactive. Recreating the processes that could affect grain surface reactivity on the moon is difficult in an Earth-bound laboratory. Freshly fractured quartz is distinctly more toxic to the rat respiratory system than aged quartz.&lt;ref name="Vallyathan et al 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vallyathan|first=V|author2=Castranova, V|author3=Pack, D|author4=Leonard, S|author5=Shumaker, J|author6=Hubbs, AF|author7=Shoemaker, DA|author8=Ramsey, DM|author9=Pretty, JR|author10= McLaurin, JL|title=Freshly fractured quartz inhalation leads to enhanced lung injury and inflammation. Potential role of free radicals.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=September 1995|volume=152|issue=3|pages=1003–9|pmid=7663775|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.152.3.7663775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quartz and lunar dust may have similar toxic properties, but breaking of surface bonds on mineral substrates has been shown to increase the toxicity of the well-studied mineral quartz.

The site at which various sizes of particles are deposited is critical to an understanding of any aspect of their toxic action. The fractional regional deposition of particles shows that between 10 and 1 μm, the portion of particles that is deposited in the upper airways falls off from 80% to 20%, whereas the pulmonary deposition increases from near zero to about 20%. Pulmonary deposition, after falling off near 1 μm, peaks again near 40% for particles of 0.03 μm, whereas upper airway deposition remains low until a new peak deposition is found at less than 0.01 μm. The portion and pattern of deposition can be modified under conditions of reduced gravity; however, human data during flights of the gravity research aircraft show that particles in the 0.5 to 1 μm range are deposited less in the respiratory system at lunar gravity than at Earth gravity. This finding is consistent with the reduced sedimentation of the particles when the gravity is less. However, a larger portion of the particles is deposited peripherally in reduced gravity.&lt;ref name="Darquenne and Prisk 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darquenne|first=C|author2=Prisk, GK|title=Deposition of inhaled particles in the human lung is more peripheral in lunar than in normal gravity.|journal=European journal of applied physiology|date=August 2008|volume=103|issue=6|pages=687–95|pmid=18488244|doi=10.1007/s00421-008-0766-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first encounter in which a particle deposits in the distal airways occurs with the broncho-alveolar lining fluid (BALF). The thickness of this fluid in the lung varies as the alveolar sacs expand and contract, but lies in the range of 0.1 to 0.9 μm.&lt;ref name="Bastacky et al 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastacky|first=J|author2=Lee, CY|author3=Goerke, J|author4=Koushafar, H|author5=Yager, D|author6=Kenaga, L|author7=Speed, TP|author8=Chen, Y|author9= Clements, JA|title=Alveolar lining layer is thin and continuous: low-temperature scanning electron microscopy of rat lung|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=November 1995|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1615–28|pmid=8594022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of biological particles such as bacteria, this fluid opsonizes the particles to facilitate ingestion by macrophages. A similar process has been demonstrated for nonbiological carbonaceous particles.&lt;ref name="Kendall et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendall|first=Michaela|author2=Brown, Leslie|author3= Trought, Katherine|title=Molecular Adsorption at Particle Surfaces: A PM Toxicity Mediation Mechanism|journal=Inhalation Toxicology|volume=16|issue=s1|pages=99–105|doi=10.1080/08958370490443187|date=1 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process removes some components of the BALF that participate in opsonization, and it is postulated that this might enhance the toxicity of particles with a surface chemistry that is capable of selectively removing opsonizing components. The agglomeration of the grains is also affected by the interactions between the BALF and the grains. Preliminary data on authentic lunar dust has shown that in aqueous suspension, lunar particles agglomerate rapidly. Artificial surfactant has been found to greatly reduce this particulate agglomeration.

Particles that are deposited in the pulmonary region are eliminated according to their surface area and chemical composition. If a particle is relatively soluble, its dissolution products end up in the bloodstream. Relatively insoluble particles are ingested by macrophages and removed by mucociliary clearance or the lymphatic system, or they persist in the interstitial areas of the lung. Ultrafine particles (&lt;0.1 μm) that deposit in the upper airways have been shown, under some conditions, to translocate to the brain,&lt;ref name="Oberdörster et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberdörster|first=G|author2=Sharp, Z|author3=Atudorei, V|author4=Elder, A|author5=Gelein, R|author6=Kreyling, W|author7= Cox, C|title=Translocation of inhaled ultrafine particles to the brain|journal=Inhalation toxicology|date=June 2004|volume=16|issue=6–7|pages=437–45|pmid=15204759|doi=10.1080/08958370490439597}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas similar particles reaching the pulmonary regions can translocate to adjacent organs such as the liver.&lt;ref name="Oberdörster et al 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oberdörster|first=G|author2=Sharp, Z|author3=Atudorei, V|author4=Elder, A|author5=Gelein, R|author6=Lunts, A|author7=Kreyling, W|author8= Cox, C|title=Extrapulmonary translocation of ultrafine carbon particles following whole-body inhalation exposure of rats.|journal=Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

The effects of particles on the respiratory system include de novo causation of clinical disease as well as exacerbation of existing disease. If particulate inhalation is to directly cause disease, the exposure levels typically must be at levels that are encountered in industrial settings. For example, silicosis is a well-known disease of persons working for years in conditions in which dust containing quartz is inhaled. Epidemiological studies show that ambient dust levels such as those that are encountered in some cities can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At certain times, sand dust that originates in Asia or Arizona, for example, has been associated with exacerbation of allergenic respiratory inflammation.&lt;ref name="Ichinose et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ichinose|first=T|author2=Yoshida, S|author3=Sadakane, K|author4=Takano, H|author5=Yanagisawa, R|author6=Inoue, K|author7=Nishikawa, M|author8=Mori, I|author9=Kawazato, H|author10=Yasuda, A|author11=Shibamoto, T|title=Effects of asian sand dust, Arizona sand dust, amorphous silica and aluminum oxide on allergic inflammation in the murine lung.|journal=Inhalation toxicology|date=May 2008|volume=20|issue=7|pages=685–94|pmid=18464056|doi=10.1080/08958370801935133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular concern in addition to the respiratory system is the ability of small particles to affect the cardiovascular system. Epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to ambient particulate matter increases the incidence of angina, arrhythmia, and myocardial infarctions. The increased acute mortality that is associated with particle "events" is attributed to cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="NRC 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=((National Research Council of the National Academies, Committee on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter, Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, Division on Earth and Life Studies))|title=Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter, Vol IV|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-09199-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical studies involving concentrated ambient air particulate have shown increased blood fibrinogen and reduced heart-rate variability;&lt;ref name="Devlin et al 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Devlin|first=RB|author2=Ghio, AJ|author3= Kehrl, H|author4= Sanders, G|author5= Cascio, W|title=Elderly humans exposed to concentrated air pollution particles have decreased heart rate variability.|journal=European Respiratory Journal | series = Supplement |date=May 2003|volume=40|pages=76s–80s|pmid=12762579|doi=10.1183/09031936.03.00402403}}&lt;/ref&gt; exposure to ultrafine particles causes "blunted" repolarization response following exercise.&lt;ref name="Frampton et al 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frampton|first=MW|author2=Zareba, W|author3= Daigle, CC|author4= Oberdorster, G|author5= Utell, MJ|title=Inhalation of ultrafine particles alters myocardial repolarization in humans [abstr]|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|year=2002|volume=165|page=B16|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryID=79291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of C-reactive protein in mediating the effect of ambient particle exposures on the causation of CAD has been reviewed.&lt;ref name="Sandhu et al 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandhu|first=RS|author2=Petroni, DH|author3= George, WJ|title=Ambient particulate matter, C-reactive protein, and coronary artery disease|journal=Inhalation toxicology|date=June–July 2005|volume=17|issue=7–8|pages=409–13|pmid=16020037|doi=10.1080/08958370590929538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batalha &lt;ref name="Batalha 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batalha|first=JRF|title=Concentrated ambient air particles induce vasoconstriction of small pulmonary arteries in rats|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|year=2002|volume=110|pages=1191–1197|pmc=1241105|doi=10.1289/ehp.5484|pmid=12460797}}&lt;/ref&gt; has drawn attention to the ability of particles to elicit vasoconstriction of small pulmonary arteries. Although the mechanistic details have not been fully elucidated, the evidence favors a strong link between exposure to particulates and to both acute and chronic heart disease.&lt;ref name="NRC 2004" /&gt; There is some evidence from the Apollo missions that, in susceptible individuals, lunar dust exposure may lead to cardiovascular effects that are similar to those produced through exposure to air pollution.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=W|title=Moon dust may simulate vascular hazards of urban pollution|journal=JBIS|year=2000|volume=60|pages=133–136|bibcode=2007JBIS...60..133R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that no accepted health standards or policies exist concerning exposure limits to lunar dust is a critical challenge to the design of vehicle systems in the CxP. The multi-center Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicology Assessment Group (LADTAG) was formed and responded to a request from the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer to "… develop recommendations for defining risk criteria for human lunar dust exposure and a plan for the subsequent development of a lunar dust permissible exposure limit." The LADTAG is composed of technical experts in lunar geology, inhalation toxicology, biomedicine, cellular chemistry, and biology from within the agency as well as of leading U.S. experts in these fields. Based on the opinions that were expressed by the LADTAG experts, NASA scientists will develop and execute a plan to build a database on which a defensible exposure standard can be set.&lt;ref name="Khan-Mayberry 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan-Mayberry|first=NN|title=The lunar environment : determining the health effects of exposure to moon dusts|journal=Acta Astronautica|year=2008|volume=63|issue=7 – 10|pages=99–105|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070006527_2007005296.pdf|bibcode=2008AcAau..63.1006K|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LADTAG experts recommend that the toxicity of lunar dust on the lungs (pulmonary toxicity), eyes (ocular toxicity), and skin (dermal toxicity) be investigated, and that this investigation is to be conducted by the Lunar Dust Toxicity Research Project (LDTRP) using various assays including in vivo and in vitro methods. In an initial LADTAG workshop that was held in 2005, experts noted that they were unable to reconcile individual expert opinions to set an inhalation standard. The array of opinions from these experts spanned a 300-fold range (i.e., 0.01 to 3&amp;nbsp;mg/m3). The members of the LADTAG concluded that research is necessary to narrow this wide uncertainty range, the lower end of which cannot be met by known methods of environmental control, and that there is an urgency to determine the standard so that environmental systems for the lunar vehicle can be appropriately designed. Therefore, in keeping with the LADTAG experts' recommendations, members of the LDTRP have reviewed first-hand accounts of Apollo astronauts who were exposed to lunar dust during their missions as well as of terrestrial-based human exposures to dust generated in the mining industry and to volcanic ash. In accordance with the LADTAG recommendations to increase our evidence base, the LDTRP is conducting studies of Apollo spacesuits, filters, vacuum bags, and rock-collection boxes. These studies will enable us to focus our understanding of the grain-size distribution that is present in the lunar surface samples and in the habitat, but the dust surfaces are expected to be fully passivated.

==Ground-based evidence==
Ground-based evidence includes data that are derived from people who are exposed occupationally to mineral dusts in industrial settings, from people who live in close proximity to active volcanoes and have been exposed to volcanic ash, and from animals and cells that are in controlled experimental studies. Mechanistic insights also guide our thinking concerning the potential toxicity of lunar dusts.

===Human exposures during industrial operations===
Workers in the mining industry are often exposed to dust from freshly fractured mineral deposits. When these workers use inadequate, or lack, respiratory protection completely, the consequences are devastating. A prime example of this is the Hawks Nest mining activity in West Virginia beginning in 1927. During the boring of a tunnel, deposits of silica were identified and mined; however, the workers did not use respiratory protection during the operations. Estimates of the proportion of workers who died, often within a few years, are typically about 30% of the 2,000 exposed workers.&lt;ref name="Cherniack 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cherniack|first=M|title=The Hawk's Nest incident: America's worst industrial disaster|year=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300044852}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rapidly lethal form of silicosis has been called "acute silicosis," which is characterized by alveolar proteinosis and interstitial inflammation.&lt;ref name="Driscol and Guthrie 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Driscol|first=K|title=Toxicology of the respiratory system.|year=1997|publisher=Elsevier Science, Inc.|location=NY|isbn=0080429734|edition=1st|author2=Guthrie, G|editor=Sipes, I |editor2=McQueen, C |editor3=Gandolfi, A |editor4=Roth, R |chapter=Crystaline silica and silicosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respiratory effects are not exactly like those one would expect from simple silicosis, a disease that usually requires decades to develop after prolonged exposure to lower concentrations of silica dust. The latter disease is characterized by silicotic nodules that are clearly distinct from surrounding tissue and often surrounded by an inflammatory response.&lt;ref name="Driscol and Guthrie 1997" /&gt;

===Humans and laboratory animals exposed to volcanic ash===
Volcanic ash originates from processes resulting in explosive eruptions into the atmosphere or pyroclastic flows oozing from the surface and discharging ash as they cool, or some combination thereof. Under any plausible condition, the ash will have had hours to days to react with the oxygen and water vapor of the atmosphere to passivate all surfaces before being inhaled by humans. The mineral composition of ash is determined by the composition of the magma. The particle size, mineral composition, and form of the minerals vary considerably from volcano to volcano as well as from one eruption to another eruption of the same volcano.

Shortly after Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, a number of experts began to investigate the effects of volcanic ash on those who had been exposed to the dust.&lt;ref name="Bernstein et al 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=RS|author2=Baxter, PJ|author3= Falk, H|author4= Ing, R|author5= Foster, L|author6= Frost, F|title=Immediate public health concerns and actions in volcanic eruptions: lessons from the Mount St. Helens eruptions, May 18-October 18, 1980|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=March 1986|volume=76|issue=3 Suppl|pages=25–37|pmid=3946727|pmc=1651693|doi=10.2105/ajph.76.suppl.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystalline silica content of this dust ranged from 3% to 7%.

Further evidence linking increased toxicity to surface activation must await data that show that lunar dust that is activated by methods other than grinding adversely affects cells. NASA has been able to demonstrate that dust that is activated by processes that are analogous to those that are understood to be present at the lunar surface (i.e., ultraviolet [UV] irradiation in a vacuum) are able to produce more ROS in aqueous solution than dust that is not activated by these processes (Wallace, unpublished data). In addition, mineral coupons that are activated by proton and alpha-particle bombardment that is analogous to the solar wind show increased ROS (Kuhlman, unpublished data). NASA was expected to assess the impact of these activation techniques on cellular systems by early 2009.

===Mechanistic understandings===
Lunar geologists state (Category I22 evidence) that iron is present in lunar dust, especially in the fraction of its smallest particles (nano-Fe), and that it can be postulated that a reaction involving iron could be important for activated lunar dust when it comes in contact with the mucous lining of the respiratory system. A good model of the issues and problems that are associated with testing surface-activated dust can be found in the studies of freshly fractured silica, which is highly toxic to the respiratory system via oxidative damage, and perhaps also in the testing of volcanic ash. The problem of the enhancement of toxicity in quartz by freshly fractured surfaces has been extensively investigated in animal and cellular systems.&lt;ref name="Porter et al 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Castranova 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ding et al 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ding|first=M|author2=Shi, X|author3=Dong, Z|author4=Chen, F|author5=Lu, Y|author6=Castranova, V|author7= Vallyathan, V|title=Freshly fractured crystalline silica induces activator protein-1 activation through ERKs and p38 MAPK.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=274|issue=43|pages=30611–6|doi=10.1074/jbc.274.43.30611|pmid=10521445|date=22 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallyathan et al 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vallyathan|first=V|author2=Kang, JH|author3= Van Dyke, K|author4= Dalal, NS|author5= Castranova, V|title=Response of alveolar macrophages to in vitro exposure to freshly fractured versus aged silica dust: the ability of Prosil 28, an organosilane material, to coat silica and reduce its biological reactivity.|journal=Journal of toxicology and environmental health|date=July 1991|volume=33|issue=3|pages=303–15|doi=10.1080/15287399109531529|pmid=1649918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fracturing silica cleaves the Si-O bonds, leaving Si and SiO radicals, which, in turn, produce OH radicals in an aqueous environment. Aged crystalline silica still produces radicals, but at a much lower level, perhaps by the Fenton reaction that occurs between iron and H2O2 that is generated by macrophage phagocytosis of the particles.&lt;ref name="Castranova 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castranova|first=V|title=Signaling pathways controlling the production of inflammatory mediators in response to crystalline silica exposure: role of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species.|journal=Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine|volume=37|issue=7|pages=916–25|doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.05.032|pmid=15336307|date=1 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passivation of reactive surfaces as dust surfaces age===
Since surface activation, which is produced primarily by grinding, is known to increase the toxicity of various mineral dusts, it is critical to ask how quickly surface activation disappears once the dust encounters an oxygen- and water-vapor-rich environment. Vallyathan et al.&lt;ref name="Vallyathan et al 1988" /&gt; demonstrated a bimodal decay by measuring the rate of disappearance of hydroxyl radical formation in an aqueous medium from silicon-based radicals on the surface of ground silica, when that ground silica was kept in air until the time of assay. The half-life of the fast decay was approximately 30 hours, whereas even after 4 weeks approximately 20% of the original activity that was induced by grinding was present on the surface of the quartz. This is similar to the ability of the 24-hour half-life in air of freshly fractured quartz to produce OH radicals.&lt;ref name="Castranova 2004" /&gt; Although quartz is not lunar dust and grinding is merely a surrogate for activation of dust at the lunar surface, the longevity of the surface reactivity requires careful attention to better understand how surface-activated lunar dust becomes passivated in a habitable environment.

==Space flight evidence==
Samples of lunar dust that have been returned to Earth have enabled NASA to learn the mineralogical properties of the dust at several lunar landing sites. First and foremost, one must keep in mind that the properties of the lunar dust may vary considerably depending on location; hence, lunar dusts may show a range of toxicity. Initially, NASA assessed the expected nature of dust at the proposed South Pole landing site on the rim of Shackleton crater.

All space flight evidence pertaining to the effect of lunar dust on astronauts is anecdotal ([[NASA categories of evidence|Category III]]). The post-flight debriefing reports of the Apollo astronauts serve as a base of evidence.&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Portree|first=DW|title=Monographs in aerospace history series #7|year=1997|publisher=NASA History Office, NASA Headquarters|location=Washington, DC|author2=Trevino, RC|chapter=Walking to Olympus: An EVA chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the astronauts attempted to remove the lunar dust before they reentered the command module (CM) by brushing the spacesuits or vacuuming, a significant amount of dust was returned to the spacecraft, which caused various problems. For instance, astronaut Harrison Schmitt complained of "hay fever" effects caused by the dust,&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt; and the abrasive nature of the material was found to cause problems with various joints and seals of the spacecraft and spacesuits.&lt;ref name="Wagner 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=SA|title=The Apollo experience lessons learned for Constellation lunar dust management|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/TP-2006-213726.pdf|work=TP-2006-213726|location=Johnson Space Center, Houston|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these reports, the Apollo crews provided several accounts of problems with lunar dust exposure as follows:

* During Apollo 11, crew members reported: "Particles covered everything and a stain remained even after our best attempts to brush it off"; a "[d]istinct pungent odor like gunpowder [was] noted when helmet [was] removed"; and "[t]exture like graphite".&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt;
* During Apollo 12, regarding dust in the lunar module (LM), the crew members noted several issues: "Both LM and CM contaminated with lunar dust"; "[LM] was filthy dirty and had so much dust that when I took my helmet off, I was almost blinded. Junk immediately got into my eyes"; and "[t]he whole thing was just a cloud of fine dust floating around in there." After the LM docked to the CM, dust infiltrated the CM. Crew members gave the following account of this period of contamination: "On the way back in the CM the system could not handle the dust, so it was continuously spread inside the spacecraft by the system"; "[w]e chose to remain in the suit loop as much as possible because of the dust and debris floating around"; and "[t]o keep our eyes from burning and our noses from inhaling these small particles, we left our helmet sitting on top of our heads".&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt;
* By contrast, the Apollo 14 crew members stated: "Dust was not a problem for us in the cabin"; and "[t]he dust control procedures were effective".&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt;
* The Apollo 15 crew members stated: "Cabin smelled like gunpowder when we first came into LM from EVA"; "[p]article matter floated around in spacecraft"; "[l]unar dust is 'soluble' in water"; and "[t]he vacuum cleaner did a good job of clearing the dust from the LM".&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt;
* Apollo 16 crew members provided the following accounts: "The LM was extremely clean until the first EVA and then it was extremely dirty"; "I question whether the vacuum cleaner ever worked properly"; and "I thought it was quite a hazard over there floating through the LM with all the dust and debris. A number of times I got my eyes full of dust and particles. I felt like my right eye was scratched slightly once".&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt;
* The Apollo 17 crew members recalled: "You knew [that] you were in a very heavily infiltrated atmosphere in the LM because of the lunar dust"; "[t]he dust clearing was remarkable considering the amount of dust we had"; "[a]lthough there was a lot of irritation to my sinuses and nostrils soon after taking the helmet off, by 2 hours that had decreased considerably"; "I did all the transfer with my helmet off and I am sorry I did because the dust really bothered my eyes and throat. I was tasting it and eating it"; and "[w]hen I climbed in the tunnel I could tell there was a lot of dust in the LM and you could smell it".&lt;ref name="Portree and Trevino 1997" /&gt;

NASA crew surgeon ([[NASA categories of evidence|Category IV]]), Dr. Bill Carpentier,&lt;ref name="Scheuring et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheuring|first=Richard A.|author2=Jones, Jeffrey A.|author3=Novak, Joseph D.|author4=Polk, James D.|author5=Gillis, David B.|author6=Schmid, Josef|author7=Duncan, James M.|author8= Davis, Jeffrey R.|title=The Apollo Medical Operations Project: Recommendations to improve crew health and performance for future exploration missions and lunar surface operations|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=63|issue=7–10|pages=980–987|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.12.065|date=1 October 2008|bibcode=2008AcAau..63..980S}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed his own, as well as Apollo mission crew members', post-flight allergic-type responses. Dr. Carpentier recalls an increase in [[eosinophil]] and [[basophil]] blood cell counts after the crew members were exposed to lunar dust, which may have indicated an allergic response.

Although no substantive evidence exists that astronaut performance was impaired by lunar dust,&lt;ref name="Wagner 2006" /&gt; one can imagine that if a crew member were "almost blinded" and had to "remain in the suit loop as much as possible because of the dust and debris floating around," the dust did have some impact on performance.

Dust from the lunar soil that was carried into the spacecraft during the Apollo missions proved to be a significant, intermittent problem. With the return to the moon and planned long-duration stays on the lunar surface, the dust toxicity and contamination problems are potentially much more serious than those that were experienced during the Apollo missions. Physical evidence also suggests that lunar dust could be a health hazard at a lunar outpost. Gravity at one-sixth that of the gravitational force of the Earth increases the time in which dust remains airborne, thereby increasing the probability that these dust particles will be inhaled.

Some examples of lunar dust grains are provided in figure 13-1.

==Exploration mission operational scenarios==
Multiple, probable scenarios exist in which crew members could be exposed to lunar dust during both lunar sortie and lunar outpost missions. Further, there are opportunities for crew members to be directly exposed to lunar dust after they perform EVAs. Post EVA, lunar crew members will introduce into the habitat and lunar lander the dust that has collected on their spacesuits and boots. Cleaning of the suits between EVAs may also directly expose crew members to lunar dust. For crew members, changing of Environmental Control and Life Support System filters is yet another potential route of direct exposure to lunar dusts. These episodic periods of increased lunar dust exposure must be taken into account when long-term exposure limits are calculated. As missions become longer, the greater dose and/or duration of lunar dust exposure will increase the potential human health risk. When a crew returns to microgravity, if lunar dust is introduced into the crew return vehicle, there will be an increased opportunity for ocular exposure if particles of dust are floating throughout the cabin. EVAs cause dermal injuries when suits that are based on the current design are used, and the introduction of lunar dusts may enhance injuries that will be sustained from contact with the EVA suit. In addition, NASA is considering the use of a rover design that will allow shirtsleeve operation of the vehicle. Thus, the rover, which must be kept in an interior space to be entered without a spacesuit, may also bring dust into the habitat.

==Conclusion==
The evidence base shows that prolonged exposure to respirable lunar dust could be detrimental to human health. Lunar dust is known to have a large surface area (i.e., it is porous), and a substantial portion is in the respirable range. The surface of the lunar dust particles is known to be chemically activated by processes ongoing at the surface of the moon. Predictions are that this reactivity will disappear on entry into the habitable volume; however, it is not known how quickly the passivation of chemical reactivity will occur, nor is it known how toxic the deactivated dust may prove to be. Although many Apollo astronauts seemed to tolerate lunar dust, their exposure times were brief and time (duration) exposure factors need to be determined. Other Apollo crew members and ground support personnel noted that the lunar dust was a sensory irritant. Finally, the size characteristics of the dust that actually was present in the atmosphere of the lunar lander have never been determined. Obtaining data will help NASA understand the size distribution of the particles that are expected to be found in future lunar habitats. It is important to design experiments that will close or, at a minimum, narrow knowledge gaps so that a scientifically defensible exposure standard can be set by NASA for protection of crew health.

'''Aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis''' (or '''aluminium toxicity''') is a problem for people on [[haemodialysis]]. The dialysis process does not efficiently remove excess [[aluminium]] from the body, so it may build up over time. Aluminium is a potentially toxic metal, and [[aluminium poisoning]] may lead to mainly three disorders: aluminium-induced [[bone disease]], [[microcytic anemia]] and neurological dysfunction ([[encephalopathy]]). Such conditions are more prominently observed in people with [[chronic renal failure]] and especially in people on haemodialysis.

About 5–10&amp;nbsp;mg of aluminium enters our body daily through different sources like water, food, occupational exposure to aluminium in industries etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carl/ |title=AB, Edward RA.

The '''American School Health Association''' ('''ASHA''') is a [[Professional body|professional association]]. It claims a membership of 2,000 members in 56 nations. More than half practice in [[K-12]] schools or administer [[health education]] or [[health services]] programs in [[school district]]s or [[State education agency|state departments of education]]. 

Founded in 1927 as the '''American Association of School Physicians''' by 325 physicians attending the annual meeting of the [[American Public Health Association]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], its mission was to protect and promote the health of children and youth by supporting coordinated school health programs as a foundation for school success. In 1936, the organization opened its membership to all professionals interested in promoting school health and adopted its current name.&lt;ref name = "ProgHealth1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The progressive era's health reform movement: a historical dictionary|first1=Ruth C.|last1=Engs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=20–22|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=2003|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attachment disorder''' is a broad term intended to describe [[mental disorder|disorder]]s of [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[behavior]], and [[Interpersonal relationship|social relation]]ships arising from a failure to form normal [[attachment theory|attachments]] to [[Primary caregiver|primary care giving figures]] in early [[Attachment in children|childhood]]. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of [[neglect]], [[Child abuse|abuse]], abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, Peter. ''Attachment Theory and Psychoanalysis''. Other Professional, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A person's ''attachment style'' is permanently established before the age of three. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.

The term attachment disorder is used to describe [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on the age of the individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality.&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; No list of [[symptom]]s can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of [[age appropriate]] social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.

There are currently two main areas of theory and practice relating to the definition and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of attachment disorder, and considerable discussion about a broader definition altogether. The first main area is based on scientific enquiry, is found in academic journals and books and pays close attention to [[attachment theory]]. It is described in [[ICD-10]] as [[reactive attachment disorder]], or "RAD" for the inhibited form, and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]], or "DAD" for the disinhibited form. In [[DSM-IV-TR]] both comparable inhibited and disinhibited types are called reactive attachment disorder or "RAD".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al. 2006 p78"&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p78&lt;/ref&gt;

The second area is controversial and considered [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="Berlin et al."&gt;{{Cite book |author=Berlin LJ |year=2005 |contribution=Preface |title=Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |series=Duke series in child development and public policy |publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-59385-470-6 | pages=xvii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in [[clinic]]al practice, on websites and in books and publications, but has little or no [[Evidence based medicine|evidence base]]. It makes controversial claims relating to a basis in attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser p 183&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these controversial [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] of attachment disorder is linked to the use of pseudoscientific [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapies]] to treat them.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al. 2006 p78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlin et al." /&gt;

Some authors have suggested that attachment, as an aspect of emotional [[Child development|development]], is better assessed along a spectrum than considered to fall into two non-overlapping categories. This spectrum would have at one end the characteristics called secure attachment; midway along the range of disturbance would be insecure or other undesirable attachment styles; at the other extreme would be
non-attachment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor &amp; Zeanah, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement has not yet been reached with respect to diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. p. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the term is also sometimes used to cover difficulties arising in relation to various attachment styles which may not be disorders in the clinical sense.

==''Attachment'' and ''attachment disorder''==
{{main | Attachment theory | Attachment in children}}
[[Attachment theory]] is primarily an [[Adaptation|evolutionary]] and [[Ethology|ethological theory]]. In relation to infants, it primarily consists of ''proximity seeking'' to an ''attachment figure'' in the face of threat, for the purpose of survival.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1970) p 181&lt;/ref&gt; Although an attachment is a "tie," it is not synonymous with love and affection, despite their often going together and a healthy attachment is considered to be an important foundation of all subsequent relationships. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton &amp; Munholland (1999) p 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental aspect of attachment is called ''basic trust''. Basic trust is a broader concept than attachment in that it extends beyond the infant-caregiver relationship to "...the wider social network of trustable and caring others."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, Barbara M., and Philip R. Newman. ''Development through Life: A Psychosocial Approach''. 12th ed. Stamford: Cenage Learning, 2015. 177. Print. {{ISBN|9781285459967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "...links confidence about the past with faith about the future."&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; [[Erik Erikson|"Erikson]] argues that the sense of trust in oneself and others is the foundation of human development"&lt;ref&gt;Kail, Robert V., and John C. Cavanaugh. ''Human Development: A Life-span View''. 5th ed. Australia: Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2010. 168. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and with a balance of mistrust produces [[hope]].

In the [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] sense, a [[Disease|disorder]] is a condition requiring [[therapy|treatment]] as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders.&lt;ref&gt;AACAP 2005, p1208&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. [[Reactive attachment disorder]] indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of ''proximity seeking'' to an identified ''attachment figure''. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of [[Reactive attachment disorder|RAD]] under [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]] are largely based on this understanding of the nature of attachment.

The words ''[[Attachment in children|attachment style]]'' or ''pattern'' refer to the various types of attachment arising from early care experiences, called ''secure'', ''anxious-ambivalent'', ''anxious-avoidant'', (all organized), and ''disorganized''. Some of these styles are more problematic than others, and, although they are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term 'attachment disorder'.

Discussion of the disorganized attachment style sometimes includes this style under the rubric of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood.&lt;ref&gt;Levy K.N. et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.

[[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and colleagues proposed an alternative set of [[Criterion validity|criteria]] (see below) of three categories of attachment disorder, namely "no discriminated attachment figure", "secure base distortions" and "disrupted attachment disorder". These classifications consider that a disorder is a variation that requires treatment rather than an individual difference within the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boris and Zeanah's typology==
Many leading attachment theorists, such as [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and Leiberman, have recognized the limitations of the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria and proposed broader diagnostic criteria. There is as yet no official consensus on these criteria. The APSAC Taskforce recognised in its recommendations that "attachment problems extending beyond RAD, are a real and appropriate concern for professionals working with children", and set out recommendations for assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin (2006) p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Boris and Zeanah (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Boris &amp; Zeannah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; have offered an approach to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those where there is a distorted relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a ''specified'' attachment figure.

Boris and Zeanah use the term "disorder of attachment" to indicate a situation in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. Such children may be indiscriminately sociable and approach all adults, whether familiar or not; alternatively, they may be emotionally withdrawn and fail to seek comfort from anyone. This type of attachment problem is parallel to Reactive Attachment Disorder as defined in DSM and ICD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms as described above.

Boris and Zeanah also describe a condition they term "secure base distortion". In this situation, the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, may cling to the adult, may be excessively compliant, or may show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult.

The third type of disorder discussed by Boris and Zeanah is termed "disrupted attachment". This type of problem, which is not covered under other approaches to disordered attachment, results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. The young child's reaction to such a loss is parallel to the grief reaction of an older person, with progressive changes from protest (crying and searching) to despair, sadness, and withdrawal from communication or play, and finally detachment from the original relationship and recovery of social and play activities.

Most recently, [[Daniel Schechter]] and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between maternal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood.   Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue.  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665-687.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of attachment style==
{{main|Attachment theory | Attachment in children}}
The majority of 1-year-old children can tolerate brief separations from familiar caregivers and are quickly comforted when the caregivers return. These children also use familiar people as a "secure base" and return to them periodically when exploring a new situation. Such children are said to have a secure attachment style, and characteristically continue to develop well both cognitively and emotionally.

Smaller numbers of children show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, they appear to be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.

Insecure attachment styles in toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or may go to the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail to return to their previous play. These children are more likely to have later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.

A small group of toddlers show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness of the person who is being sought.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J (2006) p 107&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;VanIJzendoorn &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible mechanisms==
One study has reported a connection between a specific [[genetic marker]] and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting.&lt;ref name= "Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Ijzendoorn MH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ |title=DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism moderates the association between maternal unresolved loss or trauma and infant disorganization |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=291–307 |year=2006 |pmid=17178609 |doi=10.1080/14616730601048159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author has compared atypical social behavior in genetic conditions such as [[Williams syndrome]] with behaviors symptomatic of RAD.&lt;ref name ="Zeanah 2007"&gt;Zeanah CH (2007). "Reactive Attachment Disorder". In  Narrow WE, First MB ''et al.'' (Eds.) ''Gender and age consideration in psychiatric diagnosis.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association. {{ISBN|0-89042-295-8}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical attachment development begins with unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to send and receive social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This makes it possible for an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.&lt;ref name="Dozier ''et al.'' (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dozier M, Stovall KC, Albus KE, Bates B |title=Attachment for infants in foster care: the role of caregiver state of mind |journal=Child Dev |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=1467–77 |year=2001 |pmid=11699682 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With insensitive or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, an infant may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways of coping with fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[[DSM-IV]] [[American Psychiatric Association]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as the development of an internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.&lt;ref name="Mercer, Sarner, &amp; Rosa 2003"&gt;Mercer J, Sarner L and Rosa L (2003) ''Attachment Therapy on Trial: The Torture and Death of Candace Newmaker.'' Westport, CT: Praeger {{ISBN|0-275-97675-0}}, pp. 98–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), pp. 64–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atypical development of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or inadequate fear reactions, might be necessary before an infant is vulnerable to the effects of poor attachment experiences.&lt;ref name="Marshall &amp; Fox (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall, |first=P.J. |authorlink= |author2=Fox, N.A. |year=2005 |month= |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |issue= 4|pages=492–502 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the two variations of RAD may develop from the same inability to develop "stranger-wariness" due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may only be able to develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is not in a position to do this cannot afford not to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p"&gt;Prior and Glaser p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inhibited form infants behave as if their attachment system has been "switched off". However the innate capacity for attachment behavior cannot be lost. This may explain why children diagnosed with the inhibited form of RAD from institutions almost invariably go on to show formation of attachment behavior to good carers. However children who suffer the inhibited form as a consequence of neglect and frequent changes of caregiver continue to show the inhibited form for far longer when placed in families.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p" /&gt;

Additionally, the development of [[Theory of Mind]] ''may'' play a role in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as [[autism]], have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie the development of reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006) p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonagy ''et al.''

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Attachment measures}}
Recognised assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the [[Attachment measures|Strange Situation procedure]] ([[Mary Ainsworth]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1978),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Main &amp;amp; Solomon (1986), pp.95-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Main &amp;amp; Solomon (1990), pp. 121-160.&lt;/ref&gt; the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment ("PAA"),&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment ("ORCE")&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]](1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Attachment measures|Attachment Q-sort]] ("AQ-sort").&lt;ref&gt;Waters and Deane (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent research also uses the [[Attachment measures|Disturbances of Attachment Interview]] or "DAI" developed by Smyke and Zeanah, (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Smyke and Zeanah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely having a discriminated, preferred adult, seeking comfort when distressed, responding to comfort when offered, social and emotional reciprocity, emotional regulation, checking back after venturing away from the care giver, reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to go off with relative strangers, self endangering behavior, excessive clinging, vigilance/hypercompliance and role reversal.
===Classification===
{{main|Reactive attachment disorder}}

[[ICD-10]] describes [[Reactive attachment disorder|Reactive Attachment Disorder of Childhood]], known as RAD, and Disinhibited Disorder of Childhood, less well known as [[Disinhibited attachment disorder|DAD]]. [[DSM-IV-TR]] also describes Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood. It divides this into two subtypes, Inhibited Type and Disinhibited Type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
*markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts,
*the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay and does not meet the criteria for [[Pervasive Developmental Disorder]],
*onset before 5 years of age,
*requires a history of significant neglect, and
*implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.
ICD-10 includes in its diagnosis psychological and physical [[Child abuse|abuse]] and injury in addition to neglect. This is somewhat controversial, being a ''commission'' rather than ''omission'' and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form is described as "a failure to initiate or respond...to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited responses" and such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain 'proximity', an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows "indiscriminate sociability...excessive familiarity with relative strangers" (DSM-IV-TR) and therefore a lack of 'specificity', the second basic element of attachment behavior. The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable. 'Disinhibited' and 'inhibited' are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can co-exist in the same child. The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver whilst the disinhibited form is more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser 2006, p. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

While RAD is likely to occur following neglectful and abusive childcare, there should be no automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p218-219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
{{main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
There are a variety of  mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment disorder, attachment problems and moods or behaviors considered to be potential problems within the context of [[attachment theory]]. All such approaches for infants and younger children concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, changing the caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AACAP (2005) p. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BakermansKranenburg ''et al.'' (2003) A meta-analysis of early interventions.&lt;/ref&gt; Such approaches include 'Watch, wait and wonder,'&lt;ref&gt;Cohen ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; manipulation of sensitive responsiveness,&lt;ref&gt;van den Boom (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van den Boom (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; modified 'Interaction Guidance,'.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit ''et al.'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Preschool Parent Psychotherapy,'.&lt;ref&gt;Toth ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Circle of Security',&lt;ref&gt;Marvin et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC),&lt;ref name="Dozier et al. 2005"&gt;Dozier ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the New Orleans Intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Larrieu &amp; Zeanah (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larrieu &amp; Zeannah (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeannah &amp; Smyke (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Parent-Child psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Leiberman ''et al.'' (2000), p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Other known treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, Relationship-based therapy (DIR) (also referred to as ''Floor Time'') by [[Stanley Greenspan]], although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of [[pervasive developmental disorders]]&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental &amp; Learning Disorders. (2007). [http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml Dir/floortime model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225132429/http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml |date=2008-02-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these approaches, such as that suggested by Dozier, consider the attachment status of the adult caregiver to play an important role in the development of the emotional connection between adult and child. This includes foster parents, as children with poor attachment experiences often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses from their attachment behaviors despite 'normative' care.&lt;ref name="Dozier et al. 2005" /&gt;

Treatment for reactive attachment disorder for children usually involves a mix of therapy, counseling, and parenting education. These must be designed to make sure the child has a safe environment to live in and to develop positive interactions with caregivers and improves their relationships with their peers.

Medication can be used as a way to treat similar conditions, like depression, anxiety, or hyperactivity; however, there is no quick fix for treating reactive attachment disorder. A pediatrician may recommend a treatment plan. For example, a mix of family therapy, individual psychological counseling, play therapy, special education services and parenting skills classes.&lt;ref name="Types of treatment for reactive attachment disorder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helpguide.org/mental/parenting_bonding_reactive_attachment_disorder.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145603/http://helpguide.org/mental/parenting_bonding_reactive_attachment_disorder.htm |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }} , 'HelpGuide.org', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscientific diagnoses and treatment==
{{main|Attachment therapy}}
In the absence of officially recognized [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians to refer to a broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al., (2006) p 81&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p 82&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[therapy]], including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream [[psychology]] or, despite its name, to be based on [[attachment theory]], with which it is considered incompatible.&lt;ref name="O'Connor (2003)"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disorders: assessment strategies and treatment approaches |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12944216 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974&amp;magic=pubmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ziv Y |year=2005 |contribution=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research |title=Enhancing Early Attachments.

A common feature of this form of diagnosis within [[attachment therapy]] is the use of extensive lists of "symptoms" which include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or not related to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as "wildly inclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p186-187&lt;/ref&gt; The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal to make eye contact, cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, "prefers dad to mom" or "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that high rates of [[false positive]] diagnoses are virtually certain and that posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin (2006) p 82&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a considerable variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as [[attachment therapy]]. These therapies have little or no evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are [[holding therapy]], [[Rebirthing (attachment therapy)|rebirthing]], [[rage-reduction]] and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p 262&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical base is broadly a combination of [[Age regression in therapy|regression]] and [[catharsis]], accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and parental control.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' 2006, p. 79–80. The APSAC Taskforce Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p 79&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated six children have died as a consequence of the more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Boris 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Sarner &amp; Rosa 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most well-known cases are those of [[Candace Newmaker]] in 2001 and the [[Michael and Sharen Gravelle|Gravelles]] in 2003 through 2005. Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by the publication of a Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting.&lt;ref name="attach07"&gt;{{Cite web|title=ATTACh White paper on coercion|year=2007|url=http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=ATTACh|accessdate=2008-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072425/http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attractive toxic sugar baits''' or ATSBs are oral [[insecticides]] designed to reduce [[malaria]] infections by killing the [[Vector (epidemiology)|host vector]] - the [[mosquito]] - rather than the parasite itself.&lt;ref name='ATSB1'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Successful field trial of attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) plant-spraying methods against malaria vectors in the Anopheles gambiae complex in Mali, West Africa | journal = Malaria Journal | date = 21 July 2010 | first = Günter | last = Müller |author2=John C Beier |author3=Sekou F Traore |author4=Mahamoudou B Toure |author5=Mohamed M Traore |author6=Sekou Bah |author7=Seydou Doumbia |author8=Yosef Schlein  | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 210 | url = http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/210 | accessdate = 2013-05-09 | doi=10.1186/1475-2875-9-210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ATSB2'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) methods decimate populations of Anopheles malaria vectors in arid environments regardless of the local availability of favoured sugar-source blossoms | journal = Malaria Journal | date = 1 Feb 2012 | first = John | last = Beier |author2=Günter C Müller |author3=Weidong Gu |author4=Kristopher L Arheart |author5=Yosef Schlein  | volume = 11 | pmc=3293779 | pmid=22297155 | doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-31 | page=31 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attractive toxic sugar baits are manufactured from readily available, inexpensive ingredients in [[tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] areas. They broadly consist of an oral toxic component, a sugar component to encourage feeding on the ATSB, and a scented component attractive to mosquitos or other target vectors.&lt;ref name='ATSB1' /&gt;  Typical ATSBs consist of [[boric acid]] as the oral toxin, unrefined cane sugar as the sugar source, and fruit, flowers, seeds and other scented material taken from local plants known to be popular feeding sources for mosquitos.&lt;ref name='ATSB1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='ATSB2' /&gt;

Mosquitoes require sugar as their main source of energy. By mimicking the scent of sugar-providing plants that are naturally attractive to mosquitoes, it is possible to attract the mosquitoes to insecticide-laden traps. The traps can be set next to areas with significant mosquito populations (e.g., reservoirs, roadside drainage ponds and culverts).&lt;ref name='ATSB1' /&gt; This use of traps attractive to mosquitoes prevents the need for indiscriminate insecticide spraying.&lt;ref name='ATSB1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='ATSB2' /&gt;

Attractive toxic sugar bait sprayed on vegetation has been successful in controlling Anopheles mosquitoes in outdoor environments. Additionally, indoor ATSB shows promise as a supplement to mosquito nets for controlling mosquitoes.&lt;ref name="Stewart, Z. P. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = Z. P. | last2 = Oxborough | first2 = R. M. | last3 = Tungu | first3 = P. K. | last4 = Kirby | first4 = M. J. | last5 = Rowland | first5 = M. W. | last6 = Irish | first6 = S.

Combined with long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor use of ATSB has the potential to serve as a strategy for managing [[insecticide resistance]]. Mortality rates of indoor ATSB were comparable to LLINs previously tested against the same species in the same area.&lt;ref name="Stewart, Z. P. 2013"/&gt;

Boric acid is only marginally more toxic to most lifeforms than normal [[table salt]], with exposure in humans and other mammals widely regarded as being safe. Its use as an insecticide in malarial control (instead of compounds which demonstrate high levels of mammalian toxicity or carcinogenicity) is thus seen as advantageous.&lt;ref name='ATSB1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='ATSB2' /&gt;&lt;ref name='ATSB3'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000E7FQ.txt | title = Red facts : boric acid | accessdate = 2013-05-09 | author = Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC.

The classical triad consists of [[pneumonia]], [[endocarditis]], and [[meningitis]], all caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. It is associated with [[alcoholism]], due to the presence of [[hyposplenia]] (reduced [[spleen|splenic]] functioning), and can be seen in males between 40 and 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Chest. 2009 Nov;136(5 Suppl):e30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind /&gt; that first appears during [[Infant|infancy]] or [[childhood]], and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0 /&gt; People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book|title = Biopsychology| vauthors = Pinel JP |publisher = Pearson|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-205-03099-6|location = Boston, Massachusetts|page = 235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–37 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin /&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek /&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London /&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin /&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |vauthors = Sacks O | author-link = Oliver Sacks |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and [[turn-taking]], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar /&gt; Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate [[nonverbal autism|nonverbal]]ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–33 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.9930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most children with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–34 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]]&lt;ref name="Sigman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 327–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird G, Cook R | title = Mixed emotions: the contribution of alexithymia to the emotional symptoms of autism | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e285 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23880881 | pmc = 3731793 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess /&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [[tantrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M |title= Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review |journal= Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume= 28 |issue=6 |pages= 567–79 |date= November 2007 |pmid= 16973329 |doi= 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |title= The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |journal= J Intellect Disabil Res |volume= 50 |issue=9 |pages= 621–32 |year = 2006 |pmid= 16901289 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |url= https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/216355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg /&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943 /&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=John2007 /&gt; for example: they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg /&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=John2007 /&gt; Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name="Landa"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landa R | title = Early communication development and intervention for children with autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17326115 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tager-Flusberg"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E | title = Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders | journal = Pediatr Clin North Am | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–81 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17543905 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 | url = https://www.academia.edu/19351942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman /&gt;

* [[Stereotypy|Stereotyped behaviors]]: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[Compulsive behavior]]s: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.
* Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name="Lam-Aman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–66 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[Self-injury]]: Behaviors such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=John2007 /&gt;

No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[immune system]] is thought to play an important role in autism.

Also, some [[inborn errors of metabolism]] are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.&lt;ref name=Manzi /&gt;

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

From studies based on [[event-related potential]]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeste SS, Nelson CA | title = Event related potentials in the understanding of autism spectrum disorders: an analytical review | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–510 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18850262 | pmc = 4422389 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[magnetoencephalography]] studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts TP, Schmidt GL, Egeth M, Blaskey L, Rey MM, Edgar JC, Levy SE | title = Electrophysiological signatures: magnetoencephalographic studies of the neural correlates of language impairment in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Int J Psychophysiol | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–60 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18336941 | pmc = 2397446 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.&lt;ref name=E-S-theory /&gt; These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name="E-S-theory"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1156 | pages = 68–80 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19338503 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | url = http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131214134422/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | archivedate = 14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni /&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]].

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gotham K, Risi S, Dawson G, Tager-Flusberg H, Joseph R, Carter A, Hepburn S, McMahon W, Rodier P, Hyman SL, Sigman M, Rogers S, Landa R, Spence MA, Osann K, Flodman P, Volkmar F, Hollander E, Buxbaum J, Pickles A, Lord C | title = A replication of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) revised algorithms | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 642–51 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18434924 | pmc = 3057666 | doi = 10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816bffb7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar /&gt; The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kan CC, Buitelaar JK, van der Gaag RJ | title = [Autism spectrum disorders in adults] | journal = Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde | volume = 152 | issue = 24 | pages = 1365–9 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18664213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover /&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name="Kanne"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE | title = Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–84 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18855144 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14769718}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover /&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mantovani JF | title = Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–53 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10855658 | doi = 10.1017/S0012162200210621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Neal D | title = Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions | journal = Psychiatr Times | volume = 26 |issue=4 |year=2009|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130403062215/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archivedate = 3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna /&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |title=Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Genet Med |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |year=2008 |pmid=18197051 |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laydate=7 February 2008 |laysource=Medical News Today |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |access-date=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901151333/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |archivedate=1 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna /&gt; A [[Genotype-first approach|genotype-first]] model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledbetter DH | title = Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 359 | issue = 16 | pages = 1728–30 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18784093 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe0806570}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Land2008 /&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name="Dover"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 | pmc=2066173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Why Many Autistic Girls are Overlooked|publisher=Child Mind Institute|url=https://childmind.org/article/autistic-girls-overlooked-undiagnosed-autism|access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–35 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research | vauthors = Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0 /&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin /&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A | title = Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 108–15 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220594 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR-299.00"&gt;{{vcite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029080544/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archivedate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD2007 /&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freitag CM | title = The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–22 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17033636 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[developmentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Happé F | title = Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure | journal = Psychologist | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 540–7 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120517162434/http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009 /&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism | journal = Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 865–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16519981 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010 | url = http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120513020615/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | archivedate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

* No [[Gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving, etc.) by 12 months.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Chaste /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL | title = Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19567888 | pmc = 3712619 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009 /&gt; Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertoglio K, Hendren RL | title = New developments in autism | journal = Psychiatr Clin North Am | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19248913 | doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2008.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Lev2009 /&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B | title = Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 943–55 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11733747 | doi = 10.1038/35103559}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E | title = Childhood autism and associated comorbidities | journal = Brain Dev | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–72 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17084999 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Intellectual disability]]'''. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Learning in autism |vauthors=Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title=Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor=Byrne JH (ed.-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol. ed.) |publisher=Academic Press |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=978-0-12-370504-4 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |access-date=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303191513/http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E | title = Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children | journal = JAMA | volume = 285 | issue = 24 | pages = 3093–99 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11427137 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100828195243/http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 | archivedate = 28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L | title = Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–29 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19223098 | pmc = 2692135 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of [[language disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spence SJ, Schneider MT | title = The role of epilepsy and epileptiform EEGs in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 599–606 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19454962 | pmc = 2692092 | doi = 10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name="Manzi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P | title = Autism and metabolic diseases | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–14 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18079313 | doi = 10.1177/0883073807308698}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minor physical anomalies]]''' are significantly increased in the autistic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozgen HM, Hop JW, Hox JJ, Beemer FA, van Engeland H | title = Minor physical anomalies in autism: a meta-analysis | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–07 | year = 2010 | pmid = 18626481 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2008.75 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steyaert JG, De la Marche W | title = What's new in autism? | journal = Eur J Pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | url = https://www.academia.edu/24262348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–11 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Victor of Aveyron, 1800.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Portrait of [[Victor of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798 who displayed possible symptoms of autism&lt;ref name="Wolff"/&gt;]]

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality | vauthors = Wing L | author-link1 = Lorna Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |access-date=23 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103210840/http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |archivedate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |vauthors=Houston R, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff S | title = The history of autism | journal = Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–08 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15365889 | doi = 10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–66 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical development and diagnoses ===
[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Balding man in his early 60s in coat and tie, with a serious but slightly smiling expression|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–17 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans-title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name="Kanner1943"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943}} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–36 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name="HappeTime" /&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–23 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Triplett]] was the first person diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as "case 1".&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pallardy|first1=Richard|title=Donald Triplett|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Triplett|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donvan|first1=John|last2=Zucker|first2=Caren | name-list-format = vanc |title=Autism's First Child|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/|access-date=19 March 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "[[refrigerator mother]]s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–05 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp| doi = 10.1177/070674370304800801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology and distinction from schizophrenia ===
As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | vauthors = Szatmari P, Jones MB | author-link1 = Peter Szatmari | pages=157–78 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed,&lt;ref name="Wolff" /&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–27 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 | url = https://www.academia.edu/20027016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1980 for the [[DSM-III]] to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the [[DSM-III-R]] provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the [[DSM-5]] was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including [[PDD-NOS]], autism, [[Asperger syndrome]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|CDD]], has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Jeffrey P.|title=Autism at 70 – Redrawing the Boundaries|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=19 September 2013|volume=369|issue=12|pages=1089–91|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1306380|pmid=24047057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biever C | title = Web removes social barriers for those with autism |journal=New Sci |issue=2610 |pages=26–27 |year=2007 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020165135/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archivedate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that [[Neurodiversity|autism is simply another way of being]].&lt;ref name=Sil2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Harmon A |title=How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=20 December 2004 |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002649/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benzo(e)pyrene.png|thumb|right|Chemical structure of benzo[e]pyrene|125px]]
A '''benzopyrene''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Structurally speaking, the colorless isomers of benzopyrene are pentacyclic hydrocarbons and are fusion products of [[pyrene]] and a [[phenylene|phenylene group]]. Two [[isomer]]ic species of benzopyrene are [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]] and the less common [[benzo(e)pyrene|benzo[''e'']pyrene]]. They belong to the chemical class of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.

==Overview==
Related compounds include [[cyclopentapyrenes]], [[dibenzopyrenes]], [[indenopyrenes]] and [[naphthopyrenes]]. Benzopyrene is a component of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and occurs together with other related pentacyclic [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] species such as [[picene]], benzo[[fluoranthene]]s, and [[perylene]].&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Betts "Tar and Pitch" in Kirk‑Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 1997, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{DOI| 10.1002/0471238961.20011802052020.a01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is naturally emitted by [[forest fire]]s and [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]] and can also be found in [[coal tar]], [[cigarette smoke]], wood smoke, and burnt foods such as [[coffee]]. Fumes that develop from fat dripping on blistering charcoal are rich in benzopyrene, which can condense on grilled goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B. K. |year=1983 |title=Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in grilled food |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=867–873 |pmid=6352775 |doi=10.1021/jf00118a049 |last2=Sahlberg |first2=GP |last3=Eriksson |first3=AT |last4=Busk |first4=LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzopyrenes are harmful because they form carcinogenic and mutagenic [[metabolite]]s (such as [[(+)-Benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide|(+)-benzo[''a'']pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide]] from benzo[''a'']pyrene) which [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] into DNA, interfering with [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].  They are considered [[pollutants]] and carcinogens. The mechanism of action of benzo[a]pyrene-related DNA modification has been investigated extensively and relates to the activity of cytochrome P450 subclass 1A1 ([[Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1|CYP1A1]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uno |first=S. |year=2006 |title=Oral Benzo[a]pyrene in Cyp1 knockout mouse lines: CYP1A1 important in detoxication, CYP1B1 metabolism required for immune damage independent of total-body burden and clearance rate|journal=Mol.

'''Bethany Christian Trust''' is a Scottish  charity based in [[Edinburgh]], registered charity no SC003783. It was set up to relieve the suffering and meet the long-term needs of [[homeless]] and [[vulnerable people]].  

The Trust's vision is that through Christian love in action, homelessness will be reduced and vulnerable people empowered to live independently within society. 

The Trust's partners include [[Edinburgh City Council]], [[West Lothian Council]], East Lothian Council, Fife Council, over 100 churches, Edinburgh City Mission, Christian Concern for the Homeless, CHAI, Rock Trust. Its areas of work are Edinburgh and the Lothians, Aberdeen (City &amp; Shire), Dundee, Fife, Dumfries &amp; Galloway and Glasgow.

The charity was established in 1983 by Rev Alan Berry, then a minister in Leith, Edinburgh, in response to the needs of the many homeless and vulnerable people he confronted daily.  

Bethany supports around 4,000 homeless and vulnerable people every year through its services. Bethany has nearly 200 full-time and part-time staff and over 1000 volunteers. Its turnover was £5.6 million in 2012.

== Bethany's Projects ==

=== Caring Christmas Trees ===

Caring Christmas Trees [http://www.caringchristmastrees.com] is a social enterprise operated by Bethany Enterprises Ltd.  Winner of the Institute of Fundraising Scotland’s Community Fundraising Award 2006, Caring Christmas Trees was set up by Scottish charity Bethany Christian Trust in 2005 to raise funds for their front-line services to help homeless people.

The Caring Christmas Trees scheme is a pre-order model, whereby customers select their preferred tree size, collection point and date for collection online. 

The marketing campaign focuses on the concept that the cost of a Christmas tree is around the same cost of giving someone shelter, food and support.  Customers are encouraged to think ethically about their Christmas tree buying and support Caring Christmas Trees because all the profits from tree sales go towards helping homeless people.
Caring Christmas Trees are freshly cut, Scottish-grown, grade 1 standard, needle-last trees and are sourced from managed, sustainable forests operated by members of the British Christmas Tree Growers Association who ensure high environmental standards. 

To keep costs down Caring Christmas Trees uses around 5000 volunteers to promote and distribute trees.  This means the maximum profit from every tree helps provide services for homeless people.

The proceeds from Caring Christmas Tree sales help fund Bethany’s homelessness services in Scotland.

===Big Sleep-Out===

The Big Sleep-Out is an annual sponsored fundraising event to encourage the community to be active in combating homelessness across Scotland.  The Sleep-Out raises awareness about Bethany's work with homeless and vulnerable people by giving participants an idea of what it is like to sleep rough for one night.  First held in Edinburgh in 2002, the event takes place in Spring at various locations across Scotland.

'''William Erasmus''' "'''Bill'''" '''Compton''' is a [[fictional character]] from ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]/Sookie Stackhouse'' series by author [[Charlaine Harris]]. He is a vampire and is introduced in the first novel in the series, ''Dead Until Dark,'' and has appeared in all of the novels since. In the fifth season of the television adaption, Bill plays the role of the main antagonist.

==Human life==
In the book series, Bill was born on April 9, 1840.  He lived in Bon Temps, Louisiana, and fought for the South during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  He was a married farmer with three children (there is inconsistency in the storyline, with Bill telling Sookie that he had five living children with his wife in ''[[Dead Until Dark]]'').  In 1865, he was made a vampire by Lorena, with whom he had a long and stormy relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0060637/bio|title=Bill Compton (Character)|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the book series, Bill discovers that he is related to the Bellefleur family in Bon Temps and secretly provides them with funds to aid in the repair of their ancestral home. The Bellefleurs - who do not know he is the source of the income - initially warm to him before coming to dislike him, but he is still able to assist Portia Bellefleur during her murder investigation in ''[[Living Dead in Dallas]]''.

In ''Living Dead in Dallas'' Bill's middle name is given as Thomas, rather than Erasmus.

==Work and position within vampire hierarchy==
At the end of the first novel, ''[[Dead Until Dark]]'', Bill is concerned about the power of Area Five sheriff [[Eric Northman|Eric]] over him and Sookie.  He decides to apply for that area's investigator position and he gets it. It was revealed that Bill works for [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq|Queen Sophie-Anne]] and she has sent him to Bon Temps to investigate Sookie Stackhouse's telepathic abilities.

Bill is also the creator of a valuable database in which all the vampires in North America are listed along with their significant information. Vampires from other areas of the world, such as Peru, have also provided information for this database. The database itself has been controversial because of potential security issues and is only available for purchase to other vampires. While most older vampires have good memories, Bill's ability to recall precise details, faces and conversations is reputed to be exceptional, even among other long-lived supernaturals.

==Romantic relationships==
* '''[[Sookie Stackhouse]]'''
:In the first book, ''[[Dead Until Dark]],'' Bill has returned to his ancestral home in Bon Temps, which is separated from the Stackhouse home by the Bon Temps cemetery.  After briefly meeting Sookie at her place of work, Merlotte's bar, Sookie saves Bill from being "drained" by the Rattrays, a husband and wife who sell vampire blood for profit. Bill later saves Sookie by giving her his blood when the Rattrays seek revenge. They subsequently embark on Sookie's first serious romantic relationship. Sookie has to endure a fair amount of dislike from the Bon Temps locals.

:Sookie and Bill's relationship falls apart when Bill is called back to his maker, [[Characters of The Southern Vampires Mysteries#Lorena|Lorena]], who entraps him in Mississippi to gain control of a project on which Bill is working for [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq|Sophie-Anne]].  Their relationship ends, and is dealt a further and final blow in [[Definitely Dead]] when Eric discovers and immediately discloses to Sookie that Bill came to Bon Temps on a mission to secure her telepathic abilities for use by Louisiana's vampire Queen.

:Bill continues to appear in the novels, but his relationship with Sookie is not romantic in nature, and by the events of ''[[Dead Reckoning (novel)|Dead Reckoning]]'' he has become a trusted friend.

* '''[[Characters of The Southern Vampires Mysteries#Lorena|Lorena Ball]]'''
:In the third book, ''[[Club Dead]],'' Lorena is introduced as Bill's maker and sire.  They were lovers since Bill became a vampire and they had an intense relationship.  They broke up eighty years ago.  In this novel, Bill tells Sookie that he had gone to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] because Lorena had called him and he was obeying her summons. Before leaving, he tells Sookie that if he has not returned or been heard from in eight weeks, she should go to Eric and place herself under his protection. According to Bill, Lorena ordered him to leave Sookie and threatened to kill her.  While Bill is with Lorena, it is revealed by Eric and Pam that he had contacted them and told them he was leaving Sookie and he wanted to make financial arrangements for her care.

* '''[[Salome]]'''
:Salome is mentioned in the book ''Dead as a Doornail''. She owns a casino called "Siete Velos" and is the maker of a vampire called Mickey.

* '''Selah Pumfrey'''
:Following his broken relationship with Sookie, Bill briefly dated a real estate agent named Selah Pumfrey. Bill makes it obvious that he still carries a torch for Sookie and continues to try to be involved in her life.

* '''[[Judith Vardamon]]'''
:Bill's "sister," who looks like his former human wife, was turned by Lorena Ball in an attempt to placate Bill after he was caught staring fondly at Judith.  Reunited only recently by Sookie's interference in ''Dead In The Family'' in order to save him from silver-poisoning, Judith and Bill's affair only lasted one book, as she has recently left Bon Temps in "Dead Reckoning."  Not knowing Judith was standing within earshot in the treeline behind Sookie's house, Bill tells Sookie that Judith is obsessed with him and although he had hoped to return her love he does not. Judith reacts by leaving town.

* '''[[Caroline Compton]]'''
:Bill's wife and the mother of his two children.

==Television portrayal==

In ''[[True Blood]]'', an [[HBO]] series based on the books, this character is played by [[Stephen Moyer]], and first appeared in the BloodCopy.com video “Bon Temps Vampire speaks”, The storyline of Bill differs significantly from that in the novels. In season one, as a punishment for staking a vampire, Bill is forced to turn a teenage girl named [[Jessica Hamby]] into a vampire, thus creating his first and only progeny in the series. In season 3, Bill has his maker, Lorena, staked by Sookie. In desperate need of blood, Sookie slits her arm to feed him. However, he quickly overpowers her and nearly drains her to death before realizing his actions. After being kicked out into the sunlight by an enraged Tara, he learns that faerie blood temporarily makes vampires immune to the sun. In season 4, Bill is named the vampire king of Louisiana after staging a coup d'état against Queen Sophie Anne with the help of the Authority. In season 5, he and [[Eric Northman]] are arrested for the murder of Nan Flanigan. The two are brought to the Authority's underground base, where he eventually accepts the Book of Lilith. Bill is left competing with Salome for the vial of Lilith's blood, which he eventually wins by killing her. After drinking Lilith's blood, despite Eric and Sookie trying to convince him not to, Bill begins to bleed out and dies. Moments later, however, he is resurrected as a more powerful vampire, now having the strength of Lilith as well. While the extent of his new powers are not fully understood, it has been revealed in season 6 that he is impervious to staking, he no longer needs an invitation to enter a human home, and that he involuntarily has visions of the future. He is also able to command Warlow, Lilith's only known progeny and Sookie's love interest. After drinking Warlow's blood, Bill is able to walk in the sun. Using this power, he is able to kill Governor Truman Burrell and his guards in an effort to save Jessica. By the end of the series in Season 7, Bill has been infected with the Hep V virus. Instead of taking a cure, he is resigned to die, and eventually convinces Sookie to stake him as he lies in his Civil War grave, giving him the "true death".

==History==
Founded and financed by businessman [[Kaspare Cohn]], Cedars-Sinai was established as the Kaspare Cohn Hospital in 1902.&lt;ref name = "American Historical Society"&gt;{{cite book | author = McGroarty, John Steven | title = Los Angeles From the Mountains to the Sea | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ucUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA777 | page = 777 | year = 1921 | accessdate = 2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jewishjournal.com Ahenker"&gt;{{cite news | last = Aushenker |first=Michael | title = From TB to T-Cell, Tracing the Roots of Cedars-Sinai |work=The Jewish Journal | url =http://jewishjournal.com/culture/science_and_technology/6750/ | date = October 3, 2002 | accessdate = 2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Cohn donated a two-story Victorian home at 1441 Carroll Avenue in the Angeleno Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles to the Hebrew Benevolent Society to create the hospital as a memorial to his brother Samuel.{{Citation needed|reason=No mention of brother Samuel in article.|date=August 2018}} The hospital had just 12 beds when it opened on September 21, 1902, and its services were initially free.&lt;ref name="Jewishjournal.com Ahenker" /&gt;

From 1906 to 1910, Dr. [[Sarah Vasen]], the first female doctor in Los Angeles, acted as superintendent.&lt;ref name = "Vasen"&gt;{{cite web | author = Beardsley, Julie | title = Dr. Sarah Vasen: First Jewish Woman Doctor In Los Angeles; First Superintendent Of Cedars-Sinai Hospital | url = http://home.earthlink.net/~nholdeneditor/Sarah%20Vasen.htm | date = April 2003 | accessdate = 2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, the hospital relocated and expanded to Stephenson Avenue (now Whittier Boulevard), where it had 50 beds and a backhouse containing a 10-cot tubercular ward.&lt;ref name="Jewishjournal.com Ahenker" /&gt; It gradually transformed from a charity-based hospital to a general hospital and began to charge patients.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt;

The hospital relocated again in 1930 to 4833 Fountain Avenue, where it was renamed Cedars of Lebanon after the religiously significant [[Lebanon Cedar]]s, which were used to build King [[Solomon]]'s [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the [[Bible]].

==Controversy==
According to articles in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2009, Cedars-Sinai was under investigation for significant radiation overdoses of 206 patients during [[CT scan|CT brain perfusion scans]] during an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/14/local/me-cedars-sinai14|title=Cedars-Sinai radiation overdoses went unseen at several points|author=Zarembo, Alan|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=20 January 2010 | date=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zarembo"&gt;''Cedars-Sinai investigated for significant radiation overdoses of 206 patients'', Alan Zarembo, Los Angeles Times, October 10, 2009; "4 patients say Cedars-Sinai did not tell them they had received a radiation overdose", Alan Zarembo, Los Angeles Times, October 15, 2009; ''Cedars-Sinai finds more patients exposed to excess radiation'', Nicole Santa Cruz, Los Angeles Times, November 9, 2009;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the initial investigation, it was found that [[GE]] sold several products to various medical centers with faulty radiation monitoring devices.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

State regulators had also found that Cedars-Sinai had placed the [[Dennis Quaid#Personal life|Quaid twins]] and others in immediate jeopardy by its improper handling of [[Heparin|blood-thinning medication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:Af_Q_JKGAL4J:www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-quaid15jan15,0,7431993.story+%22Cedars-Sinai%22+%22quaids%22&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=Quaids recall twins' drug overdose|author=Charles Ornstein|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==
First developed by philanthropists [[Frederick R.

Ninety to 95 percent of the collection is on display at any given time. Nine large-scale works are located in courtyards, parking lots and public walkways throughout the approximately 30-acre campus. The collection consists entirely of gifts from donors, other institutions and occasionally the artists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Vankin (July 7, 2014), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-cedars-art-stella-20140707-story.html Abstract Frank Stella sculpture 'Adjoeman' joins Cedars-Sinai artworks] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6934">The '''Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Alcoholism''' (COGA) is an eleven-center research project in the United States designed to identify and understand the genetic basis of [[alcoholism]].  Research is conducted at [[University of Connecticut]], [[Indiana University]], [[University of Iowa]], [[SUNY]] [[Downstate Medical Center]] at Brooklyn, [[Washington University]] in St. Louis, [[University of California at San Diego]], [[Rutgers University]], [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]], and [[Howard University]]. 

[[Henri Begleiter]], Ph.D. and Theodore Reich, M.D. were founding PI and Co-PI of COGA since its inception. Since 1991, COGA has interviewed more than 17,000 members of more than 2,200 families from around the United States, many of whom have been longitudinally assessed. Family members, including adults, children, and adolescents, have been carefully characterized across a variety of domains, including other alcohol and other substance-related phenotypes, co-occurring disorders (e.g., depression), electrophysiology, key precursor behavioral phenotypes (e.g., conduct disorder), and environmental risk factors (e.g., stress). This has provided us with a very rich phenotypic dataset to complement the large repository of cell lines and DNA for current and future studies. We have made this dataset widely available to advance the field: hundreds of researchers have worked with data generated as part of COGA through a variety of different mechanisms including data sharing through dbGaP and the Genetic Analysis Workshops, as COGA collaborators, through meta-analysis consortia, and as independent requestors for COGA samples and data.  

In studying alcoholism, COGA hopes to find better ways of treating alcoholism and improving the lives of the millions of people who suffer from alcoholism. The COGA project has achieved national and international acclaim for its accomplishments, and numerous articles about the study have been published in scientific journals. This project is funded by the federal government and is one of the largest of its kind to be done in the United States.

== Scientific mission ==

COGA's aim is to identify the genes involved in alcoholism.  There is a large body of twin-studies and adoption-studies that show that alcoholism is inherited.  COGA is trying to determine more specifically how it is inherited and what genes are involved.  There is no one gene that controls alcoholism, rather it is polygenetically controlled.  

That means there are several different genes that influence risk factors involved in alcoholism.  Examples of these risk factors include one's level of response to alcohol, a person's neuroelectrochemistry, and other psychiatric disorders, such as [[Antisocial Personality Disorder]] or [[clinical depression]].

== Interview ==

COGA researchers will interview subjects using the SSAGA, or Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism, specifically created for the COGA project.  Each subject is asked to participate in the SSAGA, with different versions for adolescents and for parents being interviewed about their children.  The SSAGA is a polydiagnostic psychiatric interview that will cover any drug or alcohol use as well as any emotional and/or medical problems the subject may have experienced.  The SSAGA is designed to use diagnostic criterion from the DSM III-R, DSM IV, and ICD-10. The SSAGA has been translated into nine languages and has been used in over 275 studies. The wide adoption of the SSAGA ensures that data from COGA families are highly compatible with data from other studies and allows COGA to participate in numerous consortia that use meta-analytic methods to combine data and results.

== Blood sample ==

COGA requests that their subjects provide a blood sample, which is then processed and examined at Rutgers University.  Genes not only carry information about eye and skin color, but also carry vulnerability to specific diseases, and probably cause a susceptibility to alcoholism as well.  COGA is attempting to find those chromosomes involved in alcoholism and have located specific loci thought to be involved.

== Brain wave ==

The brain wave is called an [[event-related potential]] (ERP) and is similar to an EEG.  Brainwaves are monitored in a non-invasive procedure that involves placing a cap on the subject's head, similar to a bathing cap.  This cap will monitor the brain's natural electrical activity and will record the brain's response when the subject is presented with various stimuli.  Subjects respond to computer programs on a screen in front of them that flash various stimuli on the screen.  

After a significant event, or an important stimuli to which the subject is instructed to respond, there is an increase in electrical activity.  COGA is investigating, for example, the P3 (or P300) peak of the ERP that occurs approximately 300 ms after the stimuli presentation.  Varying amplitudes of the wave have different behavioral implications.  The amplitude is fairly consistent throughout families and steady across time, suggesting an inherited component, as opposed to an environmental component.

== Confidentiality ==

Subject's confidentiality is important to COGA.  Subjects' names are never connected with the information they give.  Rather, an ID number is assigned to them.  COGA has also received the Confidentiality Certificate from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to protect researchers from being forced, even by court subpoena, to identify you.  The Certificate adds protection only for the research information and does not mean the Secretary of DHHS approves or disapproves of the project.

The '''EMMS Nazareth Hospital''', also known as '''Scottish Hospital''' and '''English Hospital''', is the general hospital of the city of [[Nazareth]], [[Israel]]. It was founded as a [[Christian mission]] by Dr. [[Kaloost Vartan]] and the [[EMMS International|Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society]] in 1861. The hospital now houses 147 beds, employs over 500 staff, and receives over 50,000 visits annually.&lt;ref name="Nazareth Trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The Nazareth Trust|url=http://www.nazarethtrust.org/history-emms-nazareth|work=The Nazareth Trust|accessdate=16 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719053532/http://www.nazarethtrust.org/history-emms-nazareth|archivedate=19 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Nazareth Hospital project was originally led by Dr. Pacradooni [[Kaloost Vartan]]. Born in [[Constantinople]] to an Armenian family in 1835, he attended an American [[Protestant]] School for Armenian Boys. During the [[Crimean War]], he served as an interpreter for British forces. There, he was moved and inspired by the poor conditions of war, and by the care provided at the hospitals run by [[Florence Nightingale]]. Vartan moved to [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] to study medicine.&lt;ref name="The Missionary"&gt;{{cite news|last=van der Klugt|first=Melissa|title=The Missionary Who Healed the Sick of Nazareth|newspaper=The Times|date=29 September 2012|location=London|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies were funded by the newly founded [[Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society]] (EMMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yaron|first=Perry|title=Modern Medicine in the Holy Land: Pioneering British Medical Services in Late Ottoman Palestine|year=2007|publisher=Tauris Academic Studies|location=London|author2=Efraim Lev |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1841 by a group of doctors, the EMMS aimed to provide medical services to foreign countries, to "circulate information on medical mission [sic], help other institutions engaged in the same work and assist as many missionary stations as their funds would permit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins and Background|url=http://www.emms.org/about-us/origins-and-background|work=EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. Vartan was first funded by the Syrian Asylum Fund in 1861 to aid massacre victims in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ziadat|first=Adel A.|title=Western Medicine in Palestine, 1860-1940|year=2003|publisher=Canadian Bulletin of Medical History|location=Montreal|pages=269–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Syrian Asylum Committee was dissolved, the EMMS recruited his services for a new mission in Nazareth starting in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=John|title=The Coogate Doctors|year=1991|publisher=Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society|location=Edinburgh|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestine and health==
During this time, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] was governed by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Lack of adequate social services and environmental factors contributed to poor public health. Citizens suffered from cholera, dysentery, malaria, and tuberculosis, and infant mortality was high. Palestine was en route for those participating in the [[Hajj]], which made locals susceptible to a steady influx of foreign diseases. Traditional medicine included herbal treatments, [[cauterization]], [[bloodletting]], [[bonesetting]], cupping, and [[leeching (medical)|leeching]], among various tribal rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidovitch|first=Nadav|author2=Zalman Greenberg |title=Public Health, Culture, and Colonial Medicine: Smallpox and Variolation in Palestine During the British Mandate|journal=NIH: US National Library of Medicine|date=May–June 2007|volume=122|pages=398–406|pmc=1847484|issue=3|pmid=17518312|doi=10.1177/003335490712200314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861 the average life expectancy was 22 for males and 24 for females.&lt;ref name="Nazareth Trust"/&gt; Although Ottoman law required the provision of medical services, in reality, it did little more than employ a few municipal part-time workers.&lt;ref name="Ziadat"&gt;Ziadat, 270-271&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, Nazareth was home to nearly 5,000 citizens, but the nearest doctor or hospital was as far away as Damascus or Beirut.&lt;ref name="The Missionary"/&gt; Ultimately, the only care was provided by charity.

==History==

===Early history===
In 1861, Dr. Vartan arrived in Nazareth to begin work. He joined Johannes or [[John Zeller]], a missionary of the [[Church Mission Society]].&lt;ref name="Yaron 129"&gt;Yaron, 129&lt;/ref&gt; Zeller was an Anglican priest, and helped Dr. Vartan carry out surgeries with chloroform anesthesia.&lt;ref name="The Missionary"/&gt; Initially, Dr. Vartan was confronted with a campaign against him by local healers, who saw his plan of establishment a threat to their practices. There was also a question of funding, as the committee that sent Dr. Vartan to Nazareth disbanded in 1864. Through these tribulations, Dr. Vartan continued to practice medicine. In 1865, he treated the son of the Mayor of Nazareth, and won the title, "The Great Doctor."&lt;ref name="Yaron 129"/&gt;

Dr. Vartan first received patients in his own home. Dr. Burns Thompson, superintendent of the Coogate dispensary, supported him for two years after the original committee dissolved. In 1866, the EMMS officially adopted the Nazareth Hospital project.&lt;ref name="Yaron 129"/&gt; The society provided £100 for a few beds for surgical cases, which were installed in the upper room of Dr. Vartan’s house. As the only hospital near Nazareth, these accommodations were obviously insufficient, and Dr. Vartan soon received approval from the EMMS for the purchase for two adjacent houses. One would serve as a hospital, and the other his residence and dispensary. Only a year after the expansion, 36 inpatients were admitted, and 70&amp;ndash;100 patients were treated daily.&lt;ref&gt;Ziadat, 272&amp;ndash;273&lt;/ref&gt;
This small dispensary was located on the east side of Nazareth. A small flow of clean water was available there, but rainwater was used more frequently. The hospital staff ran a boys’ Sunday school and soup kitchen,&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;"Editorial Notes." Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society Quarterly Paper XX (Nov. 1941): 50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an artists’ club, in addition to normal hospital operations.&lt;ref&gt;"Editorial Notes." Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society Quarterly Paper XX (Nov. 1942): 97. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Christian mission, prayers were held every morning at 7am.&lt;ref&gt;Hatton. "Impressions of a Patient in Nazareth Hospital." Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society Quarterly Paper XX (Feb. 1941): 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most nurses and staff were native to Ottoman Palestine, and had minimal English skills, which proved challenging to Dr. Vartan and his wife. Both patients and staff came from various religious denominations. Most were Christian, but Jews and Muslims worked for and were treated by the hospital, as well. An early survey of patients shows that in 1899, 5,747 Christians and 2,680 Muslims sought care in the hospital.&lt;ref name="notes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziadat, 271&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, a plot of land overlooking Nazareth was purchased for the establishment of a bigger hospital. Before anything could be done, Dr. Vartan was tasked with getting permission, a ''[[firman]]'', from the Ottoman authorities to establish a dispensary.&lt;ref name="The Missionary"/&gt; The Turkish government put a stop to his efforts to build after a misleading promise to provide a permit. No more progress was made until 1895, when the EMMS directors approved a new site west of Nazareth. Dr. Vartan died in 1908, before any construction could begin.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Frederick John Scrimgeour succeeded Dr. Vartan as the head doctor of the mission, along with two European nurses. The new hospital was almost complete, when World War I broke out through Europe and the Middle East, and British physicians were ordered to leave Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Yaron, 130&lt;/ref&gt; The new hospital was requisitioned by the military, stripped, and used as stables.&lt;ref name="The Missionary"/&gt; While Dr. Scrimgeour was stuck in Egypt and unable to return; two nurses from the hospital operated in his rented residence downtown.&lt;ref&gt;Ziadat, 273&amp;ndash;274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital was restored in 1919, and normal operations slowly resumed. In that year, the hospital was recognized by the British government’s mandate as a hospital for training nurses. In 1924, the hospital was officially inaugurated and, by 1935, it had electricity and a sanitary annex for [[tuberculosis]] patients. The mission began extending services beyond elementary care. For example, by 1924, plans were adopted for infant welfare clinics in a nearby village.&lt;ref name="Ziadat 274-275"&gt;Ziadat, 274&amp;ndash;275&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, an east wing was added to the hospital, which contained the "Abercrombie Ward".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 48-49"&gt;Wilkinson, 48&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt; It soon took on the name, the "Hospital on the Hill". By this time, Dr. Scrimgeour had retired, and Dr. William D. Bathgate and Sister Mary Parkinson had taken charge of the hospital.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 48-49"/&gt;

===Late history===
In May 1948, the state of Israel was established. Dr. Runa MacKay, who joined the mission a few years later, reported that hospital operations were generally uninhibited by the political upheaval, and the majority Arab population of Nazareth remained. However, an influx of refugees created more demand on the workers. At this time, the hospital still only had 100 beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKay|first=Runa|title=Exile In Israel: A Personal Journey with the Palestinians|year=1995|publisher=Wild Goose|location=Glasgow|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This pressure resulted in the recruitment of more doctors. In addition to Dr. MacKay, Drs. Hester and Bernath joined the mission in May 1956.&lt;ref name="Nazareth Trust"/&gt; Their work inspired major changes in the hospital. Dr. Tester joined the hospital staff in 1952. Under his supervision, the hospital installed a modern laundry system, a new outpatient facility, nurses' home and chapel, and new accommodations for staff from 1957 to 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bernath arrived at the mission in 1956, and was appointed as administrator of the hospital in 1969. He worked to continue updating the hospital, and oversaw the development of a new maternity clinic, kitchen, and most importantly, the recruitment of specialists to provide dialysis and physiotherapy.&lt;ref name="Nazareth Trust"/&gt; Other significant improvements include the addition of the "Tower Block,” an intensive care unit, in 1976. A unit for [[renal dialysis]] was opened in October 1981, and the first computer was installed the following year. This period saw another increase in hospital staff. Many of the newly hired doctors came from the Arab community, in particular, Dr. Nakhle Bishara, who became the medical director of the hospital in 1981. In that same year, Israeli healthcare reform named the Nazareth Hospital as the official district hospital for the Nazareth area. This, in addition to a strike by Israeli doctors in 1983, caused a massive influx in patients, leaving the hospital once again inadequate.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, 51-53"&gt;Wilkinson, 51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, a delegation from Edinburgh was sent to review the hospital's operations and establish a plan to accommodate the renewed demand for services. Mr. Fred Aitken was appointed as head the implementation of the plan, which aimed to increase the standards of the facilities, rather than the capacity of the hospital, and had an operating budget of 3.5 million pounds.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, 51-53"/&gt;
In 1988 Dr. Robert W. Martin succeeded Dr. Bernath as superintendent. In 1995, further healthcare reforms were instituted which guaranteed basic healthcare to all residents of Israel. The hospital recruited help, namely from Mr. G. Anthony Holt, who became interim general administrator, and Mr. Derek Thompson, a hospital administrator from the United Kingdom, to make further transitions to a large-scale medical facility. In 2001, The EMMS split into two separate organizations, EMMS International and EMMS Nazareth. Thompson served as the first CEO of EMMS Nazareth, followed in 2007 Mr. Joseph Maine. In that same year, Mr. Elia Abdo became the General Director of the Nazareth Hospital. In 2010, Dr. Bishara Bisharat became the head of the hospital. In 2009, the title "EMMS Nazareth" was replaced with "The Nazareth Trust."&lt;ref name="Nazareth Trust"/&gt; After almost 150 years, the Nazareth Hospital and nursing school are still operational.

==Today==
Today, the hospital continues to expand its practices, led by the head of the hospital, Dr. Fahid Hakeem, Dr Kemal Kem (MD MBBS DCH DRCOG DFFP MRCGP) and a faithful management team. For example, in October 2012, the hospital opened a pregnancy and childbirth complex in the nearby village of Umm Al-Fahm.&lt;ref&gt;ابوعطا, ابراهيم."مستشفى الناصرة يفتتح دفيئة الحمل والولادة في مجمع أبو دغش في أم الفحم.

'''Edouard Wyss-Dunant''' (17 April 1897 – 30 April 1983) was a Swiss physician and [[alpinism|alpinist]]. He had a distinguished career in [[medicine]], both in his own country and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;K2: the 1939 tragedy Andrew J. Kauffman, William Lowell Putnam - 1992  "Edward Wyss-Dunant (1897-1983), a radiologist and physiologist, was a resident of Geneva who climbed mostly in the Oberland."&lt;/ref&gt;  He published a number of treatises in his professional capacity and was the author of several mountaineering books. He is best known for his leadership of the [[1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition|Swiss Expedition to Everest of 1952]].

==Biography==

Wyss-Dunant had a [[German-speaking Swiss|Swiss-German]] father and a [[Vaud]]oise mother. He spent his childhood in [[Alsace]], where his father managed a chemical works. He went on to study medicine in [[Geneva]]. After receiving a doctorate in radiology in [[Zurich]] he set himself up as a practitioner in [[radiology]] in Bern and became a member of the ''Berner Akademische Alpen-Klub'' (Bern Academical Alpine Club). Later, he moved into a practice in Geneva, where he met his future wife, Lucrece, and there, with the exception of a period spent in North Africa, he made his home for the rest of his life.

During his stay in [[Bern]], Wyss-Dunant climbed all the main summits of the [[Bernese Oberland]]: among the classic routes in his record at that time were the Mittellegi Ridge of the [[Eiger]], the North Ridge of the [[Mönch]] and many good ascents in the chain of the [[Grosses Engelhorn]]. In his early twenties, he traversed the [[Dent d'Hérens]] from the Tiefenmatten-Joch to the Col du Lion and made a double traverse, in two days, of both the [[Matterhorn]] and the Dent d'Hérens. He also achieved a solo traverse of the Matterhorn and climbed it by its formidable Furggen-{{Not a typo|Grat}} with [[Alexander Taugwalder]]. He also climbed extensively in the [[Mont Blanc]] massif with [[Marcel Kurz]].

Wyss-Dunant also participated in several expeditions further afield: in [[Mexico]] (1936), [[East Africa]] (1937), [[Greenland]] (1938), [[Tibesti]] ([[Chad]]) (1946) and in the [[Himalaya]] (1947 and 1952). The accounts of these exploits are recorded in his books: "Appels des Sommets", "Au dela des Cîmes", "Sur les Hauts Plateaux Mexicains", "Mes Ascensions en Afrique", "Mirages Groenlandais" and "Forets et Cîmes Himalayennes".

The climax of his career as an alpinist was his selection by the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Exploration as leader of the Geneva-based Swiss Expedition to Everest in the spring of 1952.

Wyss-Dunant also served as president of the [[Swiss Alpine Club]] and the [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]]. In tribute to these services and to his lifelong record as a climber he was made an honorary member of the [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=In Memoriam, compiled by Geoffrey Templeman|url=http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1984_files/AJ%201984%20258-275%20In%20Memoriam.pdf |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spring 1952 expedition to the Everest==

{{main article|1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition}}

Edouard Wyss-Dunant, was appointed leader of this expedition. All the expedition’s participants were from Geneva, they almost all belonged to the exclusive «L'Androsace» climbing club and knew each other very well. The city and Canton of Geneva provided moral and financial support for the expedition, and the University of Geneva provided the scientific contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Excerpt from: Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, 1939 to 1970. Published in Zurich in 1972 |url=http://www.sfar-evev06.ch/en/expeditions/everest52f.html |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118032851/http://www.sfar-evev06.ch/en/expeditions/everest52f.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountaineering task that this team had set itself was primarily exploring the access to the [[South Col]], the conquest of the labyrinthine [[Khumbu Icefall]], and possibly the advance to the [[South Col]]. The team never even considered an attempt at an ascent of Everest.

[[Raymond Lambert]] and [[Sherpa (people)|Sherpa]] [[Tenzing Norgay]] were able to reach a height of about {{convert|8595|m|ft|0}} on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imagingeverest.rgs.org/Concepts/Virtual_Everest/-116.html|title=Tenzing Norgay GM|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which he summited with [[Edmund Hillary]].

The results of this first Swiss Everest expedition are remarkable, and exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. At the first attempt, they had opened up a new route to Everest, and had reached an extraordinary height on the south-western ridge in difficult conditions. In the opinion of the extremely critical Marcel Kurz, this expedition could almost be compared to a victory. It paved the way for further successes by other expeditions.

The '''epidemiology of cancer''' is the study of the factors affecting [[cancer]], as a way to infer possible trends and causes.  The study of cancer [[epidemiology]] uses epidemiological methods to find the cause of [[cancer]] and to identify and develop improved treatments.

This area of study must contend with problems of [[lead time bias]] and [[length time bias]]. Lead time bias is the concept that early diagnosis may artificially inflate the survival statistics of a cancer, without really improving the natural history of the disease. Length bias is the concept that slower growing, more indolent tumors are more likely to be diagnosed by screening tests, but improvements in diagnosing more cases of indolent cancer may not translate into better patient outcomes after the implementation of screening programs. A related concern is [[overdiagnosis]], the tendency of screening tests to diagnose diseases that may not actually impact the patient's longevity. This problem especially applies to [[prostate cancer]] and [[Prostate cancer screening|PSA screening]].&lt;ref name="pmid15283896"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brawley OW |title=Prostate cancer screening: clinical applications and challenges |journal=Urol. Oncol. |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=353–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15283896 |doi=10.1016/j.urolonc.2004.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cancer researchers have argued that negative cancer clinical trials lack sufficient [[statistical power]] to discover a benefit to treatment. This may be due to fewer patients enrolled in the study than originally planned.&lt;ref name="pmid17687153"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bedard PL, Krzyzanowska MK, Pintilie M, Tannock IF |title=Statistical power of negative randomized controlled trials presented at American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meetings |journal=J.

== Organizations ==

State and regional [[cancer registry|cancer registries]] are organizations that abstract clinical data about cancer from patient medical records. These institutions provide information to state and national public health groups to help track trends in cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the largest and most important [[cancer registry|cancer registries]] is [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results]] (SEER), administered by the [[US Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/ |title=SEER Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results |accessdate=2007-11-02 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health information privacy concerns have led to the restricted use of [[cancer registry]] data in the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]&lt;ref name="lancetva"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Furlow B |title=Accuracy of US cancer surveillance under threat |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=762–3 |date=September 2007 |pmid=18348351 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470204507702589/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70258-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpva"&gt;{{cite web |title=VA Cancer Data Blockade May Imperil Surveillance |date=31 August 2007 |work= |publisher=Medpage Today |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/PublicHealth/tb/6563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytva"&gt;{{cite news |title=States and V.A. at Odds on Cancer Data |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |pages= |page= |date=10 October 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/health/10cancer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other institutions.&lt;ref name="iomhip"&gt;{{cite web|title=Negative Impact of HIPAA on Population-Based Cancer Registry Research: Update of a Brief Survey |date=14 June 2007 |work=IOM Presentation |publisher= |url=http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/43/927/HIPAA%20IOM%20meeting%20607r.Howe.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205190537/http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/43/927/HIPAA%20IOM%20meeting%20607r.Howe.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Cancer Society predicts that approximately 1,690,000 new cancer cases will be diagnosed and 577,000 Americans will ultimately die of cancer in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/cancer-facts-figures-2012/ |title = Cancer Facts and Figures 2012 |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==

[[Observational study|Observational epidemiological studies]] that show associations between risk factors and specific cancers mostly serve to generate hypotheses about potential interventions that could reduce cancer incidence or [[morbidity]]. [[Randomized controlled trial]]s then test whether hypotheses generated by epidemiological studies and laboratory research actually result in reduced cancer incidence and mortality. In many cases, findings from observational [[epidemiological]] studies are not confirmed by randomized controlled trials.

== Risk factors ==
[[File:Preventable Causes of Cancer in US.png|thumb|300px|The approximate relative levels of the preventable causes of cancer in the United States, taken from the article [[Cancer prevention]].]]

The most significant risk factor is age.  According to cancer researcher [[Robert A. Weinberg]], "If we lived long enough, sooner or later we all would get cancer."&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;{{cite news 
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/health/28cancer.html?pagewanted=all
| title = Unearthing Prehistoric Tumors, and Debate
| newspaper = ''The New York Times''
| date = 28 December 2010
| author = Johnson, George }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially all of the increase in cancer rates between prehistoric times and people who died in England between 1901 and 1905 is due to increased lifespans.&lt;ref name=Weinberg /&gt;

Although the age-related increase in cancer risk is well-documented, the age-related patterns of cancer are complex. Some types of cancer, like testicular cancer, have early-life incidence peaks, for reasons unknown. Besides, the rate of age-related increase in cancer incidence varies between cancer types with, for instance, prostate cancer incidence accelerating much faster than brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhaes JP | title = How ageing processes influence cancer | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 357–65 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23612461 | doi = 10.1038/nrc3497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of cancer deaths worldwide (and about 75-80% of cancers in the United States&lt;ref name=Doll&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doll R, Peto R |title=The causes of cancer: quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1191–308 |year=1981 |pmid=7017215 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/66.6.1192|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are due to potentially modifiable risk factors. The leading modifiable risk factors worldwide are:
* [[tobacco smoking]], which is strongly associated with lung cancer, mouth, and throat cancer;
* [[alcoholic beverage|drinking alcohol]], which is associated with a small increase in oral, esophageal, breast, liver and other cancers;
* a diet low in [[fruit]] and [[vegetables]],
* physical inactivity, which is associated with increased risk of colon, breast, and possibly other cancers
* [[obesity]], which is associated with colon, breast, endometrial, and possibly other cancers
* sexual transmission of [[human papillomavirus]], which causes [[cervical cancer]] and some forms of [[anal cancer]], vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, penile cancer, rectal cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer.

Men with cancer are twice as likely as women to have a modifiable risk factor for their disease.&lt;ref name=Danaei&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lifestyle and environmental factors known to affect cancer risk (either beneficially or detrimentally) include the use of exogenous hormones (e.g., [[hormone replacement therapy]] causes [[breast cancer]]), exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] and [[ultraviolet]] radiation, and certain occupational and chemical exposures.&lt;ref name=Uccello&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Uccello M, Malaguarnera G, Corriere T, Biondi A, Basile F, Malaguarnera M |title= Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in workers exposed to chemicals |journal=Hepat.

Every year, at least 200,000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace.&lt;ref name=WHO_occup&gt;{{cite press release |title=WHO calls for prevention of cancer through healthy workplaces |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2007-04-27 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2007/np19/en/index.html |accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as [[pleural]] and [[peritoneal mesothelioma]]  from inhaling asbestos fibers, or [[leukemia]] from exposure to [[benzene]] at their workplaces.&lt;ref name=WHO_occup/&gt; Currently, most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world.&lt;ref name=WHO_occup/&gt; It is estimated that approximately 20,000 cancer deaths and 40,000 new cases of cancer each year in the U.S. are attributable to occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cancer/|title=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health- Occupational Cancer |accessdate=2007-10-13|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rates and mortality ==
In the U.S. cancer is second only to [[cardiovascular disease]] as the leading cause of death;&lt;ref name="Jemal"/&gt; in the UK it is the leading cause of death.&lt;ref name="BBC2000-news"&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1015657.stm Cancer: Number one killer] (9 November 2000). ''BBC News online''. Retrieved 2005-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In many developing countries cancer [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (insofar as this can be measured) appears much lower, most likely because of the higher death rates due to infectious disease or injury. With the increased control over [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in some Third World countries, incidence of cancer is expected to rise; in the Eastern Mediterranean region, for example, cancer incidence is expected to increase by 100% to 180% in the next 15 years due to increases in life expectancy, an increasing proportion of elderly people, and the successful control of childhood disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khatib O, Aljurf M |title=Cancer prevention and control in the Eastern Mediterranean region: the need for a public health approach |journal=Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=44–52 |year=2008 |pmid=20063528 |doi=10.1016/s1658-3876(08)50060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is termed the epidemiologic transition in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] terminology.

Cancer epidemiology closely mirrors risk factor spread in various countries. [[Hepatocellular carcinoma]] ([[liver]] cancer) is rare in the West but is the main cancer in China and neighbouring countries, most likely due to the [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] presence of [[hepatitis B]] and [[aflatoxin]] in that population. Similarly, with [[tobacco smoking]] becoming more common in various Third World countries, [[lung cancer]] incidence has increased in a parallel fashion.

=== India ===
According to the National Cancer Registry Programme of the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR), more than 1300 Indians die every day due to cancer. Between 2012 and 2014, the mortality rate due to cancer increased by approximately 6%. In 2012,  there were 478,180 deaths out of 2,934,314 cases reported. In 2013 there were 465,169 deaths out of  3,016,628 cases. In 2014, 491,598 people died in out of 2,820,179 cases.&lt;ref name="Delhi Daily News"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cancer kills 1300 Indians every day | website=Delhi Daily News | url=http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Cancer-kills-1300-Indians-every-day-1431864460/ | accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Population Cancer Registry of Indian Council of Medical Research, the incidence and mortality of cancer is highest in the north-eastern region of the country.&lt;ref&gt;National Cancer Registry Programme (2013). Three-year report of population based cancer registries:2009-2011. NCDIR-ICMR, Bangalore.&lt;/ref&gt; Breast cancer is the most common, and stomach cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer for the population as a whole. Breast cancer and lung cancer kill the most women and men respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

=== Canada ===

In Canada, as of 2007, cancer is the number one cause of death, contributing to 29.6% of all deaths in the country. The second highest cause of death is cardiovascular diseases resulting in 21.5% of deaths. As of 2011, prostate cancer was the most common form of cancer among males (about 28% of all new cases) and breast cancer the most common in females (also about 28% of all new cases).

The leading cause of death in both males and females is lung cancer, which contributes to 26.8% of all cancer deaths. Statistics indicate that between the ages of 20 and 50 years, the incidence rate of cancer is higher amongst women whereas after 50 years of age, the incidence rate increases in men. Predictions by the Canadian Cancer Society indicate that with time, there will be an increase in the rates of incidence of cancer for both males and females. Cancer will thus continue to be a persistent issue in years to come.

=== United States ===

In the United States, cancer is responsible for 25% of all deaths with 30% of these from lung cancer. The most commonly occurring cancer in men is [[prostate cancer]] (about 25% of new cases) and in women is [[breast cancer]] (also about 25%). Cancer can occur in children and adolescents, but it is uncommon (about 150 cases per million in the U.S.), with [[leukemia]] the most common.&lt;ref name="Jemal"/&gt; In the first year of life the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] is about 230 cases per million in the U.S., with the most common being [[neuroblastoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SEER|1999|loc=[http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/childhood/infant.pdf Cancer among infants](PDF) pp. 149–156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 2004-2008 in the United States indicates that the overall age-adjusted [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of cancer was approximately 460 per 100,000 men and women per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets: All Sites] by [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results]], a project of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, posted October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer is responsible for about 25% of all deaths in the U.S., and is a major [[public health]] problem in many parts of the world. The statistics below are estimates for the U.S. in 2008, and may vary substantially in other countries. They exclude basal and squamous cell skin cancers, and [[carcinoma in situ]] in locations other than the urinary bladder.&lt;ref name="Jemal" /&gt; As seen, breast/prostate cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer are responsible for approximately half of cancer incidence. The same applies for cancer mortality, but with lung cancer replacing breast/prostate cancer as the main cause.

In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics|title=Cancer Statistics|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidence of a second cancer in survivors===
In the developed world, one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetimes.  If all cancer patients survived and cancer occurred randomly, the normal lifetime odds of developing a second primary cancer (not the first cancer spreading to a new site) would be one in nine.&lt;ref name=Rheingold03 /&gt;  However, [[cancer survivor]]s have an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer, and the odds are about two in nine.&lt;ref name=Rheingold03 /&gt;  About half of these second primaries can be attributed to the normal one-in-nine risk associated with random chance.&lt;ref name=Rheingold03 /&gt;

The increased risk is believed to be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, such as the person's genetic profile, alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, and environmental exposures, and partly due, in some cases, to the treatment for the first cancer, which might have included mutagenic chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation.&lt;ref name=Rheingold03 /&gt;  Cancer survivors may also be more likely to comply with recommended screening, and thus may be more likely than average to detect cancers.&lt;ref name=Rheingold03&gt;{{cite book

== Children ==

[[Childhood cancer]] and cancer in adolescents is rare (about 150 cases per million yearly in the US). [[Leukemia]] (usually [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]) is the most common cancer in children aged 1–14 in the U.S., followed by the [[brain tumor|central nervous system cancers]], [[neuroblastoma]], [[Wilms' tumor]], and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="Jemal"/&gt; Statistics from the SEER program of the US [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]] demonstrate that childhood cancers increased 19% between 1975 and 1990, mainly due to an increased incidence in acute leukemia. Since 1990, incidence rates have decreased.&lt;ref name="SEER1999"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Ries LA, Smith MA, Gurney JG, Linet M, Tamra T, Young JL, Bunin GR |year=1999 |title= Cancer Incidence and Survival among Children and Adolescents, United States SEER program 1975–1995 |publisher= National Cancer Institute, SEER Program |id=NIH Pub. No. 99-4649 |location=Bethesda MD |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/childhood/ |ref={{harvid|SEER|1999}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infants ==

The age of peak incidence of cancer in children occurs during the first year of life, in [[infant]]s.  The average annual incidence in the United States, 1975–1995, was 233 per million infants.&lt;ref name="SEER1999"/&gt;  Several estimates of incidence exist.  According to SEER,&lt;ref name="SEER1999"/&gt; in the United States:
*[[Neuroblastoma]] comprised 28% of infant cancer cases and was the most common malignancy among these young children (65 per million infants).
*The [[Leukaemia|leukemias]] as a group (41 per million infants) represented the next most common type of cancer, comprising 17% of all cases.
*[[brain tumor|Central nervous system malignancies]] comprised 13% of infant cancer, with an average annual incidence rate of nearly 30 per million infants.
*The average annual incidence rates for malignant germ cell and malignant soft tissue tumors were essentially the same at 15 per million infants.  Each comprised about 6% of infant cancer.

[[Teratoma]] (a [[germ cell tumor]]) often is cited as the most common tumor in this age group, but most teratomas are surgically removed while still benign, hence not necessarily cancer. Prior to the widespread routine use of prenatal ultrasound examinations, the incidence of [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s diagnosed at birth was 25 to 29 per million births&lt;!-- 1:40,000 to 1:35,000 --&gt;.

Female and male infants have essentially the same overall cancer incidence rates, a notable difference compared to older children.

White infants have higher cancer rates than black infants.  Leukemias accounted for a substantial proportion of this difference: the average annual rate for white infants (48.7 per million) was 66% higher than for
black infants (29.4 per million).&lt;ref name="SEER1999"/&gt;

Relative survival for infants is very good for neuroblastoma, [[Wilms' tumor]] and [[retinoblastoma]], and fairly good (80%) for leukemia, but not for most other types of cancer.

'''Ernesto Luigi Lomasti''' (29 October 1959 &amp;ndash; 12 June 1979) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mountaineer]] and [[alpini|alpino]] skier.  He is regarded as one of the Italian pioneers of [[climbing]] as a sport.&lt;ref name="nonsitornaindietro"&gt;[http://searchworks.stanford.edu/vufind/Record/7630952 Beltrame, L. (2008).

The pillar today is named Lomasti pillar.&lt;ref name="arnad"&gt;[http://www.guidealpinearnad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=65 Arrampicare ad Arnad - Le origini ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pillar"&gt;[http://www.rudijanin.com/lomasti.htm Lomasti Pillar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pillar2"&gt;[http://www.onsight.it/index.php?module=Pagesetter&amp;func=viewpub&amp;tid=3&amp;pid=20 Lomasti Pillar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topopazzoclimbing.com/pilastro_lomati.html Lomasti pillar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ernesto Lomasti was born in [[Udine]] but spent his early life in [[Pontebba]] and [[Tarvisio]], where he attended the local school. During childhood, he contracted [[pertussis]] and his parents and uncle used to bring him up on high hills.&lt;ref name="nonsitornaindietro" /&gt;
On 29 June 1973, he left middle school and passed the exam, earning his father a climb on the [[Julian Alps|Jôf di Montasio]], Montasio along with a local [[mountain guide]].
Following an accident at age three, he severely damaged his hearing in his right [[ear]]. This [[disability]] would severely impair his climbing career because of having difficulties hearing [[lead climbing|climbing]] instructions. The problem was solved on 29 August 1977 when he decided to undergo surgery.&lt;ref name="nonsitornaindietro"/&gt; He served under the [[alpini|Alpini corps]] attending the SMALP (alpini military school)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalp.it/nonsitorrnabook.htm Enrico Lomasti ,SMALP]&lt;/ref&gt; until his sudden death.

==Climbing achievements==
Lomasti is remembered for a series of ascents of extraordinary difficulty&lt;ref name="firstwinterascent"&gt;[http://www.planetmountain.com/english/News/shownews1.lasso?l=2&amp;keyid=36681 There's no turning back: Cima Grande della Scala, first winter ascent of Lomasti - Mazzillis by Vuerich and Laurencig]&lt;/ref&gt;
His life as a climber spanned for three years, primarily on [[Julian Alps]] from 1976 to 1979, with an impressive list of great gradients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismoruralefvg.it/page.php?path=3_16_69_96&amp;l=2 Ernesto Lomasti life and ascents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ascents"&gt;[http://www.tarvisiano.org/jsptarvisiano/cont.jsp?nodes=1-18-19-25&amp;doc=569 Enrico Lomasti ascent list]&lt;/ref&gt; He is remembered especially for [[Cima Grande della Scala]],&lt;ref name="cimagrande"&gt;[http://picasaweb.google.com/ALPmagazine/InvernaleAllaCimaGrandeDellaScala?feat=directlink# Cima Grande della Scala photos of first winter ascent]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106140255/http://picasaweb.google.com/ALPmagazine/InvernaleAllaCimaGrandeDellaScala?feat=directlink |date=November 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; north anti-peak, on 3 September 1978,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucavuerich.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=36:non-si-torna-indietro&amp;catid=24:arrampicata Ernesto Lomasti way, Cima grande della Scala]&lt;/ref&gt; All his ascents were conquered using hard boots, as he apparently never had the chance to use light shoes.&lt;ref name="nonsitornaindietro" /&gt;

{{About|a type of horse used for riding to hounds|horse show competition|Show hunter|Fox hunting|Fox hunting}}
[[Image:Hubertusjagt-2004.jpg|thumb|A group of field hunters in Denmark.]]

A '''field hunter''', or a '''fox hunter''', is a type of horse used in the hunt field for [[fox hunting]] and [[stag hunting]]. 

==Characteristics==
The field hunter may be of any breed, but should possess stamina, a level head, and bravery. The horse should have a safe jump, so as not to get caught on any of the solid obstacles found in the hunt field. The type of terrain is also an important factor: wide open, flat land is generally best for horses of a [[Thoroughbred]] type, while rockier, more unforgiving land may be best suited by a draft-cross or tougher breed.

==Field hunter trials==
Field hunter trials are regularly held to test these horses, and have become a popular form of equestrian competition. Often the horses are judged over several days of fox hunting, with the best of the group performing in the "handy hunter" class. The handy hunter class may ask for the horse and rider pair to trot a log, open and close a gate while mounted, jump several fences, and for the rider to dismount and remount. The horse is judged on its manners, way of going, as well as its suitability as a hunter.

==The field hunter vs. the show hunter==
In some ways, the field hunter is more similar to a good cross-country horse seen in [[eventing]] than a show-ring hunter, as it must gallop and jump over varied terrain, jump ditches, coops, up and down banks, and occasionally go through water.

Unlike the field hunter, the horse known in the US as a [[show hunter]] and in the UK as a [[Show hunter (British)|working hunter]] performs in a ring, usually over a course of 8-10 fences. The judging of the American show hunter is based on the requirements of a horse in the hunt field, focusing on the horse's manners, movement, jumping form, rhythm, and smoothness around the course. Show hunters in the US are usually [[warmblood]] or Thoroughbred types. They do not have to have the bravery required of the field hunter, nor do they travel over the same type of terrain, as the field or arena is usually fairly level. Although the fences in a show hunter course are usually "natural" poles and standards, as opposed to the brightly colored fences seen in [[show jumping]], the show hunter course does not include rock walls, ditches, or banks that might be seen in the hunt field. The British working hunter is not required to jump obstacles exactly like those met in the hunting field, although a [[Water (obstacle)|water tray]] is sometimes used to simulate a ditch, and natural dips in the ground, banks etc. are often incorporated into the course in order to make it more challenging.

==Point-to-point==
{{See also|National Hunt Racing}}
Horses of field hunter type may also compete in certain race completions such as [[Point-to-point (steeplechase)|point-to-pointing]].  In the United Kingdom, with the exception of Hunt Members races, all the horses that compete in [[Point-to-point (steeplechase)|point-to-point]] must be registered by [[Weatherbys]] - in the General Stud Book or Non-Thoroughbred Register. Horses and jockeys must have qualified with a pack of [[foxhound]]s, [[harrier (dog)|harrier]]s, [[bloodhound]]s or draghounds by [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ride-to-hounds "riding to hounds"]. Horses must be ridden to hounds on four or more occasions during the hunting season that immediately precedes the point-to-point season, and belong to a member, subscriber or farmer of a recognised pack.{{sfn|Weatherbys  staff|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">A '''fitness boot camp''' is a type of group [[physical training]] program conducted by [[gym]]s, [[personal trainer]]s, and former [[military personnel]]. These programs are designed to build strength and fitness through a variety of types of [[exercise]]. Indoor and outdoor boot camp workouts became popular in the United States in the late 1990s. Fitness boot camps as outdoor group fitness classes grew in popularity in the 2000s. These originated independently in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

In the United States, the television series [[Boot Camp (TV series)|Boot Camp]] aired in 2001. In the United Kingdom, [[reality television]] program [[Celebrity Fit Club]], which involved boot camp-style fitness, aired from 2002–2006. The series was brought over to the United States in 2005 as [[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]] which aired until 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Format ==
Boot camp training often commences with dynamic [[stretching]] and [[running]], followed by a wide variety of [[interval training]], including lifting weights/objects, pulling rubber [[suspension training|TRX straps]], pushups/situps, [[plyometrics]], and various types of intense explosive routines. Sessions usually finish with [[yoga stretching]]. Many other exercises using [[weight training|weights]] and/or body weight, similar to [[CrossFit]] routines, are used to lose [[body fat]], increase [[cardiovascular]] efficiency, increase [[Physical strength|strength]], and help people get into a routine of regular [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monge, Stefanie|title=Fitness boot camps are a big business in Omaha|url=http://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/news/2008/01/09/3202025.htm|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|date=January 9, 2008|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs offer [[nutrition]] advice as well. It is called "boot camp" because it trains groups of people, may be outdoors, and may or may not be similar to [[military basic training]].

The term "''boot camp''" is currently used in the fitness industry to describe group fitness classes that promote fat loss, [[camaraderie]], and team effort. They are designed to push people a little bit further than they would normally push themselves in the gym alone. Boot Camps are sometimes organized outdoors in [[park]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen, Matthews|title=Open-air exercise: Fitness boot camps hit the parks|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_168093853?keyword=secondarystory|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Eagle-Tribune]]|date=June 17, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archivedate=June 1, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601122401/http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_168093853?keyword=secondarystory}}&lt;/ref&gt; using bodyweight exercises like [[push up]]s, [[squat (exercise)|squats]], [[suspension training]] and [[burpee (exercise)|burpees]], interspersed with [[running]] and competitive games. The idea is that everyone involved works at their own pace as they team up and work towards one goal, either in pairs, small teams of three or four, or even two teams head on.

Boot camps provide [[social support]] for those taking part. This provides a different environment for those exercisers who get bored in a gym and so find it hard to develop a habit of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/34033/jssarticle.pdf|title=Effects of Perceived Fitness Level of Exercise Partner on Intensity of Exertion|journal=Journal of Social Sciences|volume=6|issue=1|pages=50–54|year=2010|first=Thomas G|last=Plante|first2=Meghan|last2=Madden|first3=Sonia|last3=Mann|first4=Grace|last4=Lee|first5=Allison|last5=Hardesty|first6=Nick|last6=Gable|first7=Allison|last7=Terry|first8=Greg|last8=Kaplow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants make friends and socialize as they exercise, although how strict the trainers or [[drill instructors]] in charge can be will depend on the company running the camp. Members of fitness boot camps are usually tested for fitness on the first day and then retested at the end of the camp, which usually runs for between 4 and 6 weeks.

Fitness boot camps are often based on the military style of training, although that has started changing over the last few years. An advantage of a boot camp is that the large group dynamic will often help motivate the participants. A growing trend in fitness boot camps are the indoor locations which prove to be climate proof and provide a better workout environment for the members. Additionally, some camps include extracurricular fitness activities off-site.

There are many other benefits of a fitness boot camp, which includes [[mental health]]. It has long been known that regular aerobic exercise can help to reduce [[high blood pressure]], [[hypertension]] and combat [[stress (biology)|stress]]. Part of this is due to the release of [[endorphins]], which act as a mood elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bothum, Kelly|title=Fitness boot camp an intense 4 weeks|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070116/ENG11/301160019/-1/NEWS01|work=[[The News Journal]]|date=January 16, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2009|archivedate=May 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529001304/http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070116/ENG11/301160019/-1/NEWS01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "Holistic Bootcamps" provide the mental coaching required to sustain motivation after people leave the camp. Themed fitness bootcamps often consist of the use of one particular training implement to the exclusion of others.{{cn|date=September 2013}} [[Kettlebell]]s are the preferred tool for kettlebell fitness bootcamps run by RKC instructors and TRX [[suspension training|suspension trainers]] are the preferred tools for TRX instructors.{{cn|date=September 2013}} Boxing themed fitness bootcamps often use heavy bags.

'''Glomerulonephritis''' ('''GN'''), also known as '''glomerular nephritis''', is a term used to refer to several [[kidney]] diseases (usually affecting both kidneys).  Many of the diseases are characterised by [[inflammation]] either of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]] or of the small blood vessels in the kidneys, hence the name,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000045097|glomerulonephritis}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all diseases necessarily have an inflammatory component.

As it is not strictly a single disease, its presentation depends on the specific disease entity: it may present with isolated [[hematuria]] and/or [[proteinuria]] (blood or protein in the [[urine]]); or as a [[nephrotic syndrome]], a [[nephritic syndrome]], [[acute kidney injury]], or [[chronic kidney disease]].

They are categorized into several different pathological patterns, which are broadly grouped into non-proliferative or proliferative types. Diagnosing the pattern of GN is important because the outcome and treatment differs in different types. Primary causes are intrinsic to the kidney. Secondary causes are associated with certain infections (bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens), drugs, systemic disorders ([[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]], vasculitis), or diabetes.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Gray1130.svg|thumb|left|A [[glomerulus_(kidney)|glomerulus]], a functional unit that represents the first step in the filtration of [[blood]] and generation of [[urine]].]]

Glomerulonephritis refers to an inflammation of the [[glomerulus_(kidney)|glomerulus]], which is the unit involved in filtration in the kidney. This inflammation typically results in one or both of the [[nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic]] or [[nephritic syndrome]]s.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|500}}

===Nephrotic syndrome===
&lt;!-- please do not move GN subtypes here, as they may result in mixed presentations --&gt;
{{Main|Nephrotic syndrome}}
The nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the finding of [[edema]] in a person with [[proteinuria|increased protein in the urine]] and [[hypoalbuminemia|decreased protein in the blood]], with [[hyperlipidemia|increased fat in the blood]]. Inflammation that affects the cells surrounding the glomerulus, [[podocyte]]s, increases the permeability to [[protein]]s, resulting in an increase in excreted proteins. When the amount of proteins excreted in the urine exceeds the liver's ability to compensate, fewer proteins are detected in the blood - in particular [[albumin]], which makes up the majority of circulating proteins. With decreased proteins in the blood, there is a decrease in the [[oncotic pressure]] of the blood. This results in edema, as the oncotic pressure in tissue remains the same. Although decreased intravascular oncotic (i.e. osmotic) pressure partially explains the patient's edema, more recent studies have shown that extensive sodium retention in the distal nephron (collecting duct) is the predominant cause of water retention and edema in the nephrotic syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;The Nephrotic Syndrome
Stephan R. Orth, M.D., and Eberhard Ritz, M.D.
N Engl J Med 1998; 338:1202-1211 April 23, 1998 DOI: 10.1056/NEJM199804233381707&lt;/ref&gt; This is worsened by the secretion of the hormone [[aldosterone]] by the adrenal gland, which is secreted in response to the decrease in circulating blood and causes [[sodium]] and [[water]] retention. [[Hyperlipidemia]] is thought to be a result of the increased activity of the liver.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|549}}

===Nephritic syndrome===
[[File:Filtration barrier.svg|thumb|right|[[Podocyte]]s, cells which line the glomerulus, are negatively charged and have small gaps, preventing the filtration of large molecules. When damaged by [[inflammation]], this can result in an increased permeability to [[protein]]s]]
{{Main|Nephritic syndrome}}
The nephritic syndrome is characterised by [[haematuria|blood in the urine]] (especially [[Urinary cast|Red blood cell casts]] with dysmorphic red blood cells) and a [[oligouria|decrease in the amount of urine]] in the presence of [[hypertension]]. In this syndrome, inflammatory damage to cells lining the glomerulus are thought to result in destruction of the [[epithelium|epithelial]] barrier, leading to blood being found in the urine. At the same time, reactive changes, e.g. proliferation of mesangial cells,{{which|date=November 2013}} may result in a decrease in kidney blood flow, resulting in a decrease in the production of urine. The [[renin–angiotensin system]] may be subsequently activated, because of the decrease in perfusion of [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]], which may result in hypertension.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|554}}

==Nonproliferative==
This is characterised by forms of glomerulonephritis in which the number of cells is not changed. These forms usually result in the [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Causes include:

===Minimal change disease===
{{Main|Minimal change disease}}
[[Minimal change disease]] is characterised as a cause of [[nephrotic syndrome]] without visible changes in the glomerulus on microscopy. Minimal change disease typically presents with  [[edema]], an [[proteinuria|increase in proteins passed from urine]] and decrease in blood protein levels, and an increase in circulating [[lipid]]s (i.e., [[nephrotic syndrome]]) and is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in children. Although no changes may be visible by light microscopy, changes on [[electron microscopy]] within the glomerules may show a fusion of the foot processes of the [[podocyte]]s (cells lining the basement membrane of the capillaries of glomerulus). It is typically managed with [[corticosteroid]]s and does not progress to [[chronic kidney disease]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|500}}&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007/&gt;{{rp|550}}

===Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis===
{{Main|Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis}}

[[Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] is characterised by a [[fibrosis|sclerosis]] of segments of some glomerules. It is likely to present as a nephrotic syndrome. This form of glomerulonephritis may be associated with conditions such as [[HIV]] and [[heroin]] abuse, or inherited as [[Alport syndrome]]. The cause of about 20–30% of focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis is unknown. On microscopy, affected glomerules may show an increase in [[hyalin]], a pink and homogenous material, [[lipid|fat cells]], an increase in the mesangial matrix and collagen. Treatment may involve [[corticosteroid]]s, but up to half of people with focal segmental glomerulonephritis continue to have progressive deterioration of kidney function, ending in kidney failure.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|550–551}}

===Membranous glomerulonephritis===
{{Main|Membranous glomerulonephritis}}

[[Membranous glomerulonephritis]] may cause either [[nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic]] or a [[nephritic syndrome|nephritic]] picture. About two-thirds are associated with auto-antibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor, but other associations include [[cancer]]s of the lung and bowel, infections such as [[hepatitis B]] and [[malaria]], drugs including [[penicillamine]], and connective tissue diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. Individuals with [[cerebral shunt]]s are at risk of developing [[shunt nephritis]], which frequently produces MGN.

Microscopically, MGN is characterized by a thickened [[glomerular basement membrane]] without a hyperproliferation of the glomerular cells. [[Immunofluorescence]] demonstrates diffuse granular uptake of [[IgG]]. The basement membrane may completely surround the granular deposits, forming a "spike and dome" pattern. Tubules also display the symptoms of a typical Type III hypersensitivity reaction, which causes the endothelial cells to proliferate, which can be seen under a light microscope with a PAS stain.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlus|000472|Membranous nephropathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prognosis follows the rule of thirds: one-third remain with MGN indefinitely, one-third remit, and one-third progress to [[end-stage kidney failure]]. As the glomerulonephritis progresses, the tubules of the kidney become infected, leading to atrophy and hyalinisation. The kidney appears to shrink. Treatment with [[corticosteroid]]s is attempted if the disease progresses.

In extremely rare cases, the disease has been known to run in families, usually passed down through the females. This condition, similarly, is called Familial Membranous Glomerulonephritis. There have only been about nine documented cases in the world.

===Thin basement membrane disease===
{{Main|Thin basement membrane disease}}
[[Thin basement membrane disease]] is an [[autosomal]] dominant inherited disease characterized by thin glomerular basement membranes on electron microscopy. It is a benign condition that causes persistent microscopic [[hematuria]]. This also may cause proteinuria which is usually mild and overall prognosis is excellent. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Proliferative==
Proliferative glomerulonephritis is characterised by an increased number of cells in the glomerulus. These forms usually present with a triad of [[haematuria|blood in the urine]], [[oliguria|decreased urine production]], and [[hypertension]], the [[nephritic syndrome]]. These forms usually progress to [[end-stage kidney failure]] (ESKF) over weeks to years (depending on type).

===IgA nephropathy===
{{Main|IgA nephropathy}}

[[IgA nephropathy]], also known as ''Berger's disease'', is the most common type of glomerulonephritis, and generally presents with isolated visible or occult hematuria, occasionally combined with low grade proteinuria, and rarely causes a [[nephritic syndrome]] characterised by [[heavy proteinuria|protein in the urine]], and visible [[hematuria|blood in the urine]]. IgA nephropathy is classically described as a self-resolving form in young adults several days after a respiratory infection. It is characterised by deposits of [[IgA]] in the [[mesangium|space between glomerular capillaries]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|501}}&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|554–555}}

[[Henoch–Schönlein purpura]] refers to a form of IgA nephropathy, typically affecting children, characterised by a rash of [[petechiae|small bruises]] affecting the buttocks and lower legs, with abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|501}}

===Post-infectious===
{{Main|Post-infectious glomerulonephritis}}

[[Post-infectious glomerulonephritis]] can occur after essentially any infection, but classically occurs after infection with the bacteria ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''. It typically occurs 1–4 weeks after a [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] infection with this bacterium, and is likely to present with malaise, a slight [[fever]], [[nausea]] and a mild [[nephritic syndrome]] of moderately increased blood pressure, gross haematuria, and smoky-brown urine. Circulating [[immune complex]]es that deposit in the glomerules may lead to an inflammatory reaction.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Vinay |editor-last=Kumar|title=Robbins basic pathology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|554–555}}

Diagnosis may be made on clinical findings or through [[antistreptolysin O]] antibodies found in the blood. A biopsy is seldom done, and the disease is likely to self-resolve in children in 1–4 weeks, with a poorer prognosis if adults are affected.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Nicki R. |editor-last=Colledge |editor-first2=Brian R. |editor-last2=Walker |editor-first3=Stuart H. |editor-last3=Ralston |others=illust.

===Membranoproliferative===
{{Main|Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis}}
Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), also known as ''mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis,''&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;{{rp|502}} is characterised by an increase in the number of cells in the glomerulus, and alterations in the glomerular [[basement membrane]]. These forms present with the [[nephritic syndrome]], [[hypocomplementemia]], and have a poor prognosis. Two primary subtypes exist:&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|552–553}}
* Type 1 MPGN is caused by circulating immune complexes, typically secondary to [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C|C]], or other chronic or recurring infections. Circulating immune complexes may activate the [[complement system]], leading to inflammation and an influx of inflammatory cells.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|552–553}}
* Type 2 MPGN, also known as ''Dense Deposit Disease'', is characterised by an excessive activation of the complement system. The C3 Nephritic Factor [[autoantibody]] stabilizes [[C3-convertase]], which may lead to an excessive activation of complement.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|553}}

===Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis===
{{Main|Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis}}
[[Image:Crescentic_glomerulonephritis_PAS_and_IF.png|thumb|[[Crescentic glomerulonephritis]] induced by infective [[endocarditis]] on [[Periodic acid-Schiff stain|PAS staining]] and [[immunofluorescence]]. PAS staining (left) demonstrated circumferential and cellular crescent formation with interstitial nephritis.

[[Image:Crescentic glomerulonephritis Periodic acid silver methanamine stain.JPEG|thumb|Photomicrograph of [[renal biopsy]] showing crescent formation and tuft narrowing. [[Periodic acid silver methenamine stain]].]]
[[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]], also known as ''crescentic GN'', is characterised by a rapid, progressive deterioration in kidney function. People with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may present with a [[nephritic syndrome]]. In management, [[steroid]] therapy is sometimes used, although the prognosis remains poor.&lt;ref name=COUSER1999 /&gt; Three main subtypes are recognised:&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|557–558}}
* Type 1 is [[Goodpasture syndrome]], an [[autoimmune disease]] also affecting the [[lung]]. In Goodpasture syndrome, [[IgG]] antibodies directed against the glomerular [[basement membrane]]  trigger an inflammatory reaction, causing a [[nephritic syndrome]] and [[haemoptysis|the coughing up of blood]].&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|557}} High dose immunosuppression is required (intravenous [[methylprednisolone]]) and cyclophosphamide, plus plasmapheresis. Immunohistochemistry staining of tissue specimens shows linear IgG deposits.
* Type 2 is characterised by immune-complex-mediated damage, and may be associated with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], post-infective glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and [[Henoch–Schönlein purpura|IgA vasculitis]].&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|558}}
* Type 3 rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also called ''pauciimmune type'', is associated with causes of [[vasculitides|vascular inflammation]] including [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (GPA) and [[microscopic polyangiitis]]. No immune deposits can be seen on staining, however blood tests may be positive for the [[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody|ANCA]] antibody.&lt;ref name=ROBBINS2007 /&gt;{{rp|558–559}}

Histopathologically, the majority of glomeruli present "crescents". Formation of crescents is initiated by passage of fibrin into the Bowman space as a result of increased permeability of glomerular basement membrane. Fibrin stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells of Bowman capsule, and an influx of monocytes. Rapid growing and fibrosis of crescents compresses the capillary loops and decreases the Bowman space, which leads to kidney failure within weeks or months. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Diagnosis==

}}'''Gunning S. Bedford''' (1806 - 5 September 1870) was a medical writer, teacher and founder of the United States' first obstetrical clinic for those too poor to pay a doctor's fee.

Dr. Bedford graduated in 1825 at [[Mount Saint Mary's University]] (then Mount Saint Mary's College), [[Emmitsburg]], Maryland, and took his medical degree from [[Rutgers College]]. He spent two years studying abroad and in 1833 became professor of obstetrics in [[Medical University of South Carolina|Charleston Medical College]]. After this he became a professor in the Albany Medical College.

He later founded the University Medical College in which he established an obstetrical clinic for those too poor to afford a doctor which was the first of in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02386a.htm Gunning S. Bedford] - [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from teaching for health reasons in 1862 and he died in 1870. His funeral panegyric was preached by Archbishop [[John McCloskey]] a fellow student at Mount St. Mary's.

Two books written by him, "Diseases of Women" and "Practice of Obstetrics" went through a number of editions, were translated into French and German and adopted as textbooks in American schools.

His son Gunning S. Bedford (1837–1893) was Assistant [[New York County District Attorney]] under [[A. Oakey Hall]] from 1865 to 1868, a New York City judge from 1869 to 1878, and again Asst. D.A. under [[Randolph B. Martine]], [[John R. Fellows]] and [[De Lancey Nicoll]] from 1885 until his death.

His uncle [[Gunning Bedford, Jr.|Gunning Bedford]] was one of the framers of the United States Constitution; another uncle, also named [[Gunning Bedford, Sr.|Gunning Bedford]], was an aide-de-camp to General [[George Washington]] and later became the Governor of Delaware.

Dr. '''Haing Somnang Ngor''' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ហាំង សំណាង ង៉ោ; {{zh|c=吳漢潤|p=Wú Hànrùn}}; March 22, 1940 – February 25, 1996) was a [[Cambodian American]] [[gynecologist]], [[obstetrician]], actor and author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-04-27/news/9604270067_1_dith-pran-killing-fields-tak-sun-tan|title=3 Teens Are Charged With Murder of 'Killing Fields' Actor Haing Ngor|website=Chicago Tribune|first=Richard|last=Liefer|date=April 27, 1996|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best remembered for winning the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 1985 for his debut performance in the film ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984), in which he portrayed Cambodian journalist and refugee [[Dith Pran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ngor, Haing S. |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9113310/Ngor,%20Haing%20S |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720152202/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9113310/Ngor,%20Haing%20S |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-20 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngor is the first (and to date, only) actor of Asian descent to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He survived three terms in [[Cambodian genocide|Cambodian prison camps]], using his medical knowledge to keep himself alive by eating beetles, termites, and scorpions; he eventually crawled between [[Khmer Rouge]] and [[Vietnam]]ese lines to safety in a [[Red Cross]] refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-day-haing-s-ngor-won-the-oscar|title=The day Haing S.

Ngor continued acting for the rest of his life, most notably in ''[[My Life (film)|My Life]]'' (1993), portraying spiritual healer Mr. Ho opposite [[Michael Keaton]] and [[Nicole Kidman]].

==Life under the Khmer Rouge==
Born in Samrong Young, Bati district, Takeo province, [[Cambodia]], Ngor trained as a surgeon and [[gynecologist]]. He was practicing in the capital, [[Phnom Penh]], in 1975 when [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]] seized control of the country and proclaimed it [[Democratic Kampuchea]].&lt;ref name="HN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Biography |publisher=Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation |url=http://www.haingngorfoundation.org/ |accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was compelled to conceal his education, medical skills, and even the fact that he wore [[spectacles|glasses]] to avoid the new regime's intense hostility to intellectuals and professionals. He was expelled from Phnom Penh along with the bulk of its two million inhabitants as part of the Khmer Rouge's "[[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]]" social experiment and imprisoned in a concentration camp along with his wife, My-Huoy, who subsequently died giving birth. Although a gynecologist, he was unable to treat his wife, who required a [[Caesarean section]], because he would have been exposed, and both he and his wife (as well as the child) would very probably have been killed.&lt;ref name="MN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Court Revives Convictions in Murder of 'Killing Fields' Survivor |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2005/tanx070805.htm |work=Metropolitan News |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Ngor worked as a doctor in a refugee camp in [[Thailand]] and left with his niece for the United States on August 30, 1980.&lt;ref name="HN"/&gt; In America, Ngor was unable to resume his medical practice,&lt;ref name="yellowbridge.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Famous Chinese-Americans in Entertainment: Acting; Haing S. Ngor |url=http://www.yellowbridge.com/people/actingM.html |work=Yellow Bridge |accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he did not remarry.

In 1988, he wrote ''Haing Ngor: A Cambodian Odyssey'', describing his life under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In the second edition of ''Survival in the Killing Fields,'' Roger Warner, Ngor's co-author, adds an epilogue telling the story of Ngor's life after winning the Academy Award.

The Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation was founded in his honor in 1997 to assist in raising funds for Cambodian aid. As part of his [[humanitarian]] efforts, Ngor built an elementary school and operated a small sawmill that provided jobs and an income for local families.&lt;ref name="HN"/&gt; Ngor's niece, Sophia Ngor Demetri, who testified at the trial of his murderers and with whom he arrived in the U.S., is the current president of the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foundation |publisher=Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation |url=http://www.haingngorfoundation.org/ |accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
Ngor, despite having no previous acting experience, was cast as [[Dith Pran]] in ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984), a role for which he won (among many honors) the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], becoming the first (and only) Asian to win Best Supporting Actor in debut performance,&lt;ref name="yellowbridge.com"/&gt; the second Asian actor to ever [[List of Asian Academy Award winners and nominees|win an Oscar]], and one of very few amateur actors to win an Oscar. Ngor was not initially interested in the role of Dith Pran, but interviews with the filmmakers changed his mind, as he recalled that he promised his late wife to tell Cambodia's story to the world. After appearing in ''The Killing Fields'' he told [[People magazine|''People'' magazine]], "I wanted to show the world how deep starvation is in Cambodia, how many people die under communist regime. My heart is satisfied. I have done something perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donahue |first=Deirdre |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089843,00.html |title=Cambodian Doctor Haing Ngor Turns Actor in the Killing Fields, and Relives His Grisly Past |publisher=People.com |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngor went on to appear in various other onscreen projects, most memorably in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Heaven &amp; Earth (1993 film)|Heaven &amp; Earth]]'' (1993) and the ''[[Vanishing Son]]'' miniseries. He also appeared in the Hong Kong film ''[[Eastern Condors]]'' (1987), which was directed by and starred [[Sammo Hung]].

He also appeared in a supporting role in the 1989 Vietnam War drama ''The Iron Triangle''. He guest-starred in a two-episode storyline on the acclaimed series ''[[China Beach]]'' (episodes "How to Stay Alive in Vietnam 1 &amp; 2"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lemaster|first1=Donna|title=China Beach an Episode Guide|url=http://epguides.com/ChinaBeach/guide.shtml#ep034|website=epguides|date=May 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a wounded Cambodian [[POW]] who befriends [[Colleen McMurphy]] while under her care.  He also guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Miami Vice]]'' called "The Savage / Duty and Honor".

Next to ''The Killing Fields'', Ngor's most prominent feature film role was in ''[[My Life (film)|My Life]]'' (1993), the directorial debut of [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Bruce Joel Rubin]]. Ngor portrayed a spiritual healer, Mr. Ho, who provides guidance for protagonist Bob Jones ([[Michael Keaton]]) and his wife Gail ([[Nicole Kidman]]) after Bob is diagnosed with terminal [[cancer]], months before the birth of his and Gail's first child.

==Foundation and legacy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation was organized in 1990 by Ngor and [[Jack Ong]]. The two actors met in 1989 while filming "The Iron Triangle" and soon after, Pastor Ong's church (Venice Christian Community in Venice, California) launched Project Cambodia to raise funds to care for orphans and help rebuild the devastated country's infrastructure. Project Cambodia was the original foundation for The Dr. Haing S. Ngor Foundation, which was incorporated in 1997 after Ngor's homicide (Feb. 25, 1996) as a 501 (C) (3) charitable organization. The goals of the Foundation include preserving the legacy of Ngor's accomplishments and human rights endeavors as well as the promotion of Cambodia's history and culture through education, activism and the arts. Ngor's niece, Sophia Ngor Demetri, who testified at the trial of his murderers and whom he brought to the U.S., is the current president of the foundation; Ong serves as executive director.

==Murder==
On February 25, 1996, Ngor was shot dead outside his home in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|Chinatown]], in downtown [[Los Angeles, California]]. Many Cambodians claimed that they had a stake in his estate, with one woman claiming that he had married her after coming to the United States. Most of Ngor's Cambodian assets went to his brother, [[Chan Sarun]], while his American assets were used up in legal fees staving off claims to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ngor |first=Haing |author2=Roger Warner |title=Survival in the Killing Fields |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |year=2003 |location=New York |pages=512–513 |isbn=0786713151}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Rose Hills Memorial Park]] in [[Whittier, California]].

Charged with the murder were three reputed members of the "Oriental Lazy Boyz" [[street gang]], who had prior arrests for snatching purses and jewelry. They were tried together in the Superior Court of Los Angeles, though their cases were heard by three separate juries.&lt;ref name="MN"/&gt; Prosecutors argued that they killed Ngor because, after handing over his gold [[Rolex]] watch willingly, he refused to give them a locket that contained a photo of his deceased wife, My-Huoy. Defense attorneys suggested that the murder was a politically motivated killing carried out by sympathizers of the Khmer Rouge but offered no evidence to support this theory.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;My-Thuan Tran, [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/21/local/la-me-ngor-murder21-2010jan21/4 Revisiting Haing Ngor's murder: 'Killing Fields' theory won't die], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kang Kek Iew]], a former Khmer Rouge official on trial in Cambodia, claimed in November 2009 that Ngor was murdered on Pol Pot's orders, but U.S. investigators did not find him credible.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;

Some criticized the theory that Ngor was killed in a bungled robbery, pointing to $2,900 in cash that had been left behind and the fact that the thieves had not rifled his pockets. Why the thieves would have demanded his locket has never been answered; Ngor typically wore the locket next to his skin under his clothing, so it would not have been in plain sight. {{as of|2003}}, the locket has not been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Ngor &amp; Warner, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

All three were found guilty on April 16, 1998, the same day that [[Pol Pot]]'s death was confirmed in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Yi, Greg Krikorian, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/17/local/me-40165 Three Men Convicted of Killing Ngor], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 17, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Tak Sun Tan was sentenced to 56 years to life; Indra Lim to 26 years to life; and Jason Chan to life without parole. In 2004, the [[U.S. District Court for the Central District of California]] granted Tak Sun Tan's ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petition, finding that prosecutors had manipulated the jury's sympathy by presenting false evidence. This decision was reversed, and the conviction was ultimately upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in July 2005.

After the release of ''The Killing Fields'', Ngor had told a ''New York Times'' reporter, "If I die from now on, OK! This film will go on for a hundred years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA785&amp;dq=%22This+film+will+go+on+for+a+hundred+years.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtxsCt9-DeAhUCCCwKHS8lCXIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22This+film+will+go+on+for+a+hundred+years.%22&amp;f=false|title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume I &amp; II|first=Leo|last=Suryadinata|date=19 November 2018|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dith Pran]], whom Ngor portrayed in ''The Killing Fields'', said of Ngor's death, "He is like a twin with me. He is like a co-messenger and right now I am alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9602/haing_ngor/|publisher=CNN|author=Jim Hill|date=February 27, 1996|title=Actor Haing Ngor found gunned down outside L.A. home|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===

{{in popular culture|date=August 2018}}
In Season 7, episode 12 of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Team Homer]]", Homer reveals that he stole Ngor's Best Supporting Actor Oscar and replaced the name on the plaque with his own. About a month after "Team Homer" aired in 1996, Ngor was murdered just outside his home in Los Angeles. In subsequent reruns, animators changed the Oscar in question to that of [[Don Ameche]] out of respect for Ngor, and to avoid the implication that Homer killed him for his Oscar.

In Season 1, episode 4 of ''[[The Critic]]'', Miserable, Ngor is listed as one of the protagonist Jay Sherman's many enemies and someone who would have a motive to kidnap him. A brief flashback then shows Sherman criticizing Ngor's acting abilities by saying that Ngor "Should have gone to the acting fields."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11263">'''Health and social care on the [[Isle of Man]]''' is the responsibility of the [[Department of Health and Social Care (Isle of Man)]]. Healthcare is free for residents and visitors from the UK and there is a reciprocal health agreement with the UK. For several years it has required a supplementary vote to balance its budget at the end of each year &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Department of Health and Social Care Programme for Government Service Delivery Plan 2017/18 |url=https://www.gov.im/media/1356624/dhsc-programme-for-government-delivery-plan.pdf |website=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In 2013 about £178.4 million was spent on healthcare.   £138 million came from the Manx government and about £40 million from income [[National Insurance]] contributions, prescription charges and private patient fees.  About £80 million was spent on Noble's hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manx health service funding 'not sustainable', says health minister|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-23343538|accessdate=4 October 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2018 Sir [[Jonathan Michael]] was asked to conduct a review of the service because of concern that current funding levels are "unsustainable".  The Council of Ministers estimated that funding would have to be increased by 23% - an additional £60 million by 2022/23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Fundamental' review of Isle of Man health service launched |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-43501849 |accessdate=2 June 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Care==

The 14 [[General practice]]s have a list system. Patients have to register with a GP.  Temporary residents from the UK can use the service without charge.  The practices on the island have an average of 1900 patients per GP.  A digital facility for patients to make GP appointments and view their own health information online was launched in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sign on for digital patient access|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/article.cfm?id=35988&amp;headline=Sign%20on%20for%20digital%20patient%20access&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2017|accessdate=4 October 2017|publisher=IOM Today|date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manx Emergency Doctor Service is available when the practices are closed, from 6{{nbsp}}pm to 8{{nbsp}}am and at weekends and bank holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare on the Isle of Man|url=https://www.locate.im/article/practical-advice/healthcare-on-the-isle-of-man/|website=LOcate IM|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NHS dentistry|Dentistry services]] are available on a similar basis to those in the UK, with charging on a banded basis and exemptions for children, students, pensioners, pregnant women and people in receipt of [[Income Support]], Income Based [[Job Seekers Allowance]] or Employed Persons Allowance, war disablement pensioners and blind people.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Annual eye tests are provided free to Isle of Man residents. NHS vouchers are available towards the cost of spectacles.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Manx [[prescription charges]] have been set at £3.85 per item since September 2010, less than half the charge in England. People get free prescriptions who have chronic conditions, as well as people who are: under 16 years old, under 19 years old and in school full-time, pregnant, on [[public assistance]], prisoners, on a pension and under 75 years old, or over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isle of Man prescription charges could net £3.8m, says health minister|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-41348242|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018 there was an announcement that NHS dentists on the island were at full capacity and that it could take years for new patients to be registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Isle of Man public health dentists at full capacity |url=http://www.itv.com/news/granada/update/2018-04-12/isle-of-man-public-health-dentists-over-capacity/ |accessdate=3 June 2018 |publisher=ITV |date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary care==

There is one hospital on the island, [[Noble’s Hospital]], with 314 beds, giving about 4 beds per 1000 residents, around the European average, but considerably higher than in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How does the UK compare internationally for health funding, staffing and hospital beds? |url=https://www.health.org.uk/chart-how-does-uk-compare-internationally-health-funding-staffing-and-hospital-beds |website=Health Foundation |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tertiary services are provided by the [[English NHS]].

The Isle of Man [[Ambulance Service]] is based at Cronk Coar on the Noble's Hospital site.  It has 9 Accident and Emergency Vehicles, 4 Patient Transport vehicles and rapid response vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambulance and Paramedics|url=https://www.gov.im/categories/home-and-neighbourhood/emergency-services/ambulance-and-paramedics/|website=Isle of Man Government|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Termination of Pregnancy Act 1995 abortions can only be carried out if a pregnancy is the result of rape or because of mental health concerns but proposals have been made to alter the law.  There have been no prosecutions under the act and women from the island travel to the UK for abortions which they have to pay for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Isle of Man abortion bill: Nearly 3,000 responses submitted in consultation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-41306864|accessdate=4 October 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before 1948 there was a Mental Hospital Board which was responsible for [[Ballamona Hospital]] under the Poor Relief Acts and three voluntary hospitals: Ramsey Cottage Hospital, [[Noble’s Hospital]] and the Jane Crookall Maternity Home, each of which had its own Management Committee, on the island.  There was a Hospitals Contributory Scheme. White Hoe Hospital was run by the Corporation of [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]. There were proposals, by the Corrin Trustees who had collected funds, to establish a hospital in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] but they were halted by the outbreak of war.  Domiciliary services were provided by District Nurses, employed by the twelve District Nursing Associations. There were also two Infant Welfare Health Visitors and seven Infant Welfare Clinics.

The [[Isle of Man Medical Society]] had begun preparing for the establishment of the NHS in 1946 and asking the Manx government to establish a process.  The two existing government bodies mostly closely involved were the [[Local Government Board - Isle of Man|Local Government Board]] and the [[Health Insurance and Pensions Board]] - which became the [[Board of Social Services]] in 1947 - submitted a report in  April 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellion |first1=Donald |title=Birth of a Service |date=2008 |location=Isle of Man |url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/nhs2008/ch01.htm |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The free health service started on the island on 5 July 1948, just as in the United Kingdom, but without any legislation and a good deal of confusion. 5 July on the island is, coincidently, [[Tynwald day]], a public holiday.  It was clear that the Board would have to be collecting National Health Insurance contributions from that date  to ensure reciprocity with the United Kingdom.

The  Mental Hospital Board was renamed the Health Services Board under the Health Services Board Act which was passed on 15 June 1948 and took on responsibility for the Cronk Ruagh Sanatorium and White Hoe Isolation Hospital. The voluntary hospitals Management Committees continued, but were now  overseen by and responsible to politicians - something they did not welcome. One-third of their members were now appointed by the Board, to be responsible to the Board, and  their accounts and activities were subject to monthly scrutiny. They were assimilated in 1963.

The Isle of Man Health Services Act was not passed until 10 August 1948.  It was agreed that the term "people of the Isle of Man" could and should be interpreted as including anybody physically present on the Island at the time, so that visitors - mostly from the UK - would be covered. In return the English NHS agreed that Manx patients could be sent, as necessary, for free treatment in English hospitals, and for other treatment not available on the Island.

32 General practitioners, 40 chemists, 16 dentists and 10 opticians joined the service at its inception.  There were 28 specialist hospital doctors: 9 full-time, 12 part-time, and 7 visiting from England. For the first nine months of operation to 31 March 1949 the costs came to £197,200. The estimate for the first full year to 31 March 1950, was £454,668.  By 1954 the Board was under pressure to reduce its expenditure by 20%. The Board responded by insisting that this would require reductions in the service which would have to be determined by the Government.  The National Health Service Act 1950, widened the Board's powers to introduce charges, and in November 1950 a charge of 6d. per prescription form was introduced.  This caused all but six of the chemists to withdraw their services for a fortnight. In December 1950 the Board introduced a range of exemptions from charges.  Charges for dental treatment were introduced in 1950 and, in 1952, charges for spectacles at 10/- a lens, and the whole cost of an approved frame.

There was considerable administrative support from the English NHS.  The Manchester Prescription Pricing Bureau dealt with the invoicing of prescribed medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gellion |first1=Donald |title=Birth of a Service |date=2008 |location=Isle of Man |url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/nhs2008/ch05.htm |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Prescribing Committee, was established of whose six members four were doctors and one a chemist.  Charges for prescriptions were increased in April 1953 to 1/- per form.

In 1954 the Board took responsibility for the Welfare Food Scheme.  Orange juice, cod liver oil, and vitamin tablets were distributed through the Infant Welfare Clinics, of which there were then ten.  They were free to all children under five, and to expectant and nursing mothers in necessitous circumstances.  In the year to March, 1956 25,884 bottles of orange juice, 4,776 bottles of cod liver oil, and 594 packets of vitamin tablets were distributed.  It also ran the Cheap Milk Scheme.  From 1951 this was subject to a means test.  In 1955/6, this was a household income not exceeding £5 a week, with the addition of 6/- for each dependent member. There were 176 beneficiaries, including 6 nursing or expectant mothers.  A Home Help Scheme was also established and by 1959 there were  25 Home Helps.

The School Dental Service provided free treatment for children of school age, and they were originally not eligible for free treatment from other dentists except in an emergency.

'''Hogenakkal Integrated Drinking Water Project''' is a [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]] mitigation drinking water project being undertaken at [[Hogenakkal (village)|Hogenakkal]], [[Dharmapuri district]], state of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omms.nic.in/aspnet/Citizens/DG/05DVC/CensusStatus.aspx?state=TN&amp;district=4&amp;block=3&amp;reportLevel=3 Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana]&lt;/ref&gt; It is scheduled to be executed by [[Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board]] (TWAD), with funding from [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation]] (JBIC) using Tamil Nadu's share of [[River Cauvery|Cauvery]] river water.  The project aims to supply safe drinking water to drought prone &lt;ref name=ndtv1&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080045964&amp;ch=4/5/2008 Hogenakkal Drinking Water Project]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]] affected [[Dharmapuri district|Dharmapuri]] and [[Krishnagiri district|Krishnagiri]] districts of Tamil Nadu.

[[File:Water flow near hogenakkal falls in tamil nadu.jpg|thumb|Water flow near hogenakkal falls in Tamil Nadu]]

==Background==
Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts of Tamil Nadu are drought prone&lt;ref name=ndtv1/&gt; and had been the cause of high political debates&lt;ref&gt;[http://164.100.47.5/rsdebate/synopsis/199/21082003.htm Rajya Sabha (SYNOPSIS OF DEBATES)]&lt;/ref&gt; and riots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/08/03/stories/2002080301400500.htm The Hindu- Drought drives ryots out of Dharmapuri]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Kaveri river]] enters the state at [[Biligundulu]] in Dharmapuri district, it does not contribute to irrigation or drinking water purposes there.&lt;ref name=fluoride&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/25/stories/2006082515430100.htm The Hindu - Wanted: water without fluoride]&lt;/ref&gt; With 10 of the 29 constituent districts in Tamil Nadu affected by fluorosis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JHE/JHE-21-0-000-000-2007-Web/JHE-21-1-000-000-2007-Abstract-PDF/JHE-21-1-027-032-2007-1522-Kumar-R-H/JHE-21-1-027-032-2007-1522-Kumar-R-H-Tt.pdf Journal of Human Ecology - Assessment of Current Status of Fluorosis in North-Western Districts of Tamil Nadu Using Community Index for Dental Fluorosis]&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmapuri district has the highest concentration of endemic fluoride in the State.&lt;ref name=hindu2&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/05/25/stories/2004052513120500.htm The Hindu - Fluoride contamination in water highest in Dharmapuri]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project details==
[[File:View of hogenakkal falls from hanging bridge.jpg|thumb|View of hogenakkal falls from hanging bridge]]

The total cost of this entire fluorosis mitigation project is Rs. 13.34 billion. 1.4 tmc feet of water is to be utilised for the Hogenakkal drinking water project. It will be from Tamil Nadu's share of Cauvery water, thereby placing no extra demand on Karnataka.

===1998 Pact on Bangalore &amp; Hogenakal Projects===
The Tamil Nadu government  has received a no objection certificate from the central government for the Hogenakkal drinking water scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200804021654.htm Baalu urges PM to advice Karnataka not to oppose Hogenakkal project]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar agreement with the [[J. H. Patel]] led government of Karnataka in 1998 was based on the premise that both states won't obstruct drinking water schemes from Cauvery as long as the water drawn for such a project is sourced from the respective state's share of Cauvery water,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/01/stories/2008040160980100.htm  Karnataka gave consent in 1998 to Hogenakkal project: Tamil Nadu]&lt;/ref&gt; whose proceedings have been recorded.A copy of the letter given to the then Tamil Nadu Government Chief Secretary from the Union Ministry of Water Resources can be found here .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Areas covered===

The project is expected to cover 6,755 households in three municipal areas, 17 panchayats and 18 town panchayats, benefiting about three million people.  Drinking water will be pumped to a master balancing reservoir at [[Madam, Tamil Nadu|Madam]], about 11&amp;nbsp;km from Hogenakkal. After treatment, water will be pumped for 145&amp;nbsp;km to cover areas such as [[Palakkodu]], [[Marandahalli]] and [[Hosur]] in Tamil Nadu. Remaining areas in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts will be covered by taking advantage of altitude gradient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/04/stories/2008040460841300.htm The Hindu - Only a drinking water project,Note : pls quickly this project work state: Tamil Nadu]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dump station''' is a place where raw sewage may be entered into a sanitary sewer system in a safe and responsible way.  Dump stations are often used by owners of [[motorhome]]s, [[campervan]]s, [[recreational vehicle]]s or [[boat]]s that are equipped with toilet facilities and a sewage [[holding tank]], also known as a [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] holding tank.  The holding tank can be safely emptied at a dump station. [[Greywater]] holding tanks can also be emptied at a dump station.

Dump stations are often located at [[campgrounds]], [[RV park]]s, [[truck stop]]s, highway rest areas, recreation vehicle dealerships, [[marinas]] and other places that are frequented by recreational vehicles and boats.  Dump station owners may charge a fee for use, or offer them as a free public service.

[[Physician]]s whose primary professional focus is caring for hospitalized patients only while they are in the hospital are called '''hospitalists'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pantilat |first=Steve |title=What is a Hospitalist? |url=http://www.the-hospitalist.org/hospitalist/article/123072/what-hospitalist |newspaper=The Hospitalist |publisher=The Society of Hospital Medicine |date=February 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of medical practice has extended beyond the United States into [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]. The vast majority of physicians who refer to themselves as hospitalists focus their practice upon hospitalized patients but do not necessarily have board certification in hospital medicine. 

The term ''hospitalist'' was first coined by [[Robert M. Wachter|Robert Wachter]] and Lee Goldman in a 1996 ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wachter R|author2=Goldman L |title=The emerging role of "hospitalists" in the American health care system |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=335 |issue=7 |pages=514–7 |date=1996 |pmid=8672160 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199608153350713}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scope of hospital medicine includes acute patient care, teaching, research, and executive leadership related to the delivery of hospital-based care.  Hospital medicine, like [[emergency medicine]], is a specialty organized around a site of care (the hospital), rather than an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] (like [[cardiology]]), a [[disease]] (like [[oncology]]), or a patient’s age (like [[pediatrics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/hmdef|title=SHM|author=|date=|website=www.hospitalmedicine.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of hospital medicine has both similarities with and differences from [[acute medicine]] in the United Kingdom, reflecting [[health system]] differences.&lt;ref name="pmid22331278"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wachter RM|author2=Bell D |title=Renaissance of hospital generalists |journal=BMJ |volume=344 |pages=e652 |date=2012 |pmid=22331278 |doi=10.1136/bmj.e652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Hospitalists are physicians with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.), [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.), or a [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS/MBChB) degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/omagazine/200903_omag_primary_care|title=''New Kinds of Primary Care'', O The Oprah Magazine March 2009|author=|date=|website=oprah.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, most hospitalists practicing in hospitals in the United States lack board certification in hospital medicine. While it was commonly believed that any residency program with a heavy inpatient component provided good hospitalist training, studies have found that general residency training is inadequate because common hospitalist problems like [[neurology]], [[hospice]] and [[palliative care]], consultative medicine, and quality improvement tend to be glossed over.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} To address this, residency programs are starting to develop hospitalist tracks with more tailored education. Several universities have also started fellowship programs specifically geared toward hospital medicine.

According to the State of Hospital Medicine Survey by the Medical Group Management Association and the Society of Hospital Medicine, 89.60% of hospitalists specialize in general internal medicine, 5.5% in a pediatrics subspecialty, 3.7% in family practice and 1.2% in internal medicine pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Practice_Resources&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=29857 |title=2012 Hospital Medicine Survey &amp;#124; Society of Hospital Medicine |publisher=Hospitalmedicine.org |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the survey also reported that 53.5% of hospitalists are employed by hospitals/integrated delivery system and 25.3% are employed by independent hospitalists groups.

According to recent data, there are more than 50,000 hospitalists practicing in approximately 75% of U.S. hospitals, including all highly ranked academic medical centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wachter|first=Robert M.|last2=Goldman|first2=Lee|date=2016-08-10|title=Zero to 50,000 — The 20th Anniversary of the Hospitalist|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=375|issue=11|pages=1009–11|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1607958|issn=0028-4793|pmid=27508924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In Australia, Hospitalists are career hospital doctors; they are generalist medical practitioners whose principal focus is the provision of clinical care to patients in hospitals; they are typically beyond the internship-residency phase of their career, but have decidedly chosen as a conscious career choice not to partake in vocational-specialist training to acquire fellowship specialist qualification. Whilst not specialists, these clinicians are nonetheless experienced in their years of medical practice, and depending on their scope of practice, they typically work with a reasonable degree of independence and autonomy under the auspices of their specialist colleagues and supervisors. Hospitalists form a demographically small but important workforce of doctors in hospitals across Australia where on-site specialist coverage is otherwise unavailable. 

Hospitalists are typically employed in a variety of public and private hospital settings on a contractual or salaried basis. Dependent on their place of employment and duties, the responsibilities and remuneration of non-specialist hospitalists are usually comparable to somewhere between registrars and consultants. Despite the common trend for clinicians to specialise nowadays, non-specialist hospitalist clinicians have an important role in fulfilling shortages in the medical workforce, especially when specialist coverage or accessibility is unavailable and where there is an area-of-need or after-hours or on-site medical care is required. These clinicians and employed across Australia in a variety of environments which include Medical &amp; Surgical Wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Departments. Nonetheless, these clinicians work closely and continually consult with the relevant attending specialists on-call; that is, final responsibility and care for the patient ultimately still rests with the attending specialist.

They are also known as: Career Medical Officers (CMO), Senior Medical Officers (SMO) and Multi-skilled Medical Officers (MMO). 

Hospitalits are represented by the [[Australian Medical Association]] (AMA), Australasian Society of Career Medical Officers (ASCMO) and Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation (AMSOF). Despite being non-specialist clinicians, they are still required to meet continuing professional development requirements and frequently attend courses facilitated by these organisations and hospitals to keep their practice and skillets up-to-date alongside their specialist registered colleagues.

== Canada ==
In Canada, there are currently no official residency programs specializing in hospital medicine. Nevertheless, some universities, such as [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], have come up with [[family medicine]] enhanced skills programs focused on hospital medicine. This program, which is available to practicing physicians and family medicine residents, has a duration of six or twelve months. The main goal behind the program is to prepare medical doctors with training in family practice to assume shared care roles with other specialists, such as [[cardiologist]]s, [[neurologist]]s, and [[nephrologist]]s, in a hospital setting. Moreover, the program prepares family physicians by giving them a set of skills required for caring for their complicated hospitalized patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jewish General Hospital|author2=St. Mary's Hospital|author3=McGill University Health Center|author4=McGill University: Department of Family Medicine|title=Enhanced Skills Program in Hospital Medicine|publisher=McGill University: Department of Family Medicine|pages=1–9|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/familymed/files/familymed/hospital_medicine_enhanced_skills_program_website.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital Medicine|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/familymed/education/enhancedskillsprograms/hospital-medicine|website=McGill Universi Department of Family Medicine|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=17 March 2015|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hospital medicine is a relatively new phenomenon in American medicine and as such is the fastest growing specialty in the history of medicine. Almost unheard of a generation ago, this type of practice arose from three powerful shifts in medical practice:
*Nearly all states, as well as the national residency accreditation organizations, the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA), have established limitations on [[medical resident|house staff]] duty hours, the number of hours that [[medical intern|interns]] and [[medical resident|residents]] can work. Many hospitalists are coming to perform the same tasks formerly performed by residents; although this is usually referred to as a House Officer rather than a hospitalist.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  The fundamental difference between a hospitalist and a house officer is that the hospitalist is the [[attending physician]] of a patient while that patient is hospitalized.  The house officer admits the patient for another attending physician and cares for that patient until the attending physician can see the patient.
*Most primary care physicians are experiencing a shrinking role in hospital care. Many primary care physicians find they can generate more revenue in the office during the hour or more they would have spent on inpatient rounds, including traveling to and from the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In addition to patient care duties, hospitalists are often involved in developing and managing aspects of hospital operations such as inpatient flow and quality improvement. The formation of hospitalist training tracks in residency programs has been driven in part by the need to educate future hospitalists about business and operational aspects of medicine, as these topics are not covered in traditional residencies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Certification==
As a relatively new specialty, only recently has certification for specialty experience and training for hospital medicine been offered.  The [[American Board of Hospital Medicine]] (ABHM), a Member Board of the [[American Board of Physician Specialties]] (ABPS), was founded in 2009. The ABHM was North America’s first board of certification devoted exclusively to hospital medicine.  In September 2009, the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] (ABIM) created a program that provides general internists practicing in hospital settings the opportunity to maintain Internal Medicine Certification with a Focused Practice in Hospital Medicine (FPHM).

==Quality initiatives==
Research shows that hospitalists reduce the length of stay, treatment costs and improve the overall efficiency of care for hospitalized patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0046836|title=The impact of hospitalists on length of stay and costs: systematic review and meta-analysis|first1=Jean-Sebastian|last1=Rachoin|first2=Jad|last2=Skaf|first3=Elizabeth|last3=Cerceo|first4=Erin|last4=Fitzpatrick|first5=Barry|last5=Milcarek|first6=Eric|last6=Kupersmith|first7=Danielle Bowen|last7=Scheurer|date=1 January 2012|journal=The American Journal of Managed Care|volume=18|issue=1|pages=e23–30|accessdate=10 April 2018|pmid=22435787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitalists are leaders on several quality improvement initiatives in key areas including transitions of care, co-management of patients, reducing hospital acquired diseases and optimizing the care of patients.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Employment==
The number of available hospitalists positions grew exponentially from 2006 to 2010 but has since then leveled off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=hospitalist&amp;l |title=hospitalist Job Trends |publisher=Indeed.com |date=2004-10-24 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the job market still remained very active with some hospitals maintaining permanent openings for capable hospitalists. Salaries are generally very competitive, averaging almost $230,000 per year for adult hospitalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayshospitalist.com/index.php?b=articles_read&amp;cnt=1380 |title=Today's Hospitalist :: Hospitalist pay is rising - survey results show pressure for productivity growth to match |publisher=Todayshospitalist.com |accessdate=2012-10-28|date=June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitalists who are willing to work night shifts only ([[nocturnist]]s) are generally compensated higher than their day shift peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalistworking.com/hospitalist.html |title=Hospitalist Jobs &amp;#124; Hospitalist Positions from |publisher=HospitalistWorking.com |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terminology==
Though hospital medicine is a young field, there have been attempts at further division of labor in the field. 
&lt;br /&gt;
A '''nocturnist''' is a hospitalist who typically covers the twelve-hour shift at night and admits patients as well as receives calls about already admitted patients.
&lt;br /&gt;
A '''[[proceduralist]]''' is generally defined as a hospitalist who primarily does procedures in the hospital such as [[central venous catheter]] insertions, [[lumbar puncture]]s, and [[Paracentesis|paracenteses]].
&lt;br /&gt;
A '''neurohospitalist''' cares for hospitalized patients with or at risk for neurological problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurohospitalistsociety.org/|title=Neurohospitalist|author=|date=|website=www.neurohospitalistsociety.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A '''surgicalist'''  is a surgeon who specializes and focuses on surgical care in the hospital setting.&lt;ref&gt;https://hospitalmedicine.org/Web/Membership/HFP/Surgicalists_and_Acute_Care_Surgeons.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are other commonly used monikers:
&lt;br /&gt;
An '''admitologist''' or '''admitter''' is a hospitalist who only admits patients and does not round on the already admitted ones, or discharge the admitted patients.
&lt;br /&gt;
A '''rounder''' is a hospitalist who only sees the already admitted patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayshospitalist.com/index.php?b=articles_read&amp;cnt=527|title=Is it time to call the admitologist? - Today's Hospitalist|author=|date=1 March 2008|website=todayshospitalist.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of this section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those mass murders where the perpetrators predominantly targeted their (former) co-workers, while the second part focuses on cases where soldiers willfully killed their own comrades.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) shall not be counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the tables are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4593">In the [[clinical research]] trial industry, '''lost to follow-up''' refers to [[patient]]s who at one point in time were actively participating in a [[Clinical trial|clinical research trial]], but have become lost (either by error in a computer tracking system or by being unreachable) at the point of follow-up in the trial.  These patients can become lost for many reasons. Without properly informing the investigator associated with the clinical trial, they may have opted to withdraw from the clinical trial, moved away from the particular study site during the clinical trial, or become ill and unable to communicate or are [[deceased]].

== Adverse effects ==

Patients who become lost to follow-up during a clinical research trial result in many negative effects on the outcome of the trial and on the [[pharmaceutical company]] sponsoring the clinical research trial.  Patients who are lost-to-follow-up lead to incomplete study results, which in turn can put a [[bias]] on the result of the study as well as a bias on the investigational study [[medication]].  A lack of complete results leads to intensified [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] scrutiny of the particular study drug, as well as the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the clinical research study.  Biased study outcomes also lead to issues of [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] standards and compliance.

Aside from partial study data and regulatory issues, patients that are not retained due to being lost-to-follow-up can lead to problems with the progression of any clinical research study.  Low [[Retention rate|rates of retention]] and high rates of patient’s lost-to-follow-up have many side-effects, including longer clinical research trial periods and more monetary expenditures because extra resources may need to be dedicated to the recruitment efforts.

== Solutions ==

Currently there are no standards or guidelines that express the process or methods that can be used to attempt to reach patients who have become lost to follow-up.  Only recently have [[government institution]]s like the FDA taken action over the recovery of or communication with patients lost-to-follow-up.  Section 4.3.4 of the ICH E-6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance reads, "Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely from a trial, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights."  This excerpt expresses the need for [[physician]]s associated with clinical research trials to make a first-hand effort to contact patients who are lost-to-follow-up.  In doing so pharmaceutical companies not only look out for the best interest of the patients who enroll in their clinical research trials, but also protect the data outcome of their clinical trials.

It is important for patients, physicians associated with the study and regulatory departments, like the FDA, that more information is provided to the appropriate people whenever possible. The information should be provided by the patient but when that is not feasible it should be provided by the investigator.  Proper ways of obtaining information from and about the patients must be developed and proper processes as to the handling of this information must be implemented in order to protect the patients and the integrity of the study outcome.

'''''Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason''''' ({{lang-fr|Folie et Déraison: Histoire de la folie à l'âge classique}}) is a 1964 abridged edition of a 1961 book by the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]]. An English translation of the complete 1961 edition, titled '''''History of Madness''''', was published in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book|author=Foucault M|secondaryauthor=Khalfa J, editor, translator &amp; Murphy J, translator|date= 2006|title= History of Madness |publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York| isbn=0-415-27701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault's first major book, ''Madness and Civilization'' is an examination of the evolving meaning of [[Insanity|madness]] in European culture, law, politics, philosophy and medicine from the [[Middle Ages]] to the end of the eighteenth century, and a critique of [[historical method]] and the idea of history. It marks a turning in Foucault's thought away from [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] toward [[structuralism]]: though he uses the language of phenomenology to describe an evolving experience of the mad as "the other", he attributes this evolution to the influence of specific powerful social structures.&lt;ref name=Khalfa&gt;{{vcite book|author=Khalfa J. in Foucault M|chapter=Introduction|title=  History of Madness |location=NY |publisher=Routledge |pages=xiiv–xxv |year=2009|isbn=0-415-47726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The book developed out of Foucault's earlier writing on psychology,&lt;ref&gt;*''a licence de psychologie'' (1949) 
*''a diplome de psycho-pathologie'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; his own psychological difficulties, and his experiences working in a [[mental hospital]], and was written mainly between 1955 and 1959 while working in cultural-diplomatic and educational posts in Sweden (as director of a French cultural centre attached to the [[University of Uppsala]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Macey, David]] (2004). ''Michel Foucault''. [[Reaktion Books]]. p. 46. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, and Poland.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[[Gutting, Gary]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/#4 "Michel Foucault"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Summer 2013 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the [[Renaissance]], the "Classical Age" (the later seventeenth and most of the eighteenth centuries) and the [[Modern history|modern]] experience. He argues that in the Renaissance the mad were portrayed in art as possessing a kind of wisdom&amp;nbsp;– a knowledge of the limits of our world&amp;nbsp;– and portrayed in literature as revealing the distinction between what men are and what they pretend to be. Renaissance art and literature depicted the mad as engaged with the reasonable while representing the mysterious forces of cosmic tragedy such as the ''[[Ship of fools]]'',&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; but the Renaissance also marked the beginning of an ''objective'' description of reason and unreason (as though seen from above) compared with the more intimate medieval descriptions from within society.&lt;ref name=Khalfa/&gt;

Foucault contends that at the dawn of the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]], in the mid-seventeenth century, the rational response to the mad, who until then had been consigned to society's margins, was to separate them completely from society by confining them, along with prostitutes, vagrants, blasphemers and the like, in newly created institutions all over Europe&amp;nbsp;– a process he calls "the Great Confinement".&lt;ref name=Khalfa/&gt;

The condition of these outcasts was seen as one of moral error. They were viewed as having freely chosen prostitution, vagrancy, blasphemy, unreason, etc. and the regimes of these new rational institutions were meticulous programs of punishment and reward aimed at causing them to reverse those choices.&lt;ref name=Khalfa/&gt;

The social forces Foucault sees driving this confinement include the need for an extra-judicial mechanism for getting rid of undesirables, and the wish to regulate unemployment and wages (the cheap labour of the [[workhouses]] applied downward pressure on the [[wages of free labour]]). He argues that the conceptual distinction between the mad and the rational was in a sense a product of this physical separation into confinement: confinement made the mad conveniently available to medical doctors who began to view madness as a [[Natural kind|natural object]] worthy of study and then as an illness to be cured.&lt;ref name=Khalfa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

For Foucault the modern experience began at the end of the eighteenth century with the creation of places devoted solely to the confinement of the mad under the supervision of medical doctors, and these new institutions were the product of a blending of two motives: the new goal of ''curing'' the mad away from their family who could not afford the necessary care at home, and the old purpose of ''confining'' undesirables for the protection of society. These distinct purposes were lost sight of, and the institution soon came to be seen as the only place where therapeutic treatment can be administered. He sees the nominally more enlightened and compassionate treatment of the mad in these modern medical institutions as just as cruel and controlling as their treatment in the earlier, rational institutions had been.&lt;ref name=Khalfa/&gt;

{{quote|...modern man no longer communicates with the madman ... There is no common language: or rather, it no longer exists; the constitution of madness as mental illness, at the end of the eighteenth century, bears witness to a rupture in a dialogue, gives the separation as already enacted, and expels from the memory all those imperfect words, of no fixed syntax, spoken falteringly, in which the exchange between madness and reason was carried out. The language of psychiatry, which is a monologue by reason ''about'' madness, could only have come into existence in such a silence.|sign=Foucault|source=''Preface to the 1961 edition''&lt;ref name=1961_preface&gt;{{vcite book|author=Foucault M.|secondaryauthor=Translated by Khalfa J.|chapter=Preface to the 1961 edition|title= History of Madness |location=NY |publisher=Routledge |pages=xxvii–xxxix|year=2009|isbn=0-415-47726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Reception==
The sociologist [[José Guilherme Merquior]] discusses ''Madness and Civilization'' in ''[[Foucault (Merquior book)|Foucault]]'' (1985). Merquior argues that while Foucault raises important questions about the influence of social forces on the meaning of, and responses to, deviant behavior, ''Madness and Civilization'' is nonetheless so riddled with serious errors of fact and interpretation as to be of very limited value. Merquior notes that there is abundant evidence of widespread cruelty to and imprisonment of the insane during eras when Foucault contends that the mad were perceived as possessing wisdom, and that Foucault has thus [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|selectively cited data]] that supports his assertions while ignoring contrary data. Madness was typically linked with [[sin]] by Christian Europeans, noted Merquior, and was therefore regarded as much less benign than Foucault tends to imply. Merquior sees ''Madness and Civilization'' as "a call for the liberation of the Dionysian id" similar to [[Norman O. Brown]]'s ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959), and an inspiration for [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Merquior, J.G. (1985). ''Foucault'', Fontana Press {{ISBN|0-00-686226-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Lewes writes that ''Madness and Civilization'' is an example of the "critique of the institutions of psychiatry and psychoanalysis" that occurred as part of the "general upheaval of values in the 1960s". Lewes sees Foucault's work as being similar to, but more profound than, [[Thomas Szasz]]'s ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewes, Kenneth |title=Psychoanalysis and Male Homosexuality |publisher=Jason Aronson Inc |location=Northvale, New Jersey |year=1995 |pages=201 |isbn=1-56821-484-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] writes in ''Michel Foucault's Phanomenologie des Krankengeistes'' (1994):

{{quote|The reactions of professional historians to Foucault's ''Histoire de la folie'' seem, at first reading, ambivalent, not to say polarized. There are many acknowledgements of its seminal role, beginning with [[Robert Mandrou]]'s early review in ''[[Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale|Annales]]'', characterizing it as a "beautiful book" that will be "of central importance for our understanding of the Classical period." Twenty years later, Michael MacDonald confirmed Mandrou's prophecy: "Anyone who writes about the history of insanity in early modern Europe must travel in the spreading wake of Michael Foucault's famous book, ''Madness and Civilization''." Later endorsements have been even stronger. [[Jan Goldstein]]: "For both their empirical content and their powerful theoretical perspectives, the works of Michel Foucault occupy a special and central place in the historiography of psychiatry." Roy Porter: "Time has proved ''Madness and Civilization'' far the most penetrating work ever written on the history of madness." More specifically, Foucault has recently been heralded as a prophet of "the new cultural history." But criticism has also been widespread and often bitter.}}

'''Microcephaly lymphoedema chorioretinal dysplasia''' (MLCRD syndrome) is a [[genetic condition]] associated with:
*Small head ([[Microcephaly]])
*Puffy feet ([[Lymphoedema]])
*Eye problems (Chorio-retinal dysplasia i.e. changes in the [[retina]])

In 1992, Feingold and Bartoshesky described two unrelated children with microcephaly, lymphoedema and chorioretinal dysplasia (MIM 152950) as a distinct entity. Since then there have been further reports of children with these three features (Angle et al. 1994, Fryns et al. 1995, Limwongse et al. 1999, Casteels et al. 2001)

Children have also been seen with two of the above features:
*Microcephaly and lymphoedema
*Microcephaly and  chorioretinal dysplasia with or without [[intellectual disability]]

The former (microcephaly and lymphoedema) has been described as an [[autosomal dominant]] (MIM 156590) or [[X-linked trait]], while the latter (microcephaly and chorioretinal dysplasia) has been described as autosomal dominant, [[autosomal recessive]] (MIM 251270 or [[Mirhosseini-Holmes-Walton syndrome]]) or X-linked trait.

The distinct facial feature include upslanting palpebral fissures, a broad nose with rounded tip, long [[philtrum]] with a thin upper lip, pointed chin and prominent ears (Vasudevan 2005)

[[File:Liping Kou observes microgreens.jpg|thumb|Technicians harvesting different types of microgreens for shelf-life studies and nutrient analyses.]]
'''Microgreens''' are a [[Leaf vegetable|vegetable green]], harvested after [[sprouting]] as [[shoot]]s, that are used both as a visual and flavor component or ingredient primarily in fine dining restaurants. Fine dining chefs use microgreens to enhance the attractiveness and taste of their dishes with their delicate textures and distinctive flavors. Smaller than “baby greens,” and harvested later than [[Sprouting|sprouts]], microgreens can provide a variety of leaf flavors, such as sweet and spicy. They are also known for their various colors and textures. Among upscale markets, they are now considered a specialty genre of greens that are good for garnishing salads, soups, plates, and sandwiches.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Millard | first=E. | title=Indoor Kitchen Gardening: Turn Your Home Into a Year-round Vegetable Garden | publisher=Cool Springs Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-61058-981-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEf4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 | access-date=May 28, 2017 | page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible young greens and grains are produced from various kinds of vegetables, herbs or other plants. They range in size from {{convert|1|to|3|in|cm}}, including the stem and leaves. A microgreen has a single central stem which has been cut just above the soil line during harvesting. It has fully developed [[cotyledon]] leaves and usually has one pair of very small, partially developed true leaves. The average crop-time for most microgreens is 10–14 days from seeding to harvest.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanderlinden|first=Colleen|title=Grow Your Own Microgreens|url=http://organicgardening.about.com/od/vegetablesherbs/a/growmicrogreens.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Microgreens began showing up on chefs' menus as early as the 1980s, in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;
In Southern California, microgreens have been grown since about the mid{{nbhyph}}1990s. There were initially very few varieties offered. Those available were such as [[arugula]], [[basil]], [[beets]], [[kale]], [[cilantro]] and a mixture called Rainbow Mix. Having spread eastward from California, they are now being grown in most areas of the country with an increasing number of varieties being produced.&lt;ref name=micro /&gt; Today, the U.S. microgreens industry consists of a variety of seed companies and growers.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;

==Form==
Microgreens have three basic parts: a central stem, cotyledon leaf or leaves, and typically the first pair of very young true leaves. They vary in size depending upon the specific variety grown, with the typical size being {{convert|1|to|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} in total length.  When the green grows beyond this size, it should no longer be considered a microgreen. Larger sizes have been called petite greens.&lt;ref name=micro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshorigins.com/microgreens.html | title=MicroGreen Facts | publisher=Fresh Origins | accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microgreens are typically 2–4 weeks old from germination to harvest.&lt;ref name=waterfields&gt;{{cite web | url=http://waterfieldsllc.com/what-are-microgreens/ | title=What are Microgreens? | publisher=Waterfields | accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both baby greens and microgreens lack any legal definition. The terms "baby greens" and "microgreens" are marketing terms used to describe their respective categories. Sprouts are germinated seeds and are typically consumed as an entire plant (root, seed, and shoot), depending on the species. For example, sprouts from almond, pumpkin, and peanut reportedly have a preferred flavor when harvested prior to root development. Sprouts are legally defined, and have additional regulations concerning their production and marketing due to their relatively high risk of microbial contamination compared to other greens. Growers interested in producing sprouts for sale need to be aware of the risks and precautions summarized in the FDA publication Guidance for Industry: Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Sprouted Seeds (FDA 1999).&lt;ref name=ufl&gt;{{cite web|last=Treadwell|first=Danielle D.|title=Microgreens: A New Specialty Crop|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs1164|publisher=Univ. of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing==
Growing microgreens is relatively easy; many small "backyard" growers have sprung up selling their greens at farmers' markets or to restaurants. A shallow [[plastic container]] with drainage holes, such as a nursery flat or prepackaged-salad box, will facilitate sprouting and grow out on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galloway|first=Will|title=Growing Microgreens Indoors|url=http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/garden/growing-microgreens-indoors|publisher=Organic Gardening|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing and marketing high-quality microgreens commercially is much more difficult.&lt;ref name=ufl /&gt;

==Nutritional analysis==
[[File:Red Cabbage Microgreens.jpg|thumb|ARS scientists analyzed key nutrients in 25 different varieties of microgreens and found that red cabbage microgreens (shown here) had the highest concentrations of vitamin C. These nutritious microgreens are ready to harvest just 10 days after planting.]]
Researchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service have published, as of early 2014, several studies that identify the nutritional make-up and the shelf life of microgreens. Twenty-five varieties were tested, key nutrients measured were [[ascorbic]] acid (vitamin C), [[tocopherol]]s (vitamin E), [[phylloquinone]] (vitamin K), and [[beta-carotene]] (a vitamin A precursor), plus other related [[carotenoids]] in the cotyledons.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the 25 microgreens tested, red cabbage, cilantro, garnet amaranth, and green daikon radish had the highest concentrations of vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin K, and vitamin E, respectively. In general, microgreens contained considerably higher levels of vitamins and carotenoids—about five times greater—than their mature plant counterparts, an indication that microgreens may be worth the trouble of delivering them fresh during their short lives.&lt;ref name="ARS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contents Specialty Greens Pack a Nutritional Punch|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan14/greens0114.htm|publisher=USDA|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A nutritional study of microgreens was done in the summer of 2012 by the Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Xiao | first1 = Z. | last2 = Lester | first2 = G. E. | last3 = Luo | first3 = Y. | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q. | title = Assessment of Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations of Emerging Food Products: Edible Microgreens | doi = 10.1021/jf300459b | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 60 | issue = 31 | pages = 7644–7651 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22812633| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating promising potential that microgreens may indeed have particularly high nutritional value compared to mature vegetables. Bhimu Patil, a professor of horticulture and director of the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&amp;M University, agrees that microgreens may potentially have higher levels of nutrients than mature vegetables. But he says more studies are needed to compare the two side by side. "This is a very good start, but there can be a lot of variation in nutrients depending on where you grow it, when you harvest, and the soil medium," Patil says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barclay|first=Eliza|title=Introducing Microgreens: Younger, And Maybe More Nutritious, Vegetables|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/08/29/160274163/introducing-microgreens-younger-and-maybe-more-nutritious-vegetables|publisher=NPR|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing a microgreen, researchers say to look for the most intensely colored ones, which will be the most nutritious.&lt;ref name="Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Jennifer|title=Tiny Microgreens Packed With Nutrients|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20120831/tiny-microgreens-packed-nutrients?page=2|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Results of the microgreens research project conducted by the University of Maryland and the USDA has garnered attention from several national media outlets including National Public Radio (NPR) and The Huffington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavin|first=Sara|title=Mighty Microgreens|url=http://agnr.umd.edu/news/mighty-microgreens|publisher=AGNR|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microgreens sprout comparison==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Sprouts are germinated or partially germinated seeds. A sprout consists of the seed, root, stem, while microgreens are harvested without the roots.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Microgreens have stronger flavors compared to sprouts, and come in a wide selection of leaf shapes, textures and colors.

Microgreens are grown in soil or soil-like materials such as peat moss.  Microgreens require high light levels, preferably natural sunlight with low humidity and good air circulation.  Microgreens are planted with very low seed density compared to sprout processing. Crop times are generally one to two weeks for most varieties, though some can take four to six weeks. Microgreens are ready to harvest when the leaves are fully expanded. Harvesting is usually with scissors cutting just above the soil surface, excluding any roots. Some growers sell them while still growing, rooted in the growing trays so that they can be cut later. Once removed from their growing environment, these trays of microgreens must be used quickly or they will rapidly begin to elongate and lose color and flavor.

Sprout seeds are soaked in water for usually eight hours and then drained.  A high density of seed is placed inside of sprouting equipment or enclosed containers. The seed germinates rapidly due to the high moisture and humidity levels maintained in the enclosures. Seeds can also be sprouted in cloth bags that are repeatedly soaked in water. The sprouting process occurs in dark or very low light conditions. These dark, wet, crowded conditions are ideal for the rapid proliferation of dangerous pathogenic bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} After a few days of soaking and repeated rinsing in water (several times a day to minimize spoilage), the processing is complete and the sprouts are ready to consume.

The conditions that are ideal for properly grown microgreens do not encourage the growth of dangerous pathogens. These growing methods would not work for the production of sprouts.

However, the potential for food safety issues with microgreens may be increasing due to the number of indoor microgreen growing operations in which excessive seed density, low light intensity, low air circulation or most commonly, a lack of GAP ([[good agricultural practices]]) and GMP ([[good manufacturing practices]]) based food safety procedures. Certain provisions of the Guidance for Industry: Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards For Sprouted Seeds &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ProducePlantProducts/ucm120244.htm&lt;/ref&gt; may be beneficial and prudent for growers of microgreens to follow.

==Storage and commercial transport==
Microgreens have a short shelf life and better methods of storing and transporting microgreens are currently being studied, which at this time are mainly focusing on buckwheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=279279|title=Publication : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial microgreens are most often stored in plastic clamshell containers, which do not provide the right balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide for any live greens to breathe.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Among package materials called films, differences in permeability, (see [[Permeation]]), are referred to as the [[oxygen transmission rate]].&lt;!---Please fix this unintelligible sentence! ---&gt;

The ARS researchers found that buckwheat microgreens packaged in films with an oxygen transmission rate of 225 cubic centimeters per square inch per day had a fresher appearance and better cell membrane integrity than those packaged in other films tested. Following these steps, the team maintained acceptable buckwheat microgreen quality for more than 14 days—a significant extension, according to authors. This study was published in LWT-Food Science and Technology in 2013.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;

[[Light-emitting diodes]]. otherwise known as LEDs, now provide the ability to measure impacts of narrow-band wavelengths of light on seedling physiology. The carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] has been hypothesized to be a blue light receptor in plant physiology. A study was carried out to measure the impact of short-duration blue light on phytochemical compounds, which impart the nutritional quality of sprouting broccoli microgreens. Broccoli microgreens were grown in a controlled environment under LEDs using growing pads. Short-duration blue light acted to increase important phytochemical compounds influencing the nutritional value of broccoli microgreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kopsell|first=Dean A.|title=Increases in Shoot Tissue Pigments, Glucosinolates, and Mineral Elements in Sprouting Broccoli after Exposure to Short-duration Blue Light from Light Emitting Diodes|url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/138/1/31.abstract|publisher=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their lived experience, such persons have expertise that professional training cannot replicate.&lt;ref name=Mich&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Michigan Department of Community Health |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/MSA-07-52-PIHP_Bulletin_207606_7.pdf |title=Bulletin MSA 07-52: Revisions to Mental Health and Substance Abuse Chapter |date=September 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with [[Peer mentoring|peer educators]], who may not consider recovery a suitable goal for everyone and may focus instead on the principles of harm reduction.

Tasks performed by [[peer support]] specialists may include assisting their peers in articulating their goals for recovery, learning and practicing new skills, helping them monitor their progress, supporting them in their treatment, modeling effective [[coping skills|coping techniques]] and [[self-help]] strategies based on the specialist's own recovery experience, and supporting them in [[self-advocacy|advocating]] for themselves to obtain effective services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gacps.org/JobDescription.html |title=Certified Peer Specialist Job Description |website=[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Peer Specialist Certification Project |date=March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012|9|post=,}} 36 states of the US had established programs that train and certify individuals with lived experience who have initiated their recovery and are willing to support others in their recovery process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/ssw/cswr/institutes/mental-health/ |last1=Kaufman |first1=L. |last2=Brooks |first2=W. |last3=Steinley-Bumgarner |first3=M. |last4=Stevens-Manser |first4=S. |date=2012 |title=Peer Specialist Training and Certification Programs: A National Overview |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |website=Center for Social Work Research. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peer recovery support specialist==
A peer recovery support specialist (P-RSS) is an [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles|occupational title]] of trained individuals who engage with peers in a [[Community mental health service|community-based recovery center]], or outside it around any number of activities, or over the telephone. The peer support specialist can work with individuals as they develop and implement a [[Recovery coaching|personal recovery plan]], which can also serve as a contract for engagement.

The [[Veterans Administration]] has increased its number of peer specialists to 800 {{As of|2013|alt=as of the end of 2013|post=.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2487 |title=VA Meets President's Mental Health Executive Order Hiring Goal |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The VA uses peer support specialists much like local, state, and private agencies.

===Recovery planning===
Recovery plans can take many forms. A key component of the [[Recovery approach|recovery management]] model is a personal recovery plan which is drawn up by the individual looking for support, and reviewed with an RSS. This plan is instrumental for individuals in the process of their recovery.

Central to such plans are the overall health and well-being of each individual, not just their mental health. Components often include [[support group]]s and individual therapy, basic health care maintenance, stable housing, improvements in family life and personal relationships, and community connections. The plan may also include education goals, vocational development and employment. Some plans outline a timetable for monitoring, and/or a plan for re-engagement when needed to balance the health and overall quality of life of each individual. 

Peer recovery support specialists can be found in an increasing variety of settings, including [[Community mental health service|community-based recovery centers]]. Funding for peer recovery programs comes from a combination of federal and state agencies as well as local and national charities and grant programs, such as [[Catholic Charities]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Melissa |last=Killeen |title=The Emerging Field of Recovery Coaching |date=March 2009 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |type=Masters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training and certification===
When peer support specialists work in publicly funded services, they are required to meet government and state certification requirements. Since the adaptation of the Recovery Management Model by state and federal agencies, peer support specialist courses have been offered by numerous state, nonprofit and for-profit entities such as Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccar.us&lt;/ref&gt; PRO-ACT (Pennsylvania Recovery Organization-Achieving Community Together),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.councilsepa.org/programs/pro-act&lt;/ref&gt; The McShin Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;http://mcshinfoundation.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/Recovery%20Coach%20Manual%20-%207-22-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee Certified Peer Recovery Specialist Training and Program,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tn.gov/mental/recovery/oca3.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Appalachian Consulting Group,&lt;ref&gt;http://acgpeersupport.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the State of New York's Office of Addiction Services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oasas.ny.gov/recovery/coach/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; [[PARfessionals]] has developed the first internationally approved online training program for peer support specialists in the fields of mental health and addiction recovery. In addition, numerous for-profit firms offer peer support specialist training. Training includes courses on the ethics of a recovery coach, recovery coaching core competencies, clinical theories as stages of change, [[motivational interviewing]], and [[co-occurring disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Killeen |first=Melissa |date=2013 |title=Recovery Coaching: A Guide to Coaching People in Recovery from Addictions |publisher=Create Space Press |location=Charlotte, NC |page=103 }} {{isbn missing|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1088">'''Ralph Frederick Sommer''' (1898 – 1971) is known as one of the two leading pioneers in the development of [[endodontics]].  He is also noted as a pioneer in the treatment of [[root canal]] infections and the development of the root canal operation.

At the [[University of Michigan]], Sommer was a faculty member (1924–1968) as well as Chair of the Department of Endodontics at the [[University of Michigan]]. He also held status as the charter member and second president of the [[American Association of Endodontists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dent.umich.edu/about/aboutschool/news/news2003/honor/sommer.html University of Michigan biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703122827/http://www.dent.umich.edu/about/aboutschool/news/news2003/honor/sommer.html |date=2007-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1808">'''Relative Fat Mass (RFM)''' is a simple formula for the estimation of overweight or obesity in humans which requires only a calculation based on a ratio of height and waist measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29362-1 | title =Relative fat mass (RFM) as a new estimator of whole-body fat percentage ─ A cross-sectional study in American adult individuals|publisher=Nature Research Journal (Scientific report article number: 10980 of 2018)|author=Orison O. Woolcott &amp; Richard N. Bergman|work=at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High body-fat is associated with increased risks of poor health and early mortality. RFM is a simple anthropometric procedure that is claimed to be more convenient than [[body fat percentage]] and more accurate than the traditional [[body mass index]] (BMI).

The ratio or the patient's height and waist measurement is multiplied by 20 before being subtracted from a number (shown in bold below) that adjusts for differences in gender and height:    

* RFM for adult males: '''64''' – (20 x height / waist circumference)
* RFM for adult females:'''76''' – (20 x height / by waist circumference)

Although generally validated on a database of some 12,000 adults RFM has not yet been evaluated in longitudinal studies of large populations to identify normal or abnormal RFM in relation to obesity-related health problems.

'''Shuntaro Hida''' (1 January 1917 – 20 March 2017) was a [[Japan]]ese [[physician]] who was an eyewitness when the ''[[Little Boy]]'' [[atomic bomb]] was dropped on [[Hiroshima]] by the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' on 6 August 1945. He treated survivors as a medical doctor and wrote about the effects of [[radiation]] on the human body.

The night before the bomb was dropped 28-year-old Dr. Hida left the Hiroshima Military Hospital where he was stationed as an army medical officer to attend to a sick child in the village of Hesaka. He was therefore approximately 6 kilometers from [[ground zero]] when the bomb was dropped&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcpeace.org/Hida_memoir.htm |title=Shuntaro Hida - Memoir |website=Wcpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he looked up and saw the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] aircraft which he described as appearing like a "tiny silver drop". He then felt the heat and blast from the explosion and saw the [[mushroom cloud]] over the city. As a medical doctor he treated the wounded and saw the short- and long-term effects of radiation on the human body.

After the war he continued to treat atomic bomb survivors (known as [[Hibakusha]]) for many years and he became the Director of the Hibakusha Counselling Centre. He also sought compensation from the [[United States]] government and advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons. In 2005 he was interviewed for the [[BBC]] drama documentary ''[[Hiroshima: BBC History of World War II|Hiroshima]]'' and his experiences were re-enacted in a dramatic reconstruction of events. He was also interviewed for the documentary ''[[White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpeace.org/Hida_bio.htm |title=Shuntaro Hida - biography |website=Wcpeace.org |date=1945-08-06 |accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Shuntaro Hida appears in the documentary ''Atomic Wounds'' by Journeyman Pictures. "At 89, Doctor Hida, a survivor of the 1945 atomic bomb at Hiroshima, continues to care for some of the other quarter of a million survivors. ''Atomic Wounds'' retraces his dedicated journey and highlights how the terrible danger of radiation was concealed by successive American administrations of the 1950s to 1970s so that nuclear power could be freely developed, with no concern for public health." He died from pneumonia on 20 March 2017 at the age of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20170321/k00/00m/040/062000c |title=訃報：肥田舜太郎さん１００歳＝広島原爆で被爆の医師 - 毎日新聞 |language=ja |website=Mainichi.jp |date=2017-02-13 |accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobacco smoking''' in [[Pakistan]] is legal, but under certain circumstances is banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/country/pakistan/summary |title=Pakistan Details |publisher=Tobacco Control Laws |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If calculated on per day basis, 177 million cigarettes per day were consumed in FY-14. According to the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey, 46 per cent men and 5.7 per cent women smoke tobacco. The habit is mostly found in the youth of Pakistan and in farmers{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}, and is thought to be responsible for various health problems and deaths in the country. Smoking produces many health problems in smokers. Pakistan has the highest consumption of tobacco in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/02/07/city/lahore/pakistans-tobacco-consumption-the-most-in-south-asia/ |title=Pakistan’s tobacco consumption: The most in South Asia! |publisher=Pakistan Today |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiscal Year 2014==
Pakistanis spent Rs. 250 billion on over 64 billion cigarettes in the financial year FY14, disclosed a State Bank report recently issued. The State Bank’s Statistical Bulletin reports that Pakistanis smoked 64.48bn cigarettes in the year FY-14. The average price of cigarette is considered Rs4 (conservative estimate) and the total price of 64.48bn cigarettes comes to an estimated Rs258bn. The most popular brand Gold Leaf is available at Rs 120 per pack of 20 cigarettes or Rs 6 per cigarette. The minimum price of cigarettes available in the market is Rs 50 per pack of 20 cigarettes or Rs2.5 per cigarette. Costly imported cigarettes are also available in the market which can go up to Rs 150 plus per pack. The main 3 companies took major part in tobacco industry. There are a number of smuggled cigarettes which find their way from Afghanistan whose landing port is in Karachi, Pakistan.

== Effects on health ==
[[Lung cancer]] in Pakistan is caused directly by tobacco in 90% of cases.

'''Social grooming''' is a behaviour in which [[social animal]]s, including [[human]]s, clean or maintain one another's body or appearance. A related term, '''allogrooming''', indicates social grooming between members of the same species.  Grooming is a major social activity, and a means by which animals who live in close proximity may [[Psychological bond|bond]] and reinforce social structures, family links, and build companionships. Social grooming is also used as a means of [[conflict resolution]], maternal behaviour and [[Reconciliation ecology|reconciliation]] in some species.&lt;ref name="Henazi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="van Schaik"/&gt;  '''Mutual grooming''' typically describes the act of grooming between two individuals, often as a part of social grooming, [[pair bonding]], or a [[Foreplay|precoital activity]].

== Evolutionary advantages ==
There are a variety of proposed mechanisms by which social grooming behavior has been hypothesized to increase [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. These evolutionary advantages may come in the form of health benefits including reduced [[Transmission (medicine)|disease transmission]] and reduced stress levels, maintaining social structure, and direct improvement of fitness as a measure of survival.

=== Health benefits ===
Social grooming behavior has been shown to elicit an array of health benefits in a variety of species. &amp;nbsp;For example, group member connection has the potential to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of [[stressor]]s. In [[macaque]]s, social grooming has been proven to reduce [[heart rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MNBefb0j-ksC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=the+role+of+emotion+in+conflict+and+conflict+resolution#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20role%20of%20emotion%20in%20conflict%20and%20conflict%20resolution&amp;f=false|title=Natural Conflict Resolution|last=Aureli|first=Filippo|last2=Waal|first2=Frans B.

These ectoparasitic ticks carry the potential to act as [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s for the spreading of [[disease]] and [[infection]] by common tick-borne [[Parasitism|parasites]] such as [[Protozoa|haemoprotozoan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akinyi|first=Mercy Y.|last2=Tung|first2=Jenny|last3=Jeneby|first3=Maamun|last4=Patel|first4=Nilesh B.|last5=Altmann|first5=Jeanne|last6=Alberts|first6=Susan C.|date=2013-03-01|title=Role of grooming in reducing tick load in wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347212005611|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=85|issue=3|pages=559–568|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.012|pmc=3961061|pmid=24659824|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baboons with lower tick loads show decreased occurrence of such infections and display signs of greater health status, evidenced by higher [[hematocrit]] (packed red cell volume) levels.

=== Reinforcing social structure and building relationships ===
One of the most critical functions of social grooming is to establish social networks and relationships. In many species, individuals form close social connections dubbed “friendships.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seyfarth|first=Robert M.|last2=Cheney|first2=Dorothy L.|date=July 5, 2011|title=The Evolutionary Origins of Friendship|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134601|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=63|pages=153–177|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100337|pmid=21740224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primates especially, grooming is known to have major social significance and function in the formation and maintenance of these friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schino|first=Gabriele|date=2001-08-01|title=Grooming, competition and social rank among female primates: a meta-analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347201917506|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=62|issue=2|pages=265–271|doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grooming networks in [[black crested gibbon]]s have been proven to contribute greater social cohesion and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guan|first=Zhen-Hua|last2=Huang|first2=Bei|last3=Ning|first3=Wen-He|last4=Ni|first4=Qing-Yong|last5=Sun|first5=Guo-Zheng|last6=Jiang|first6=Xue-Long|date=2013-12-01|title=Significance of grooming behavior in two polygynous groups of western black crested gibbons: Implications for understanding social relationships among immigrant and resident group members|journal=American Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=75|issue=12|pages=1165–1173|doi=10.1002/ajp.22178|pmid=23843246|issn=1098-2345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of gibbons with more stable social networks formed grooming networks that were significantly more complex, while groups with low stability networks formed far fewer grooming pairs. In [[meerkat]]s, social grooming has been shown to carry the role of maintaining relationships that increase [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kutsukake|first=Nobuyuki|last2=Clutton-Brock|first2=Tim H.|date=2010-02-01|title=Grooming and the value of social relationships in cooperatively breeding meerkats|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347209004655|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=79|issue=2|pages=271–279|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, researchers have observed that dominant males receive more grooming while grooming others less, thereby indicating that less dominant males groom more dominant individuals to maintain relationships. In addition to primates, animals such as deer, cows, horses, vole, mice, meerkats, coati, lions, birds, bats also form social bonds through grooming behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Gerald|last2=Leffer|first2=Lauren|date=2015-10-07|title=Social Grooming in Bats: Are Vampire Bats Exceptional?|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=10|pages=e0138430|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138430|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4596566|pmid=26445502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social grooming is critical for vampire bats especially, since it is necessary for them to maintain food-sharing relationships in order to sustain their food regurgitation sharing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carter|first=Gerald|last2=Leffer|first2=Lauren|date=2015-10-07|title=Social Grooming in Bats: Are Vampire Bats Exceptional?|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=10|pages=e0138430|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0138430|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4596566|pmid=26445502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct fitness consequences ===
Social grooming relationships have been proven to provide direct fitness benefits to a variety of species. In particular, grooming in [[yellow baboon]]s (''Papio cynocephalus'') has been studied extensively, with numerous studies showing an increase in fitness as a result of social bonds formed through social grooming behavior. One such study, which collected 16 years of behavioral data on wild baboons, highlights the effects that [[sociality]] has on infant survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silk|first=Joan B.|last2=Alberts|first2=Susan C.|last3=Altmann|first3=Jeanne|date=2003-11-14|title=Social Bonds of Female Baboons Enhance Infant Survival|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5648/1231|journal=Science|language=en|volume=302|issue=5648|pages=1231–1234|doi=10.1126/science.1088580|issn=0036-8075|pmid=14615543}}&lt;/ref&gt; A positive relationship is established between infant survival to one year and a composite sociality index, a measure of sociality based on proximity and social grooming. Evidence has also been provided for the effect of sociality on adult survival in wild baboons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archie|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Tung|first2=Jenny|last3=Clark|first3=Michael|last4=Altmann|first4=Jeanne|last5=Alberts|first5=Susan C.|date=2014-10-22|title=Social affiliation matters: both same-sex and opposite-sex relationships predict survival in wild female baboons|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1793/20141261|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=281|issue=1793|pages=20141261|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.1261|issn=0962-8452|pmc=4173677|pmid=25209936|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct correlations between measures of social connectedness (which focuses on social grooming) and median survival time for both female and male baboons were modeled.

Social bonds established by grooming may provide an adaptive advantage in the form of conflict resolution and protection from aggression. In wild savannah baboons, social affiliations are shown to augment fitness by increasing tolerance from more dominant group members &lt;ref name="Henazi"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henazi|first=Peter S.|last2=Barrett|first2=Louise|date=1999-01-01|title=The value of grooming to female primates|journal=Primates|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=47–59|doi=10.1007/BF02557701|pmid=23179531|issn=0032-8332}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing the chance of obtaining aid from [[conspecifics]] during instances of within-group contest interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sterck|first=Elisabeth H.

These social relationships serve to aid cooperation and facilitate protection against combative groups composed of other males, which can oftentimes cause physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berghänel|first=Andreas|last2=Ostner|first2=Julia|last3=Schröder|first3=Uta|last4=Schülke|first4=Oliver|title=Social bonds predict future cooperation in male Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=81|issue=6|pages=1109–1116|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.02.009|year=2011}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, social relationships have also been proven to decrease risk of infanticide in several primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaik|first=Carel P.

== Altruism ==
[[Altruism (biology)|Altruism]], in the biological sense, refers to a behavior performed by an individual that increases the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the one performing the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selection : the mechanism of evolution|last=Graham.|first=Bell|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198569725|oclc=781154368}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This differs from the philosophical concept of [[altruism]] which requires the conscious intention of helping another.  As a behavior, altruism is not evaluated in moral terms, but rather as a consequence of an action for [[reproductive fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/altruism-biological/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often questioned why the behavior persists if it is costly to the one performing it, however, [[Charles Darwin]] proposed [[group selection]] as the mechanism behind the clear advantages of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.|year=1871|publisher=John Murray|last=Darwin|first=Charles|language=en|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.2092|hdl = 2027/bc.ark:/13960/t96696g2b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social grooming is considered a behavior of facultative altruism- the behavior itself is a temporary loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain), followed by personal reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|date=1971-03-01|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradeoff has been compared to the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma]] model, and out of this comparison came [[Robert Trivers]] reciprocal altruism theory under the title "tit-for-tat".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=W. D.|date=1981-03-27|title=The evolution of cooperation|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/211/4489/1390|journal=Science|language=en|volume=211|issue=4489|pages=1390–1396|doi=10.1126/science.7466396|issn=0036-8075|pmid=7466396}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In conjunction with altruism, [[kin selection]] bears an emphasis on favoring the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicreader.com/book/107/59/|title=Origin of Species  : Chapter VIII. Instinct : Objections to the theory of natural selection as applied to instincts: neuter and sterile insects by Charles Darwin @ Classic Reader|website=www.classicreader.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, kin selection is an instance of [[inclusive fitness]], which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others, such as siblings.

=== Hamilton's Rule ===
&lt;math&gt;rB&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;

Developed by [[W. D. Hamilton|W.D. Hamilton]], this rule governs the idea that kin selection causes genes to increase in frequency when the genetic relatedness (r) of a recipient to an actor multiplied by the benefit to the recipient (B) is greater than the reproductive cost to the actor (C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Sewall|date=1922-07-01|title=Coefficients of Inbreeding and Relationship|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=56|issue=645|pages=330–338|doi=10.1086/279872|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, it is advantageous for an individual to partake in altruistic behaviors, such as social grooming, so long as the individual receiving the benefits of the behavior is related to the one providing the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary genetics|last=)|first=Smith, John Maynard, (1920-|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198542155|oclc=954574132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use as a commodity ===
It was questioned whether some animals are instead using altruistic behaviors as a market strategy to trade for something desirable.  In olive baboons, ''[[Olive baboon|Papio anubis]],'' it has been found that individuals perform altruistic behaviors as a form of trade in which a behavior is provided in exchange for benefits, such as [[Aggression|reduced aggression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Rebecca|year=January 2009|title=Impatient traders or contingent reciprocators? Evidence for the extended time-course of grooming exchanges in baboons|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/silk/PDF%20Files%20Pubs/Frank%20&amp;%20Silk%202009%20Grooming.pdf|journal=Behavior|volume=146|issue=8|pages=1123–1135|via=Brill|doi=10.1163/156853909x406455}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grooming was evenly balanced across multiple bouts rather than single bouts, suggesting that females are not constrained to complete exchanges with single transactions and use social grooming to solidify long term relationships with those in their [[social group]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition, [[Lar gibbon|white-handed gibbons]] (''Hylobates lar)'' confirmed that males were more attentive to social grooming during [[Estrous cycle|estrus]] of the females in their group.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barelli|first=Claudia|last2=Reichard|first2=Ulrich H.|last3=Mundry|first3=Roger|date=2011-10-01|title=Is grooming used as a commodity in wild white-handed gibbons, Hylobates lar?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347211002922|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=82|issue=4|pages=801–809|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the behavior of social grooming itself was not beneficial to the one providing the service, the opportunity to mate and subsequent [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] increases the [[reproductive fitness]] of those participating in the behavior.  This study was also successful in finding that social grooming performance cycled with that of the females [[Menstrual cycle|ovarian cycle]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many [[social animal|animal]]s groom each other in the form of stroking, scratching, and massaging. This activity often serves to remove foreign material from the body to promote the communal success of these socially active animals.

=== Insects ===
In insects, grooming often involves the important role of removing foreign material from the body. The honey bee, for example, engages in social grooming by cleaning body parts that cannot be reached by the receiving bee. The receiving bee extends their wings perpendicular to their body while their wings, mouth parts, and antennae are cleaned in order to remove dust and pollen. This removal of dust and pollen allows for sharpening of olfactory senses in contributing to the overall well being of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = D. | last2 = Angel | first2 = J.

=== Bats ===
Recent studies have determined that vampire bats engage in social grooming much more than other types of bats to promote the well-being of the group. Facing higher levels of parasitic infection, vampire bats engage in cleaning one another as well as sharing food via regurgitation. This activity prevents ongoing infection while also promoting group success.&lt;ref&gt;Carter G.; Leffer L. (2015), Social Grooming in Bats: Are Vampire Bats Exceptional?. ''PLOS ONE'' 10(10): e0138430. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138430&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primates ===
[[File:Vampire bat allogrooming.jpg|thumb]]
Primates provide perhaps one of the best example of mutual grooming due to the intensive research performed regarding their varying lifestyles, and the direct variation of means of social grooming across different species. Among primates, social grooming plays a significant role in animal [[consolation]] behavior whereby the primates engage in establishing and maintaining alliances through [[dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]], pre-existing coalitions, and for reconciliation after conflicts. Primates groom socially in moments of boredom as well, and the act has been shown to reduce tension and stress.&lt;ref name="Schino1988"&gt;{{citation|title=Allogrooming as a tension-reduction mechanism: a behavioral approach|year=1988|last1=Schino|last2=Scucchi|last3=Maestripieri|last4=Turillazzi|first1=G.|first2=S.|first3=D.|first4=P.G.|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=16|pages=43–50|doi=10.1002/ajp.1350160106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in stress is often associated with observed periods of relaxed behavior, and primates have been known to fall asleep while receiving grooming.&lt;ref name="Smuts1985"&gt;{{citation|title=Sex and Friendship in Baboons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vx_l76muFWMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=smuts+%22Sex+and+Friendship+in+Baboons%22&amp;q|year=1985|author=Smuts, Barbara|place=New York|publisher=Aldine Publications|isbn=978-0-202-02027-3|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooming in primates is not only utilized for alliance formation and maintenance, but to exchange resources such as communal food, sex, and hygiene.  Wild baboons have been found to utilize social grooming as an activity to remove ticks and other insects from others. In this grooming, the body areas receiving significant attention appear to be the regions where the baboons themselves cannot reach.  Grooming activity in these regions is used to remove parasites, dirt, dead skin, as well as tangled fur to help keep the animal’s health in good condition despite an individual inability to reach and clean certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, Barbara B. ''Sex &amp; friendship in baboons''. New Brunswick: Aldine Transaction, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies regarding chimpanzees have determined the direct correlation of the release of oxytocin to consolatory behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawick-Goodall | first1 = J. van | year = 1968 | title = The behavior of free living chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour Monographs | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 161–311 | doi = 10.1016/s0066-1856(68)80003-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior as well as release has been noted in primates such as the Vervet monkey, a primate species that actively engages in social grooming from early childhood to adulthood. [[Vervet monkey]] siblings often have conflict over grooming allocation by their mother, yet, grooming remains an activity that mediates tension and is low cost for alliance formation and maintenance. This grooming occurs both between the siblings as well as involving the mother.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, F. (1989). Peacemaking among primates. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies regarding the [[crab-eating macaque]]s have shown that males will groom females in order to procure sex. One study found that a female has a greater likelihood to engage in sexual activity with a male if he had recently groomed her, compared to males who had not groomed her.[[Social grooming#cite note-41|&lt;sup&gt;[41]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Birds ===
{{Main|Preening (bird)#Allopreening}}
In 2010, researchers determined the existence of a form of social grooming as a consolation behavior within ravens via a form of bystander contact, whereby observer ravens would act to console a distressed victim via contact sitting, preening, as well as beak-to-beak touching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orlaith | first1 = N.F. | last2 = Bugnyar | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Do Ravens Show Consolation? Responses to Distressed Others | journal = PLoS ONE | volume =  5| issue = 5| page =  e10605| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010605 | pmid = 20485685 | pmc=2868892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horses ===
Horses engage in mutual grooming via the formation of [[Pair bond|'pair bonds]]' where parasites and other contaminants on the surface of the body are actively removed. This removal of foreign material is primarily performed in hard-to-reach areas such as the neck via nibbling.&lt;ref&gt;Feh, C., De Mazieres, J. Grooming at a preferred site reduces heart rate in horses. Anim. Behav. 1993;46:1191–1194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cattle===
Allogrooming is a behaviour commonly seen in many types of cattle, including dairy and beef breeds. The act of social licking can be seen specifically in heifers to initiate social dominance, emphasize companionship and improve hygiene of oneself or others. This behaviour seen in cows may provide advantages including reduced parasite loads, social tension and competition at the feed bunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Val-Laillet|first=David|last2=Guesdon|first2=Vanessa|last3=Keyserlingk|first3=Marina A.G. von|last4=Passillé|first4=Anne Marie de|last5=Rushen|first5=Jeffrey|title=Allogrooming in cattle: Relationships between social preferences, feeding displacements and social dominance|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=116|issue=2–4|pages=141–149|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2008.08.005|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that social licking can provide long term benefits such as promoting positive emotions and a relaxed environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laister|first=Simone|last2=Stockinger|first2=Barbara|last3=Regner|first3=Anna-Maria|last4=Zenger|first4=Karin|last5=Knierim|first5=Ute|last6=Winckler|first6=Christoph|title=Social licking in dairy cattle—Effects on heart rate in performers and receivers|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=130|issue=3–4|pages=81–90|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2010.12.003|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endocrine effects==
Social grooming has shown to be correlated with changes in endocrine levels within individuals. Specifically, there is a large correlation between the brain's release of oxytocin and social grooming. Oxytocin is hypothesized to promote prosocial behaviours due to its positive emotional response when released.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further, social grooming also releases beta-endorphins which promote physiological responses in stress reduction. These responses can occur from the production of hormones and endorphins, or through the growth or reduction in nerve structures. For example, in studies of suckling rats, rats who received warmth and touch when feeding had lower blood pressure levels than rats who did not receive any touch. This was found to be a result of an increased vagal nerve tone, meaning they had had higher parasympathetic nervous response and lower sympathetic nervous response to stimulus, resulting in a lower stress response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453098000560|title=OXYTOCIN MAY MEDIATE THE BENEFITS OF POSITIVE SOCIAL INTERACTION AND EMOTIONS|access-date=2017-03-24 | doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00056-0|volume=23|issue=8|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|pages=819–835|date=November 1998|last1=Uvnäs-Moberg|first1=Kerstin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social grooming is a form of innocuous sensory activation. Innocuous sensory activation, characterized by non aggressive contact, stimulates an entirely separate neural pathway from nocuous aggressive sensory activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uvnäs-Moberg|first=Kerstin|date=1997-01-01|title=Physiological and Endocrine Effects of Social Contact|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=807|issue=1|pages=146–163|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb51917.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innocuous sensations are transmitted through the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system.

=== Oxytocin ===
[[Oxytocin]] is a peptide hormone known to help express social emotions such as altruism, which in turn provides a positive feedback mechanism for social behaviours.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kemp|first=Andrew H.|last2=Guastella|first2=Adam J.|date=2011-08-08|title=The Role of Oxytocin in Human Affect|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=222–231|doi=10.1177/0963721411417547}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies in [[vampire bat]]s have shown that intranasal injections of oxytocin have increased the amount of allogrooming done by female bats.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson1986" /&gt; The release of oxytocin, found to be stimulated by positive touch( such as allogrooming), positive smells and sounds, can have physiological benefits to the individual. Benefits can include: relaxation, healing, and digestion stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uvnäs-Moberg|first=Kerstin|date=1998-11-01|title=OXYTOCIN MAY MEDIATE THE BENEFITS OF POSITIVE SOCIAL INTERACTION AND EMOTIONS1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453098000560|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=23|issue=8|pages=819–835|doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, reproductive benefits have been found such as studies in rats have shown that the release of oxytocin can increase male reproductive success. The role of oxytocin is important in maternal pair bonding, and is hypothesized to promote similar bonding in social groups as a result of positive feedback loops from social interactions.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 260–268"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. I. M.|date=2010-02-01|title=The social role of touch in humans and primates: Behavioural function and neurobiological mechanisms|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763408001127|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|series=Touch, Temperature, Pain/Itch and Pleasure|volume=34|issue=2|pages=260–268|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.07.001|pmid=18662717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta-endorphins ===
Grooming stimulates the release of [[beta-endorphin]], which is one physiological reason for why grooming appears to be relaxing.&lt;ref name="Keverne1989"&gt;{{citation|title=Beta-endorphin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of monkeys are influenced by grooming relationships|year=1989|last1=Keverne|last2=Martensz|last3=Tuite|first1=E.B.|first2=N.D.|first3=B.|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=14|issue=1–2|pages=155–161|doi=10.1016/0306-4530(89)90065-6|pmid=2525263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta-endorphins are found in neurons in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Beta-endorphins are found to be opioid agonists. Opioids are molecules that act on receptors to promote feelings of relaxation, and reduce pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physiology and Pharmacology for Anesthesia: Foundations and Clinical Application: Expert Consult - Online and Print.|last=FRCA.|first=Hemmings, Hugh C., MD, PhD|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1437716795|oclc=830351627}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in monkeys shows the changes in opiate expression in the body, mirroring changes in beta-endorphin levels, influences desire for social grooming. In using [[Opioid receptor|opiate receptor]] blockades, which decrease the level of beta-endorphins, the monkeys responded with an increased desire to be groomed. In contrast, when the monkeys were given morphine, the desire to be groomed dropped significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keverne|first=Eric B.|last2=Martensz|first2=Nicholas D.|last3=Tuite|first3=Bernadette|date=1989-01-01|title=Beta-endorphin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of monkeys are influenced by grooming relationships|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306453089900656|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=14|issue=1–2|pages=155–161|doi=10.1016/0306-4530(89)90065-6|pmid=2525263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta- endorphins have been difficult to measure in animal species, differently from oxytocin which can be measured by sampling cerebrospinal fluid, and therefore have not been linked as strongly with social behaviours.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 260–268"/&gt;

=== Glucocorticoids receptors  ===
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal cortex and are a part of the group of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are involved in immune function, and are a part of the feedback system that reduces inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert M.|last2=Romero|first2=L. Michael|last3=Munck|first3=Allan U.|date=2000-02-01|title=How Do Glucocorticoids Influence Stress Responses?

Studies in macaques have shown that increased social stress results in glucocorticoid resistance, further inhibiting immune function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capitanio|first=John P.|last2=Mendoza|first2=Sally P.|last3=Lerche|first3=Nicholas W.|last4=Mason|first4=William A.|date=1998-04-14|title=Social stress results in altered glucocorticoid regulation and shorter survival in simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=95|issue=8|pages=4714–4719|issn=0027-8424|pmc=22556|pmid=9539804|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.8.4714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macaques who participated in social grooming showed decreased levels of viral load, which points toward decreased levels of social stress resulting in increased immune function and glucocorticoid sensitivity.  Additionally, an article published in 1997 concluded that an increase in [[Maternal bond|maternal]] grooming resulted in a proportionate increase in [[Glucocorticoid receptor]]s on target tissue in the neonatal rat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Dong|last2=Diorio|first2=Josie|last3=Tannenbaum|first3=Beth|last4=Caldji|first4=Christian|last5=Francis|first5=Darlene|last6=Freedman|first6=Alison|last7=Sharma|first7=Shakti|last8=Pearson|first8=Deborah|last9=Plotsky|first9=Paul M.|date=1997-09-12|title=Maternal Care, Hippocampal Glucocorticoid Receptors, and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Responses to Stress|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5332/1659|journal=Science|language=en|volume=277|issue=5332|pages=1659–1662|doi=10.1126/science.277.5332.1659|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9287218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the study on neonatal rats, it was found that the receptor number was altered because of a change in both [[serotonin]] and [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] concentrations. An increase in the number of receptors might influence the amount of [[negative feedback]] on corticosteroid secretion and prevent the undesirable side effects of an abnormal physiologic stress response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Sapolsky, Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Sapolsky|title=The Importance of a Well-Groomed Child|date=September 1997|journal=Science|volume=277|pages=1620–1621|doi=10.1126/science.277.5332.1620|pmid=9312858|issue=5332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social grooming can change the number of glucocorticoid receptors, which can result in increased immune function.

Studies have also shown that male baboons who participate more in social grooming show lower basal cortisol concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ray|first=Justina C.|last2=Sapolsky|first2=Robert M.|date=1992-01-01|title=Styles of male social behavior and their endocrine correlates among high-ranking wild baboons|journal=American Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=231–250|doi=10.1002/ajp.1350280402|issn=1098-2345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[chemical compound]] '''trichloroethylene''' is a [[halocarbon]] commonly used as an industrial [[solvent]]. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. It should not be confused with the similar [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]], which is commonly known as ''chlorothene''.

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] name is '''trichloroethene'''. Industrial abbreviations include '''TCE''', '''trichlor''', '''Trike''', '''Tricky''' and '''tri'''.  It has been sold under a variety of trade names. Under the trade names '''Trimar''' and '''Trilene''', trichloroethylene was used as a volatile [[anesthetic]] and as an inhaled obstetrical [[analgesic]] in millions of patients.

Groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge is a major concern for human health and has precipitated numerous incidents and lawsuits.

==History==
Pioneered by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain, its development was hailed as an anesthetic revolution. Originally thought to possess less [[hepatotoxicity]] than [[chloroform]], and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of [[ether]], TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of [[cardiac arrhythmias]], low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with [[soda lime]] used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform.

The introduction of [[halothane]] in 1956 greatly diminished the use of TCE as a general anesthetic. TCE was still used as an inhalation analgesic in childbirth given by self-administration. Fetal toxicity and concerns for carcinogenic potential of TCE led to its abandonment in developed countries by the 1980s.

Due to concerns about its toxicity, the use of trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned in much of the world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 [[List of R-phrases|risk phrase]], ''May cause cancer''. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on [[n-Propyl bromide|''n''-propyl bromide]] which carries an R60 risk phrase of ''May impair fertility'', and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.

[[Groundwater]] contamination by TCE has become an important environmental concern for [[#Human exposure|human exposure]].

In 2005 it was announced by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that the agency had completed its Final Health Assessment for Trichloroethylene and released a list of new TCE toxicity values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/IRIS/subst/0199.htm|title=Trichloroethylene (CASRN 79-01-6)|publisher=Epa.gov|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study have formally characterized the chemical as a human carcinogen and a non-carcinogenic health hazard. A 2011 toxicological review performed by the EPA continues to list trichloroethylene as a known carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|journal=EPA|date=September 2011|volume=635|issue=R–09/011F|url=http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0199tr/0199tr.pdf | title = Toxicological Review of Trichloroethylene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Prior to the early 1970s, most trichloroethylene was produced in a two-step process from [[acetylene]]. First, acetylene was treated with chlorine using a [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] [[catalyst]] at 90&amp;nbsp;°C to produce [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane]] according to the [[chemical equation]]

:[[acetylene|HC≡CH]] + 2 [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

The 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is then dehydrochlorinated to give trichloroethylene. This can either be accomplished with an aqueous solution of [[calcium hydroxide]]

:2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2 ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

or in the vapor phase by heating it to 300-500&amp;nbsp;°C on a [[barium chloride]] or [[calcium chloride]] catalyst

:Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]

Today, however, most trichloroethylene is produced from [[ethylene]]. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a [[iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] catalyst to produce [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]].

:[[ethylene|CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[1,2-Dichloroethane|ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]]

When heated to around 400&amp;nbsp;°C with additional chlorine, 1,2-dichloroethane is converted to trichloroethylene

:[[1,2-Dichloroethane|ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]] + 2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ClCH=CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 HCl

This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of [[potassium chloride]] and [[aluminium chloride|aluminum chloride]]. However, various forms of porous [[carbon]] can also be used. This reaction produces [[tetrachloroethylene]] as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by [[distillation]].

== Uses ==
Trichloroethylene is an effective [[solvent]] for a variety of [[organic chemistry|organic]] materials.

When it was first widely produced in the 1920s, trichloroethylene's major use was to extract [[vegetable oil]]s from plant materials such as [[soy]], [[coconut]], and [[palm tree|palm]]. Other uses in the food industry included [[coffee]] [[decaffeination]] and the preparation of flavoring extracts from [[hops]] and [[spice]]s. It has also been used for drying out the last bit of water for production of 100% ethanol.

From the 1930s through the 1970s, both in Europe and in North America, trichloroethylene was used as a volatile anesthetic almost invariably administered with nitrous oxide. Marketed in the UK by ICI under the trade name Trilene it was coloured blue (with a dye called waxoline blue) to avoid confusion with the similar smelling chloroform.  TCE replaced earlier anesthetics [[chloroform]] and [[diethyl ether|ether]] in the 1940s, but was itself replaced in the 1960s in developed countries with the introduction of [[halothane]], which allowed much faster induction and recovery times.  Trilene was also used as a potent inhaled analgesic, mainly during childbirth.  It was used with halothane in the Tri-service field anaesthetic apparatus used by the UK armed forces under field conditions. As of 2000, however, TCE was still in use as an anesthetic in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It has also been used as a [[dry cleaning]] solvent, although replaced in the 1950s by [[tetrachloroethylene]] (also known as perchloroethylene), except for spot cleaning where it was used until the year 2000.

Trichloroethylene was marketed as 'Ecco 1500 Anti-Static Film Cleaner and Conditioner' until 2009, for use in automatic movie film cleaning machines, and for manual cleaning with lint-free wipes.

Perhaps the greatest use of TCE has been as a degreaser for metal parts. The demand for TCE as a degreaser began to decline in the 1950s in favor of the less toxic [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|1,1,1-trichloroethane]].  However, 1,1,1-trichloroethane production has been phased out in most of the world under the terms of the [[Montreal Protocol]], and as a result trichloroethylene has experienced some resurgence in use as a degreaser.

TCE has also been used in the United States to clean kerosene-fueled rocket engines (TCE was not used to clean hydrogen-fueled engines such as the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]).  During static firing, the RP-1 fuel would leave hydrocarbon deposits and vapors in the engine.  These deposits had to be flushed from the engine to avoid the possibility of explosion during engine handling and future firing.  TCE was used to flush the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing.  The flushing procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30–35 minutes, depending upon the engine.  For some engines, the engine's gas generator and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |format=PDF |title=Santa Susana Field Laboratory : The Use of Trichloroethylene at NASA's SSFL Sites |publisher=Ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114001621/http://ssfl.msfc.nasa.gov/public-involvement/docs/SSFL_TCE_Final_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall&amp;Ntt=19750070175|title=F-1 Rocket Engine Operating Instructions|publisher=Ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[F-1 rocket engine]] had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/&gt;

TCE is also used in the manufacture of a range of fluorocarbon refrigerants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~enviro/design/r134a.pdf |format=PDF |title=Production of R-134a |publisher=Nd.edu|accessdate=21 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711235310/http://www.nd.edu/~enviro/design/r134a.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] more commonly known as HFC 134a. TCE was also used in industrial refrigeration applications due to its high heat transfer capabilities and its low temperature specification. Many industrial refrigeration applications used TCE up to the 1990s in applications such as car testing facilities.

==Chemical instability==
Despite its widespread use as a metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable in the presence of metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry, when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point in a [[reflux condenser]] and observing decomposition. The first widely used stabilizing additive was [[dioxane]]; however, its use was patented by [[Dow Chemical Company]] and could not be used by other manufacturers. Considerable research took place in the 1960s to develop alternative stabilizers for trichloroethylene. Other chemical stabilizers include [[ketone]]s such as [[methyl ethyl ketone]].

==Physiological effects==
When inhaled, trichloroethylene produces [[central nervous system]] depression resulting in general [[anesthesia]]. These effects may be mediated by trichloroethylene acting as a [[positive allosteric modulator]] of inhibitory GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and glycine receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = M. J. Beckstead, J. L. Weiner, E. I. 2nd Eger, D. H. Gong &amp; S. J.

Higher concentrations result in [[tachypnea]].  Many types of cardiac [[arrhythmias]] can occur and are exacerbated by [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline).  It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) absorbing systems ([[soda lime]]) to produce dichloroacetylene and [[phosgene]].&lt;ref name=Orkin&gt;Orkin, F. K. (1986) Anesthesia Systems (Chapter 5). In R. D. Miller (Ed.), Anesthesia (second edition). New York, NY: Churchill Livingstone.{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cranial nerve]] dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbing systems.  These nerve deficits could last for months.  Occasionally facial numbness was permanent.  Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor.  For these reasons as well as problems with [[hepatotoxicity]], TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthestics such as [[halothane]] by the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Stevens, W.C. and Kingston H. G. G. (1989) Inhalation Anesthesia (Chapter 11). In P. G. Barash et al. (Eds.) Clinical Anesthesia.  Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott.{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of acute non-medical exposure are similar to those of [[alcohol intoxication]], beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/tri-ethy.html |title=Trichloroethylene &amp;#124; Technology Transfer Network Air Toxics Web site &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respiratory and circulatory depression can result in death.

Much of what is known about the human health effects of trichloroethylene is based on occupational exposures. Beyond the effects to the central nervous system, workplace exposure to trichloroethylene has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; Over time, occupational exposure limits on trichloroethylene have tightened, resulting in more stringent ventilation controls and personal protective equipment use by workers.

Research from Cancer bioassays performed by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (later the [[National Toxicology Program]]) showed that exposure to trichloroethylene is carcinogenic in animals, producing liver cancer in mice, and kidney cancer in rats.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/phs19.html |title=ATSDR - Redirect - Public Health Statement: Trichloroethylene |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Toxicology Program’s 11th Report on Carcinogens categorizes trichloroethylene as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”, based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Trichloroethylene |chapterurl=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/Trichloroethylene.pdf |pages=420–3 |title=Report on Carcinogens |edition=12th |url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12 |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |year=2011 |author=[[National Toxicology Program]] |isbn=978-1-4379-8736-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625114247/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/roc12 |archivedate=2011-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent review of the epidemiology of [[renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]] rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2006.07.130 |title=The Epidemiology of Renal Cell Carcinoma |year=2006 |last1=Lipworth |first1=Loren |last2=Tarone |first2=Robert E. |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Joseph K. |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=176 |issue=6 |pages=2353–8 |pmid=17085101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, "[t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11707.html |title=Assessing the Human Health Risks of Trichloroethylene: Key Scientific Issues &amp;#124; The National Academies Press |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the US [[National Academy of Science|NAS]] suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population.

The health risks of trichloroethylene have been studied extensively. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) sponsored a "state of the science" review of the health effects associated with exposure to trichloroethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.00108s2159 |title=Trichloroethylene Health Risks--State of the Science |year=2000 |last1=Scott |first1=Cheryl Siegel |last2=Cogliano |first2=V.

In Europe, the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] (SCOEL) recommends for trichloroethylene an [[occupational exposure limit]]  (8 hour time-weighted average) of 10 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 30 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/keyDocuments.jsp?type=0&amp;policyArea=82&amp;subCategory=153&amp;country=0&amp;year=0&amp;advSearchKey=recommendation&amp;mode=advancedSubmit&amp;langId=en|title=SCOEL recommendations|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize|section|date=February 2010}}

Exposure to TCE occurs mainly through contaminated drinking water. With a specific gravity greater than 1, trichloroethylene can be present as a [[dense non-aqueous phase liquid]] (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment. Another significant source of vapor exposure in [[Superfund]] sites that had contaminated groundwater, such as the [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]], was by showering. TCE readily volatilizes out of hot water and into the air. Long, hot showers would then volatilize more TCE into the air. In a home closed tightly to conserve the cost of heating and cooling, these vapors would then recirculate.

The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne FA, McLachlan T (1949). "Contamination of water by trichloroethylene" p. 513 in {{cite journal |doi=10.1039/AN9497400510 |title=Notes |year=1949 |last1=Lilliman |first1=B. |last2=Houlihan |first2=J.

In 1998, the [[View-Master factory supply well]] in [[Beaverton, Oregon]] was found to have been contaminated with high levels of TCE.

In the case of [[Lisle, Illinois]], releases of trichloroethylene (TCE) had allegedly occurred on the Lockformer property beginning in 1968 and continuing for an undetermined period.

Contamination at the Lockformer site is presently under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Illinois EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.state.il.us/community-relations/fact-sheets/lisle-groundwater/lisle-groundwater1.html |title=Fact Sheet #1 - Lisle Groundwater Contamination Investigation |publisher=Epa.state.il.us |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Lockformer conducted soil sampling on their property and found TCE in the soil at levels as high as 680 parts per million (ppm). During the summer of 2000, a group of residents hired legal counsel, and on October 11, 2000, these residents had their private well water tested by a private environmental consultant. The group owned homes south of the Lockformer property in the suspected path of groundwater flow. The consultant collected a second round of well water samples on November 10, 2000, and TCE was detected in some of the wells sampled. Beginning in December 2000, Illinois EPA collected about 350 more private well water samples north and south of the Lockformer property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pdf/LISLE%20RWs%20PHA%20FINAL%20Release.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050530143200/http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pdf/LISLE%20RWs%20PHA%20FINAL%20Release.pdf|date=May 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over twenty years of operation, [[RCA Corporation]] had been pouring toxic wastewater into a well in its [[Taoyuan City]], [[Taiwan]] facility.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The pollution from the plant was not revealed until 1994, when former workers brought it to light.

The 1998 film [[A Civil Action (film)|A Civil Action]] dramatizes the EPA lawsuit ''Anne Anderson, et al., v. Cryovac, Inc.'' concerning trichloroethylene contamination that occurred in [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] in the 1980s.

=== Existing regulation ===
Until recent years, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) contended that trichloroethylene had little-to-no carcinogenic potential, and was probably a [[co-carcinogen]]—that is, it acted in concert with other substances to promote the formation of tumors.

State, federal, and international agencies classify trichloroethylene as a known or probable carcinogen. In 2014, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] updated its classification of trichloroethylene to Group 1, indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it causes cancer of the kidney in humans as well as some evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol106/mono106-001.pdf |title=Trichloroethylene (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation, Volume 106, 2014) |publisher=iarc.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; California EPA regulators consider it a known carcinogen and issued a risk assessment in 1999 that concluded that it was far more toxic than previous scientific studies had shown.

In the [[European Union]], the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] (SCOEL) recommends an exposure limit for workers exposed to trichloroethylene of 10&amp;nbsp;ppm (54.7&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for 8-hour [[Permissible exposure limit|TWA]] and of 30&amp;nbsp;ppm (164.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[Permissible exposure limit|STEL]] (15 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6405&amp;langId=en |format= PDF |title= Recommendation from the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Trichloroethylene (SCOEL/SUM/142) |date= April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing EU legislation aimed at protection of workers against risks to their health (including Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:131:0011:0023:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=Council Directive 98/24/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carcinogens Directive 2004/37/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0023:0034:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=Directive 2004/37/EC |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) currently do not impose binding minimum requirements for controlling risks to workers health during the use phase or throughout the life cycle of trichloroethylene. However, in case the ongoing discussions under the Carcinogens Directive will result in setting of a binding Occupational Exposure Limit for trichloroethylene for protection of workers; this conclusion may be revisited.

The Solvents Emissions Directive 1999/13/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1999L0013:19990329:EN:PDF|title=LexUriServ.do|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:334:0017:0119:en:PDF |format=PDF |title=Directive 2010/75/EU |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; impose binding minimum requirements for emissions of trichloroethylene to the environment for certain activities, including surface cleaning. However, the activities with solvent consumption below a specified threshold are not covered by these minimum requirements.

According to European regulation, the use of trichloroethylene is prohibited for individuals at a concentration greater than 0.1%. In industry, trichloroethylene should be substituted before April 21, 2016 (unless an exemption is requested before October 21, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013R0348&amp;qid=1396362971420&amp;from=EN|title=L_2013108EN.01000101.xml|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by other products such as [[tetrachloroethylene]] ([[perchloroethylene]]), [[methylene chloride]] ([[dichloromethane]]), or other hydrocarbon derivatives ([[ketone]]s, [[alcohol]]s, ...)

=== Proposed U.S. federal regulation ===
In 2001, a draft report of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) laid the groundwork for tough new standards to limit public exposure to trichloroethylene. The assessment set off a fight between the EPA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and [[NASA]], who appealed directly to the White House. They argued that the EPA had produced junk science, its assumptions were badly flawed, and that evidence exonerating the chemical was ignored.

The DoD has about 1,400 military properties nationwide that are contaminated with trichloroethylene. Many of these sites are detailed and updated by www.cpeo.org and include a former ammunition plant in the Twin Cities area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cpeo.org/milit.html |title=Military |publisher=CPEO |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty three sites in the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex — including [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in the San Francisco Bay area, and NASA centers, including the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[La Cañada Flintridge]] are reported to have TCE contamination.

Political appointees in the EPA sided with the Pentagon and agreed to pull back the risk assessment. In 2004, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] was given a $680,000 contract to study the matter, releasing its report in the summer of 2006. The report has raised more concerns about the health effects of TCE.

In response to the heightened awareness of environmental toxins such as TCE and the role they may be playing in childhood disease, in 2007, Senator Barack Obama proposed S1068, co-sponsored by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d110:19:./temp/~bdMMKn:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation aimed to inform and protect communities that are threatened with environmental contamination. Senator Clinton's own bill, S1911, is known as the TCE Reduction Act.

=== Reduced production and remediation ===
In recent times, there has been a substantial reduction in the production output of trichloroethylene; alternatives for use in metal degreasing abound, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons being phased out in a large majority of industries due to the potential for irreversible health effects and the legal liability that ensues as a result.

The U.S. military has virtually eliminated its use of the chemical, purchasing only 11 gallons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Recent research has focused on the in-place remediation of trichloroethylene in soil and ground water instead of removal for off-site treatment and disposal. Naturally-occurring bacteria have been identified with the ability to degrade TCE. ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' sp. degrade trichloroethylene by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' can co-metabolize TCE. Soil and ground water contamination by TCE has also been successfully remediated by chemical treatment and extraction. The bacteria ''[[Nitrosomonas europaea]]'' can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene.&lt;ref name="genome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/niteu/niteu.home.html |title=Home - Nitrosomonas europaea |publisher=Genome.jgi-psf.org |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toluene dioxygenase]] has been reported to be involved in TCE degradation by ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]''.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oLNtgk_VKXsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Bioremediation+of+gypsum#v=onepage&amp;q=Bioremediation%20of%20gypsum&amp;f=false|title=Bioremediation Technologies: Principles and Practice|author1=Robert L.

==Biography==
Binder holds an M.D. degree from [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/20-year-olds-getting-botox-preventative-1.3794558|title=Why more 20-somethings are getting Botox|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1319430/Have-Cameron-Diaz-Kylie-Minogue-surgery-free-facelift.html|title=Pillow-face epidemic: Which celebs have plumped for a surgery-free facelift - and who just looks like they have?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Binder was elected as a member of the Board of Directors of the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, for which he also serves as a National Board Examiner. He is a member of the National Review Committee for the American Academy of Neurology Therapeutics and Technologies Subcommittee on the Assessment of Botulinum Toxin Therapy and also an adjunct reviewer for the Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery Journal.
Binder is board certified by both the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and the American Board of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery.
Binder published around 70 articles in national medical and surgical journals. He edited three textbooks in Facial Plastic Surgery and Head and Neck Surgery and Otolaryngology. He speaks and lecturers on various aspects of facial plastic surgery, including Rhinoplasty and multi-level concept of facelift surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/pics/real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-plastic-surgery-botox/|title=Photos!

In 1992, Binder discovered the use of Botox to alleviate sufferers of chronic migraine headaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/130951/20170106/botox-drug-health-problems-consider-side-effects.htm|title=Botox Is The Drug For All Health Problems-Yet Consider The Side Effects Too|first=Latin|last=Post|date=6 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercado.com.ar/notas/mercado-plus/8023219/botox-mucho-ms-que-cosmtica|title=Botox: mucho más que cosmética|website=www.mercado.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6357">'''Women's police stations''' (also '''units''' or '''offices''') – {{lang-es|Comisaría de la Mujer}}, {{lang-pt|Delegacia da mulher}} – are [[police station]]s specializing in crimes with female victims. They were first introduced in 1985 in Brazil and are numerous in Latin America.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1093-womens-police-stations-units.html |title=Women's police stations / units |publisher=[[UN Women]] |accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Latin American Perspectives'', the first women's police station was opened in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]]{{Clarify|reason=São Paulo?|date=April 2016}} and "In the first six months of operation, the DDM processed 2,083 reports."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Sara|date=1996|title=Constructing and Negotiating Gender in Women's Police Stations in Brazil|jstor=2633942|journal=Latin American Perspectives|doi=|pmid=|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Police officer|Officers]] at these stations are only allowed to respond to certain crimes, such as [[psychological violence]], [[domestic violence]], [[family violence]], as well as specific types of threats and [[sexual violence]].  Some units offer financial help, counseling, and medical care for women who are having trouble.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

In India, a study found "the establishment of 188 women's police stations resulted in a 23 percent increase in reporting of crimes against women and children and a higher conviction rate between 2002 and 2004".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

== Aim ==
Women's police stations are located in mostly Latin American countries where rates of rape and violence against women are high.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/299-fast-facts-statistics-on-violence-against-women-and-girls-.html&lt;/ref&gt; Americasquarterly.org states, "Femicide—the killing of women—has reached alarming levels in Latin America.  The most recent region-wide statistics available, from 2003, show that seven Latin American countries score among the worst 10 nations when measuring the rate of femicide per one million women in 40 countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/1930|title=Gender: Violence Against Women|last=Gasman|first=Nadine|date=|website=Americas Quarterly|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's police stations are also in Ghana, [[Women in India|India]], Pakistan, Kosovo, Liberia, Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda and Uruguay. A policewoman at a station in Pakistan states, "Even if a woman is being beaten and psychologically tortured, she's told to consider her husband's honor and not go to the police station."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/08/22/3694083/pakistan-policewomen/|title=Why This Police Force's Gender Problem Is Bad News For Women|last=Ahmed|first=Beenish|date=22 August 2015|website=thinkprocess.org|publisher=|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Latin America do not even know their rights, Endvawow.org states, "Only in Brazil had a majority of women surveyed receiving training or information about their rights one or more times (by any source): 54% in Brazil, 42% in Nicaragua, 34% in Peru, and 23% in Ecuador."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/uploads/browser/files/security_wps_case_study.pdf|title=Women's Police Stations in Latin America Case Study: An Entry Point for Stopping Violence and Gaining Access to Justice (Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Nicaragua)|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Endvawnow.org|publisher=|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hautzinger in her article ''Criminalising Male Violence in Brazil's Women's Police Stations'', in Salvador, Brazil in regular police stations in spousal violence cases less than 2% actually went to court and the punishments the men did get were very minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hautzinger|first=Sarah|date=2002|title=Criminalising Male Violence in Brazil's Women's Police Stations: from awed essentialism to imagined communities|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=88a50b7a-736a-4bc0-ad8f-f74fa15c4911%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4101|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endvawnow states that women police stations are an important first step for crimes to enter the justice system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Results ==
Women's police stations have greatly expanded since 1985. Endvawnow.org states, "In 2010, there were 475 WPS in Brazil, 34 in Ecuador, 59 in Nicaragua, and 27 in Peru."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Santos' article ''EN-GENDERING THE POLICE'' states, "They [women's police stations] expanded victims' citizenship rights, allowing them to denounce a violence that not long ago was invisible and considered a private matter. In 2000, for example, 310,058 complaints of violence against women were registered in the women's police stations of Sao Paulo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Cecilia|date=21 January 2004|title=EN-GENDERING THE POLICE: &gt; Women's Police Stations and Feminism in Sao Paulo*|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=614ba16b-06b5-45e9-aad9-0eac03dc2a09%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=123|journal=Latin American Research Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language barriers and the inability to get to a station is still a problem. According to Endvawnow.org, women's police stations are located in more populated areas making it hard for women in [[rural area]]s to get to them and women who do not speak the same language as the policewomen can not communicate effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Endvawnow.org also states "It was also found that poor and less educated women are sometimes ignored in the WPS. Also, despite psychological violence being illegal in all four countries, operators frequently prioritise those cases in which women have severe visible physical injuries, and may resist accepting complaints of psychological violence."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 15th day of each lunar month is the day/night with full moon.
