[[File:Unknown-artist-eadwine-the-scribe-at-work-eadwine-psalter-christ-church-canterbury-england-uk-circa-1160-70.jpg|thumb|Scribe of [[Eadwine Psalter]] (mid-12th century, English)]]

This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in the '''12th century'''.

The 12th century in Western Europe saw an increase in the production of Latin texts and a proliferation of literate clerics from the multiplying cathedral schools. At the same time, vernacular literatures ranging from Provençal to Icelandic embodied in lyric and romance the values and worldview of an increasingly self-conscious and prosperous courtly aristocracy. These two trends contributed to a sweeping revival of letters with a lasting influence on the development of literature in the following centuries.

The '''''Altarpiece of the Saints John'''''  is a painting by [[Bernat Martorell]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional 

d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The ''Altarpiece of the Saints John'' from [[Vinaixa]] was commissioned in 1432 from the [[Tarragona]] painter [[Ramon de Mur]], but in the end it was painted by Martorell. The MNAC keeps most of the panels from this altarpiece. The main panel is kept at the [[Museu Diocesà de Tarragona]], a side compartment is kept at the [[Musée Rolin]] d'[[Autun]] ([[France]]), and the whereabouts of another compartment is unknown. The two Saints John feature in the scenes in the lateral lanes of the altarpiece and two more on the predella, respectively. The topmost compartment depicts the Calvary. The predella shows signs of old damage, especially scratches, on figures who were considered negative, such as the executioner (who cuts Saint John's head off), Herod and Herodias (crowned, behind the panel) and the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=064045-CJT  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Apple Scruffs'''" is a song by English musician [[George Harrison]], released on his 1970 triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''. It was written as a tribute to the die-hard [[Beatles]] fans known as [[Apple scruffs]], who would wait in certain London locations where the band members were likely to appear, even long after the group's [[The Beatles' break-up|break-up]] in April 1970.

The recording has been noted for its [[Bob Dylan]] influence, featuring Harrison on acoustic guitar and harmonica, and is recognised as a departure from the big sound synonymous with ''All Things Must Pass''. "Apple Scruffs" was also released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to "[[What Is Life]]", gaining further popularity through airplay on US radio, and became the preferred side of the single in some countries.

==Background and composition==
The name "Apple scruffs" was first coined by [[George Harrison]] during the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although well known for his aversion to fan worship, particularly to the [[Beatlemania]] phenomenon, Harrison had formed a bond with a number of the scruffs; he acknowledged in an April 1969 interview with ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc]]'' magazine: "their part in the play is equally as important as ours".&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 272–73.&lt;/ref&gt; His song "Apple Scruffs" was written as a tribute to the fans who had kept vigil outside the various recording studios he had been working in since late May 1970, during the sessions for his ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' triple album, as well as the [[Apple Corps|Apple]] headquarters on [[Savile Row]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Leng, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spizer p 224"&gt;Spizer, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Harrison makes no mention of the song in his 1980 [[I, Me, Mine (book)|autobiography]], [[Derek Taylor]], in his role as editor, describes the Apple scruffs as the "central core" of fans, long after Beatlemania had subsided, adding that "We were all very fond of them".&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 36, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Post]]'' writer [[Al Aronowitz]] was present during much of the ''All Things Must Pass'' sessions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; He later wrote: "Outside the studio door, whether it rained or not, there was always a handful of Apple Scruffs, one of them a girl all the way from [[Texas]]. Sometimes George would record from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and there they would be, waiting through the night, beggars for a sign of recognition on his way in and out."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Schaffner, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
Harrison recorded "Apple Scruffs" late in the proceedings, during the [[overdubbing]] and mixing phase of ''All Things Must Pass''. Uniquely among the tracks on ''All Things Must Pass'', "Apple Scruffs" was performed solo by Harrison – except for a percussive, tapping sound provided by Beatles assistant [[Mal Evans]].&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 430"&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison recorded the song live on acoustic guitar and harmonica,&lt;ref name="Spizer p 224" /&gt; in the style of his friend [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, pp. 147, 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 94, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his heavy beard and moustache, Harrison struggled while attempting to play the harmonica;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez p 147"&gt;Rodriguez, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; sessions tapes also reveal he needed to coach himself on the sucking and blowing technique required for the part.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 430" /&gt;

Using take 18 of his performances that day,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 430" /&gt; the released recording was edited together from the full take, lasting around two-and-a-half minutes, with the section comprising the song's chorus and the following instrumental passage repeated,&lt;ref name="Spizer p 224" /&gt; thereby extending the track length to 3:04.&lt;ref name="Castleman &amp; Podrazik p 94" /&gt; Earlier in the year, co-producer [[Phil Spector]] had similarly extended Harrison's song "[[I Me Mine]]" when preparing the Beatles' ''[[Let It Be]]'' album for release.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison overdubbed backing vocals, credited on the album to "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers", and two [[Slide guitar|slide-guitar]] parts onto the basic track.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 431" /&gt;

Harrison invited the Apple scruffs into [[Abbey Road Studios]] to hear the results.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harry p 19"&gt;Harry, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A teenager at the time, Gill Pritchard later recalled that Harrison told them: "Well, you had your own magazine, your own office on the [studio] steps, so why not your own song?"&lt;ref name="Jones/Mojo"&gt;Cliff Jones, "We're Waiting for the Beatles", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', October 1996, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:George Harrison-What Is Life+Apple Scruffs.png|thumb|right|160px|Trade ad for the "What Is Life" single, February 1971]]
[[Apple Records]] released ''All Things Must Pass'' on 27 November 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; with "Apple Scruffs" appearing as the second track on side three, in the triple [[LP record|LP]] format.&lt;ref name="Castleman &amp; Podrazik p 94"&gt;Castleman &amp; Podrazik, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the Beatles' break-up seven months before, author [[Peter Doggett]] writes, "Apple Scruffs" and tracks such as "[[Run of the Mill (George Harrison song)|Run of the Mill]]" and "[[Wah-Wah (song)|Wah-Wah]]" presented the band's fans with "a teasing glimpse into an intimate world that had previously been off-limits to the public".&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, pp. 141, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was afforded further exposure when issued as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to "[[What Is Life]]", released internationally (though not in Britain) in February 1971 as a second single off the album.&lt;ref&gt;Castleman &amp; Podrazik, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Its inclusion on the single marked the first in a short-lived tradition of what author Simon Leng has called Harrison's "upmarket busking" acoustic B-sides, other examples being "[[Miss O'Dell]]" and "[[I Don't Care Anymore (George Harrison song)|I Don't Care Anymore]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 136, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The US picture sleeve gave both sides of the single equal billing, the song titles printed above a [[Barry Feinstein]] photo of the top of a tower at Harrison's new home, [[Friar Park]].&lt;ref name="Spizer p 231"&gt;Spizer, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular track on radio, "Apple Scruffs" received as much airplay as the A-side in America,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 431"&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; while in some European markets and Australia, its popularity led to the song being favoured as the lead side over "What Is Life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsort.info/music/azncfw.htm George Harrison (Song artist 225)], Tsort pages (retrieved 16 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, "Apple Scruffs" and "What Is Life" were listed as a double A-side when the single topped the ''[[Go-Set]]'' National Top 60 in May 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1971/19710508.html "Go-Set Australian charts – 8 May 1971"], poparchives.com.au (retrieved 25 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The two sides were also listed together on the US chart compiled by ''[[Record World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Frank Mitchell (ed.), "The Singles Chart", ''[[Record World]]'', 27 March 1971, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; where the single peaked at number 10.&lt;ref name="Spizer p 231" /&gt;

==Reception==
On release, reviewers were quick to point out the Dylan influence on "Apple Scruffs";&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr &amp; Tyler, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Smith of the ''[[NME]]'' described it as "a Dylanesque, pacy piece with harmonica and a girlie chorus".&lt;ref name="Smith/NME"&gt;Alan Smith, "George Harrison: ''All Things Must Pass'' (Apple)", ''[[NME]]'', 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=20023 Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Hunt (ed.), ''NME Originals: Beatles – The Solo Years 1970–1980'', IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Ben Gerson considered "Apple Scruffs" to be "One of the most wonderful cuts on the album" and added: "it sounds as if it was recorded while co-producer Phil Spector was out for coffee."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Gerson, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/all-things-must-pass-19710121 "George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 20 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his combined review of all the former Beatles' 1970 solo releases, [[Geoffrey Cannon]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described ''All Things Must Pass'' as "relaxed, well resolved, and, as ever with George, magnanimous" and said he especially admired the sentiments in "Apple Scruffs", despite it being "one of the slighter songs".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Cannon, "Ringo Stars: Geoffrey Cannon on the Beatles' Solo Albums", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 December 1970; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/ringo-stars-geoffrey-cannon-on-the-beatles-solo-albums Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's reviewer wrote of "What Is Life" and "Apple Scruffs" as "intriguing rhythm follows-ups" to Harrison's international hit "[[My Sweet Lord]]", and songs that were "sure to repeat that success" and "prove big juke box items".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=pt-BR&amp;id=6QgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=what+is+life#v=snippet&amp;q=%22What%20is%20life%22&amp;f=false "Spotlight Singles"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 20 February 1971, p. 62 (retrieved 13 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Beatles author [[Bruce Spizer]] has written of the song: "Sandwiched in the middle of an album full of elaborate [[Wall of Sound|wall-of-sound]] productions, ''Apple Scruffs'' breaks through like a breath of fresh air."&lt;ref name="Spizer p 224" /&gt; Simon Leng praises the track's [[slide guitar|bottleneck]] parts, and particularly the backing vocals, which he describes as "the best on the album".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The same passage, towards the end of the song, has been referred to by [[Tom Moon]] in his book ''[[1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die]]'' as "an explosive peak-experience refrain that comes direct from heaven's songbook".&lt;ref name="Moon"&gt;Moon, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 review for the 30th anniversary reissue of ''All Things Must Pass'', James Hunter of ''Rolling Stone'' highlighted "Apple Scruffs" among other tracks on an album that "helped define the decade it ushered in", advising listeners to "proceed to music that exults in breezy rhythms", which included "the colorful revolutions of 'What Is Life' … bluesy and intricate on Harrison and Dylan's 'I'd Have You Anytime,' fizzy on 'Apple Scruffs,' grooving on 'Let It Down,' and spookily proto-disco on 'Art of Dying'".&lt;ref&gt;James Hunter, "George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass'' 30th Anniversary reissue", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 29 March 2001; quoted in The Super Seventies "Classic 500", [http://www.superseventies.com/harrison1.html George Harrison – ''All Things Must Pass''] (retrieved 26 July 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
According to Simon Leng&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chip Madinger and Mark Easter:&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, pp. 430–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman''''' is a 1993 [[television film]], it is a [[remake]] of the [[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman|1958 film of the same name]]. Directed by [[Christopher Guest]] and starring [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Daniel Baldwin]], the film premiered on [[HBO]] on December 11, 1993, and was later theatrically released in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

==Plot==
The film begins by following a tour group at a memorial museum dedicated to Nancy Archer. The patrons are shown a film with Dr. Loeb, who explains that the events surrounding Nancy Archer were true. Nancy was an heiress to her mother's fortune. Her father, Hamilton Cobb, hopes to use the money to gain control over the town they live in. Nancy sees her psychiatrist, Dr. Cushing, about her low self-esteem and bad marriage to Harry. Her husband frequently spends time with a beautiful mistress, Honey Parker, the town beautician, together with whom he discusses his plans to steal the family's business away from Nancy's father. Despite her attempts to confront Harry, Nancy cannot express her anger in a healthy manner, allowing both her husband and father to take advantage of her.

While driving one night out in the desert, she sees a UFO, which shines a bright light at her. Even though she knows she will be the town's laughing stock, she also knows what she saw was real. She finally convinces Harry to accompany her on another night time drive in the desert, but the UFO is nowhere in sight. Suddenly, the ship descends from the sky. Getting out of the car for a closer look, Nancy is trapped by a bright light and disappears along with the UFO. Harry quietly returns to town and does not even report the kidnapping to the local authorities, Sheriff Denby and deputy Charlie.

A dazed Nancy is later found atop Honey's salon and is brought home. Her father is suspicious that Harry left her out in the desert while Harry denies any wrongdoing. Harry accuses Hamilton of neglecting his own wife after she was locked away at a sanitarium. As the two men argue, Nancy loses her temper, shouting that she can speak for herself and her mother. Suddenly, to everyone's surprise, she begins to grow; her clothes tear and rip as her head goes smashing through the ceiling into the attic.

The next morning Nancy is relocated to a large stable. There she is introduced to Dr Loeb. He observed a hormonal surge that occurred during Nancy's growth. Scared, Nancy asks that he find a cure, while keeping it a secret. Unable to convince her to move to a "controlled, therapeutic environment", Dr Loeb explains to Harry that Nancy's condition is unique and precarious. The strain of her heart to sustain her new size would make any stress too dangerous for her. This gives Harry an idea to get rid of her.

As she grows, Nancy becomes more self-confident and strong-willed, empowered by her new strength over everyone else. Eventually, she invites Harry to dinner and discuss her physical, mental and emotional growth. She thinks it will make their marriage stronger and she has a number of other ideas. However, Harry speculates that more stress will overload her heart and blood pressure and that she will die, leaving the family business and its money to him.

Harry, pretending to be unhinged by Nancy's suggestions (but carrying out his plan to overload her heart so that she dies), deliberately insults and angers her so much that she faints from the stress, crashing into the stable. Escaping to Honey's salon, he celebrates Nancy's apparent death by offering her Nancy's diamond necklace. Nancy wakes up and searches through the town for Harry. As she approaches a drive-through theater, a quick reference to the [[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman|original 1958 film]] can be seen on the screen.

Finding Honey and Harry, Harry hides under the desk in pure fear. He crawls away, feeling more scared then he has ever felt; Nancy is back for revenge. Trying not to scream or cry, he runs to his car. Nancy follows him and dumps him in her hand. Capturing Harry, she flees into the desert with National Guard helicopters pursuing her. Stopped by some high voltage power lines and confronted by her father and the authorities, she asserts herself and announces her father's ambitions to buy out the town using her money.

Due to a miscommunication from the sheriff ("No one does anything 'til I say "Fire"!"), a sniper on the helicopter shoots Nancy. Taking a direct hit, she falls onto the power lines, but is rescued and taken away (with Harry still in her grip) by the UFO, proving her claims were real.

The crowds disperse, with Honey making a business agreement with Hamilton. Dr Cushing explains to the press that wherever Nancy is, she now has Harry all to herself. Inside the UFO, Harry is forced to undergo therapy with two other men under a tiny dome, watched over by Nancy and two other giantesses, and the spaceship flies away into the night.

Brian Gusse of Rovi writes, "This made-for-cable remake of the cult favorite 1958 film of the same name is updated with an even more feminist slant and has a more thoughtful (and clever) script".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attack-of-the-50-Ft-Woman - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.com |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/132651/Attack-of-the-50-Ft-Woman/overview |date=25 March 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325024540/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/132651/Attack-of-the-50-Ft-Woman/overview |archivedate=25 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past century the Indonesian art of [[batik]]-making has become firmly established in [[Sri Lanka]]. The '''[https://www.lanka.com/about/interests/sri-lankan-batik/ Batik industry in Sri Lanka]''' is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and creativity. Its economic benefit is profit from dealing with foreign customers. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along [[Hikkaduwa]]'s Galle Road strip. [[Mahawewa]], on the other hand, is famous for its batik factories.

Batiks incorporate many [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s and colours, some traditional, others highly contemporary and individual. Many display a vigorousness of design related to their origin. The material created by the batik-makers is used to produce distinctive dresses, shirts, sarongs and beachwear well-suited for tropical climes. Many tourists at seaside resorts such as Hikkaduwa wear batik clothes throughout their holiday. Apart from [[Clothing|clothes]], [[tablecloth]]s, wall pictures, beach clothes, pure cotton and silk, men's and ladies' wear and bed covers are popular as a reminder of a visit to Sri Lanka.

Batiks originated many centuries ago with the villagers and tribesmen of what are now the countries of [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] and has been [[History of Sri Lanka|brought to Sri Lanka]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The promotion of the village arts is a way of keeping alive an important part of a vibrant and beautiful culture. Many of Sri Lanka's batik paintings are imported directly from [[Java]]nese village artists. They use 100-percent cotton cloth and all dyes used are colour-fast.

The batik art panels provide quilters, craft and home sewers, and interior designers with an opportunity to combine an ancient art form with a contemporary use. Since each batik piece is individually handmade, the colours and designs may vary. Originally, when batik-making was a cottage industry, one artist created the entire batik from start to finish.

'''''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects''''' (1974) is a thirteen-minute black and white [[video art]] tape by 
Canadian artist [[Lisa Steele]]. It is her best known early work and depicts Steele "present[ing] her naked body to the unblinking gaze of the camera".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 2002, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

The tape itself is characterized by common practices of early video art, unedited with a static shot.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 2002, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Steele turns the camera on, walks to the end of the room/set and removes her clothing. She approaches the camera and begins to examine the various scars she's accumulated over her life up to that point. The work represents what critic Dot Tuer indicates is "an offering to the technological gaze [which] downplays the representation of the body as a gendered subject,"&lt;ref&gt;Tuer 1993, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and as film historian Catherine Russell points out, the work is a "counter-image to the emergent critique of the female body in narrative cinema." &lt;ref&gt;Russell 2002, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Steele's description of the work: "On the occasion of my 27th birthday I decided to do a tape that chronicled my passage through time. I have always been clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts the extent of the consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Steele (Director) ''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects'' (1974) Dist. V tape&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects'' was selected by [[Toronto International Film Festival]] as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy.

Her videos are in collections worldwide, including The [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], the [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Houston, Texas), Ingrid Oppenheim, Concordia University (Montreal), Newcastle Polytechnic (England), Paulo Cardazzo (Milan), the Canadian Embassy (Tokyo) and the Akademie der Kunst (Berlin). She is a founding director of Vtape in Toronto, a national information and distribution service for independent video and a founding publisher and editor of ''FUSE Magazine''.

Steele has collaborated exclusively with her partner Kim Tomczak since the early 1980s.

== Context and description ==

Steele's earliest works are part of a key moment in video art history, not only setting the tone for her later work but in particular, pioneering a language for a medium becoming crucial in 1970s Canadian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Davies |first=John |year=2013 |title=Lisa Steele Box Set Grows Canadian Canon |url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/lisa-steele-box-set/ |magazine=Canadian Art |issue=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early video art in Canada made by women was a direct critique of mass media with an "awareness" of "media's manipulation" of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tuer |first=Dot |year=1990 |orig-year=1990 |title=Screens of Resistance: Feminism and Video Art |journal=Canadian Woman Studies |volume=11 |issue=1 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects'' is a crucial early work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Matthew Ryan |year=2014 |title=Relational Maneuvers in Autobiographical Video Art |journal=Biography |volume=37 |issue=4 |page=954}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "has entered the canon of Western art history as one of the  best examples of early feminist video art from Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Matthew Ryan |year=2014 |title=Relational Maneuvers in Autobiographical Video Art |journal=Biography |volume=37 |issue=4 |page=966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like much early video art, the work is performance-based, with a static camera and one angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=4 hours and 38 minutes: the videotapes of Lisa Steele and Kim Tomczak |last=Monk |first=Philip |publisher=Art Gallery of Ontario |year=1990 |isbn=0-919777-78-3 |pages=17 |chapter=Disclosure: Lisa Steele and Kim Tomczak: The Collaborative Tapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire twelve minutes is unedited and

&lt;blockquote&gt;the soundtrack consists entirely of the sounds and voice of the take. Notwithstanding the private and unspectacular setting, the strict form of ''Birthday Suit. With Scars and Defects'' – its seemingly rehearsed choreography, the chronological ordering of memory, and the unvarying repetition of gestures – unsettles the viewer’s spontaneous impression of an unedited sequence. Directly addressing the viewer as "you", moreover, contrasts with the otherwise private setting. Such gaze alignment, which the fixed camera position epitomizes, opens up the scene toward a literally "exhibitionist" affirmation of self.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Adorf |first=Sigrid  |year=2014 |title=Operation Video. The Use of Images as Visual Agents in Struggles Over Representation |journal=FKW Zeitschrift für Geschlechterforschung und Visuelle Kultur |edition=57 |pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Birthday Suit with scars and defects'' Steele disrobes and examines the scars on her naked body, accumulated over her lifetime, on the day of her 27th birthday in order to channel the scars' "origin stories through the touch of her fingers, all in an effort to chart the marks endured in her twenty-seven years of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Davies |first=John |year=2013 |title=Lisa Steele Box Set Grows Canadian Canon |url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/lisa-steele-box-set/ |magazine=Canadian Art |issue=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of her work in the 1970s, ''Birthday Suit'' addresses the video medium as "a gendered tool of power [as a] means of surveillance and social control, or of confession and self-examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Davies |first=John |year=2013 |title=Lisa Steele Box Set Grows Canadian Canon |url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/lisa-steele-box-set/ |magazine=Canadian Art |issue=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early video art in Canada ==

By the 1970s artists, seeking more control over their work but also the display and distribution, turned to mass media, new technology and communication technologies. Video, photography and audio became the media of choice for artists with a feminist practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Canadian Art in the Twentieth Century |last=Murray |first=Joan |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=1999  |isbn=1550023322 |publication-place=Toronto |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, women artists utilized performance and technology to both engage the viewer but also as a form of direct documentation, often utilizing the artist's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/08/sinead-king-katie-obrien |title=Meet the Muffia |last=Groskop |first=Viv |date=April 8, 2009 |work=The Guardian |access-date=March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects'' is an important early example of feminist video art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Embodied Politics in Visual Autobiography |last=Brophy |first=Sarah |last2=Hladki |first2=Janice |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2014 |isbn=1442646608 |editors=Sarah Brophy, Janice Hladki |publication-place=Toronto |pages=21 |chapter=Visual Autobiography in the Frame: Critical Embodiment and Cultural Pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele's approach to identity is both matter-of-fact but also fictionalized, employing irony and as an extension of [[conceptual art]], practices of directness and banal bluntness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Canadian Art in the Twentieth Century |last=Murray |first=Joan |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=1999  |isbn=1550023322 |publication-place=Toronto |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early video art employs approaches first found in performance and [[body art]] in the 1960s. Addressing voyeurism (both from the mass media and modernist impulses) and using [[documentary film|documentary]] tropes, in particular [[direct cinema]], the first generation of video art's concerns with sexuality and sexual politics aligned it with feminist discourse of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Resolutions: Contemporary Video Practices |last=Diamond |first=Sara |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1996 |isbn=0816623309 |editor-mask=Michael Renov, Erika Suderburg |publication-place=Minneapolis |publication-date=1996 |pages=190 |chapter=Sex Lies with Videotape: Abbreviated Histories of Canadian Video Sex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist art in the early 1970s operated in the "ideological" and "linguistic" space of the body. Steele's ''Birthday Suit'' engages with "nudity, pain and memory", reinventing the "adult female body" through memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Resolutions: Contemporary Video Practices |last=Diamond |first=Sara |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1996 |isbn=0816623309 |editor-mask=Michael Renov, Erika Suderburg |publication-place=Minneapolis |publication-date=1996 |pages=191 |chapter=Sex Lies with Videotape: Abbreviated Histories of Canadian Video Sex}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A form of "critical [[Process of embodiment (physical theatre)|embodiment]]" Steele's video [[self-portrait]] "counters [[normative]] 'pedagogical spectacles' of women's bodies" by emphasizing the "unhealthy... body in ways that forcefully enact embodied agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Embodied Politics in Visual Autobiography |last=Brophy |first=Sarah |last2=Hladki |first2=Janice |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2014 |isbn=1442646608 |editors=Sarah Brophy, Janice Hladki |publication-place=Toronto |pages=21 |chapter=Visual Autobiography in the Frame: Critical Embodiment and Cultural Pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==

For the 2017 [[Canadian sesquicentennial]], the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) selected a list of the 150 essential moving-image productions made in Canada, determined "through a national poll of over 200 members of the film, television, advertising and music industry along with journalists, critics, scholars, and filmmakers." ''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects'' was selected as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tiff.net/the-review/tiff-selects-150-essential-works-in-canadian-cinema-history/ |title=TIFF Selects 150 Essential Works In Canadian Cinema History |date=Oct 13, 2016 |orig-year=2016 |publication-place=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as a canonical work of video art and body art, ''Birthday Suit – with scars and defects'' is also an important influence on later artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://visiblecity.info.yorku.ca/lisa-steele-kim-tomczak/ |title=Lisa Steele and Kim Tomczak |last=Horwatt |first=Eli |year=2009 |publisher=York University |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aspect of online video sharing, on platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]] and [[Dailymotion]], is the aesthetic of the amateur where "non-professionals, art students, or amateurists comprise the vast majority of videos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Matthew Ryan |year=2015 |title= Performative Appropriation of Video Art on Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion |journal=Journal of Curatorial Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=183 |doi=10.1386/jcs.4.1.181_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often taking as their inspiration autobiographical video artworks of the 1970s, focusing on the physical body in front of the stationary camera, with minimal editing, the uploaders "physically or conceptually substitute the artist’s body and narrative for their own. In other words, uploaders employ the artist as a productive template for their recorded performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Matthew Ryan |year=2015 |title= Performative Appropriation of Video Art on Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion |journal=Journal of Curatorial Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=181 |doi=10.1386/jcs.4.1.181_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele is one of the most widely appropriated artists on video-sharing websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Matthew Ryan |year=2015 |title= Performative Appropriation of Video Art on Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion |journal=Journal of Curatorial Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=183 |doi=10.1386/jcs.4.1.181_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online videos employ Steele's performance of body narrative, often emphasizing the unhealthy, scarred or marked. Like Steele's direct engagement with an absent viewer, these online homages forge complex relationships with viewers, albeit anonymously and not as art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Matthew Ryan |year=2015 |title= Performative Appropriation of Video Art on Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion |journal=Journal of Curatorial Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=184 |doi=10.1386/jcs.4.1.181_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elements of '''Caribbean folklore''' (the orally transmitted beliefs, myths, tales, and practices of a group of people) are African in origin, given that [[Slavery|slaves]] brought from Africa's [[West Africa|West (or Gold) Coast]] made up a large majority of those brought to the region.

==Characters==

Very popular in terms of Caribbean [[story-telling]], and a direct transfer from West Africa to the Caribbean are the Anancy Stories (Nancy Stories) told throughout the region.  [[Anansi|Ananse]] is the [[Ashanti language|Ashanti]] word for spider, and the trickster Anancy (also known as Ananci, Ananse, Anansi, Ananci Krokoko, and Brer Nancy), with his quick-witted intelligence and his knack for surviving the odds, often through trickery, is the most popular of this genre of African-Caribbean [[Folklore|folk-tale]] characters, although there are other West African influences, in folk story characters, including the hare (chief character in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folktales) and the tortoise, which features in the stories of the [[Igbo people|Ibo]] people.

In addition to these stories, African religious figures also comprise a significant part of Caribbean folklore, many of the supernatural folklore figures possessing characteristics which are identical with those of African deities, and include:

"[[Papa Bois]]", who appears in many different forms, sometimes as a deer, or in old ragged clothes, sometimes hairy and though very old, extremely strong and muscular, with cloven hoofs and leaves growing out of his beard. As the guardian of the animals and the custodian of the trees, he is known to sound a cow's horn to warn his friends of the approach of hunters. He doesn't tolerate killing for killing's sake, and the wanton destruction of the forest.

"[[La Diablesse]]", the devil woman, is sometimes personified as an old crone, who steps forth with her cloven hoof from behind a tree on a lonely road, the sound of chains mingling with the rustle of her petticoat. Sometimes she takes the form of a beautiful woman, to lure some unsuspecting passerby to his death or perhaps to madness. Although she may appear young, she will be dressed in the ancient costume of these islands: a brilliant madras turban, chemise with half sleeves and much embroidery and lace, ''zepingue tremblant'' ("trembling pins of gold"), and all the finery of the by-gone days. Even when she appears beautiful, there is something that betrays her - she often has one hoof and a normal human foot or two hooves which she uses her long, flowing gown to hide.

"[[Mama Dlo]]" or "Mama Dglo" (known in West Africa today as [[Mami Wata|Mammy Wata]]) whose name is derived from the French "maman de l'eau" which means "mother of the water" is akin to the [[mermaid]] figure of European folklore and represents West African water spirits and there is a spirit called a cocoya who feasts on children then eats them up - they also can change into different shapes.

The "[[Soucouyant]]", whose French-derived names comes from the word "to suck", is personified by a woman, often old, who sheds her skin at night and flies through the skies, sometimes as a ball of flame, to suck blood from her victims.

The "[[Lagahoo|Ligahoo]]" or "Loup Garou" is a shape changer, a man who has power over nature and the capacity to change form to that of an animal. Or in Caribbean Myths the Loup-Garou is a man who made a deal with the devil, to have the ability to change form (to a werewolf) so that at night he could go around to kill without ever being caught.

Some contemporary Caribbean writers explore Afro-Caribbean folklore themes in their novels, including [[Nalo Hopkinson]], [[Wayne Gerard Trotman]] and [[Marie-Elena John]].

The '''Hotel Casino de la Selva ''' (Forest Casino Hotel) was a hotel and casino located in the city of [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico. 
The main building was opened in 1931 as a hotel and casino, but from 1934 it was used only as a hotel.
Additions in the late 1950s included buildings designed by the architect [[Félix Candela]] that were roofed by reinforced concrete paraboloid shells.
The interior was decorated with murals by well-known Mexican and Spanish artists.
After the 1970s the hotel went into decline, and in 1994 was sold to a hotel chain that failed to pay taxes on the property.
It was seized by the Mexican government and was auctioned off in 2001 as a site for construction of a [[discount store]] and a [[hypermarket]].
After demolition had begun there was a public outcry, and eventually some parts of the murals were preserved.

==History==
===Initial construction (1931)===

Cuernavaca in the early 1930s held the homes of several former generals who later became presidents, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]].
It was also often visited by foreigners, particularly Anglo-Saxons.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
The first constitutional governor of [[Morelos]] state, Vicente Estrada Cajigal&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Vicente Estrada Cajigal|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, authorized construction of a casino complex in Cuernavaca by the Compañía Hispanoamericana de Hoteles.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
This was  a consortium of Mexican businessmen backed by President [[Abelardo L. Rodríguez]].{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}
[[Manuel Suárez y Suárez]], an [[Asturias|Asturian]] entrepreneur, was the building contractor.
The Casino de la Selva was inaugurated in 1931 near the train station.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}

The layout was relatively simple.
There was a large fountain at the entrance, then a main driveway between two blocks of rooms, one on each side.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
The drive led to the main hall, used as the gaming room.
There was also an Olympic swimming pool, a pediment and some other facilities.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
The grounds contained bungalows set within the surrounding Amanalco Forest.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
Hundreds of the trees were at least 100 years old.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}
Two of them were estimated to be over 1,000 years old.{{sfn|Goldberg|2008|p=67}}
The {{convert|10|ha}} site held springs and a wide variety of plant species. 
There was evidence of pre-Hispanic culture that could have dated to over 1500 years ago.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=2}}
The pre-Columbian site was first excavated in the 1940s.{{sfn|Goldberg|2008|p=67}}

===Early years (1931–46)===
[[File:Manuel Suarez y Suarez sculpture.jpg|thumb|Detail of sculpture of Manuel Suárez at [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], Mexico City]]

The Casino de la Selva was briefly the most luxurious watering spot in the Americas until the Garci-Crespo Hotel opened in [[Tehuacán]] in 1934.{{sfn|Walsh|2018|p=141}}
However, the owners were unable to pay their debts to the state or to the builders.
Manuel Suárez was the main creditor and acquired the property in 1934.
That year the new president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] took office. 
One of his first decrees banned gambling in Mexico since he saw casinos as centers of vice.
Suárez retained the property but ran it purely as a hotel.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
Suárez and the Valencian architect [[Jesús Martí Martín]] founded the company Vías y Obras, which built facilities in the ports of [[Veracruz]], [[Acapulco]] and other cities. 
Suárez built the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz, and was involved in other industries, including sugar mills.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

In 1938 [[Malcolm Lowry]] moved to Cuernavaca to work on his novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'', and described the hotel in the first chapter,{{sfn|Veitch|2006|p=128}}
{{quote|The Hotel Casino de la Selva stands on a slightly higher hill just outside the town, near the railway station. It is built far back from the main highway and surrounded by gardens and terraces which command a spacious view in every direction. Palatial, a certain air of desolate splendour pervades it. For it is no longer a Casino. You may not even dice for drinks in the bar. The ghosts of ruined gamblers haunt it. No one ever seems to swim in the magnificent Olympic pool. The spring-boards stand empty and mournful. Its jai-alai courts are grass-grown and deserted. Two tennis courts only are kept up in the season.{{sfn|Lowry|2000|loc=PT23–24}} }}

===Expansion (1946–70)===
In 1946 the Casino de la Selva was closed so that Vías y Obras could undertake various enlargements under the direction of Martí.
The two blocks of rooms were each given a second floor, and a French-style garden was laid out in the area between them.
New rooms were added to the main building.
Other additions included a large convention hall, a bowling alley and cafeteria, a walkway around the Olympic pool, two more pools and sandy areas to give a beach-like atmosphere.
The effect was much like the Hotel Mocambo.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
[[Félix Candela]] came to Mexico to escape the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]] in Spain and worked for Vías y Obras from 1942 to 1947.
He helped the architect Martí in his renovation of the Casino de la Selva.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

Candela is best known for his reinforced concrete shells, which he introduced to Mexico.
These are based on [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s, in which straight beams can be used to build a [[saddle roof]], and can cover large spans with minimal thickness.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
At the end of the 1950s the construction company of the brothers Félix, Antonio and Julia Candela built a dining room attached to an auditorium, and a non-denominational chapel in place of the fountain at the entrance, all with shell roofs.
Candela's pupil, the architect Juan Antonio Tonda&lt;sup&gt;([[:se:Juan Antonio Tonda Magallón|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, designed the shells and about 30 bungalows in the south of the site and oversaw construction.
Later the chapel was converted to a nightclub, the Club Jano, and then the Discoteca Mambo.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

[[File:Felix candela en Casino.jpg|thumb|Dining room in front of the auditorium]]
The dining room, the ''Salón de los Relojes'' (Salon of the Clocks), had a roof formed of five paraboloid sections with a large clock hanging from the central point where the arcs intersected showing the times of places around the world.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
The auditorium, reached via the ''Salón de los Relojes'', had a single hyperbolic paraboloid roof and contained the mural ''La farándula'' (Showbiz) by the Mexican artist [[Francisco Icaza]], a tribute to the German playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
After 1965 Suárez started various unfinished projects such as a monorail below the pools and a forum to hold large murals by [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].
Later this project was transferred to Mexico City where it became the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], leaving the building at the Casina de la Selva unfinished.
The result of these later works was increasing diversity of architectural styles and growing maintenance costs.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
Lilia Suárez, daughter of the owner, assumed management of the Casino de la Selva in 1966.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}

===Decline and abandonment (1970–2001)===

From the 1970s until his death Suárez put most of his energy into the [[Hotel de México]] (now the [[World Trade Center Mexico City|World Trade Center]]) in the Federal District, a project that grew out of control. The Casino de la Selva was neglected and used only by foreign tourists.
Suárez died in 1987.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
After this the hotel was used as a spa, and was sometimes rented for events such as wedding celebrations and graduations.
Cuernavaca continued to expand, but most development happened outside the city center, which had expanded to include the hotel.
A bus station was built beside the hotel and in 1991 the Plaza Cuernavaca shopping center opened to its east.
In 1994 Suárez's heirs sold the property to the Grupo Situr-Sidek, a hotel company.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
The deed of sale does not seem to have included any stipulation that the murals were to be preserved.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}
In 1996 the group defaulted on $63.7 million of taxes it owed to the Mexican government, and the Ministry of Finance seized the property.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}

The Hotel Casino de la Selva was abandoned for several years and deteriorated quickly.
The heritage authorities chose not to evaluate the property.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
Ownership was transferred to the Fondo Bancario de Protección al Ahorro ([[Fobaproa]]: Bank Fund for the Protection of Savings).{{sfn|Laxer|Soron|2006|p=164}}
By 2001 the buildings had deteriorated badly, with murals crumbling from neglect, bat guano on interior walls, and litter and human excrement covering the floor of the main salon that held some of the finest murals.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
The buildings and over {{convert|4|ha}} of green land were sold in 2001 for 10 million pesos, well below market value.
The cultural wealth contained in the property was not declared.{{sfn|Laxer|Soron|2006|p=164}}

==Artwork==

[[File:Mural de Reyes Meza.jpg|thumb|Fragmento of mural by the artist [[José Reyes Meza]] ]]
Suárez wanted the hotel to be a gathering place for intellectuals and artists, and commissioned various works of art for the walls and gardens.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
He hired Mexican and Spanish artists such as [[José Reyes Meza]] and [[Josep Renau]] to decorate the walls with murals showing Mexican history from the pre-Columbian period to the modern age.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}
The murals would cover an area of {{convert|600|m2}}.{{sfn|Casino de la Selva, golpe al patrimonio artístico}}
The hotel became the center of cultural activity in Cuernavaca and was visited by artists, writers and political activists.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}

The former gaming room in the main hall came to be called the Salón de los Murales.
The Spanish Republican artist [[Josep Renau]] painted a mural there of "La Hispanidad" a history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the time of the [[Phoenicia]]ns to the conquest of America.
The other side of the room held a 1965 mural by [[José Reyes Meza]] that depicted indigenous culture in the [[Valley of Mexico]].
The hall also had a mural of ''The Apocalypse'' by Jorge Flores, a disciple of [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
Renau's ''Mural de la conformacion hispanica'', painted with his wife Manuela Ballester&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Manuela Ballester|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, depicted the conquest and colonization of America by the Spanish and covered more than {{convert|300|m2}}.{{sfn|Fernanda Mancebo|2004|p=60}}
The walls of the rooms and corridors also held the work of  [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Dr. Atl]], [[Benito Messeguer]], [[Jorge González Camarena]], [[Francisco Icaza]], [[Victor Moscoso]] and others.{{sfn|Vargas|2001}}{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}

Sculptures in the gardens included pre-Hispanic allegories by Federico Canessi&lt;sup&gt;([[:de:Federico Canessi|de]])&lt;/sup&gt; and works by Antonio Ballester.
A large equestrian statue of [[Hernán Cortés]] by the Spanish sculptor Florentino Aparicio was installed late in 1962.{{sfn|Hanke|1964|p=339}}
Suárez provided the hotel with a pottery workshop directed by Aparicio, where several noted potters learned their art.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
In 1980 the ceramicist Gustavo Pérez Mirada was able to rent the workshop for a nominal sum with the help of his friend [[Ida Rodríguez Prampolini]].{{sfn|Pérez|2005|p=75}}

==Famous visitors ==

In 1969 the mother of Lilia Rossbach was director of the hotel.
She offered the author [[Carlos Monsiváis]] an old bungalow as a quiet space where he could write a book, his ''Días de guardar'', published in 1971.{{sfn|Rossbach|2013|p=258}}
Rafael Buñuel, son of the filmmaker [[Luis Buñuel]], spent six months living at the casino in 1971–72 developing avante-garde theatrical works, which were staged over the next four years.
[[Carmen Montejo]] and [[Sergio Jiménez]] came to give classes to the performers.
The pianist Alfonso Morquecho performed at the hotel.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}

The Mexican painter and muralist Gerardo Murillo, better known as [[Dr. Atl]], was among the best known guests. 
Dr. Atl would hold marathon conversations from three to four in the afternoon in the dining room with other visitors such as [[Mario Orozco Rivera]] and [[Benito Messeguer]].{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}
A fragment of Dr. Atl's mural, ''Architectural view of the City of Puebla'', is preserved in the [[Chapultepec Castle]].{{sfn|Bravo|2006}}
[[Leonora Carrington]] lived in the casino while they built her house in Cuernavaca.
[[Jules Dassin]] visited with [[Joseph Losey]] and [[Richard Burton]], planning to film ''Under the Volcano'', but the project fell through due to funding problems.{{sfn|Güemes|2001}}

==Demolition controversy==

The property was sold at auction in 2001 to a joint venture of the American [[Costco]] discounter and the Mexican [[Comercial Mexicana]] supermarket chain.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
The partner companies quickly began to clear the site for construction of two giant stores, uprooting trees and tearing down many of the buildings.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
Costco said they would invest over $30 million in the Club de Precios (Price Club) store, which would generate 1,500 temporary and 500 permanent jobs.{{sfn|Casino de la Selva, golpe al patrimonio artístico}}
When the plans became public the [[Civic Front for the Defense of the Casino de la Selva]] was formed by local environmentalists, preservationists and small business owners, asking the city to maintain the hotel and turn the land around it into a park.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}

[[File:Fragmento mural casino.jpg |thumb|Fragment of one of the murals]]
The issue quickly gained national and international media attention.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}
The painter José Reyes Meza was refused access to inspect the state of the murals.{{sfn|Bautista|2001}}
On 14 July 2001 it was reported that the Josep Renau Foundation of Valencia, Spain, had sent a communiqué to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]] of [[UNESCO]] asking him to exert pressure on the Mexican government to hold responsible those causing this "damage to the universal cultural heritage".{{sfn|Bautista|2001}}
The Civic Front organization filed lawsuits, organized a boycott of Costco's other Mexican stores, and held public demonstrations outside the construction site entrance.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=88}}

A group of [[Morelos]] state deputies drafted a proposal to urge the Federal [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH) and [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]] (INBA) to conserve the historical and archaeological cultural heritage on the site.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}
They described the damage to the murals due to demolition of part of the shell of the Casino de la Selva building as an act of aggression against the cultural heritage of humanity.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}
They called on the City of Cuernavaca to take into consideration the opinion of the citizens, suspend the work and prepare a comprehensive plan for conservation and use of the cultural, historial and ecological resources.{{sfn|Gobierno del Estado de Morelos|2001|p=1}}

In August 2002 demonstrators held a lengthy sit-in, calling for access to the site so they could count the remaining trees.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|pp=88–89}}
On 21 August 2001 protestors blocked access to the property for eight hours before being evicted by the authorities.
31 of the demonstrators were arrested and accused of riot, sabotage, assault, blocking public roads and incitement to crime.{{sfn|Miranda|2002}}
On 23 August 2002 the state authorities transferred 31 opponents of the shopping centre project who had refused to pay bail to Atlacholoaya prison and deployed 360 troops around the entrance to the site to prevent the arrival of a group of supporters from [[San Salvador Atenco]], México.{{sfn|Miranda|2002}}
Six days later 15,000 people marched in protest through downtown Cuernavaca.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=89}}
Eventually the company agreed to save the murals and part of the surrounding forest.{{sfn|Amador Tello|2011}}
The hotel was demolished in the fall of 2002.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}
During the excavation figurines and prehispanic ceramics were found.
The INAH tried to intervene but was too late to stop the work.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}

==Aftermath==

Within a year the new Costco outlet and the new mega supermarket opened in two huge concrete blocks surrounded by a sea of asphalt.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=89}}
In 2003 the UN High Commission on Human Rights in Mexico condemned the project and criticized the local authorities for using excessive force in removing the protesters from the site.{{sfn|Goldberg|2008|p=67}}
One of the organizers of the protests, Flor Guerrero, described the failure to protect the Casino de la Selva as symbolic of Mexico's acceptance of the U.S. free-trade gospel. 
{{quote|Our struggle to defend the Casino de la Selva was basically a struggle against neo-liberalism. We see neo-liberalism here in our country as an economic, cultural, and political penetration at every level. In Latin America today, it isn't armies that are conquering us, it's megastores, transnational corporations. The Casino de la Selva is a dramatic case that should be held up as an example on a global scale. It was a devastating attack against our culture, our art and our environment.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=90}} }} 
Another local resident gave a different view, saying "They said we were all against those stores, but the stores may bring more benefits than harm. New jobs and investment were created, and there's a greater variety of products to choose from in those stores. Besides, the Casino de la Selva hotel never belonged to the people."{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=92}}

Costco opened an art museum named the Museo Muros to hold the Renau and Reyes Meza murals that had been salvaged as well as the [[Jacques Gelman|Gelman]] collection of Mexican art.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}
A reinforced concrete shell was built next to the museum in imitation of the Salón de los Relojes.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72–73}}
The shell was poorly executed and does not achieve the feeling of lightness that was characteristic of Candela's work.
The museum was boycotted by the activists of the Frente Ciudadano Pro-Casino de la Selva and received very few visitors.
In 2008 the Gelman collection was withdrawn and in November 2008 the museum became a branch of the Papalote Museo del Niño.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=73}}

{{Ancient Rome military sidebar}}

The '''Devil's Dykes''' (Hungarian: '''''Ördög árok'''''), also known as the '''''Csörsz árka''''' ("Csörsz Ditch") or the '''''Limes Sarmatiae''''' (Latin for "Sarmatian border"), are several lines of Roman fortifications built mostly during the reign of [[Constantine I]] (312–337), stretching between today's [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].

==History==

The fortifications consisted of a series of defensive earthen ramparts-and-ditches surrounding the plain of the ''Tisia'' ([[Tisza]]) river. They stretched from [[Aquincum]] (within modern [[Budapest]]) eastwards along the line of the northern [[Carpathian]] mountains to the vicinity of [[Debrecen]], and then southwards to [[Viminacium]] (near modern [[Stari Kostolac]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://terinformatika-online.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=157&amp;Itemid=84  Devil's Dykes essays with photos (in Hungarian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721113347/http://terinformatika-online.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=157&amp;Itemid=84 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were probably designed to protect the [[Iazyges]], a [[Sarmatian]] tribe that inhabited the Tisza plain and had been reduced to tributary status by Constantine, from incursions by the surrounding [[Goths]] and [[Gepids]].&lt;ref&gt;Penguin Atlas 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of the fortifications, however, date from the 2nd century AD, and probably constituted an earlier defensive line constructed under emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (ruled 161–80) at the time of the [[Marcomannic Wars]], the previous occasion that the Tisza plain was occupied by the Romans.

The "Limes Sarmatiae" was intended to expand the [[Roman Limes]], and was built at the same time as the [[Brazda lui Novac|Constantine Wall]] in [[Wallachia]] (connected to the [[Limes Moesiae]]). It was, however, destroyed after a few years, at the end of the 4th century.

Indeed, in 374 AD, the [[Quadi]], a Germanic tribe in what is now [[Moravia]] and [[Slovakia]], resenting the erection of [[Roman forts]] of the "Limes Sarmatiae" to the north and east of the Danube in what they considered to be their own territory, and further exasperated by the treacherous murder of their king, Gabinius, crossed the river and laid waste the province of [[Pannonia]].

The emperor [[Valentinian I]] in 375 Ad entered Pannonia with a powerful army and reinforced the fortifications of the "Limes Sarmatiae". But during an audience to an embassy from the Quadi (who were quickly defeated by the Roman legions) at Brigetio on the Danube (in Slovakia), Valentinian I suffered a burst blood vessel in the skull while angrily yelling at the people gathered. This injury resulted in his death on November of that year.

Soon after his death, and following a lack of ruling power inside the [[Roman Empire]], the "Limes Sarmatiae" was destroyed.

'''Donald Brook''' (born 8 January 1927) is an Australian artist, art critic and theorist whose research and publications centre on the philosophy of art, non-verbal representation and [[cultural evolution]]. He initiated the [http://aeaf.org.au Experimental Art Foundation] in [[Adelaide]] and is Emeritus Professor of Visual Arts in the [[Flinders University]], Bedford Park, South Australia.

==Early life and education==
Brook was born in [[Leeds]], [[Yorkshire]] and educated on scholarships at Woodhouse Grove School and at the [[University of Leeds]], where he read Electrical Engineering. He left before graduating with the intention of becoming an artist and was conscripted in the army toward the end of WWII. He received a Further Education and Training grant in 1949 to study sculpture at the King Edward VII School of Art in the [[University of Durham]].
 
After graduating (B.A. Fine arts) with first class honours in 1953 [[Henry Moore]] and [[William Coldstream]] were his external examiners, he spent a further year on a Chancellor’s postgraduate award researching [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Archaic]] and [[Cycladic art|Cycladic sculpture]] in Greece. Thereafter he established a practice as a sculptor, exhibiting at the Woodstock Gallery in London and executing commissions, and was awarded a studio and residence at the Digswell Arts Trust at Welwyn in Hertfordshire, His interest in unresolved theoretical questions about the visual arts led him to accept a further postgraduate scholarship in the Department of Philosophy in the [[Australian National University]] in Canberra in 1962. His PhD thesis (1965), examined by Professors [[E. H. Gombrich]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], applied analytic-philosophical theories of perception to questions of pictorial representation and art-critical appraisal.

===Professional career===

Electing to remain in Australia, Brook continued to work as a sculptor and as art critic of the [[Canberra Times]] under John Pringle’s editorship. Later (from 1968) he became art critic of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] when he was appointed as one of the three first academics in the new [[Power Institute of Fine Arts]] in the [[University of Sydney]]. During this period (1968-1973) he was an energetic initiator of the so-called ‘Tin Sheds’ workshops, where his promotion of what he then called  ‘post-object art’–more generally referred to at the time as ‘conceptual art,’ &lt;ref&gt;[1]‘Toward a definition of 'conceptual art.' Leonardo 5 (1972): 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;—was found liberating by many of the younger artists. His 1969 John Power Memorial Lecture ‘Flight from the Object’ &lt;ref&gt;[2]The 1969 John Power Lecture in Contemporary Art. Flight from the object. Sydney: Power Institute of Fine Arts, 1970. 1-22. Reprinted in Ed. Bernard Smith, Concerning Contemporary Art, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974 and as "El alejamiento del objeto estetico" in Ed. Bernard Smith, Interpretacion y analysis del ARTE ACTUAL, Trans. Jesus Ortiz, Pamplona: Eunsa, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a radical alternative to the ideas that animated [[Clement Greenberg|Clement Greenberg’s]] 1968 Power Lecture ‘Avant-garde Attitudes.’ Australian painters had generally taken their options to be restricted to the choice of international mainstream modernism or the purposeful construction of a distinctively Australian style.

In 1973 he was appointed to the inaugural chair of Fine Arts at the Flinders University, where he contentiously changed the departmental name from ‘Fine Arts’ to ‘Visual Arts.’ He initiated theoretical studies in the psychology and philosophy of visual perception and introduced a study of Aboriginal visual culture in a context where European Art History had previously dominated. At that time no practical studio courses were offered in any Australian University. From 1974 he therefore initiated the [http://aeaf.org.au Experimental Art Foundation] in the city of Adelaide. This was partly designed to enrol practising artists, along with academics and theorists, to bridge what he called ‘the gap between town and gown.’ He also introduced postgraduate academic programs for practising artists.

Brook abandoned art criticism after leaving Sydney, and published extensively thereafter in journals of informed opinion and more popular media as well as in the academic literature. He retired from Flinders at the end of 1989 and lived in Cyprus from 1990–92, returning temporarily to a part-time role at the University of Western Australia before settling again in Adelaide.

===Theoretical contributions===

Although they are wide-ranging, Brook’s philosophical interests have centred on two principal regions of speculation:  to understand the nature and place of perception and non-verbal representation in the visual arts, and to elucidate the relationship between art, the histories of works of art and the dynamics of cultural evolution. His early work on perception was first publicly aired in ‘Perception and the appraisal of sculpture’,&lt;ref&gt;[3]‘Perception and the appraisal of sculpture.’ Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 27 (1969): 323-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the important distinction he later draws between matching and simulating non-verbal representational practices is introduced as a difference between what he calls the ‘object accounts’ and the ‘picture accounts’ that we spontaneously give of visually perceived things; notably of three-dimensional works of art. Crucial to his thinking is the idea that non-verbal representation is not a quasi-linguistic form of communication. It relies on the de facto socially efficacious substitutability of one thing for another thing even in cases where relevant properties are not shared. He argues that this perceptually mediated substitutive felicity must have been available to pre-linguistic organisms or language itself could not possibly have evolved.

Brook’s elucidation of the concept of art, as what he at first called ‘experimental modelling of actual and possible worlds,’ is first comprehensively spelled out in his paper ‘A new theory of art’.&lt;ref&gt;[4]‘A new theory of art.’ British Journal of Aesthetics 20 (1980): 305-321.&lt;/ref&gt; This rather complex theoretical structure underwent continuous modification in numerous publications as his [[memetic]] account of cultural evolution developed. He embraced [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins’]] concept of the [[meme]] as the potent factor in cultural evolution, analogous to the function of the [[gene]] in biological evolution. However, he differed significantly from Dawkins and other meme-theorists in his way of understanding and exemplifying the meme. Instead of offering such examples as the popular song or catchphrase he insisted that these things are items of a cultural kind analogous to the items of biological kinds such as a horse, or a cabbage. Just as a horse is the product of appropriately activated genes, he argues that a popular song or a catchphrase is not itself a meme. It is an item of a predictable cultural kind that is generated by exercising memes. Memes are purposefully directed actions that can be exercised in concerted ways, as contrasted with mere behaviours. This is first unambiguously elucidated in his paper ‘Art history?’.&lt;ref&gt;[5]‘Art history?’ History and Theory 43 (February 2004), 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brook’s account of art as the essentially unexpected recognition of the viability of new memes is spelled out in his book The awful truth about what art is (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[6]The awful truth about what art is. Artlink, Adelaide, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is succeeded by his semi-autobiographical book Get A life (2014) &lt;ref&gt;[7]Get a life. Artlink, Adelaide, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in which an anthology of his papers on perception, representation, art, evolution and history is strung together along a string of text that is intended to place them in the context of his personal history and experience.

'''Feminist views on sexuality''' widely vary. Many feminists, particularly [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]], are highly critical of what they see as [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexual exploitation]] in the media and society. Radical feminists are often opposed to the [[sex industry]], including opposition to [[Feminist views on prostitution|prostitution]] and [[Feminist views on pornography|pornography]]. Other feminists define themselves as [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]] and believe that a wide variety of expressions of female sexuality can be [[Empowerment|empowering]] to women when they are [[Free will|freely chosen]]. Some feminists support efforts to reform the sex industry to become less [[Sexism|sexist]], such as the [[feminist pornography]] movement.

==Feminist sex wars==
{{Main|Feminist sex wars}}

The '''feminist sex wars''' and '''lesbian sex wars''', or simply the '''sex wars''' or '''porn wars''', were acrimonious debates amongst [[feminism|feminists]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The sides were characterized by anti-porn and pro-sex groups with disagreements regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], sexual representation, [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[trans woman|trans women]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The debate pitted [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and the feminist movement was deeply divided as a result.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. | title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture | year=1995 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York  | isbn=0-415-91036-6 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg |author2=Philipson, Ilene J. | title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader | year=1990 | publisher=Temple University Press | location=Philadelphia  | isbn=0-87722-630-X | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{Cite book | author=Gerhard, Jane F. | title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 | year=2001 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{Cite book | author=Leidholdt, Dorchen | authorlink= Dorchen Leidholdt |author2=Raymond, Janice G | title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism | year=1990 | publisher=Pergamon Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{Cite book | author=Vance, Carole S | title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality | publisher=Thorsons Publishers| isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist sex wars are sometimes viewed as part of the division that led to the end of the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] era and the beginning of [[third-wave feminism]].

The two sides included anti-pornography feminists and sex-positive feminists. One of the more significant clashes between the pro-sex and anti-pornography feminists occurred at the [[1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality]]. Anti-pornography feminists were excluded from the events' planning committee, so they staged rallies outside the conference to show their disdain.&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist criticism of sexual exploitation and the sex industry===
Many feminists denounce industries such as the sex industry as examples of misogynistic [[sexual exploitation|exploitation]]. Important anti-sex industry feminists included [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]]. The pair wanted civil laws restricting pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian Sex Wars|url=http://glbt.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They viewed male sexual dominance as the root of all female oppression, and thus condemned pornography, prostitution, and other manifestations of male sexual power.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt; The anti-pornography movement gained ground with the creation of [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]]. During the time of the sex wars, it organized marches against the creators and distributors of pornography in [[San Francisco]] and led to [[Women Against Pornography]], [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]], and similarly-oriented organizations and efforts across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=The Sex Wars, 1970s to 1980s|url=http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/The_Sex_Wars,_1970s_to_1980s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex-positive feminism===
{{Main|Sex-positive feminism}}
The response by "sex-positive feminists" was one that promoted sex as an avenue of pleasure for women.  [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Patrick Califia]] were influential in this part of the movement.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt; Other feminists who identify as "sex-positive" include [[Ellen Willis]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Susie Bright]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Avedon Carol]], [[Tristan Taormino]], [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]], [[Nina Hartley]], and [[Betty Dodson]].

===Feminism and pornography===
{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of [[pornography]] as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminist debate on this issue reflects larger concerns surrounding feminist views on sexuality, and is closely related to [[feminist views on prostitution|feminist debates on prostitution]], [[Feminist views on BDSM|BDSM]], and other issues. Pornography has been one of the most divisive issues in [[feminism]], particularly among feminists in Anglophone countries.

====Anti-pornography feminism====
Radical feminist opponents of pornography—such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]], [[Alice Schwarzer]], [[Gail Dines]], and [[Robert W. Jensen|Robert Jensen]]—argue that pornography is harmful to women, and constitutes strong causality or facilitation of violence against women. Anti-pornography feminists, notably MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name="stanford-shrage"&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography"].

''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-89645-9}} (1st ed), {{ISBN|0-674-89646-7}} (2nd ed). "Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catharine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| year = 1995| url = https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[Point of view pornography|gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail. (2007-03-24). "[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220# Pornography &amp; Pop Culture: Putting the Text in Context]" Presentation at: ''Pornography &amp; Pop Culture - Rethinking Theory, Reframing Activism''.

Even porn industry people commented in a recent article in Adult Video News, that gonzo porn is taking its toll on the women, and the turnover is high because they can't stand the brutal acts on the body for very long."&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-pornography feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to [[sexism]], arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} On-face ejaculation and anal rape are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn.&lt;ref name="GailDines-JulieBindel-PornIndustry"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/02/gail-dines-pornography Bindel, Julie, ''The Truth About the Porn Industry: Gail Dines, the Author of an Explosive New Book About the Sex Industry, on Why Pornography Has Never Been a Greater Threat to Our Relationships'', in ''The'' (U.K.) ''Guardian'', Jul. 2, 2010, section ''Life &amp; Style'', subsection ''Women''], as accessed Jul. 17, 2010 (Wikipedia has an article about [[Julie Bindel]]).&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as "the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words".&lt;ref name="mackinnon-fu"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press.

====Anti-censorship and pro-pornography feminists====
Pornography is seen as being a medium for women's sexual expression in this view. Sex-positive feminists view many [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] views on sexuality, including views on pornography, as being as oppressive as those of [[patriarchal]] religions and ideologies, and argue that anti-pornography feminist discourse ignores and trivializes women's sexual agency. [[Ellen Willis]] (who coined the term "pro-sex feminism") states "As we saw it, the claim that 'pornography is violence against women' was code for the neo-Victorian idea that men want sex and women endure it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| edition = 50th Anniversary special| last = Willis| first = Ellen.| title = Lust Horizons: The 'Voice' and the women's movement| work = [[Village Voice]]| accessdate = 2009-09-02| date = 2005-10-18| url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-10-18/specials/lust-horizons/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-positive feminists take a variety of views towards existing pornography. Many sex-positive feminists see pornography as subverting many traditional ideas about women that they oppose, such as ideas that women do not like sex generally, only enjoy sex in a relational context, or that women only enjoy [[vanilla sex]]. They also argue that pornography sometimes shows women in sexually dominant roles and presents women with a greater variety of body types than are typical of mainstream entertainment and fashion.

Many feminists regardless of their views on pornography are opposed on principle to censorship. Even many feminists who see pornography as a sexist institution, also see censorship (including MacKinnon's civil law approach) as an evil. In its mission statement, [[Feminists for Free Expression]] argues that censorship has never reduced violence, but historically been used to silence women and stifle efforts for social change. They point to the birth control literature of [[Margaret Sanger]], the feminist plays of [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]], and works like ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' and ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' as examples of feminist sexual speech which has been the target of censorship. FFE further argues that the attempt to fix social problems through censorship, "divert[s] attention from the substantive causes of social ills and offer a cosmetic, dangerous 'quick fix.'" They argue that instead a free and vigorous [[marketplace of ideas]] is the best assurance for achieving feminist goals in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feminists For Free Expression: Mission |accessdate=2009-09-02 |url=http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026144507/http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php |archivedate=2013-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some feminists such as [[Wendy Kaminer]], while opposed to pornography are also opposed to legal efforts to censor or ban pornography. In the late 1970s, Kaminer worked with [[Women Against Pornography]], where she advocated in favor of private [[consciousness raising]] efforts and against legal efforts to censor [[pornography]]. She contributed a chapter to the anti-pornography anthology, ''Take Back the Night'', wherein she defended [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] freedoms and explained the dangers of seeking legal solutions to the perceived problem of pornography. She opposed efforts by [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]] to define pornography as a civil rights violation, and she critiqued the pro-censorship movement in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' entitled "Feminists Against the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]."&lt;ref&gt;Kaminer, Wendy [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199211/feminism-censorship Feminists Against the First Amendment], ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Feminist pornography=====
{{Main|Feminist pornography}}
Feminist pornography is [[pornography]] that is produced by and with feminist women. It is a small but growing segment of the [[pornography industry]]. According to [[Tristan Taormino]], "Feminist porn both responds to dominant images with alternative ones and creates its own iconography."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Vogels| first = Josey.| title = Female-friendly porn| work = Metro| accessdate = 2012-07-14| date = 2009-04-21| url = http://metronews.ca/news/159072/female-friendly-porn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pornographic actresses such as [[Nina Hartley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cleis Press| isbn = 1-57344-042-6| pages = 142–144| last = Hartley| first = Nina.| title = Sex Work: Writings by Women in the Sex Industry|editor = Frédérique Delacoste &amp;  Priscilla Alexander| chapter = Confessions of a feminist porno star| year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovidie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = La Musardine| isbn = 2-84271-237-4| last = Ovidie.| title = Porno Manifesto| year = 2004}} (In French).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison Young]], and [[Sasha Grey]] are also self-described sex-positive feminists, and state that they do not see themselves as victims of sexism. They defend their decision to perform in pornography as freely chosen, and argue that much of what they do on camera is an expression of their sexuality. It has also been pointed out that in pornography, women generally earn more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]]. (2000). ''Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man''. Perennial. {{ISBN|0-380-72045-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some porn performers such as Nina Hartley are active in the [[sex workers' rights]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.woodhullfoundation.org/leadership/nina-hartley/|title=Woodhull Freedom Foundation: Leadership|last=|first=|date=|website=www.woodhullfoundation.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Worker Activists|last=|first=|publisher=General Books LLC|year=2010|isbn=1155643089|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish director and feminist Suzanne Osten voiced scepticism that "feminist pornography" actually exists, referring to her belief that pornography is inherently objectifying and that feminist pornography would therefore constitute an [[oxymoron]].&lt;ref&gt;Curman, Sofia, ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', "[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/porr-for-feminister-1.940378 Porr för feminister?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326202518/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/porr-for-feminister-1.940378 |date=2010-03-26 }}". August 28, 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The American radical feminist periodical [[off our backs]] has denounced feminist pornography as "pseudo-feminist" and "so-called 'feminist' pornography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Erotic City:Sexual Revolutions and the Making of Modern San Francisco|last= Sides|first= Josh|year= 2009|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location= Oxford, England|isbn= 978-0-19-537781-1|page= 219|pages= |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WYJezSP8fMoC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=Not+for+Sale+%22feminist+pornography%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=psOevu9pYp&amp;sig=epfdEbDmmzV2OAKo7vO_4jT1B9A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NqpsUInOFcWA0AGl9YDwBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism and prostitution===
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}}
As with many issues within the feminist movement, there exists a diversity of opinions regarding [[prostitution]]. Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive  of prostitution and [[sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16 |isbn=0-7456-1204-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of [[sex work]] can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support [[sex workers' rights|sex worker activism]] against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system. The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the [[feminist sex wars]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Priscilla |year=1997 |chapter=Feminism, Sex Workers and Human Rights |editor-last=Nagle |editor-first=Jill |title=Whores and Other Feminists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=83–90 |isbn=0-415-91821-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-prostitution feminism====
A proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution,  as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Melissa Farley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations].

These feminists argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances. These feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?" (MacKinnon, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Catharine MacKinnon argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |date=5 August 2009 |work= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230257/http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |archivedate=25 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, ''"In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible.

In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a "good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of "consent," since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative." &lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, K "The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women" New York: NYU Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pro-sex work and pro-sex worker's rights feminists====
Unlike those feminists critical of prostitution, pro-sex work perspectives do not concede that prostitution sexual acts have an inherent element of coercion, exploitation, and domination. As such, pro-sex feminists instead assert that sex-work can be a positive experience for women who have employed their autonomy to make an informed decision to engage in prostitution.

Many feminists, particularly those associated with the [[sex workers' rights]] movement or [[sex-positive feminism]], argue that the act of selling sex need not inherently be exploitative; but that attempts to abolish prostitution, and the attitudes that lead to such attempts, lead to an abusive climate for sex workers that must be changed. In this view, prostitution, along with other forms of [[sex work]], can be valid choices for the women and men who engage in it. This perspective has led to the rise since the 1970s of an international sex workers' rights movement, comprising organizations such as [[COYOTE]], the [[International Prostitutes Collective]], the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project]], and other [[:Category:Sex worker organizations|sex worker rights groups]].

An important argument advanced by pro-sex work feminists such as Carol Queen highlights that all too often feminists who are critical of prostitution have failed to adequately consider the viewpoints of women who are themselves engaged in sex work, choosing instead to base their arguments in theory and outdated experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Nagle, Jill [ed.] (2001) ''Whores and Other Feminists''. Routledge: New York pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists who do not support the radical anti-prostitution view, argue that there are serious problems with the anti-prostitution position, one of which is that, according to Sarah Bromberg, "it evolves from a political theory that is over-verbalized, generalized, and too often uses stereotypical notions of what a prostitute is. The radical [anti-prostitution] feminist views are ... not always delineated sufficiently to support a credible theory that prostitution degrades all women".&lt;ref&gt;Feminist Issues In Prostitution. Sarah Bromberg. http://www.feministissues.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-sex work feminists say that the sex industry is not a "monolith", that it is large and varied, that people are sex workers for many different reasons, and that it is unproductive to target prostitution as an institution. Instead, they believe things should be done to improve the lives of the people within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=7 Key American Sex Worker Activist Projects. | author=Audacia Ray in Feministe. | url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/07/29/7-key-american-sex-worker-activist-projects/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism and stripping===
Many feminists consider [[strip club]]s to be insulting to women's human rights and [[dignity]]. Feminists and women's rights activists in [[Iceland]] succeeded in outlawing [[Strip club ban in Iceland|strip clubs]] in March 2010.&lt;ref name="iceland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2010/03/24/Bill-in-Iceland-makes-stripping-illegal/UPI-19411269468866/ |title= Iceland's Strip Club Ban | publisher=UPI| date=2010-03-24| accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reviewiceland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&amp;ew_0_a_id=359882|title=Legislation Bans Stripping in Iceland|accessdate=2010-06-06|work=Iceland Review| date=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law officially took effect on July 31, 2010.&lt;ref name="iceland"/&gt; The Icelandic feminist [[Siv Friðleifsdóttir]] was the first presenter of the bill.&lt;ref name="iceland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reviewiceland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reviewiceland"/&gt; [[Johanna Sigurðardottir]], Iceland's prime minister, said: "The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale." &lt;ref name="Salon Iceland 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/03/26/iceland_bans_stripping_strip_clubs|title=Iceland's stripping ban: Does the country's move to shut down strip clubs really make it the most "female-friendly on the planet"?|accessdate=2010-05-07|work=Salon.com| date=2010-03-26 |last1=Clark-Flory |first1=Tracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The politician behind the bill, [[Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir]], said: "It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold."&lt;ref name="Salon Iceland 2010"/&gt; The vote of the [[Althing]] was praised by British radical feminist [[Julie Bindel]], who declared Iceland to be "the world's most feminist country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/25/iceland-most-feminist-country |title=Iceland: the world's most feminist country |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |location=London |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lusty Lady marquee.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Marquee of the now defunct Seattle Lusty Lady, [[Thanksgiving]] 2005]]

Others feminists believe that stripping can be sexually empowering and feminist. The [[Lusty Lady]] is a [[peep show]] establishment in [[North Beach, San Francisco]], that was established by a group of strippers who wanted to create a feminist, [[Worker cooperative|worker owned]] strip club.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5Tc5FSbGM8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22Exotic+Dancing+and+Unionizing%22+Brooks&amp;cd=1|title=Feminism and antiracism: international struggles for justice|editor1=France Winddance Twine|editor2=Kathleen M.

==Feminism and BDSM==
{{Main|Feminist views on BDSM}}
'''Feminist Views on BDSM''' vary widely from rejection to acceptance and all points in between.  As an example, the two polarizing frameworks are being compared here. The history between feminists and [[BDSM]] practitioners has been controversial.  The two most extreme positions are those who believe that feminism and BDSM are mutually exclusive beliefs, and those who believe that BDSM practices are an expression of sexual freedom.

===Feminist opposition to BDSM and sadomasochism===
A number of radical feminists, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Susan Griffin]], regard [[BDSM]] as a form of [[violence against women|woman-hating violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffen|first=Susan|title="Sadomasochism and the Erosion of Self:A Critical Reading of Story of O" in [[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]|year=1982|location=East Palo Alto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrew|title=Woman Hating|year=1974|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''[[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]'' includes essays and interviews from numerous feminists who criticize sadomasochism, including [[Alice Walker]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Diana E. H. Russell]], [[Susan Star]], [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[John Stoltenberg]], [[Sarah Hoagland]], [[Susan Griffin]], [[Cerridwen Fallingstar]], [[Audre Lorde]], and [[Judith Butler]]. Feminist organizations that publicly opposed S/M/ include [[Lavender Menace]], the [[New York Radical Feminists]] (NYRF), [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]]. In 1982, a leaflet was produced by the "Coalition for a Feminist Sexuality and Against Sadomasochism", an ad-hoc coalition put together by [[Women Against Pornography]] to protest the [[Feminist Sex Wars|Barnard Conference]]. The NYRF's NYRF was listed among the signatories to the leaflet.&lt;ref&gt;Abelove H, et al. (1983). "The Barnard Conference". ''Feminist Studies'' 9(1):177–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-BDSM and BDSM-practicing feminists===
While many radical feminists are opposed to BDSM, other feminists view S/M as an ideal feminist expression of [[sexual freedom]] while other feminists say that BDSM, and more particularly SM, reinforce patriarchy and that these practices are contradictory to feminism. Additionally, some feminists are open about practicing BDSM. Many sex-positive feminists see BDSM as a valid form of expression of [[human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jaclyn|title=Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World without Rape|year=2008|publisher=Seal Press|location=Seattle|isbn=1-58005-257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lesbian feminists practice BDSM and regard it as part of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sana Loue |author2=Martha Sajatovic |author3=Keith B. Armitage |title=Encyclopedia of Women's Health|year=2004|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Wakeman wrote of her own experience with SM activities in a follow-up interview after her article [http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-06-01/first-time-for-everything-spanking/ First Time For Everything: Getting Spanked] was published in 2009. At the time of the interview in October, 2010, Wakeman had been writing about feminist issues, including feminism and media criticism, feminism and politics, and feminism and sex for about eight years and considered herself to be a rather active feminist.&lt;ref name="Carpentier"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=BDSM And Feminism: "Stop Telling Me What I'm Supposed To Like, D*mn It."|url=http://jezebel.com/5666107/bdsm-and-feminism-%20stop-telling-me-what-im-supposed-to-like-dmn-it|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakeman discussed how she is able to enjoy spanking play and being dominated and still be a feminist.&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt; Like other feminist BDSM practitioners, Wakeman rejects the argument that women are taught what they enjoy and led to be submissive by a dominant sexist power structure.&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt;

There are several BDSM organizations that cater to lesbian and feminist women, including the [[Lesbian Sex Mafia]] and the group [[Samois]] that was founded by [[Patrick Califia]] and [[Gayle Rubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Gayle Rubin on the History of Samois|journal=Leather Times|year=2004|volume=|pages=3–7|doi=|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and celibacy==

The feminist group [[Cell 16]], founded in 1968 by [[Roxanne Dunbar]], was known for its program of [[celibacy]] and separation from men, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Bevacqua, Maria. ''Rape on the Public Agenda: Feminism and the Politics of Sexual Assault'' (2000) {{ISBN|1-55553-446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990, p164"&gt;Echols, Alice. ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–75'', University of Minnesota Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8166-1787-2}}, p164&lt;/ref&gt; Considered too extreme by many mainstream feminists, the organization acted as a sort of [[hard left]] [[Vanguardism|vanguard]].&lt;ref&gt;Heath and Potter. ''Feminism For Sale''. ''[[This Magazine]]'' (2005) {{cite web |url=http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2005/05/feminism.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022080224/http://thismagazine.ca/issues/2005/05/feminism.php |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been cited as the first organization to advance the concept of [[separatist feminism]].&lt;ref name="Echols, Alice 1990, p164" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saulnier, Christine F. ''Feminist Theories and Social Work: Approaches and Applications'' (1996) {{ISBN|1-56024-945-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''No More Fun and Games'', the organization's radical feminist periodical, Cell Members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to "separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation", but advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be "nothing more than a personal solution."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, Leghorn. ''The Man's Problem'', from ''No More Fun and Games'', November 1969, quoted in Echols, 165&lt;/ref&gt; The periodical also published Dana Densmore's article "On Celibacy" (October 1968), which stated in part, "One hangup to liberation is a supposed 'need' for sex. It is something that must be refuted, coped with, demythified, or the cause of female liberation is doomed. Already we see girls, thoroughly liberated in their own heads, understanding their oppression with terrible clarity trying, deliberately and a trace hysterically, to make themselves attractive to men, men for whom they have no respect, men they may even hate, because of 'a basic sexual-emotional need.' Sex is not essential to life, as eating is. Some people go through their whole lives without engaging in it at all, including fine, warm, happy people. It is a myth that this makes one bitter, shriveled up, twisted. The big stigma of life-long virginity is on women anyway, created by men because woman's purpose in life is biological and if she doesn't fulfill that she's warped and unnatural and 'must be all cobwebs inside.'" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/scriptorium/wlm/fun-games1/#celibacy|title=No More Fun and Games: a Journal of Female Liberation (v. 1, no. 1)|work=Duke Digital Collections|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Feminists]], also known as Feminists—A Political Organization to Annihilate Sex Roles, was a radical feminist group active in New York City from 1968 to 1973; it at first advocated that women practice celibacy, and later came to advocate [[political lesbianism]]. [[Political lesbianism]] embraces the theory that [[sexual orientation]] is a choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women.&lt;ref name="Location, location, orientation"&gt;Julie Bindel, [https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1177708,00.html Location, location, orientation], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  March 27, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] a pamphlet titled ''Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'', which stated, "We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women."&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3dD4VR6trTUMzYzZTExNmMtY2FlMC00MjlhLTg1ZjItYjFhNGMzMWNlMGIx/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CN6ixb8C&amp;pli=1 |title=Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism |publisher=Onlywomen Press: [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some political lesbians chose to be celibate or identified as [[asexuality|asexual]].

In April 1987 the manifesto of the Southern Women's Writing Collective, titled ''[http://sisyphe.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=4127 Sex resistance in heterosexual arrangements: Manifesto of the Southern Women's Writing Collective]'' was read in New York City at a conference called "The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism".&lt;ref name="Sisyphe http://sisyphe.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sisyphe.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=4127|title=Sisyphe|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifesto stated in part, "In contrast to the pro-sex movement, we are calling ourselves Women Against Sex (WAS)...The sex resister understands her act as a political one: her goal is not only personal integrity for herself but political freedom for all women. She resists on three fronts: she resists all male-constructed sexual needs, she resists the misnaming of her act as prudery and she especially resists the patriarchy's attempt to make its work of subordinating women easier by consensually constructing her desire in its own oppressive image." &lt;ref name="Sisyphe http://sisyphe.org"/&gt;
   
In 1991 feminist activist [[Sonia Johnson]] wrote in her book ''The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room: Sex and Intimacy Reconsidered'', "Nearly four years after I began my rebellion against relation/sex/slave Ships, experience and my Wise Old Woman are telling me that sex as we know it is a patriarchal construct and ''has'' no rightful, natural place in our lives, no authentic function or ways. Synonymous with hierarchy/control, sex is engineered as part of the siege against our wholeness and power." &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Sonia. ''The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room: Sex and Intimacy Reconsidered''. Wildfire Books, September 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and sexual orientation==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexual orientation}}
{{See also|Gender roles in non-heterosexual communities#Feminism}}
Feminist approaches to the issue of [[sexual orientation]] widely vary. Feminist views on sexual orientation are often influenced by the personal experiences of feminists, as expressed in the feminist slogan "[[Carol Hanisch|the personal is political]]." Because of this, many feminists view sexual orientation is a political issue and not merely a matter of individual sexual choice or preference.

===Feminism and asexuality===
A 1977 paper titled ''[[Asexuality|Asexual]] and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups'', by Myra T. Johnson, may be the first paper explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans. In it Johnson portrays asexual women as invisible, "oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent," and left behind by both the [[sexual revolution]] and the feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups" found in ed. Gochros, H.L.; J.S. Gochros (1977). ''The Sexually Oppressed. Associated Press.'' {{ISBN|978-0-8096-1915-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 paper written by [[Karli June Cerankowski]] and Megan Milks, titled ''New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice'', states that society has deemed "[LGBT and] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of [[pro-sex feminism]] [in which it is] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=David G.|title=Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1597-8|page=474|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[political lesbianism|political lesbians]] identify as asexual. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women.&lt;ref name="Location, location, orientation"/&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] a pamphlet titled ''Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'' which stated, "We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women."&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt;

===Feminism and bisexuality===
The lesbian quarterly ''[[Common Lives/Lesbian Lives]]'' had a policy that all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the [[University of Iowa]] [[Human Rights Commission]] by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.&lt;ref name="sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonlIves.html |title=Common Lives/Lesbian Lives Records, Iowa Women's Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City, Iowa |publisher= |accessdate=29 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821003341/http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonLives.html |archivedate=21 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since [[Coming out|come out]] as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.&lt;ref name="Gerstner 2006"&gt;{{cite book |title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|page= |pages= 82–3|accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22bisexual+feminism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n32nIC-3XC&amp;sig=h7jkH9Tq2dtkR0gs9Q7hmvNMzZ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zrdsUIKQLeWC0QHKqYHwAQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual hedonism" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-bindel/where-is-the-politics-in-_b_1589435.html |title=Where's the Politics in Sex? |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/08/lesbianism |title=It's not me.

===Feminism and gay men===
In her 2003 book ''Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective'', Australian radical lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]] advances the position that [[lesbian]] culture has been negatively affected by emulating the [[sexism|sexist]] influence of the gay male subculture of [[BDSM|dominant/submissive]] sexuality.

However, some gay men such as [[Andrea Dworkin]]'s husband [[John Stoltenberg]] are also critical of [[sadomasochism]] and [[pornography]] and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices.

===Feminism and heterosexuality===
Some heterosexual feminists believe that they have been unfairly excluded from lesbian feminist organizations. The lesbian quarterly ''[[Common Lives/Lesbian Lives]]'' had a policy that all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the [[University of Iowa]] [[Human Rights Commission]] by a heterosexual woman who believed she was discriminated against when not hired to be an intern. A complaint was also lodged with the collective by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.&lt;ref name="sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu"/&gt;

[[Image:Labrys-symbol.svg|thumb|125px|right|The [[Labrys]], a lesbian-feminist symbol.]]

Lesbians have been active in the mainstream American feminist movement. The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the [[National Organization for Women]] came in 1969, when [[Ivy Bottini]], an open lesbian who was then president of the New York chapter of the [[National Organization for Women]], held a public forum titled "Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?".&lt;ref name="bare_url_d"&gt;[[Barbara Love|Love, Barbara J.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=1968+lesbian+ivy+bottini&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4P7QT4ToGcXZ0QHIpdDqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFoQ6wEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=1968%20lesbian%20ivy%20bottini&amp;f=false Feminists Who Changed America, 1963–1975]&lt;/ref&gt; However, National Organization for Women president [[Betty Friedan]] was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969 she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a "lavender menace" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor [[Rita Mae Brown]], and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including [[Ivy Bottini]], from NOW's New York chapter.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman [https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC&amp;pg=PA134 Lesbian histories and cultures: an encyclopedia], Garland Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|0-8153-1920-7}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vicki Lynn Eaklor p. 145"&gt;Vicki Lynn Eaklor [https://books.google.com/books?id=qJZdHuZ0aM0C&amp;pg=PA145 Queer America: a GLBT history of the 20th century], ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|0-313-33749-7}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read "Lavender Menace" came to the front of the room and faced the audience.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;Flora Davis [https://books.google.com/books?id=ioM-8naFn60C&amp;pg=PA264 Moving the mountain: the women's movement in America since 1960], University of Illinois Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-252-06782-7}} p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; One of the women then read their group's paper "The Woman-Identified Woman", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheshire Calhoun p. 27"&gt;Cheshire Calhoun [https://books.google.com/books?id=7V73W75tGssC&amp;pg=PA27 Feminism, the Family, and the Politics of the Closet: Lesbian and Gay Displacement], Oxford University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-19-925766-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The group, who later named themselves "Radicalesbians", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Zerbe Enns p. 105"&gt;Carolyn Zerbe Enns [https://books.google.com/books?id=bIe7ZtOubc8C&amp;pg=PA105 Feminist theories and feminist psychotherapies: origins, themes, and diversity], Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7890-1808-X}} p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 NOW passed a resolution declaring "that a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle," as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://now.org/resource/now-leading-the-fight/ Leading the Fight | National Organization for Women].

[[Del Martin]] was the first open lesbian elected to NOW, and [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] were the first lesbian couple to join NOW.&lt;ref name="ABOUTMARTIN"&gt;{{cite news |last=Belge |first=Kathy |url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/herstory/p/DelMartin.htm |title=Del Martin |publisher=About |date= |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213073920/http://lesbianlife.about.com/cs/herstory/p/DelMartin.htm |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lesbian feminism]] is a cultural movement and political perspective, most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s (primarily in North America and Western Europe), that encourages women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and often advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]]. (1980). ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. Signs, 5, 631–660.&lt;/ref&gt; Some key thinkers and activists are [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Rita Mae Brown]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Marilyn Frye]], [[Mary Daly]], [[Sheila Jeffreys]] and [[Monique Wittig]] (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of [[queer theory]]). Lesbian feminism came together in the early 1970s out of dissatisfaction with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[gay liberation movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian: "Surpassing the Love of Men," p. 17. Quill/William Morrow, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Old_and_New_Wave-Feminism.html Lesbianism and Feminism]. Accessed May 28th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of radical lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]], "Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the WLM [Women's Liberation Movement] began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian politics, and lesbians in the GLF ([[Gay Liberation Front]]) left to join up with their sisters".&lt;ref name="Jeffreys, Sheila p. 19"&gt;Jeffreys, Sheila: "Unpacking Queer Politics," p. 19. Polity, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Judy Rebick]], a leading Canadian journalist and political activist for feminism, lesbians were and always have been at the heart of the [[women's movement]], while their issues were invisible in the same movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.activism.uts.edu.au/conferences/rebick/discussion.html Research on International Activism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323092851/http://www.international.activism.uts.edu.au/conferences/rebick/discussion.html |date=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lesbian separatism====
{{Main|Lesbian separatism}}
[[Lesbian separatism]] is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy, and as a lifelong practice but mostly the latter.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Lesbian separatism became popular in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether mainstream society or even the LGBT movement had anything to offer them.

====Political lesbianism====
{{Main|Political lesbianism}}
Political lesbianism is a phenomenon within [[lesbian feminism]] and [[radical feminism]], primarily [[second-wave feminism]]. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that [[sexual orientation]] is a choice, and advocates [[lesbian]]ism as a positive alternative to [[heterosexuality]] for women.&lt;ref name="Location, location, orientation"/&gt;

Lesbian women who have identified themselves as "political lesbians" include [[Ti-Grace Atkinson]], [[Julie Bindel]], [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Sheila Jeffreys]]. Jeffreys helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] a pamphlet titled ''Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'' which argued that women should abandon [[heterosexuality]] and choose to become lesbians as a feminist act. The pamphlet stated, "We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women."&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt; Thus, some political lesbians choose to be celibate or identify as [[asexuality|asexual]].

===Biphobia and lesbophobia in feminism===
Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.&lt;ref name="Gerstner 2006"/&gt; Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual hedonism" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"/&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the [[National Organization for Women]]. Some heterosexual feminists such as [[Betty Friedan]] downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. In 1969 Friedan referred to growing lesbian visibility as a "lavender menace" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor [[Rita Mae Brown]], and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including [[Ivy Bottini]], from NOW's New York chapter.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vicki Lynn Eaklor p. 145"/&gt; In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read "Lavender Menace" came to the front of the room and faced the audience.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; One of the women then read their group's paper "[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheshire Calhoun p. 27"/&gt; The group, who later named themselves "Radicalesbians", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Zerbe Enns p. 105"/&gt; In 1971 NOW passed a resolution declaring "that a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle," as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; That year NOW also committed to offering legal and moral support in a test case involving child custody rights of lesbian mothers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In 1973 the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism was established.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In November 1977 the [[National Women's Conference]] issued the [http://www.lindagriffith.com/IWY%20PlanofAction.html National Plan of Action], which stated in part, "Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding, and the military. State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation." &lt;ref name="Plan of Action"/&gt;

Friedan eventually admitted that "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy." &lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p221"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far: A Memoir''. N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster (Touchstone Book), &amp;copy; 2000, pbk., 1st Touchstone ed. ({{ISBN|0-7432-0024-1}}) [1st printing?] 2001. Page 221.&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. "The women's movement was not about sex, but about [[Equal Opportunity Employment|equal opportunity in jobs]] and all the rest of it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that [[Human female sexuality#Feminist concepts|freedom of sexual choice]] is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...."&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p223"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women initially and objected to what she saw as demands for equal time.&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p221" /&gt; "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'"&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p222"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Page 222.&lt;/ref&gt; While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of [[abortion]] and [[Childcare|child care]].&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p248-249"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Pp. 248&amp;ndash;249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded the lesbian rights resolution "which everyone thought I would oppose" in order to "preempt any debate" and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]) to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="LifeSoFar-pbk-1-1-p295"&gt;Friedan, Betty. ''Life So Far'', op. cit. Page 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American radical feminist group [[Redstockings]] were strongly opposed to [[lesbian separatism]], seeing interpersonal relationships with men as an important arena of feminist struggle, and hence seeing separatism as [[Escapism|escapist]]. Like many radical feminists of the time, Redstockings saw lesbianism primarily as a political identity rather than a fundamental part of personal identity, and therefore analyzed it primarily in political terms. Redstockings were also opposed to [[Gay|male homosexuality]], which they saw as a deeply [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] rejection of women. Redstockings' line on gay men and lesbians is often criticized as [[Homophobia|homophobic]].&lt;ref&gt;Echols, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism and queer theory===
{{See also|Queer theory}}
Queer theory' is a field of [[post-structuralist]] [[critical theory]] that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of [[queer studies]] and [[women's studies]]. Queer theory has been heavily influenced by the work of feminists such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and [[Judith Butler]]. Queer theory builds both upon [[feminist]] challenges to the idea that [[gender]] is part of the [[Essentialism|essential]] self and upon gay/lesbian studies' close examination of the [[Social construction|socially constructed]] nature of sexual [[Human sexual activity|acts]] and [[Sexual identity|identities]].

====Feminist application of queer theory====
Queer theory has been greatly influenced by [[feminist theory]] and women's studies. Many works have been written on the [[Intersectionality|intersection]] of feminism and queer theory and how both feminist persepectives can enrich [[LGBT]]Q theory and [[Queer studies|studies]] and how queer perspectives can enrich feminism. Books such as ''Feminism is Queer: The Intimate Connection Between Queer and Feminist Theory'' detail the intersections between queer and feminist theory and argue that feminism itself could be construed as a "[[queer]]" movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Feminism is Queer: The Intimate Connection Between Queer and Feminist Theory|last= Marinucci|first= Mimi|year= 2011|publisher= [[Zed Books]]|location= London, England|isbn= 1-84813-475-4|page= |pages= |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 28, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist criticism of queer theory====
Many feminists have critiqued queer theory as either a diversion from feminism issues or as a male-dominated backlash to feminism. Lesbian feminists and radical feminists have been the most prominent critics of queer theory and queer politics. [[Sheila Jeffreys]]' ''Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective'' harshly criticizes queer theory as the product of "a powerful gay male culture" which "celebrated masculine privilege" and "enshrined a cult of masculinity." She repudiates queer theory as anti-lesbian, anti-feminist, and anti-women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective|last= Jeffreys|first= Sheila|year= 2003|publisher= [[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location= Cambridge, England|isbn= 0-7456-2838-9|page= |pages=1–2 |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=October 3, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist sexology==
{{Main|Feminist sexology}}
Feminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of [[sex]] and [[gender]] in relation to the [[sexual lives]] of [[women]]. [[Feminist]] sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly. Notable feminist sexologists include [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] and [[Gayle Rubin]].

A notable radical feminist work on women's sexuality is Anne Koedt's [[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]], which advances the claim that [[vaginal orgasm]] is a patriarchal myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher=[[Chicago Women's Liberation Union|CWLU Herstory Archive]] |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and sexual violence==
{{See also|Rape culture}}
Rape culture is a [[culture]] in which [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] are common and in which prevalent [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[norm (sociology)|norms]], practices, and [[mass media|media]] [[normalization (sociology)|normalize]], excuse, tolerate, or even condone sexual violence. Examples of behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include [[victim blaming]], [[slut-shaming]], [[sexual objectification]], and trivializing rape.  Rape culture has been used to model behaviour within social groups, including prison systems where [[prison rape]] is common and conflict areas where [[war rape]] is used as psychological warfare. Entire countries have also been alleged to be rape cultures.&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;Sommers, Dr. Christina Hoff.

Although the concept of rape culture is a generally accepted theory in feminist academia, disagreement still exists over what defines a rape culture and to what degree a given society meets the criteria to be considered a rape culture.

Rape culture has been observed to correlate with other social factors and behaviours. Research identifies correlation between [[rape myth]]s, [[victim blaming]] and trivialisation of rape with increased incidence of racism, homophobia, ageism, classism, religious intolerance and other forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name=AOSVOD001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aosved|first=Allison C.|author2=Long, Patricia J.|title=Co-occurrence of Rape Myth Acceptance, Sexism, Racism, Homophobia, Ageism, Classism, and Religious Intolerance|journal=Sex Roles|date=28 November 2006|volume=55|issue=7–8|pages=481–492|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=E.|author2=Gadalla, T.

==Feminism and sexual harassment==
{{See also|Sexual harassment}}
Feminists have been crucial to the development of the notion of [[sexual harassment]] and the codification of laws against sexual harassment. [[Catharine MacKinnon]] was among the first to write on the topic of sexual harassment. MacKinnon's book ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination'' is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by Fred Shapiro in January 2000.

Some [[Liberal feminism|liberal feminists]] and [[Individualist feminism|individualist feminists]] have criticized the notion of sexual harassment. [[Camille Paglia]] says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with [[Playboy]], "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you—sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm Playboy interview, Camille Paglia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622065038/http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm |date=June 22, 2006 }} May 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Gallop]] believes that sexual harassment laws have been abused by what she calls "[[victim feminist]]s", as opposed to "[[power feminist]]s" as she calls herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= When Women Kill: Questions of Agency and Subjectivity|last= Morrissey|first= Belinda|year= 2003|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= 2003|isbn= 0-203-42283-X|page=135 |pages= |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fewUIbJHyy0C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Jane+Gallop+%22victim+feminism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kvzR4-xVsf&amp;sig=POczS8Svc2YEQDuEwV1gEiF5sGM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pshsUPiuKOHM0AG5roGoCw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and sexual objectification==

The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of [[women]], is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism.&lt;ref name=BarryK&gt;Barry, Kathleen, ''Female Sexual Slavery'' (NYU Press, 1994), {{ISBN|978-0-8147-1069-2}}, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts, 'The Beast within the Beauty: An Existential Perspective on the Objectification and Condemnation of Women' in Jeff Greenberg, Sander Leon Koole, Thomas A.

===The male gaze===
{{Main|Male gaze}}
The "male gaze" is feminist theory that was first developed by [[Laura Mulvey]] in 1975. The male gaze occurs when the audience, or viewer, is put into the perspective of a heterosexual male. Mulvey stressed that the dominant male gaze in mainstream [[Hollywood films]] reflects and satisfies the male unconscious: most filmmakers are male, thus the voyeuristic gaze of the camera is male; male characters in the [[Fictional film|film's narratives]] make women the objects of their gaze; and inevitably, the spectator's gaze reflects the voyeuristic male gazes of the camera and the male actors.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Brenda|title='Click Flicks' as Feminist Texts:The Appropriation of the Male Gaze in Thelma &amp; Louise|journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]]|year=2000|volume=23|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[feminism]] characterizes the "male gaze" certain themes appear such as, [[voyeurism]], [[objectification]], [[fetishism]], [[scopophilia]], and women as the object of male pleasure.&lt;ref name="Theorizing the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snow|first=Edward|title=Theorizing the Male Gaze: Some Problems|journal=Representations|year=1989|issue=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary Ann Doane|Mary Anne Doane]] gives an example of how [[voyeurism]] can be seen in the male gaze. "The early silent cinema, through its insistent inscription of scenarios of voyeurism, conceives of its spectator's viewing pleasure in terms of the peeping tom, behind the screen, reduplicating the spectator's position in relation to the woman on the screen."&lt;ref name=Doane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doane|first=Mary Ann|title=Film and the Masquerade: Theorising the Female Spectator|journal=Screen|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fihi ma fihi sample.jpg|thumb|right|A page of ''Fihi ma Fihi'' from MuntaXab-i ''Fihi ma fihi'']]
The '''''Fihi Ma Fihi''''' ({{lang-fa|فیه مافیه}}; from {{lang-ar|فیه ما فیه}}), "It Is What It Is" or "In It What Is in It") is a [[Persian language|Persian]] prose work of a famous 13th century writer, [[Rumi]]. The book has 72 short discourses.

==Description==

=== The title and origin of the book ===
According to [[Jaafar Modarres-Sadeghi|J. M. Sadeghi]] the title "Fihi ma fihi" has appeared on a copy dated 1316. Another copy of the book dated 1350 has the title '''''Asrar al-jalalieh'''''. Rumi himself in the fifth volume of [[masnavi|''Masnavi-i Ma'navi'']] mentions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="حکایت شیخ محمد سررزی غزنوی قدس الله سره" in Masnavi-i Ma'navi}}&lt;/ref&gt; that
{{cquote|&lt;center&gt; بس سوال و بس جواب و ماجرا &lt;br /&gt; بد میان زاهد و رب الوری &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; که زمین و آسمان پر نور شد &lt;br /&gt; در مقالات آن همه مذکور شد&lt;/center&gt;}}

which most likely refers to this book. The title '''''Maghalat-e Mowlana''''' of copies of the book published in Iran follows this.

Not much is known about the publication time and the writer of the book. According to [[forouzanfar|B. Forouzanfar]], the editor of the most reliable copy of the book, it is likely that the book was written by [[Sultan Walad|Sultanwalad]], the eldest son of Rumi, based on manuscripts and notes taken by himself or others from the lectures of his father on [[masnavi|''Masnavi-i Ma'navi'']].

In the ''Essence of Rumi'', John Baldock states that Fihi Mafihi was one of Rumi's discourses written towards the end of his life.  Rumi lived from 1207 to 1273 so ''Fihi Mafihi'' was likely written some time between 1260 and 1273 by Rumi himself.

==Significance==
This book is one of the first [[persian language|Persian]] prose books after the so-called [[Persian literature]] revolution (enghelāb-e adabi). Moreover, the book has become an introduction to the ''[[Masnavi]]''. Also many concepts in [[Sufism]] are described in this book in simple terms.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Maghalat-mowlana-sample.png|thumb|right|A excerpt of "Maghãlât-e Mowlânâ" on "I hate poems".]] --&gt;

== English translations ==
The book has been ([[Untranslatability#Translation procedures|freely]]) translated into English under the title '''''Discourses of Rumi''''' by [[A. J. Arberry]]  in 1961 and consists of 71 discourses. An authoritative translation by Dr. Bankey Behari was published in 1998 under the title '''''Fiha Ma Fiha, Table Talk of Maulani Rumi''''' (DK Publishers, New Delhi), {{ISBN|81-7646-029-X}}.

The '''Standard Theatre''', now known as the '''Folly Theater''' and also known as the '''Century Theater''' and '''Shubert's Missouri''', is a former [[vaudeville]] hall in downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  Built in 1900, it was designed by Kansas City architect [[Louis Curtiss|Louis S. Curtiss]]. The theater was associated with the adjoining Edward Hotel (known later as the Hotel Missouri), which was also designed by Curtiss; the hotel was demolished in 1965.

==History==
The Standard Theatre opened with 2,400 seats on September 23, 1900, featuring [[burlesque]] and vaudeville.&lt;ref name="follystan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=578&amp;DocName=Standard%20Theatre|title=Standard Theatre (September 1900-August 1901)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by Colonel Edward Butler of [[St. Louis, Missouri]], at a cost of $250,000, for his son to present shows on the Empire vaudeville circuit.&lt;ref name="folly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=516&amp;DocName=Folly%20History.|title=Folly Theater History|year=2004|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, a fire at the nearby Coates Opera House caused opera and comic opera performances to be moved to the Standard, featuring such performers as [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Richard Mansfield]], and [[Maude Adams]]. The theater's name changed to the "Century" in 1902. The Century featured acts from the Empire burlesque circuit, including  [[Al Jolson]], [[Fannie Brice]], and [[Eddie Foy, Sr.|Eddie Foy]]. In addition to theater acts, the Century featured prizefighting and wrestling, with appearances by [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[Jack Dempsey]]. Johnson stayed in the manager's apartment, as hotels refused to rent him a room.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/74001074.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Standard Theatre|last=Ryan|first=James|date=March 30, 1974|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shubert brothers]] bought the Century in 1923 and renamed it "Shubert's Missouri" after extensive renovations by Shubert architect [[Herbert J. Krapp]].&lt;ref name="follyshub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=561&amp;DocName=Shubert's%20Missouri%20Theatre|title=Shubert's Missouri Theater (September 1923-September 1932)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shuberts booked dramatic productions including [[Shakespeare]] and [[Eugene O'Neill|O'Neill]] plays. The [[Marx Brothers]] performed ''I'll Say She Is'' for three weeks in 1923-24, the long run convincing the Shuberts to continue operating the theater.&lt;ref name="follyshub"/&gt; After 1928, business began falling off and the theater was used for touring shows on an intermittent basis until it closed in 1932. After a tax sale it eventually reopened in 1941 as "The Folly", featuring [[striptease]]. Performers included [[Gypsy Rose Lee]] and [[Tempest Storm]], and before the Folly closed in January 1974, [[Chesty Morgan|Chesty Gabor]]. The theater began showing "adult" movies in 1969, apparently prompting an unknown person to plant a dynamite stick in a drainpipe on December 29, 1969.&lt;ref name="follyburl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=563&amp;DocName=Folly%20Burlesque|title=Folly Burlesque (1941-1974)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York announced that if a new buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref name="APReprieve"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated |first=Press |date=February 15, 1975 |title=Historic Showhouse Gets Reprieve |newspaper=The Evening Standard |location=Uniontown, Penn. |publisher=Uniontown Newspapers, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of local historic preservation activists, including [[Joan Dillon (historic preservation activist)|Joan Dillon]] and [[William N. Deramus III]], formed a nonprofit, the Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.&lt;ref name="APReprieve" /&gt; Following the Folly's listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; a "Strip the Folly" fundraiser was held featuring [[Sally Rand]], who had performed at the Folly. After seven years a full renovation was completed in 1981, including the construction of an annex on the site of the former Edward Hotel.&lt;ref name="follyreno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=564&amp;DocName=Restoration%20&amp;%20Renovation|title=Restoration/Renovation (1974-November 1981)|year=2004|work=Folly Theater History|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Folly's centennial year of 2000, a new lobby, restrooms, and second-floor Shareholders' Room were added.  In 2005, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Folly's reopening, the auditorium's original color scheme was restored.  Plans are now under way, and approval has been granted by the Kansas City Landmarks Commission, to install a marquee sign that closely mimics the original Folly signage.

The Performing Arts Foundation of Kansas City, d.b.a. The Folly Theater, is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit corporation whose mission is "to preserve Kansas City's oldest historic theater as a premier performance venue by presenting, producing, and hosting a wide range of quality events for the community".  The Folly produces a Jazz Series, a Kids Series, and "Cyprus Avenue Live!" performances by artists ranging from blues to rock and country.  It hosts the Harriman-Jewell Series of classical performers, the Friends of Chamber Music series, and the [[Heartland Men's Chorus]].

==Description==
The Neo-Palladian facade uses Carthage [[limestone]] and red pressed brick, with an adapted  [[Palladian window]] centered in the facade. Rather than a fully glazed infill within the limestone Palladian framework, the lower portion of the unit uses three arched windows with an entablature over the center window dividing it from the lunette under the principal arch. The street level is heavily rusticated limestone with three arched entrances and wrapping a short way around the right (east) side to form an additional arch. The east wall contains small limestone-framed ventilation openings near the top, as well as emergency exits and a {{convert|19|ft|m|adj=on}} high opening for stage scenery. The building is {{convert|125|ft|m}} deep, {{convert|70|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|65|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

The interior structure mixes steel and wood construction. There is a basement under the stage, housing mechanical systems and backstage service spaces. The main floor is entered through a lobby and a box office area. The house contains three sections of seats facing a highly decorated proscenium arch. The house is flanked by balcony-level boxes, with the main balcony to the rear. The stage is provided with a [[fly loft]], fly balconies, a scenery workshop, and ten dressing rooms. Interior decoration is predominantly red and gold.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

The exterior is largely unaltered, but the interior has been substantially renovated. In 1923, the lobby was reduced in size, moving the box office and eliminating a secondary box office for the balcony, while the balcony itself and a gallery level were replaced by a single larger balcony, reducing [[seating capacity]].  Plasterwork in the upper levels was replaced at this time, and a manager's apartment was removed.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"/&gt;

Current [[seating capacity]] is 1,078 seats.&lt;ref name="follyrent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.follytheater.org/SiteResources/Data/Templates/t4.asp?docid=518&amp;DocName=Facility%20Rental.|title=Folly Theater Rental|year=2012|publisher=Folly Theater|accessdate=2009-05-04}} {{Live link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giveh''' or '''Givah''' ({{lang-fa|گیوه}})([[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]:کڵاش)is a kind of soft, comfortable, durable and handwoven-top shoe common in several parts of [[Iran]] especially in rural and mountainous areas of [[Kermanshah Province]]. The production centers of Giveh are the two provinces of [[Yazd Province|Yazd]] and Kermanshah in Iran.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kurd Klash.jpg|thumb|300px|Hand made ''Giveh'' of Kermanshah]] --&gt;
 
Giveh is made up of two parts: sole and upper. The sole is usually rubber or leather the upper is woven thread. Before the arrival of rubber industry to the area, Giveh-makers would use a kind of wild-bull leather to make giveh and the upper was of wool or cotton thread. Most rich people would wear them. With the arrival of rubber industry, lower-class people have used rubber in the sole of their givehs.

'''Hardy Amies London Limited''' is a British-based [[Fashion design|fashion house]] specialising in modern luxury menswear. Amies was a pioneer of ready-to-wear menswear market in the 1950s, and starting in the 1960s Amies was commissioned to create high-profile specialized clothing for customers including British [[World cup soccer|World cup]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] teams, [[Stanley Kubrick]] for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].

The fashion house has changed ownership several times over the course of its history, and is currently the property of Fung Capital.

==History==
{{main|Hardy Amies}}
Sir [[Hardy Amies]], [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] (17 July 1909 – 5 March 2003), was born Edwin Amies in [[Maida Vale]], London. His father was an architect for the [[London County Council]], his mother a saleswoman for Madame Gray at Machinka &amp; May, London. In his teens, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Hardy – and always cited her as the inspiration for his chosen professional path.

Amies was educated at [[Brentwood School (Essex)|Brentwood School]], Essex, leaving in 1927. Although his father wanted him to attend [[Cambridge University]], it was his ambition to become a journalist. His father relented and arranged for a meeting between his son and [[R. D. Blumenfeld]], the editor of the [[Daily Express]]. His father was mortified when Blumenfeld suggested his son travel around Europe to gain some worldly experience. After spending three years in France and Germany; learning the languages, working for a customs agent and then as an English tutor in [[Antibes]] and later [[Bendorf]], Germany – Amies returned to England, where in 1930 he became a sales assistant in a ceramic wall-tile factory, after which he secured a trainee position as a weight machine salesman with [[W &amp; T Avery Ltd.]] in Birmingham.

It was Amies' mother’s contacts in the fashion world, and his flair for writing, that secured him his first job in fashion. It was his vivid description of a dress, written in a letter to a retired French seamstress, which brought Hardy to the attention of the owner of the Mayfair couture house [[Lachasse]] on Farm Street, [[Berkeley Square]], as the wearer of the dress was the owner's wife. He became [[managing director]] at the age of 25, in 1934. In 1937, he scored his first success with a Linton tweed suit in sage green with a cerise overcheck called ‘Panic’. ‘Panic’ was to be his debut into the fashion bible [[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]] and was photographed by [[Cecil Beaton]]. By the late 1930s, Hardy was designing the entire Lachasse collection. His second celebration creation was ‘Made in England’, a biscuit-coloured checked suit for the Hollywood ingénue [[Mildred Shay]]. He left Lachasse in 1939 and joined the [[House of Worth]] in 1941.

At the outbreak of World War II, he had been recruited into military intelligence because of his fluent German and French. He listed among his accomplishments on his application mountaineering, shooting, boxing and sketching. Amies saw service in the [[Special Operations Executive]] or SOE. Posted to SOE Headquarters in Baker Street in London, Amies was put in charge of the Belgium section and worked with the various Belgian resistance groups organising [[sabotage]] assignments. Amies rose to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. SOE's commander [[Colin Gubbins|Major General Colin Gubbins]] did not regard a dressmaker as suitable military material, but his training report stated:

"This officer is far tougher both physically and mentally than his rather precious appearance would suggest. He possesses a keen brain and an abundance of shrewd sense. His only handicap is his precious appearance and manner, and these are tending to decrease."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/am_z_ies_h.html glbtq: arts: Amies, Sir Hardy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031120317/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/am_z_ies_h.html |date=31 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===№ 14 Savile Row===
On 12 November 1945; Virginia, the Countess of Jersey (erstwhile Hollywood film star and the first Mrs. [[Cary Grant]]), who had been a former client during Hardy’s days at Laschasse, financed Hardy Amies move to [[Savile Row]]. The following January, Amies established his own couture fashion house business: '''Hardy Amies Ltd.''' Although Savile Row is the home of English [[Bespoke|bespoke tailor]]ing, the Hardy Amies brand developed to become known for its classic and beautifully tailored clothes for both men and women. Hardy’s business quickly took off in the postwar years when customers, who had been deprived of couture for the preceding years, snapped up his elegant, traditional designs. Hardy was quoted at the times as saying, “A woman's day clothes must look equally good at Salisbury Station as the Ritz bar”. Amies was vice-chairman of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers from 1954 to 56, and chairman from 1959 to 60.

Hardy Amies is located at 14 Savile Row besides [[Cad and the Dandy|Cad &amp; the Dandy]].

===Commercial success===
Amies was successful in business by being able to commercially extract value from his designs, while not replicating his brand to the point of exploitation. Amies was one of the first European designers to venture into the ready-to-wear market when he teamed up with Hepworths in 1959 to design a range of menswear. In 1961, Amies made fashion history by staging the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London. The runway show was a first on many levels as it was both the first time music was played and for the designer to accompany models on the catwalk.

Amies also undertook design for in-house work wear, which developed from designing special clothes for the England [[1966 World Cup]] team, the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 British Olympic squad]];&lt;ref name="BBCBank"/&gt; and groups such as the [[Oxford University Boat Club]] and [[London Stock Exchange]]. During the mid-1970s, he ventured into interior design, including designs for [[Crown Wallpaper]]. In 1974, Amies was entered into the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men ''Vanity Fair''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601052941/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men |date=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001: A Space Odyssey===
In 1967, Amies was commissioned by director [[Stanley Kubrick]] to design the costumes for his film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0024868|name=Hardy Amies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection allowed Amies to design totally futuristic fashions. In ''2001'', the standard attire was a business-as-usual approach to the corporate fashion. There were no neck-ties as they were in zero gravity. The Russian women scientists wore dark conservative clothing, reflecting their own conservative values. Although Kubrick's ''2001'' wardrobe was practical, it still reflected the mid-1960s slender look. The military and spacecraft uniforms were as common as they are now, with no dramatic changes. American women in ''2001'' retained roles they held in the 1960s as Hotel receptionists and air stewardesses. The women wore space-age travelling hats while carrying hand bags. According to 'Setting the Scene' by Robert S. Sennett (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, 1994), many design elements of the film seem to reflect swinging London c. 1968, rather than the imagined future. The stewardesses' uniforms, designed by Hardy Amies, look like the uncomfortable unisex pant suits that were being promoted in the late 1960s. An epic science fiction film, it demonstrated the immense range of Amies' design ability, and was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] – receiving one for visual effects. The film was an inductee of the 1991 [[National Film Registry]] list.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/&lt;/ref&gt;

Amies' work was seen in a handful of other films of the 1960s: he dressed [[Albert Finney]] in ''[[Two for the Road (1967 film)|Two for the Road]]'', [[Tony Randall]] in ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'', [[Joan Greenwood]] in ''[[The Amorous Prawn]]'' and [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The Grass is Greener]]''.

===Queen Elizabeth II===
Amies is best known to the British public for his work for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The association began in 1950, when Amies made several outfits for the then Princess Elizabeth's royal tour to Canada. Although the couture side of the Hardy Amies business was traditionally less financially successful, the award of a Royal Warrant as official dressmaker in 1955 gave his house respectability and publicity. One of his best known creations is the gown he designed in 1977 for [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee]] portrait, which he said was "immortalised on a thousand biscuit tins." An estimated 500 million people watched the day of events on television. [[Knighted]] in 1989, Amies held the Warrant until his death in 2003.  He gave up visiting The Queen himself in 1990 so that his Design Director Ken Fleetwood could create for the Queen until 1996. The House of Hardy Amies was still designing for her under Design Director Jon Moore until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Moore Design Director 1996-2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===ABC of men's fashion===
Having written a regular column for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine on men's fashion, in 1964 Amies published the book ''ABC of Men's Fashion.'' Amies's strict male dress code – with commandments on everything from socks to the summer wardrobe – made compelling reading:&lt;ref name="ABCGuard"/&gt; When in July 2009, the Hardy Amies designer archive was opened on Savile Row, the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] reissued the book.&lt;ref name="ABCGuard"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/31/hardy-amies-style-advice|title=How to dress like Hardy Amies|work=The Guardian |date=31 July 2009|accessdate=9 October 2009 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Chilvers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VicAlb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/fashion_motion/amies/index.html|title=Hardy Amies|publisher=[[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]|accessdate=9 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504111734/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/fashion_motion/amies/index.html|archivedate=4 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|A man should look as if he has bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care and then forgotten all about them.}}

==Hardy Amies' growth==
In May 1973, Hardy Amies Ltd. was sold to [[Debenhams]], which had already purchased Hepworths who distributed the Hardy Amies line. Amies purchased the business back in 1981. In May 2001, Amies sold his business to the Luxury Brands Group. He retired at the end of the year, when [[Morocco|Moroccan]]-born designer Jacques Azagury became head of couture. In November 2008, after going bankrupt,&lt;ref name="BBCBank"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7664113.stm|title=No rescue for Hardy Amies company |publisher=BBC News|date=10 October 2008|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hardy Amies brand was acquired by Fung Capital. Hardy Amies is now owned by No.14 Savile Row, which in turn is owned by Fung Capital which is the private investment holding company of the Fung family who are separately the controlling shareholders of publicly listed Li &amp; Fung Limited and Trinity Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retail-week.com/hardy-amies-uk-stores-to-close-following-sale-to-fung-capital/1920101.article|title=Hardy Amies UK stores to close following sale to Fung Capital|publisher=Retail Week|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Highgrove Florilegium''''' ({{OCLC|463290110}}) is a two-volume book of [[botanical illustration]]s recording plants in the garden of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] at [[Highgrove House]] in [[Gloucestershire]]. The volumes, published in 2008 and 2009, contain [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] painted by invited leading [[Botanical illustrator|botanical artists]] from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardenstovisit/3347785/Highgrove-The-florilegium-returns.html | title=Highgrove: The florilegium returns | accessdate=March 2, 2011 | author=Parker, Peter | date=April 25, 2008 | publisher=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour plates are reproduced in their original size from watercolour drawings. The publication is a limited edition of 175 sets, each signed by the Prince and all the [[royalties]] from the Highgrove Florilegium are donated to [[The Prince's Charities Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/gloucestershire/7357403.stm | work=BBC News | title=Prince's 'garden book' published | date=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is by Christopher Humphries and Frederick J. Rumsey and the preface is by [[Royal Highness|HRH]] The Prince of Wales. The publisher is Addison Publications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addisonpublications.com/highgrove_florilegium/index.html Addison Publications Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;. Each set is accompanied by a handmade green felt book cover with maroon ties.

==Book production==

===Design===
The book contains original sketches of [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] from the garden at Highgrove decorate the text and the end papers. The decorative motifs include plants in the garden, the Princes' tree house, the [[Dovecote|dove cote]] and the flock of Indian Runner [[Domestic duck|Ducks]].

===Printing===
The printing of both the text and the image pages used stochastic [[lithography]] in order to create outstanding quality prints from the original watercolours. Stochastic lithography is an advancement in printing technology that can give a better print quality, cleaner more dynamic and accurate colour images, and reduce running waste. Whereas conventional lithography uses half-tone dots of various sizes and spaces these dots at the same distance from each other, stochastic lithography uses microdots of a common size of various spacing according to tonal value. Stochastic screening uses smaller printing dots to create a higher image detail. Tonal ranges and colour contrasts are also improved because the variation in dot distribution increases ink densities. The images were printed on 245 [[Paper density|gsm]] American Cotton paper for the colour plates and on 175 gsm Somerset Bookwove text paper. The text is set in Fairbank and [[Bembo]] book types.

===Bookbinding===
The books are half-bound in red goatskin with marbled paper boards and sprinkled edges. The pages were collated and sewn by hand. That is, after the text and plate pages were soft folded, holes were punched into them for the sewing needle. Then the pages were sewn and the boards of the book cover were laced on. The collated and sewn books are hand finished with embossed [[Leather crafting|hand tooled leather]] motifs and [[gold leaf]] tooling on the spine.

===Marbling===
Each sheet of paper was hand [[Paper marbling|marbled]] separately using the traditional technique of sprinkling the colours onto a viscous fluid prepared from [[Chondrus crispus|Carragheen moss]] and manipulating a pattern in the paint using a [[stylus]]. The paper is carefully lowered onto the floating pattern and then lifted, rinsed and hung out to dry. Each pattern on each piece of paper must be controlled to check they are the same.

==Artists==
Each plate is  signed by the artist and blind embossed to record the copyright of A.G. Carrick Ltd, with the plate and edition numbers added in pencil.

'''Ixtlán del Rio''' is an archaeological site located in the [[Ixtlán del Rio]] municipality, on the south west region of the [[Nayarit]] State, Mexico. It is also known as "Los Toriles" and contains the only vestiges of the western cultures in Nayarit.&lt;ref name="INAH"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Arana Alvarez|first = Raúl M.|date =|title = Zona arqueologica Ixtlán del Río|url = http://www.inah.gob.mx/es/red-de-museos/266-zona-arqueologica-ixtlan-del-rio-o-los-toriles|format = Text based on work by Raúl Martín Arana Álvarez, Eduardo S. Contreras, José Corona Núñez &amp; Rodolfo Castro Hernández.|journal = INAH|language = Spanish|location = Mexico|trans-title=Ixtlán del Río Archaeological site|accessdate = March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of [[petroglyph]]s are registered in five areas, the most important are "El Terrero", "Sayulapa" and "El Veladero", which depict [[Sgraffito|sgraffiti]] lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Of the traditional Shaft Tombs, five large concentration areas are identified, containing human bone remains; domestic pottery [[ollas]], [[Comal (cookware)|comal]]es and cantaros (pitchers)]; as well as sculpture type remains (human and animal figures).&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Background==
In remote times in which early American settlers crossed the Behring Strait, several sedentary groups migrated south. The territory of present-day Nayarit State has manifestations of those settlers, chronologically and consecutively located in three cultural periods: Los Concheros, the shaft tomb tradition and the Aztatlán tradition.&lt;ref name=Encinay&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date= |title=Historia Nayarit |trans-title=Nayarit History |journal=Enciclopedia de los municipios |location=Mexico |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162123/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Concheros===
Los concheros ("concha" = shell), is a name given to groups dedicated to the sea exploitation of the ocean shores, and in the process developed the first settlements, with sea shells. According to archaeologist Gabriela Zepeda, the Matanchén and San Blas coves, it was in the Nayarit shores where history commenced in these lands. From about 2000 BCE up to 1500 CE, an amazing occupation persisted by a culture that perceived the sea as merciful and stormy God. It was also the origin of artistic ceramic modeling and cooking.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===Shaft Tomb Tradition===
[[File:Ancient Western Mexico Archaeological Sites.svg|350px|thumb|Western Mexico archaeological sites. The orange circles show archeological sites. The larger green circles highlight the most important sites. Note that the sites form what has been called the "shaft tomb arc" which extends from northwest Nayarit through the central Jalisco highlands and down to Colima.]] [[File:ShafttombMNAH.jpg|350px|thumb|Reconstruction of an excavated Shaft tomb exhibited at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia]], México.]]

On the traditional shaft tomb tradition, five major areas of concentration were identified, containing bones; ceramics for domestic use (pots, comales and pitchers); and remains of sculptural type (human and animal figures).&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

The Shaft Tomb Tradition (500 BCE - 500 CE) constitutes a peculiar feature of mesoamerican prehispanic development in México, although there are analog burials forms elsewhere in the continent. Shaft Tombs thus far discovered in the Nayarit territory, were found and excavated outside of the settlement sites of that epoch, in vertical shafts (Wells), with one or two chambers where their dead were placed together with human and animal sculptures, also with large vessels that contained funerary offerings, these reflect the development achieved by this tradition, with the particular regional characteristics found.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The '''[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]]''' or '''shaft tomb culture''' refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western [[Mexican states]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Colima]] to the south, roughly dating to the period between 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 400 [[Common Era|CE]], although there are disagreements on this end-date.  Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without [[provenance]], making dating problematic.&lt;ref&gt;The International Council of Museum estimates that 90% of the clay figurines come from illegal excavations [http://icom.museum/redlist/LatinAmerica/english/page04.htm ICOM].&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered but until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] as well as Danien, p. 23.  There is some evidence (Meighan &amp; Nicholson, p. 42) that many tombs were looted in ancient times.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, [http://www.famsi.org/research/williams/wm_classicperiod.html Classic period page] and most other sources give the 300 BCE date.  For example, Dominique Michelet in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' says "it probably started earlier" than 200 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years, for example, the shaft tomb at [[El Opeño]] in [[Michoacán]] has been dated to 1500 BCE but it is linked to central, rather than western Mexico.  Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around [[Tequila, Jalisco]], which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and [[Teuchitlan tradition|Teuchitlan]], constitute its "undisputed core".&lt;ref&gt;Beekman (2000) p. 388 &amp; 394.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although, as noted above, there is disagreement on the end date.&lt;ref&gt;The proposed end date of the shaft tomb tradition varies considerably.  Williams as well as the [[De Young Museum]] give a date of 300 CE.  The International Council of Museums, on the other hand, provides a date of 500 CE, while the Smithsonian and ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures'' give 600 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aztatlán Tradition===
The archaeological ruins of "Los Toriles" are related to the Aztatlán tradition. Its buildings contain temples with stairs and worship places made of round stones jointed with clay, stone slabs and in some cases, with motif carved stones including spirals and a snake.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

The Aztatlán tradition is chronologically located on a period from 700 BCE throughout 1520 CE, it is considered a western mesoamerican cultural event that shares cultural traits with the [[Toltec]] and received cultural influences from central highlands.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

This rich tradition is manifested in their varied and beautiful complex ceramic and polished stone, [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], and jade, such as: arrowheads; human instruments, gods and animals. Metal work impacted the agricultural activity and environmental exploitation, manufactured utilitarian artifacts as well as ornamental and sumptuary objects.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

Architecture reached its peak when ballgame courts appeared, their construction prompted the organizing of large well designed platforms, patios and squares with pyramids of certain elevations, walkways and paved roads, stairways, worship stone carvings, columns as roof support, roofs, posts, palm and grass, utilization of adobe walls and floors. The burial was common in large pots where skeletons lie in sitting or extended position, accompanied by offerings primarily made of pottery.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The " Aztatlán Tradition " flourished in the south of the State with the cultural development of Ixtlán de Río, on a period from around 750 BCE to 1110 CE, recognized as the Mid-Ixtlán period. Its early phase corresponds to the period that goes from 300 BCE to 600 CE.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

From the "Aztatlán Tradition" the Shaft Tombs are highlighted, and it is noted that the discovery of [[Smoking pipe]]s vestiges in Amapa imply that tobacco was farmed, there are also samples that demonstrate the use of metals, form manufacturing needles and fish hooks, also bricks for construction evidence was found.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

In more recent times, within the "Aztatlán tradition", the now called Sentispac town, formerly known as Tzenticpac or Centicpac, was the seat of the lordship of the same name, which extended to Omitlán, Itzcuintla, Cillan and Atecomatlán and was occupied by Totorames native groups, who dominated and receiving tributes from Coras and Zayahuecos settled in the same coastal region.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===Toponymy===
The word "'''Ixtlán'''" is of [[Nahuatl]] origin, composed by the words "Itz-ittztell" that means obsidian, and "Tlán", that means place with abundance, that is, "Place where obsidian is abundant".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Enciixt   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Ixtlán del Río, Nayarit
|trans-title=|journal=  Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|location=Mexico|url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nayarit/mpios/18006a.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia, Ixtlán, means place dedicated to Ehécatl, Wind God .&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

===History===
This important site was very possibly occupied from 300 BCE through 600 CE. During the first stage a cultural complex was developed known as the Shaft Tomb tradition in which offerings were placed inside of funeral chambers. Between 500 and 600 CE the Shaft Tomb tradition is abandoned and its development is registered within an ample cultural region known as Aztatlán, with an apogee towards 750 and 1,100 CE.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

With the "Tradición Aztatlán" develops a new way of life and it begins towards 750 – 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as mid-Ixtlán period (750 - 1110) that represents the apogee of the city, dedicated to Ehécatl (Wind God); and late Ixtlán (1110–1525CE) identified by red smooth ceramic for domestic use as well as cajetes and tripod [[molcajetes]]s decorated with white designs over red.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

The city was founded in the 12th century, by [[Nahuatlaca]] tribes en route towards the Valley of Mexico, forming the Ahuacatlán Lordship, known by its building construction and trading of obsidian goods.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

It is then that the urban settlement grows considerable with the construction of large terraces, palaces, temples and altars, acquiring a certain regional importance as manufacturing and commercial trade center. Although more than 85 mounds and structures have been located in the site, that remain still unexplored, at the moment it is only possible to visit fifteen structures, among them the building called Quetzalcoatl Temple that displays a circular shape with a parapet surrounding it and with peculiar perforations in cross shape.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The temple has two altars on top of the Mexico Central Plateau style. Other important buildings are structures called "Reliefs Palace", "Columns Palace", the "Four Column Palace" complex and the "Square Palace".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Ixtlán is the most studied archaeological zone in Nayarit. Its influence zone extended to the present day municipalities of Ixtlán del Rio, Ahuacatlán, Jala and Santa Maria del Oro. Their main towns were Cacalután, Tepuzhuacán, Mexpan, Zoatlán, Xala, Jomulco, Tequepexpan, Camotlán, Tetitlán, Acuitapilco and Zapotán.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Petroglyphs===
In Santiago Ixcuintla, [[INAH]] has registered the existence of petroglyphs from the "Los Concheros" epoch, in the Las Parejas, Emérita, Yago, El Caballo and Acatán de las Piñas sites, with a total of 13 engravings, including the "Piedra Galana".&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

The presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of [[Petroglyph]]s are registered in five areas, the most important are "El Terrero", "Sayulapa" and "El Veladero", which depict [[Sgraffito|sgraffiti]] lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.&lt;ref name=Enciixt   /&gt;

===Ceramic===
This stage of prehispanic development distinguishes and identifies western Mexico from other mesoamerican cultural expressions, during the late formative period and early classical. The Nayarit shaft tomb complexes are identified within the early Ixtlán period (300 BCE to 300 CE), and three distinctive clay modeling styles have been defined: Chimisco, Ixtlán and San Sebastian.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

The pottery of this tradition shows abundance of colors, predominating red, orange, yellow beige and the "negative" form. Common themes are human beings as warriors, musicians, women, sick people and couples.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

==The Site==
The '''Ixtlán del Río''' site is known as "Los Toriles", it was a constantly growing city and its inhabitants place huge importance to its buildings. They had urbanism knowledge, applied to an organized arrangement, with stairs, restricted accesses, open spaces, altars, sidewalks, drains, causeways, neighborhoods and palaces throughout the extensive city that flourished from 700 to 1200 CE.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

It had its heyday as a city during the "Aztatlán Tradition" period, in an area extended over eighty hectares. In the late phase, that corresponds to the period from 1110 to 1525 CE, had artistic red smooth ceramic expressions for home use, vessels and [[molcajete]]s tripods with white decor on red. This same period developed the metallurgy used to produce ornamental, ritual objects and obsidian bifacial instruments. On slopes they built extensive terraces, palaces, worship spaces, people’s homes, farmland areas and obsidian carving workshops.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

It is clear that it is still unknown what was their original culture, it is only known that they were predecessors of the [[Cora people|Coras]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]] or Wixáritari peoples, they believed in life after death.&lt;ref name=Pedro   &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   Pedro |date=Oct 24, 2006  |title= Los Toriles, Noticias de Historia Antigua y Arqueología|trans-title=Los Toriles, ancient history and archaeology news |journal= El Informador |location=  |url= http://historiayarqueologia.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/abriran-exposicion-sobre-culturas-prehispanicas-en-nayarit/ |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Accordingly, what their name was is not known, these were communities a little older than 2,200 years, and are known as belonging to the Shaft Tomb Tradition, constructed in vertical wells, round or square, representing the maternal uterus.&lt;ref name=Pedro   /&gt;

Anthropologist Marina Anguiano concludes that at the Spaniards arrival to these lands, ethnic-linguistic groups existed of the Yuto-Aztec or Yuto-Nahuatl family, which had a socio-political structure divided into lordships, ruled by groups, possibly of noble rank, and a number of local lords.&lt;ref name=Encinay   /&gt;

This archaeological site is considered related to the Aztatlán tradition, of which Corinca&lt;ref&gt;Corinca (1502-1530) was the last Lord of Aztatlán. He took office in 1513. During his Government, the tahue and achier peoples became tributaries of Aztatlán. In 1517, Aztatlán became part of the Chimalhuacana Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; was the last governor. Its constructions contain temples with stairways and altars made from round stones jointed with clay, slab stones and, in some cases, with carved stones with spirals and a serpent.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site was founded, in the 12th century, by Nahuatlacas tribes while on their way to the Valley of Mexico, and formed part of the Ahuacatlán kingdom, known by its constructions and obsidian objects which they traded.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site has an unusual pyramid for Mesoamerica; it is a round construction 24 meters diameter by four meters high. It has five stairways harmonically distributed around its perimeter. A wall that ends on top has small cruciform windows. Probably this was a ceremonial center dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]], central image of the [[Toltec]] culture. The shaft tombs are the most representative funeral constructions of the area, although there are other modalities such as "shaft tombs" or earth graves where dead people were barely buried near the surface. Ceramics are constituted by spherical glasses with vertical walls tall neck and triple bell support. The most frequent ornamental motifs are flowers and streamlined butterflies, deer and tiger heads. There are many ceramic vessels decorated with white over red color rhombuses and segments.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Due to its special characteristics, ceramics and sculptures from this region are known as "Ixtlán style".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The small 30 to 40 centimeters high sculptures distinguish themselves by ornaments consisting of earrings and nose perforations, where they placed one or more hoops.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

From the rich Ixtlán ceramics, scale models with excellent finishing are featured, from them we can intuit their forms of life, the social organization and the economic life characteristic of these towns. There are scale models that represent houses, groups in some activity and ballgame courts. These are always constructions with life and movement. Also, worth mentioning, are sculptures representing soldiers, identifiable from a spiked helmet; the chest is armor protected and in their hands a cane resembling a mallet. The lower part generally is naked.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

[[File:Ixtlán.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ixtlán del Río another view of the Round Structure]]

==Structures==
Ixtlán del Río archaeological site has a plaza, with an altar with four small stairways and to the sides buildings that appear to be small rectangular rooms.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Busca &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title=Zona Arqueologica los Toriles |url=  http://www.buscanay.com/Ixtlan%20del%20Rio/Atractivos%20Turisticos/Los%20toriles.html |publisher=Buscanay |location=Mexico |language= Spanish |trans-title=Los Toriles Archaeological Site  |year= |accessdate= September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These temples/rooms are built on platforms with adobe pilasters, as well as sidewalks and stairways.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

One of these temples has a road paved with stone slabs, which leads to the round monument, discovered in 1948 by Prof. José Corona Núñez and eloquently describes his discovery, stating: "the round monument has 30 meters in diameter by 4 meters high;" sloped walls crowned by a perforated parapet with crosses, as if skylights, four access stairs, limited by alfardas die finished, some of them still have cross shaped handrails.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

Above, within the round patio, limiting the parapets are pyramid bases, one to the north and another at the south, with stairs geared toward the center. The North has a smooth vertical panel and the south has a beveled cornice. According to the remains found, these bases maintained small altars with column portals, ceilings and stone altered battlements: one shaped as arrowheads, others composed of a disk with two circles engraved, this monument is called "Quetzalcoatl Temple" and is believed to belong to the Toltec horizon by the Toltec cultural traits observed in its architecture.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

In earlier times, between 300 BCE and 600 CE., flourished a cultural complex known as shaft tombs tradition characterized by underground architecture and offerings deposited inside the funeral chambers. Its origins are ancient and have been found in the neighboring States of Colima, Zacatecas, Jalisco and Michoacán.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

Around 500 to 600 CE.,the shaft  tomb traditoion disappears and a new way of perceiving life starts from 750 to 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as the Aztatlán tradition and is known in the mid-Ixtlán period (750 to 1110) which represents the apogee of this city dedicated to the God of the wind; and late Ixtlán (1110 to 1525) identified by red smooth ceramics household items and cajetes and tripod molcajetes with white decor on Red.&lt;ref name=Busca   /&gt;

One of the temples has a stone slab paved road, which leads to the round building of section A.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section A===
Corresponds to the initial explorations of the site, composed of four structures; two of which are restored with rectangular shape with columns to the front, that limit spaces between the rooms, these two structures are part of the plaza with pyramidal foundation with central altar and other unexplored structures (mounds to the north and east of the plaza). The highlight of this complex is the circular pyramid, discovered in 1948 by [[Jose Corona Nuñez|Prof. Jose Corona Nuñez]], it is the most important structure of the archaeological site that, from its design and finishing, constitutes one of the most beautiful works of the prehispanic architecture in western Mexico. "The monument is of round base 24 meters in diameter and 4 meters high, originally was a cylinder with vertical walls (compact drum) crowned with a perforated parapet with small cruciform windows that give the construction the aspect of a large brazier, with five stairs harmonically distributed in its contour"; in the superior part there are two rectangular altars, and it is known as a Quetzalcoatl or Ehécatl temple,&lt;ref&gt;Quetzalcoatl temples probably dedicated to Ehécatl, are mesoamerican round buildings, generally related to Ehécatl. The circle is a perfect geometric figure, has no beginning or end, therefore infinite, as the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; due to its architectonic characteristics and elements.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section B===
It is composed by two plazas bordered by structures that correspond to buildings foundations and small pyramidal shape altars. Both plazas have nine monuments each, rectangular form, explored and restored; in center is a small foundation, similar to the ceremonial altar; dimensions and height varies and is in relation to the site topography and the plaza needs. The buildings stairways face the plaza, which has three closed spaces with one in front open and roof supporting pillars. Also there are remains of dirt floors, evidence of prehispanic occupation; constructive systems base in retaining walls with relief carved stone walls, with symbols religious and animal motifs.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Section C===
It is the entrance to the archaeological zone; the south part has three explored and recovered structures that form part of a larger complex of plaza and buildings with a central altar. From the explored constructions one is outstanding, with two rectangular bodies and a single story whose stairways face towards the plaza. Also there are large columns that were used for support the roof of two large halls; the one to the east has a room and stairway integrated to the wall behind the structure.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Central Altar and Plaza C===
Is a two bodied pyramidal shape structure with stairways in all four sides; an "alfarda", ended on a dice shaped element in the top. Two bodied Pyramidal foundation. Is located in the center of Plaza C; its stairway faces west and is limited by two unexplored mounds, that are part of the plaza. The structure, just as other monuments, has stone retaining walls that were stucco covered.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Shaft Tombs==
During prehispanic times, western cultures buried to their dead in shaft tombs, these are vertical wells 1.5 to 16 meters deep, where diverse sculptures were placed as offering for the deceased; these were of various types of polychrome ceramic figures; animal forms, anthropomorphous and small and medium size scale models, which measured from five to 80 centimeters.&lt;ref name=Elda   &gt;{{cite web |first=Elda   |last= Lastra |title=Esculturas de las tumbas de tiro en Ixtlán del Río |url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226:esculturas-de-las-tumbas-de-tiro-en-ixtlan-del-rio-&amp;catid=45:especiales&amp;Itemid=118 |publisher=INAH |location=Mexico |language= Spanish|trans-title=Shaft Tombs Sculptures of Ixtlán del Río |date=November 18, 2009 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceramic figures date back to the late Preclassical period (400 BCE to 200 CE) and to the Classical period (200 to 650 CE), these were discovered by archaeologists since 1945 until recent years in areas included in the Nayarit, Colima and Jalisco States, where this funeral activity was practiced.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

In the case of the Ixtlán del Rio Archaeological Zone, the figures represent funeral processions, villages, people lying down or in beds, the flier and ballgame rituals, were modeled in reddish clay and decoration painted with black, red, orange, yellow and beige colors.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

According to art historian Lizeth Barreto Saucedo, these sculptures were modeled with reddish clay, dried and cooked in open fire.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The funeral processions scale models are square or round, the carved figures depict many people; musicians, moving towards a house, while carrying the dead person for burial; they carry food plates and practice the cheek perforation ritual practice.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The pieces representing the flier ritual, represents an individual dressed as a bird, on top of a pole on a flying simulation pose, can be leaning face down on the post or standing up looking upwards, houses are seen below and many people watching the ritual, some dance or play.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Similarly, there are ball game sculptures, similar to the Mesoamerican "I" shaped structure, the difference here is that there are houses in the ends of the representation, and some spectators.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The dancers and musicians figures not only appear in the processions scale models, there are also exclusive pieces of people groups in circular dances or playing instruments, such as drums, snails and flutes.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The largest sculptures (20 to 80 centimeters) are anthropomorphous figures decorated with facial painting and different types from clothes, some are standing up and other are seated. Women carry vessels or children, and men carry balls or instruments, some are soldiers with shields. Figures of both genders carry jewels, earflaps and cut shell collars. The facial painting is naturalist and streamlined.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Also sculptures with human figures representations are known with cheek perforations, in which three to four people are displayed (men and women) interconnected by an instrument that crosses their cheeks.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The individuals lying down or in beds are similar to those from Veracruz, emphasizing that are figures tied to a bed, which would seem to indicate that are women dead from childbirth or convalescent.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Five types of scale models have been classified, representing houses, measuring approximately 18 centimeters high by 20 wide and are distinguished by its shed roof with the corners raised in triangles form.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

The type 1 house lacks walls, only shows the roof and people inside. House type 2 has an ample room with walls. Type 3, the building half walls are leaned. Type 4, has two levels, with a room on each level and stairs. And type 5 is similar to Type 4, except that the house is full of people.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;
 
Among the scale models, there are also villages with a circular construction in the center, very similar to the pyramid of the [[Guachimontones]] Archaeological site in Jalisco, surrounded by houses as previously mentioned.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

Shaft tombs are vertical wells, whose surface can be circular or square, and have a depth of between 1.5 and 16 meters, and a width of between 0.80 and one meter; there are two types: familiar burials underneath the rooms, or cemeteries.&lt;ref name=Elda  /&gt;

'''Joint authorship''' of a copyrightable work is when two or more persons contribute enough to the work to be the [[author]] of that work.{{sfn|Sterling|2008|p=210}} In the case of joint authorship, the authors share the copyright in the work with each other.

== International conventions ==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7bis.html Article 7bis] of the [[Berne Convention]] states the term of protection for works of joint authorship and extends the general terms of protection provided under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7.html Article 7] to works of joint authorship, under the condition that the term of copyright protection must be measured from the death of the last surviving author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7bis.html |title=BERNE CONVENTION, AS REVISED - Article 7bis |website=www.law.cornell.edu|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Berne Convention doesn’t define what works of joint authorship are, because various national legislations have a lot of variations while defining the same, and have a different approach to the topic.{{sfn|Sterling|2008|p=214}}

This problem relating to joint authorship is not specifically dealt with by other international agreements as well, like the [[Universal Copyright Convention|UCC]], [[TRIPS Agreement|TRIPS]], and the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] 1996.{{sfn|Sterling|2008|p=215}}

== Law in the United States ==
A joint work is defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101 Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act] as "''a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole''".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html |title=17 U.S.C. § 101 |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201 Section 201(a)] gives the status of co-ownership in the copyrighted work to such authors of a joint work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html |title=17 U.S.C. § 201(a) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elements ===
Under the [[Copyright law of the United States|US copyright law]], a person has to prove the following two things for claiming joint authorship in a work:{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}
# First, he must show that he made a copyrightable contribution to the final work at issue. 
# Second, he must show that all of these contributors intended that their various contributions be merged into a unitary whole.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}

==== Copyrightable contribution ====
The individual contributions made by authors to a joint work need not necessarily be equal in quality or quantity.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–6}} Nevertheless, the author has to show that his contribution to the joint work is copyrightable by itself.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}{{sfn|Ashton-Tate Corporation v Ross|1991}} A contribution of mere ideas is not sufficient.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–48}} In order to be a joint author, one must contribute expression.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=507}} For the expression to be copyrightable it has to be [[Threshold of originality#United States|original]] – that is independently created and possess at least a [[Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.|minimal degree of creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/case.html |title=Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co 499 U.S. 340 (1991) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''Gaiman v. McFarlane'', where the issue of joint authorship was on the creation of new characters for an existing comic series, the court held that there will be joint-authorship even though the author's contribution was not independently copyrightable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1241893.html |title=Gaiman v McFarlane 360 F.3d 644 (2004) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning given behind this was that if more than one person laboured to create a single copyrightable work, then it would be paradoxical if no one was able to claim copyright because the individual contributions were not themselves copyrightable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While in this case, recent decisions holding that individual contribution must be independently copyrightable were not explicitly overruled, they were distinguished on facts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huang |first=Teresa |date=January 2005 |title=Gaiman v. McFariane: The Right Step in Determining Joint Authorship for Copyrighted Material |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1544&amp;context=btlj |journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also observed that the lower standard for joint authorship only applies to mixed media works.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intention to be merged into a unitary whole ====
The core of joint authorship is joint labouring by two or more persons in order to complete a pre-concerted common design. In the absence of a pre-concerted common design, the completed work will not be regarded as a joint work.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998}} However, it is not required of the several authors that they must necessarily work in physical propinquity or in concert.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/47/490/1799427/ |title=Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co., 47 F. Supp. 490 (S.D.N.Y. 1942) |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co'', the court held that while producing a musical composition jointly, two men will be coauthors and owners of the copyright even if they labour at different times, without consulting each other, and remain strangers to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is a work of joint authorship if a person creates lyrics or music with the intention that his work shall be combined with the work of another person who shall create the music or write the lyrics, as the case may be, so as to make the composition complete.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The touchstone here is the intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves may be either "inseparable" (as the case of a novel or painting) or "interdependent" (as in the case of a motion picture, opera, or the words and music of a song).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:H.R._Rep._No._94-1476_(1976)_Page_120.djvu |title=House of Representatives Report No.  94-1476 |last= |first= |date= |website= |page=120|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, joint authors must have the intention of combining their respective works at the time of creating the work, and not at some later date.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, they are not required to have an express collaboration agreement creating a joint-author relationship.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–6}}

There have also been situations wherein the parties shared a pre-concerted intent that their works be merged into one, and yet the court did not grant joint authorship.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–27}} This was since all the participants in a work did not consider themselves or others to be joint authors.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991}}{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998}}

=== Relevant cases ===

==== ''Childress v. Taylor'' ====
In ''Childress v. Taylor'', actress Clarice Taylor asked playwright Alice Childress to write a play about legendary comedienne Jackie "Moms" Mabley. While writing, Childress accepted Taylor's assistance. Taylor mainly contributed ideas regarding the portrayal of characters in the play and also provided research on the life of "Moms" Mabley.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=502}} On finalization of the draft, Childress rejected that it was owned equally by her and Taylor and registered the same in her name.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=508}} Later, Taylor took a copy of the play and produced it at another theatre without Childress' permission.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=508}} As a response to a suit for infringement by Childress, Taylor claimed that she was a joint author of the script and hence had equal rights in it. The Court while determining this issue, looked at whether the both the participants intended to combine their works into a unitary whole. Additionally, the court checked whether the parties {{'}}''intended to be joint authors''{{'}} in the work.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=507–509}} The court held that Taylor was not a joint author of the script due to lack of contribution of sufficient expression.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=509}} It observed that no evidence was shown to establish Taylor's role as anything more than giving advice and ideas.{{sfn|Childress v Taylor|1991|p=509}}

==== ''Thomson v. Larson'' ====
In another case wherein both the participants had contributed expression, the court denied joint authorship status due to lack of requisite intent.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–59}} ''Thomson v. Larson'' revolved around the claims to co-authorship of the musical ''Rent'' made by a dramaturge. In this particular case, Jonathan Larson, the author, had written the original play and was having it produced by the New York Theatre Workshop ("NYTW").{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=197}} Lynn Thomson, who was a literature professor at New York University, was hired to help shape and form the plot.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=197}} The NYTW and Thomson entered into an agreement the terms of which stated that Thomson was to be listed as 'dramaturge' for billing purposes as an independent contractor.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=198}}

However, not long after the dress rehearsal, Larson passed away and Thomson filled in her shoes and concluded the book to be used for the musical. At this stage, Thomson was yet to sign a waiver which would entail her handing over any copyright interest in the concluded work.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=198}} Notwithstanding the fact that Thomson had a significant contribution in portions that could be copyrighted to the end result, the court held that ''Rent'' was not the product of joint work and as such Thomson could not claim the status of co-author.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=200}} The argument furthered in this regard was that there was a lack of expression of an indication on behalf of Larson which would indicate that it was ever his intention for Thomson to be a joint author. Instead, his intention as expressed characterized her capacity as an editor of his original work. The court reiterated the precedent established by ''Childress'', rejecting Thompson's argument that the requirement of intention needs to be met with only in a situation where an author's contributions are minimal.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=202}}

The court held that in order to be characterized as a joint author, an individual must show two things: first, that he or she produced independent copyright material within the context of the creative process and second, that both individual authors exhibited mutual intent to create the joint work. However, the court argued that, despite Thomson's significant contribution to the development of ''Rent,'' Thomson's claim was without a clear demonstration that Larson knowingly intended to share the playwright credit with her and hence Thomson would not qualify as a joint author.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=205}}

=== Difference from collective work ===
In the case of a [[collective work]], defined in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101 Section 101], separate and independent works are assembled into a collection, and while the independent works may have a copyright protection, the nature of copyright protection of the collection is different from that of the independent works.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The collective work exists as a distinct entity, other than the individual works that form the collection.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–15}} Therefore, the key characteristics are assemblage or collection of "separate and independent works into a collective whole".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike a work of joint authorship, a collective work such as periodicals{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–36}} lacks the elements of unity and merger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Difference from derivative work ===
{{See also|Derivative work}}
The definition of "joint works" has led to some concern that when a previously written work such as a play, novel or music is incorporated in a future work such as a motion picture, the authors of such previous works could claim to be the coauthors of the motion picture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is usually true that a motion picture would be a joint work and not a collective work with respect to the authors actually working on the film, but the usual status of "employees for hire" given to them would not let the question of co-ownership come up. Although an author such as a songwriter or novelist may write a work hoping and expecting that his work will be used in a motion picture, it will still be a work of independent authorship because the author did not write the work with the intention of it being used in the motion picture.{{sfn|Nimmer|2010|p=6–13}} In such a case, the motion picture will be a derivative work, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/103 Section 103] makes it amply clear that copyright in a derivative work is independent of, and does not affect the extent of any rights in any pre-existing works incorporated in the said derivative work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Economic effect ===
In the case of joint authorship, each author is the owner of not only the part he or she created but of the whole work.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–17}} Every author can freely use the work and [[license]] it out for others to use it.{{sfn|Thomson v Larson|1998|p=199}} A co-owner of a work of joint authorship does not require other authors' permission to use the work himself, and the other authors can't object to such a use.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–18}}

If the license has been granted by one of the joint authors unilaterally, then the license fee collected, if any, must be shared appropriately with other joint authors. In the absence of an agreement determining how the license fee is to be shared, every joint author must receive an equal share irrespective of the amount of their individual contribution to the joint work. A joint author can sign a written statement in compliance with [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204 Section 204(a)] to alter his ownership shares he is initially vested with.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–18}}

A joint author may also sue any third party for copyright infringement without asking other co-owners to join the litigation.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–19}}

Moreover, a joint author does not require other joint authors' consent to transfer his exclusive proportional interest in the work.{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–21}} However, a joint author cannot transfer all interest in the work without obtaining authorization from other co-owners, since that would result in "an involuntary transfer of the other joint owners' undivided interest in the whole".{{sfn|Patry|2012|p=5–22}}

The interest of a joint author in a work of joint authorship is passed on to his heirs after his death, and not the other joint authors. Hence, in this regard, joint authorship in copyright law is similar to tenancy in common in property law and not a joint tenancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:H.R._Rep._No._94-1476_(1976)_Page_121.djvu |title=House of Representatives Report No.  94-1476 |last= |first= |date= |website= |page=121|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law in India ==
[[Copyright law of India|Indian copyright law]] defines 'work of joint authorship' in [https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1242671/ Section 2(z)] of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 as ''"a work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of one author is not distinct from the contribution of the other author or authors"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/797096/ |title=Section 2(z), Indian Copyright Act, 1957 |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term of copyright protection in case of joint authorship is calculated from the death of the last author, which is sixty years post the death of the last author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/535461/ |title=Section 22, Indian Copyright Act, 1957 |last= |first= |date= |website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relevant case ===
The leading case of joint authorship in India is ''Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors''. In this case, the plaintiff is the legal heir of the author of the book ''India Wins Freedom''. The defendant is the publisher of said book.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|pp=2–3}} The defendant entered into an agreement with one Prof. Humayun Kabir to make contents of the book known to the public.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=7}} The plaintiff obtained an injunction restraining defendants from breaking seals of covers of the complete book ''India Wins Freedom'' and from making its contents known to the public. According to the preface to the said book written by Kabir, Maulana Azad used to describe his experiences in Urdu, on the basis of which a draft in English would be prepared by Kabir.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=19}} The court held that active and close intellectual collaboration and cooperation between Maulana Azad implied that Kabir is a joint author of the book with Maulana Azad.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=28}} Hence, the defendants were allowed to break the seals of the covers of the complete book ''India Wins Freedom'' and make its contents known to the public.{{sfn|Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors|1988|p=28}}

'''Horse Cave Theatre''' (in its mid-life known as Kentucky Repertory Theatre) is a [[theater]] company located in [[Horse Cave, Kentucky]], United States. The company is located in two former commercial buildings in the city's [[downtown]] area.

KRT was formed as Horse Cave Theatre in 1976, and was a novelty for its time: a professional theater company located in a small rural town, producing a series of plays in a [[repertory]] cycle. The theater's proximity to the [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] tourist area was hoped to help attract theatergoers, and that has been proven to be the case over the years, though the theater enjoys substantial support from the town's residents as well, as well as those in neighboring [[Cave City, Kentucky|Cave City]], [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]], [[Munfordville, Kentucky|Munfordville]] and other surrounding cities.

The primary season for KRT was originally in the [[summer]], when tourism business in the area is at its peak. In recent times, the company shifted its season to a period between [[autumn]] and [[Christmas]], while continuing to present a single production in the summer to attract tourists.  Over the years, KRT productions have run the gamut of theater, from [[George Bernard Shaw]] to [[Neil Simon]], with one play by [[William Shakespeare]] being featured nearly every season. The company has also encouraged works by Kentucky playwrights, including at least one such work in its repertory nearly every season. [[Sallie Bingham]], a descendant of the Bingham family of Louisville (former owners of ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' and numerous other media properties), has had three of her plays produced by KRT.

The theater was housed in two renovated buildings, and seated 346 people in its main auditorium. An entrance building, built to resemble a tobacco barn typically found in southern Kentucky, was added at the opening. In 1998, the company purchased a residential building for office space, and a nearby warehouse for [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] and [[Theatrical properties|prop]] construction. The main theater buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Warren Hammack was KRT's first artistic director, serving the company for 25 years until his retirement.

He was succeeded by director, [[Robert Brock]].  Mr. Brock was the Artistic Director of Kentucky Repertory Theatre from 2002-2011. In that time he produced 86 plays, 11 of them were new scripts premiering at the theatre. Under his directorship the theatre's Educational Outreach Programs tripled the number of students impacted (15,000 students in 22 counties annually). He created the very popular and successful Young Performers Program in 1999 and produced and directed 14 shows involving middle and high school students from the region. The Young Performers Program produced a number of young actors that went on to receive theatre scholarships to colleges and universities nationwide. 9 Young Performers were accepted into the Governor's School for the Arts. Mr. Brock also initiated a cooperative program with T J Samson Hospital and Barren County Drug Prevention to address health issues with young people in the region. The program was called Project HEAT (Health Education Awareness Theatre) and produced three plays that toured to schools. These plays offered an entertaining and imaginative approach to looking at Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco Abuse, Bullying and Hygiene. In 2008 Mr. Brock accepted the Governor's Arts Award on behalf of KRT. While Mr. Brock was Artistic Director, KRT received many accolades, among them being named ‘one of the Top Ten small regional theatres in the nation’ by USA Today. The Theatre's Educational Outreach Program was written up in the [[The Cincinnati Enquirer|Cincinnati Enquirer]], [[The Indianapolis Star]], [[The Evansville Courier]], and [[The Dallas Morning News]]. While Mr. Brock was Director, KRT was commissioned by the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]] and the Kentucky Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to produce two plays about Lincoln ( Abraham Lincoln and One Man's Lincoln) during the bicentennial years 2008-2009. Mr Brock performed with [[Annie Potts]] in 2 productions of [[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]] in 2002 and 2003 that played in Horse Cave, Elizabethtown and Bowling Green, and directed [[Sally Struthers]] in another production of Love Letters in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glasgowdailytimes.com/news/lifestyles/love-letters/article_f94f82b0-2fa1-592b-8a4d-f0fc54a2e7a8.html|title=‘Love Letters’|last=Times|first=SUSAN TEBBENGlasgow Daily|work=Glasgow Daily Times|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com/content/struthers-gallagher-star-elizabethtown-presentation-love-letters|title=Struthers, Gallagher to star in Elizabethtown presentation of 'Love Letters' {{!}} TheNewsEnterprise.com|website=subscriber.thenewsenterprise.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Christopher Carter Sanderson for one season. For the 2013 season, RepALLIANCE under the direction of Ken Neil Hailey took over the producing duties. In May 2013, the theatre was closed due to debt that had built up over a number of the later seasons. The theatre and its board suspended operations while the core directors and actors who produced the successful final season moved on and formed a new company, Kentucky Stage(s), in residence at Bowling Green's new SKyPAC (Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center during the 2013-14 season. Kentucky Stage(s) observed the process after closure and has retained a contract to reacquire and restore the theatre, re-re-branding the facility again as THE HORSE CAVE THEATRE. Plans to reopen the theatre by the summer of 2015 were unsuccessful.

==Plot==
Fighting a legal battle for over 10 years in the hope of getting back his land from the forest department, the film narrates the story of Raghu Karhe who, along with his wife, two sons - Panda and Balu, his daughter-in-law and grandson, all wander while shepherding sheep from one village to another.

Balu, a budding wrestler and a daydreamer, foreseeing prosperity and good future in agriculture hopes to find his family a permanent settlement instead of day-to-day wandering.

Fate brings them to a village headed by the rowdy, Ashokrao, who along with his fellow wrestlers terrorizes all the adjoining villages and very often creates trouble by picking up the sheep of poor shepherds. Balu and his family bear everything silently.

In one of the wrestling competitions, Balu defeats Ashokrao's academy's wrestlers, which leads to animosity between him and Balu. Ashokrao compels Balu to a wrestle with his ace wrestler. Feeling the pain of Ashokrao's separatist remarks, Balu applies his full strength and breaks the wrestler's spine and runs away. This further hurts Ashokrao's ego who vows to finish him. Balu's angst for finding resolution culminates in a heart-wrenching climax of the film.

Through its protagonist, the film talks about the entire shepherd community and how their lives are unstable, full of challenges and how at times, they have to pay a heavy price for survival with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twocircles.net/2015oct27/1445932786.html#.VjBdBNIrIVg|title=Marathi movie Khwada projects the rebel against upper-caste hegemony|work=twocircles.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15874">The following is a non-exhaustive list of [[K-pop]] videos that have been banned by South Korean television networks, for reasons such as suggestive or offensive lyrics and imagery.

K-pop is a genre of modern [[pop music]] that originates from [[South Korea]]. It is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements, and K-pop singles will typically include a music video and a dance routine. There is a history of media [[censorship in South Korea|censorship]] and [[conservatism in South Korea]], and as a result, many risque or explicit K-pop songs or videos have been banned by South Korean broadcasting stations. Other reasons for banning include having Japanese lyrics, negatively influencing youth, or use of brand names.

[[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] are the three largest broadcasting and television networks, and they account for the vast majority of banned K-pop videos. In September 2012, it was revealed that these networks had banned over 1,300 K-pop songs in the past three years alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/89575/20140430/what-it-takes-to-get-a-song-banned-from-broadcast-stations-in-korea.htm|title=What It Takes To Get A Song Banned From Broadcast Stations In Korea|last=KpopStarz|date=2014-04-30|work=KpopStarz|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This list only includes titular k-pop songs that have an accompanying music video, but many K-pop songs that were not title tracks have been banned as well.

== Aftermath of bans ==

=== Revising ===
Often, the entertainment company that owns the banned song will try to revise the song and have its reevaluated by the broadcasting company. They may edit the music video and delete the controversial scenes and re-release the new video. Other times, they may alter the explicit dance moves or change a song's lyrics so that the song may still be performed on music shows, such as [[Music Bank (TV series)|Music Bank.]] In the case of EXO's "Lotto," which as banned due to the title being a brand name, the group sang the word "louder" instead of "lotto" while performing the song live. This revision allowed the song to be performed on KBS and MBC music shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although K-pop songs and videos are often banned by KBS, is it less often for MBC or SBS to place a ban. Some groups are content to promote themselves on networks other than KBS and do not make any changes to their original material. In regards to PSY's "Gentlemen," a spokesperson for YG Entertainment said they had no plans to submit a difference version of their video, and they followed the decision made by KBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/04/18/south-korean-tv-network-bans-psys-video/|title=South Korean TV Network Bans Psy’s Video|last=Kwaak|first=Jeyup S.|date=2013-04-18|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 12 out of 18 songs of [[Cheetah (rapper)|Cheetah]]'s album were deemed unfit for broadcast by KBS and five by SBS, the agency stated that they did not plan on making any changes to the lyrics in order to "keep the original intentions and meanings of the song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/02/12-songs-in-cheetahs-new-album-deemed-unfit-for-kbs-agency-says-no-changes-will-be-made-in-lyrics|title=12 songs in Cheetah's new album deemed unfit for KBS + agency says no changes will be made in lyrics|work=allkpop|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan reactions ===
Of all the broadcasting networks, KBS has banned the most songs and videos, earning it the nickname "Korean Banning System." When a more explicit video is released, fans have come to expect the video to be deemed inappropriate for broadcast by KBS.

There have been cases of fans arguing against a banning decision. When KBS deemed several of Block B's new songs as being unfit for broadcast, an online petition appeared, requesting that KBS reconsider their decision. It gained 2,400 signatures within a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2012/01/kbs-deems-block-bs-new-songs-unfit-for-broadcast|title=KBS deems Block B's new songs unfit for broadcast|work=allkpop|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Madonna with Child and Saints''''' is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] late [[Renaissance]] painter [[Luca Signorelli]], executed around 1519-1523. It is housed in the [[Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant Angelo]], [[Rome]], Italy.
The picture is a traditional [[Holy Conversation]] composition.

==History==
The painting was commissioned by the Brotherhood of St. Jerome in [[Arezzo]] for their seat. The work was executed in [[Cortona]] and was brought to Arezzo by the painter himself, who was then in his seventies (here, he resided in the Vasari family's house and met the young [[Giorgio Vasari]], his future biographer, who started to practice painting  after Signorelli's suggestion).

It is the last work by Signorelli, who died after returning to Cortona.

Tile designs included influences the styles of [[Moorish]], [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Saracen]] cultures.  Many of the tile designs were [[geometric]].  The company was known for their tile [[murals#Tile mural|murals]] consisting of tiles with peacocks and other birds.  The company also produced decorated tiles for floors in the style of a laid-out Persian rug.  May Rindge's daughter's house, the [[Adamson House]] has many examples of the tile produced by Malibu Potteries.

== History ==
[[File:Peacock Fountan, Adamson House.jpg|thumb|Peacock Fountain, Adamson House]]
Founded in 1926 by May Knight Rindge, Malibu Potteries was formed under the corporate name Marblehead Land Company.  Rindge after unsuccessfully prospecting for oil on her property near Zuma Beach, instead found red and buff clays suitable for the production of pottery.  In Malibu, California alongside the ocean coast, a factory was built to produce ceramic tile.

Rindge hired Rufus Keeler.  Keeler was formerly a ceramic engineer for California Clay Products Company (Calco).  Rindge and Keeler hired William Handley, a former product designer for Calco.  At the height of the companies production, 125 employees produced over 30,000 square feet of tile a month.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|title=Malibu Potteries|url=http://www.adamsonhouse.org/tile.html|website=Historic Adamson House and Museum|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company specialized in the production of ceramic tile.  The styles were influenced by Moorish, Egyptian, Mayan and Saracen cultures.  Tile designs were mostly geometric.  Tile murals were made with peacocks, ships, and birds.  The company also produced fountains.  Tiles were produced for the architectural, builder and design trades for use indoors and outdoors on floors, walls, fireplaces, step treads, tables, benches, and fountains.

After the stock market crash of 1929, the pottery closed for a short period of time and reopened.  A devastating fire destroyed the factory on 30 September 1931.  The unsold stock of tile was moved to Rindge's unfinished home near the former factory.  In 1942, Rindge died and her home was sold to the [[Franciscan]] Friars.  The Friars named Rindge's former home Serra Retreat.  Serra Retreat was damaged in the September 1970 Malibu Canyon wild fire and was rebuilt using many of the original tiles.  The wild fire had exposed a massive amount of Malibu Potteries tile stored on the property.  The supply of vintage tile was unknown except to the heirs of Rindge. The vast majority of the tiles were unscathed by the fire. The excess tiles not used in the restoration of Serra Retreat were eventually sold with many being placed in private collections.

Robert (Bob) Harris, a sound technician in the movie industry purchased a large collection of Malibu Potteries tile.  In 1979, Harris and ceramist Jim Sullivan founded Malibu Ceramic Works and began producing tile in the style and manner of Malibu Potteries.&lt;ref name="messenger"&gt;{{Citation |last = Potenza |first = Flavia | title = Bob Harris' Malibu Ceramic Works |newspaper = Topanga Messenger |publication-place = Topanga, California | volume = 37 | issue = 25 | date = December 13, 2013 |page = 22| url = http://www.topangamessenger.com/story_detail.php?SectionID=&amp;ArticleID=6484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''History of the Thai Nation''==
Thailand's military junta was criticized for a history textbook it ordered written by the Fine Arts Department of the ministry. The book, ''History of the Thai Nation'',  claims that the military has established "true democracy" in Thailand and has eliminated corruption.&lt;ref name="AC-20180420"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai junta history book claims it established 'true democracy'|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2018/04/thai-history-book-lampooned-for-saying-military-junta-established-true-democracy/|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Asian Correspondent|date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 the ministry's Fine Arts Department published ''History of the Thai Nation'' ({{lang-th|ประวัติศาสตร์ชาติไทย}}; {{rtgs|''prawat sat chat thai''}}) at the order of the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO).&lt;ref name=PTE-20180418&gt;{{cite news|title=New history textbook claims NCPO established true Thai democracy| url=https://prachatai.com/english/node/7716|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Pratchatai English|date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCPO wanted a new history book covering the past 400 years to foster "national reconciliation". The book was written in two months.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phataranawik|first1=Phatarawadee|title=Writing and Rewriting History|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/big_read/30344212|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=The Nation|date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 195, the text reads, "Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha as Prime Minister has carried out a policy of reforming the country, reforming politics to be truly a democracy, eliminating corruption and using moral principles to lead the country to be truly a democracy."&lt;ref name=PTE-20180418/&gt; On page 197 it goes on to say, "After the coup d'etat, Gen Prayut became prime minister. He has tried to develop the country and reform Thai politics into a real democracy. Gen Prayut has used moral principles and stamped out corruption to return democracy to the country."&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"/&gt; The book maintains that the NCPO was forced to stage the 2014 coup to end the political chaos caused by the civilian government of the time. Ten thousand copies of the book were published at a cost of one million [[Thai baht|baht]]. Twenty copies autographed by Prayut were sold at the launch.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429" /&gt; In November 2017, the prime minister ordered the Fine Arts Department to send 100 copies of the book to each of Thailand's provinces.&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kongrut|first1=Anchalee|title=Activist: 'Prayut as democracy hero' book a lie| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1448146/activist-prayut-as-democracy-hero-book-a-lie|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading critic of the junta charged that, "The content of the book is misleading and it will lead to the distortion of the country's history [if not corrected]."&lt;ref name="BP-20180419"/&gt; The culture ministry plans to translate the book to English for distribution to Thai embassies worldwide.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180429" /&gt;

{{Writing systems sidebar}}
A '''pictogram''', also called a '''pictogramme''', '''pictograph''', or simply '''picto''',&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip Babcock. (1993). ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged''. Merriam-Webster Inc. {{ISBN|0-87779-201-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in computer usage an '''[[Computer icon|icon]]''', is an [[ideogram]] that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object. Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance.  A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure, tourism, and geography.

Pictography is a form of [[Writing system|writing]] which uses representational, pictorial [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawings]], similarly to [[cuneiform]] and, to some extent, [[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphic writing]], which also uses drawings as phonetic letters or [[determinative]] rhymes. Some pictograms, such as [[GHS hazard pictograms|Hazards pictograms]], are elements of [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|formal languages]].

Pictograph has a rather different meaning in the field of [[prehistoric art]], including recent art by traditional societies and then means art painted on rock surfaces, as opposed to [[petroglyph]]s; the latter are carved or incised. Such images may or may not be considered pictograms in the general sense.

==Historical==
[[File:Agawa Rock, panel VIII.jpg|thumb|alt=A boat and an animal with horns, painted with red ochre|[[Ojibwa]] pictographs on cliff-face at Agawa Rock, [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]]]]

Early written [[symbols]] were based on pictographs (pictures which resemble what they signify) and [[ideograms]] (symbols which represent ideas). Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into [[logogram|logographic writing systems]]. Pictographs are still in use as the main medium of written communication in some non-literate cultures in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Oceania]]. Pictographs are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.

Pictographs can be considered an art form, or can be considered a written language and are designated as such in [[Pre-Columbian art]], [[Native American art]], Ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Painting in the Americas before Colonization]]. One example of many is the [[Rock art of the Chumash people]], part of the [[:Category:Native American history of California|Native American history of California]].
In 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage List added "[[Petroglyph]] Complexes of the Mongolian Altai, Mongolia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1382|title=Petroglyphic Complexes of the Mongolian Altai|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the importance of the pictograms engraved in rocks.

Some scientists in the field of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology, such as Prof. Dr. [[Mario Christian Meyer]], are studying the symbolic meaning of indigenous pictograms and petroglyphs,&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.UNESCO.org/images/0006/000678/067843F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to create new ways of communication between native people and modern scientists to safeguard and valorize their cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pisad.bio.br/artigos/amazonupclose_outoftheforest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern uses ==
An early modern example of the extensive use of pictographs may be seen in the map in the London suburban timetables of the London and North Eastern Railway, 1936-1947, designed by [[George Dow]], in which a variety of pictographs was used to indicate facilities available at or near each station.  Pictographs remain in common use today, serving as pictorial, representational [[signage|sign]]s, instructions, or statistical diagrams. Because of their graphical nature and fairly realistic style, they are widely used to indicate public toilets, or places such as airports and train stations.  Because they are a concise way to communicate a concept to people who speak many different languages, pictograms are also used extensively at the [[Olympics]], and are redesigned for each set of games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pages.uncc.edu/visualrhetoric/projects/illustration-video/olympic-pictograms/ Visual Rhetoric - Olympic Pictograms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mediamadegreat.com/olympic-pictograms/ Olympic Pictograms: Design through History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://1stmuse.com/pictograms/ Olympic Games Pictograms]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictographic writing as a modernist poetic technique is credited to [[Ezra Pound]], though French [[surrealism|surrealists]] accurately credit the [[Pacific Northwest]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] of [[Alaska]] who introduced writing, via [[totem pole]]s, to [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed 2003, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist [[Xu Bing]] created Book from the Ground, a universal language made up of pictograms collected from around the world. A Book from the Ground chat program has been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally.

Pictograms are used in many areas of modern life for commodity purposes, often as a [[formal language]] (see the [[#In mathematics|In mathematics]] section).

==In mathematics==
[[File:Titanic casualties.svg|thumb|300px|alt=table with boxes instead of numbers, the amounts and sizes of boxes represent amounts of people|A compound pictogram showing the breakdown of the survivors and deaths of the maiden voyage of the [[RMS Titanic]] by class and age/gender.]]

In statistics, pictograms are charts in which icons represent numbers to make it more interesting and easier to understand. A key is often included to indicate what each icon represents. All icons must be of the same size, but a fraction of an icon can be used to show the respective fraction of that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/factsheet/ma37grap-e3-f-pictograms|title=Understanding pictograms|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
! Day !! Letters sent
|-
| Monday || 10
|-
| Tuesday || 17
|-
| Wednesday || 29
|-
| Thursday || 41
|-
| Friday || 18
|}
can be graphed as follows:
{| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
|+
! Day !! Letters sent
|-
| Monday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]]
|-
| Tuesday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Image from the Silk icon theme by Mark James half left.svg|alt=and a half]]
|-
| Wednesday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=three envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|-
| Thursday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=four envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|-
| Friday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=two envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|}
Key: [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]] = 10 letters

As the values are rounded to the nearest 5 letters, the second icon on Tuesday is the left half of the original.

==Standardization==
Pictographs can often transcend languages in that they can communicate to speakers of a number of tongues and language families equally effectively, even if the languages and cultures are completely different. This is why [[Road signs in the United States|road signs]] and similar pictographic material are often applied as global standards expected to be understood by nearly all.

A standard set of pictographs was defined in the [[international standard]] ''[[ISO 7001]]: Public Information Symbols''. Other common sets of pictographs are the [[laundry symbols]] used on clothing tags and the [[GHS hazard pictograms|chemical hazard symbols]] as standardized by the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|GHS system]].

Pictograms have been popularized in use on the [[World Wide Web|web]] and in [[software]], better known as "[[Computer icon|icon]]s" displayed on a computer screen in order to help user navigate a computer system or mobile device.

{{The Works of Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s '''''Poetics''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Περὶ ποιητικῆς}}; {{lang-la|De Poetica}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isnature.org/Files/Aristotle/ ''Aristotelis Opera''] by [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; c. 335 BC&lt;ref name="dukore"&gt;Dukore (1974, 31).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]] and first [[Extant literature|extant]] philosophical treatise to focus on [[literary theory]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, ix).&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been the traditional view for centuries.  However, recent work is now challenging whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;"Aristotle on the Power of Music in Tragedy," Pierre Destrée, Greek &amp; Roman Musical Studies, Vol. 4, Issue 2, 2016; Gregory L. Scott, ''Aristotle on Dramatic Musical Composition The Real Role of Literature, Catharsis, Music and Dance in the Poetics'' (2016b), {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, Aristotle offers an account of what he calls "poetry" (a term which in Greek literally means "making" and in this context includes verse [[drama]] – [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], [[tragedy]], and the [[satyr play]] – as well as [[lyric poetry]] and [[epic poetry]]). They are similar in the fact that they are all imitations but different in the three ways that Aristotle describes:
# Differences in music rhythm, harmony, meter and melody. 
# Difference of goodness in the characters. 
# Difference in how the narrative is presented:  telling a story or acting it out.

In examining its "first principles", Aristotle finds two: 1) imitation and 2) [[genre]]s and other concepts by which that of truth is applied/revealed in the poesis. His analysis of [[tragedy]] constitutes the core of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Poetics'' 1447a13 (1987, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Aristotle's ''Poetics'' is universally acknowledged in the [[Western culture|Western]] critical tradition, "almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions".&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;Carlson (1993, 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]] only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habib|first=M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory: From Plato to the Present|year=2005|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=0-631-23200-1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and content==
Aristotle's work on [[aesthetics]] consists of the ''Poetics,'' ''Politics'' (Bk VIII) and ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric: An Art of Character|page=3

At some point, Aristotle's original work was divided in two, each "book" written on a separate roll of [[papyrus]].&lt;ref name=j20&gt;Janko (1987, xx).&lt;/ref&gt; Only the first part &amp;ndash; that which focuses on [[tragedy]] and epic (as a quasi-dramatic art, given its definition in Ch 23) &amp;ndash; survives. The lost second part addressed [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]].&lt;ref name=j20/&gt; Some scholars speculate that the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' summarises the contents of the lost second book.&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, xxi).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other scholars indicate that "tragedy" is a very misleading translation for the Greek &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt;, which seems to have meant "goat-song" originally.  The reason is that Aristotle says three times in the treatise that the protagonist can go from fortune to misfortune or &lt;i&gt;misfortune to fortune&lt;/i&gt;; also in Chapter 14 the best type of &lt;i&gt;tragoidos&lt;/i&gt; is that which ends happily, like &lt;i&gt;Cresphontes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Iphigenia&lt;/i&gt; (presumably &lt;i&gt;"in Tauris"&lt;/i&gt;)!&lt;ref&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aristotle's Favorite Tragedy: Oedipus or Cresphontes?&lt;/i&gt;, Gregory Scott, 2018, {{ISBN|9780999704912}} or 9780999704905&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The table of contents page of the ''Poetics'' found in Modern Library's ''Basic Works of Aristotle'' (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Basic Works of Aristotle''. Ed. Richard McKeon Modern Library (2001) – Poetics. Trans. Ingrid Bywater, pp. 1453–87&lt;/ref&gt;

* A. Preliminary discourse on tragedy, epic poetry, and comedy, as the chief forms of imitative poetry.
* B. Definition of a tragedy, and the rules for its construction. Definition and analysis into qualitative parts.
* C. Rules for the construction of a tragedy: Tragic pleasure, or [[catharsis]] experienced by fear and pity should be produced in the spectator. The characters must be four things: good, appropriate, realistic, and consistent. [[Discovery (observation)|Discovery]] must occur within the plot. Narratives, stories, structures and poetics overlap. It is important for the poet to visualize all of the scenes when creating the plot. The poet should incorporate complication and [[dénouement]] within the story, as well as combine all of the elements of [[tragedy]]. The poet must express thought through the characters' words and actions, while paying close attention to [[diction]] and how a character's spoken words express a specific idea. Aristotle believed that all of these different elements had to be present in order for the poetry to be well-done.  However, starting in 1948 with a Macedonian classicist, M.D. Petruševski, some scholars have rejected that Aristotle himself could have written the word ''katharsis'' in the definition of tragedy, because unlike all of the other words in the definition, it is not discussed either before or after the definition.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Petruševski "Pathēmatōn Katharsin ou bien Pragmatōn Systasin?," Ziva antika/Antiquite vivante (Skopje: Societe d'etudes classiques Ziva Antika) 1954.

Scott (2016b) {{ISBN|9780999704929}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* D. Possible criticisms of an epic or tragedy, and the answers to them.
* E. Tragedy as artistically superior to epic poetry: Tragedy has everything that the epic has, even the epic meter being admissible. The reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the play as acted. The tragic imitation requires less space for the attainment of its end. If it has more concentrated effect, it is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it. There is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets (plurality of actions) and this is proved by the fact that an epic poem can supply enough material for several tragedies.

===Content===

Aristotle distinguishes between the [[genre]]s of "poetry" in three ways:
* Matter
::[[language]], [[rhythm]], and [[melody]], for Aristotle, make up the matter of poetic creation. Where the [[epic poem]] makes use of language alone, the playing of the lyre involves rhythm and melody. Some poetic forms include a blending of all materials; for example, Greek tragic drama included a singing chorus, and so music and language were all part of the performance.  These points also convey the standard view.  Recent work, though, argues that translating ''rhuthmos'' here as "rhythm" is absurd:  melody already has its own inherent musical rhythm, and the Greek can mean what Plato says it means in ''Laws'' II, 665a:  "(the name of) ordered body movement," or dance.  This correctly conveys what dramatic musical creation, the topic of the ''Poetics'', in ancient Greece had:  music, dance, and language.  Also, the musical instrument cited in Ch 1 is not the lyre but the ''kithara'', which was played in the drama while the kithara-player was dancing (in the chorus), even if that meant just walking in an appropriate way.  Moreover, epic might have had only literary exponents, but as Plato's ''Ion'' and Aristotle's Ch 26 of the ''Poetics'' help prove, for Plato and Aristotle at least some epic rhapsodes used all three means of mimesis:  language, dance (as pantomimic gesture), and music (if only by chanting the words).&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"&gt;Scott (2016b)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Subjects
::Also "agents" in some translations. Aristotle differentiates between [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] throughout the work by distinguishing between the nature of the [[Character (arts)|human characters]] that populate either form. Aristotle finds that tragedy treats of serious, important, and virtuous people. Comedy, on the other hand, treats of less virtuous people and  focuses on human "weaknesses and foibles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Aristotle's Poetics|page= 270
|url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226313948|isbn= 0226313948
|first= Stephen |last= Halliwell |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle introduces here the influential ''tripartite division of characters'' in superior (βελτίονας) to the audience, inferior (χείρονας), or at the same level (τοιούτους).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Michael Sifakis (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GfLAlkcFYgC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Aristotle on the function of tragic poetry''] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Poetics 1448a, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1448a English], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0055%3Asection%3D1448a original Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]] (1957). ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Method
::One may imitate the agents through use of a narrator throughout, or only occasionally (using direct speech in parts and a narrator in parts, as Homer does), or only through direct speech (without a narrator), using actors to speak the lines directly.  This latter is the method of tragedy (and comedy): without use of any narrator.

Having examined briefly the field of "poetry" in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tragedy is a [[Mimesis|representation]] of a serious, complete action which has magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people acting and not by [[Diegesis|narration]], accomplishing by means of pity and [[terror]] the [[catharsis]] of such emotions.

By "embellished speech", I mean that which has rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By "with its elements separately", I mean that some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and others again by means of song (1449b25-30).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 7). In Butcher's translation, this passage reads: "Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play, in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper [[catharsis]] of these emotions."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then identifies the "parts" of tragedy:

* [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'')
::Refers to the "organization of incidents". It should imitate an action evoking pity and fear. The plot involves a change from bad towards good, or good towards bad. Complex plots have reversals and recognitions. These and suffering (or violence) are used to evoke the tragic emotions. The most tragic plot pushes a good character towards undeserved misfortune because of a mistake  (''[[hamartia]]''). Plots revolving around such a mistake are more tragic than plots with two sides and an opposite outcome for the good and the bad. Violent situations are most tragic if they are between friends and family. Threats can be resolved (best last) by being done in knowledge, done in ignorance and then discovered, almost be done in ignorance but be discovered in the last moment.

::Actions should be follow logically from the situation created by what has happened before, and from the character of the agent. This goes for recognitions and reversals as well, as even surprises are more satisfying to the audience if they afterwards are seen as a plausible or necessary consequence.

* [[Character (arts)|character]] (''[[ethos]]'')
::Character is the moral or ethical character of the agents. It is revealed when the agent makes moral choices. In a perfect tragedy, the character will support the plot, which means personal motivations and traits will somehow connect parts of the cause-and-effect chain of actions producing pity and fear. 
::Main character should be
::* good—Aristotle explains that audiences do not like, for example, villains "making fortune from misery" in the end. It might happen though, and might make the play interesting. Nevertheless, the moral is at stake here and morals are important to make people happy (people can, for example, see tragedy because they want to release their anger)
::* appropriate—if a character is supposed to be wise, it is unlikely he is young (supposing wisdom is gained with age)
::* consistent—if a person is a soldier, he is unlikely to be scared of blood (if this soldier is scared of blood it must be explained and play some role in the story to avoid confusing the audience); it is also "good" if a character doesn't change opinion "that much" if the play is not "driven" by who characters are, but by what they do (audience is confused in case of unexpected shifts in behaviour [and its reasons and morals] of characters)
::* "consistently inconsistent"—if a character always behaves foolishly it is strange if he suddenly becomes smart. In this case it would be good to explain such change, otherwise the audience may be confused. If character changes opinion a lot it should be clear he is a character who has this trait, not a real life person - this is also to avoid confusion
* thought (''[[dianoia]]'')—spoken (usually) reasoning of human characters can explain the characters or story background
* diction (''[[Lexis (Aristotle)|lexis]]'')  Lexis is better translated according to some as "speech" or "language."  Otherwise, the relevant necessary condition stemming from ''logos'' in the definition (language) has no followup:  mythos (plot) could be done by dancers or pantomime artists, given Chs 1, 2 and 4, if the actions are structured (on stage, as drama was usually done), just like plot for us can be given in film or in a story-ballet with no words.&lt;ref name="Scott 2016b"/&gt;
::Refers to the quality of speech in tragedy. Speeches should reflect character, the moral qualities of those on the stage. The expression of the meaning of the words.
* melody (''melos'')  "Melos" can also mean "music-dance" as some musicologists recognize, especially given that its primary meaning in ancient Greek is "limb" (an arm or a leg).  This is arguably more sensible because then Aristotle is conveying what the chorus actually did.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2016a and 2016b&lt;/ref&gt;
::The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors. It should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action. Should be contributed to the unity of the plot. It is a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama. 
* spectacle (''[[opsis]]'')
::Refers to the visual apparatus of the play, including set, costumes and props (anything you can see). Aristotle calls spectacle the "least artistic" element of tragedy, and the "least connected with the work of the poet (playwright). For example: if the play has "beautiful" costumes and "bad" acting and "bad" story, there is "something wrong" with it. Even though that "beauty" may save the play it is "not a nice thing".

He offers the earliest-surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anyway, arising from an [[Improvisation|improvisatory]] beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the [[dithyramb]], and comedy from the leaders of the [[phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities) [...] (1449a10-13)&lt;ref&gt;
Janko (1987, 6). This text is [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a available online] in an older translation, in which the same passage reads: "At any rate it originated in improvisation—both tragedy itself and [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]. The one tragedy came from the prelude to the dithyramb and the other comedy from the prelude to the [[Fertility rite|phallic songs]] which still survive as institutions in many cities."
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Poetique Aristote Arabe 2346.jpg|thumbnail|Arabic translation of the ''Poetics'' by [[Abu Bishr Matta ibn Yunus|Abū Bishr Mattā]].]]
The Arabic version of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' that influenced the [[Middle Ages]] was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated ''Paris 1741.''  The [[Syriac language | Syriac-language]] source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original ''Poetics'' and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Hardison, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paris 1741'' appears online at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France).&lt;ref&gt;To obtain it on images or on a pdf format, follow this route: &gt; http://www.bnf.fr/; &gt; COLLECTIONS ET SERVICES; &gt; Catalogues; &gt; Accès à BnF archives et manuscrits; &gt; Collections; &gt; Département des Manuscrits; &gt; Grec; &gt; Manuscrits grecs - Présentation du fonds. &gt; Grec 1741 &gt; Download Images or pdf. The Poetics begins at 184r, page 380 of the pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle's ''Poetics'' included [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Averroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition|pages= 15–16

Averroes' interpretation of the ''Poetics'' was accepted by the [[Western culture|West]], where it reflected the "prevailing notions of poetry" into the 16th century.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=54}}

'''''Rhythm 0''''' (1974) was a six-hour work of [[performance art]] by Yugoslav artist [[Marina Abramović]] in Studio Morra, [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Marina Abramović, Chris Thompson and Katarina Weslien, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4139995 "Pure Raw: Performance, Pedagogy, and (Re)presentation"], ''PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art'', 28(1), January 2006 (pp. 29–50), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The work involved Abramović standing still while the audience was invited to do to her whatever they wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, and a gun loaded with one bullet.&lt;ref name=Abramovic01:00mins&gt;[https://vimeo.com/71952791 "Marina Abramović on ''Rhythm 0'' (1974)"], Marina Abramović Institute, 2014, c. 01:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/190/1972 "Marina Abramović. Rhythm 0. 1974"], Museum of Modern Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no separate stages. Abramović and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer Ward, ''No Innocent Bystanders: Performance Art and Audience'', University Press of New England, 2012, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: "What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?"&lt;ref name=Abramovic00:00mins&gt;[https://vimeo.com/71952791 Abramović 2014], c. 00:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
Her instructions were placed on the table: 

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;
Instructions.&lt;br/&gt;
There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance.&lt;br/&gt;
I am the object.&lt;br/&gt;
During this period I take full responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;
Duration: 6 hours (8 pm – 2 am).&lt;ref&gt;Ward 2012, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abramović said the work "pushed her body to the limits."&lt;ref name=Abramovic00:00mins/&gt; Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss.&lt;ref name=Abramovic01:00mins/&gt; Art critic [[Thomas McEvilley]], who was present, wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;

It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed so someone could suck her blood. Various minor sexual assaults were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the audience factions."&lt;ref&gt;Ward 2012, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Abramović described it later: “What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.” ... “I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.”&lt;ref&gt;Daneri, 29; and 30&lt;/ref&gt;

When the gallery announced the work was over, and Abramović began to move again, she said the audience left, unable to face her as a person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/71952791 Abramović 2014], c. 01:45 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Rhythm 0'' ranked ninth on a ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' list of the greatest works of performance art ever done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/04/the-25-best-performance-art-pieces-of-all-time/rhythm-0-the-artist-is-present|title=The 25 Best Performance Art Pieces of All Time|last=Eisinger|first=Dale|magazine=Complex|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sticker album''' is a book in which collectable [[sticker]]s are stuck into designated sections. Sticker album themes can be sporting events such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] or [[Television program|TV shows]] like ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[Panini Group|Panini]] first produced a World Cup sticker album for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brand collaborations |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/licensing/brand-collaborations.html |accessdate=8 September 2018 |agency=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“Iconic”&gt;{{cite news |title=Panini World Cup 2018 stickers: When is the iconic sticker album release date?

The stickers are usually sold in blind packs, so the purchaser does not know which stickers they are buying. Collectors then swap or sell their spares with other collectors.

===Sports===
A [[sports]]-related sticker album, such as [[Panini Group|Panini]]’s [[FIFA World Cup]] edition, have designated sections for each team along with numbered rectangles for each sticker.&lt;ref name=“Iconic”/&gt;&lt;ref name=“Guardian”/&gt; Each sticker will have the players picture and below it there is usually their name, birth date, position and birthplace. In addition to the players, there are stickers which bear the team's crest and a team photo.

'''Strahlendes Klima e.V''' is a registered [[non-profit organization]] that produces films and media focusing on the issues of energy and resources for an [[environmentally friendly]], more climate conscious world. Their main concept is to build a [[decentralised]] activist network in order to distribute topical content in terms of [[open licence]] publications. By offering free educational media they aim to raise awareness for environmental conservation.&lt;ref name="Educational media for German schools at Deutscher Bildungsserver"&gt;

== History ==
In late 2006 political scientist [[Kerstin Schnatz]] and cinematographer [[Isabel Huber]] began to research on uranium. They intended to do a documentary film focussing on the origins of nuclear power, especially the [[nuclear cycle]] and [[uranium mining]]. After having gathered a film crew of volunteers, the film was shot in Australia, France and Germany. In 2009 the international version of the documentary "Uranium - is it a country?" (53 min.) was released and nominated for the newcomer's award "Goldener Schlüssel" at [[Kasseler Dokumentarfilm- und Videofest]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Dok-Fest Kassel 2009"&gt;

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film crew decided to distribute the documentary under an [[open licence]] model&lt;ref name="Uranium - is it a country? - Licence"&gt;

to spread the content. The film has been screened thousands of times all around the world due to its [[decentralised]] [[Film distributor|distribution]] coordinated by online networking activists.
It has been used heavily for political campaigning up to the [[German federal election]] in September 2009&lt;ref name="Screening Ludwigsburg"&gt;

In the summer of 2010 the film crew decided to found a [[non-profit organisation]] (Strahlendes Klima e.V.) to keep up the work on envirenmental issues.

== Activities ==

Strahlendes Klima e.V. helps activists to organize film screenings and debates on environmental issues.
They organise workshops for schools and non-profits and release educational films and media on a regular basis. In 2010 "At Eyelevel" their film about [[indigenous peoples]] facing the problems of uranium mining was released.

In 2011 [[Goethe Institut]]-Shanghai invited the organisation to visit [[China]]. A short film treating [[renewable energies]] in China is expected to be released in mid-2012.&lt;ref name="Projekt China"&gt;
                      {{cite web

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They recently started the shooting of a new feature-length documentary on sustainable waste strategies, which will be available licensed under [[creative commons]] by 2013.

[[File:TheChildrenOfSanchez.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Random House]])]]
'''''The Children of Sanchez''''' is a [[1961 in literature|1961]] book by American [[anthropologist]] [[Oscar Lewis]] about a [[Mexico|Mexican]] family living in the [[Mexico City]] slum of [[Tepito]], which he studied as part of his program to develop his concept of [[culture of poverty]]. Due to criticisms expressed by members of the family regarding the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI) government and Mexican presidents such as [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] and [[Adolfo López Mateos]], and its being written by a foreigner, the book was banned in Mexico for a few years before pressure from literary figures resulted in its publication.

Jesús Sánchez, age fifty, is the father, and his four children are Manuel, age thirty-two; Roberto, twenty-nine; Consuelo, twenty-seven; and Marta, twenty-five.

==Film==
A [[The Children of Sanchez (film)|film based on the book and with the same title]] was directed by [[Hall Bartlett]] and was released in [[1979 in film|1979]]. It stars [[Anthony Quinn]] as Jesús Sánchez.

'''The Hallé''' is an English [[symphony orchestra]] based in Manchester, England. It supports a choir, youth choir, youth training choir, children's choir and a youth orchestra, and releases its recordings on its own record label, though it has occasionally released recordings on [[Angel Records]] and [[EMI]].  Since 1996 the orchestra has been resident at the [[Bridgewater Hall]] in Manchester.

==History==
In May 1857 the pianist and conductor [[Charles Hallé]] set up an orchestra to perform at the Manchester [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], which it did until October.  Hallé decided to continue working with the orchestra as a formal organisation, and it gave its first concert under those auspices on 30&amp;nbsp;January 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/2/Royal-Liverpool-Philharmonic-Society/SHP_ADJ_175173.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105084922/https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/2/Royal-Liverpool-Philharmonic-Society/SHP_ADJ_175173.aspx |archivedate=2017-01-05 |df= }}
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-17041169
&lt;/ref&gt;  The orchestra's first home was the [[Free Trade Hall]]. By 1861 the orchestra was in financial trouble, and it performed only two concerts that year.&lt;ref name="Hewett"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml;jsessionid=CW4IP5KH5U3VDQFIQMFCFF4AVCBQYIV0?xml=/arts/2008/01/07/bmelder107.xml | title=Manchester's Hallé: Knees-up for our oldest orchestra | work=Telegraph | author=Ivan Hewett | date=7 January 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article3326598.ece | title=How an orchestra changed my life  | work=The Independent | author=Howard Jacobson | date=11 January 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111215658/http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article3326598.ece &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hallé-first-concert.jpg|thumb|left|alt=old newspaper classified advertisement with twenty lines of text in small type|The Hallé's first programme (1858)]][[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] served as music director from 1899 to 1911. During his tenure, the orchestra gave the first performance of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1]] of Sir [[Edward Elgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Richter-Hungarian-conductor|title=Hans Richter|accessdate=2017-07-04|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 the orchestra was again in crisis, having diminished in size to 30 players.&lt;ref name="Hewett"/&gt;  Over the next 27&amp;nbsp;years, from 1943 to 1970, the orchestra's next music director, Sir [[John Barbirolli]], restored the Hallé to national prominence.  Together, they made many recordings, including the first recording of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[Symphony No. 8 (Vaughan Williams)|Symphony No. 8]]'', of which they also gave the first performance.  During Barbirolli's tenure, one of the most notable orchestra members was concertmaster Martin Milner, who served in that capacity from 1958 to 1987.  Barbirolli regarded Milner as his "right-hand man" and once wrote in appreciation to him: "You are the finest leader I have ever had in my fairly long career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,336724,00.html | title=Martin Milner: Barbirolli's right-hand man who led the Hallé through arduous times | work=The Guardian | author=Clive Smart | date=27 June 2000 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kent Nagano]] was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999.  The orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996, as its primary concert venue.  During his tenure, Nagano received criticism for his expensive and ambitious programming, as well as his conducting fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,299041,00.html | title=Nagano passes on Halle baton | work=The Guardian | author=John Ezard | date=25 May 1999 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, poor financial management at the orchestra separately contributed to the fiscal troubles of the orchestra. The orchestra faced major financial problems during the late 1990s, including a £1.3&amp;nbsp;million deficit in 1998, to the point where the existence of the orchestra was threatened with loss of funding from the Arts Council and ultimately bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/article994944.ece | title=A city reborn | work=The Times | author=Richard Morrison | date=14 January 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jodrell Bank Live 2013 14.jpg|thumb|right|The Hallé performing at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].]]
During 1997 there was an eight-month period when the orchestra had no executive director.  Leslie Robinson served for two years as chief executive after that period, starting changes to the orchestra to start to bring under control the orchestra's financial troubles.  These included public fund-raising, which netted £2&amp;nbsp;million, cutting the number of people on the orchestra board in half, and reducing the number of musicians in the orchestra from 98 to 80. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Since 1999, the orchestra's chief executive has been John Summers, who continued Robinson's fiscal practices to restore greater financial security to the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/career_and_jobs/secretarial/article1050437.ece | title=In perfect harmony | work=The Times | author= | date=24 March 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Arts Council awarded the orchestra a £3.8&amp;nbsp;million grant to allow it to pay off accumulated debts and increase musician salaries, which had been frozen for 4&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,510258,00.html | title=Troubled orchestra gets £3.8m fillip | work=The Guardian | author=David Ward | date=21 June 2001 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000 Sir [[Mark Elder]] took up the position of music director, having been appointed to the post in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiachra Gibbons | title=Miracle man to stir Halle giant | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,292269,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=1999-06-07 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His concerts with the orchestra have received consistently positive reviews, and he is generally regarded as having restored the orchestra to high critical and musical standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article623923.ece | title=Orchestras: these are the champions | work=The Times | author=Richard Morrison | date=1 September 2006 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 Elder signed a contract to extend his tenure through 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article577628.ece | title=Opera: Armed for action | work=The Times | author=Hugh Canning | date=16 October 2005 | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in May 2009 the Hallé announced a further extension to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cullingford, "Elder renews Hallé contract until 2015".

One of the orchestra's recent ideas was to try to find alternative stage dress to the traditional "penguin suits", but this idea did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=David Ward | title=Halle keeps penguin suits for new season | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/16/arts.artsnews1 | work=The Guardian | date=2003-05-16 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The orchestra has also begun to issue new CD recordings under its own label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=David Ward | title=Hallé opts to record on own label | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,718534,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=2002-05-20 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the orchestra began a series of recordings in collaboration with the film composer, [[Benson Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_bensontaylor/status/852265750601629697|title=BENSON TAYLOR on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 the orchestra was forced to cancel a planned tour of the United States because of the cost and administrative difficulties in obtaining visas for the musicians, a result of the tougher visa regulations intended to combat potential terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbcmusicmagazine.com/newsRead.asp?id=19331&amp;scrollCount=12 | title=Visa hurdle forces Hallé to cancel US tour | work=BBC Music Magazine | author= | date=5 April 2006 | accessdate=2007-05-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928185634/http://www.bbcmusicmagazine.com/newsRead.asp?id=19331&amp;scrollCount=12 | archivedate=28 September 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Tikka To Ride'''" is the first episode of [[science fiction]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' Series VII and the 37th in the series run. It was first broadcast on the British television channel [[BBC Two|BBC2]] on 17 January 1997.&lt;ref name="BBC - Programme Catalogue - RED DWARF VI - TIKKA TO RIDE"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/NMYJ411X | title =BBC - Programme Catalogue - RED DWARF VI - TIKKA TO RIDE | publisher =BBC |accessdate =12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Doug Naylor]] and directed by [[Ed Bye]], it was the first episode not to involve co-creator and writer [[Rob Grant]].

Series VII was the first series to have extended episodes.

==Plot==
[[Dave Lister|Lister]] makes a video explaining how the crew survived [[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|their battle]] with their future selves. If the future crew had killed their former selves, they would have eliminated their own existence, and therefore not have been able to destroy themselves. (See [[temporal paradox]].) Therefore, time has reset to a point before the crew picked up time drive. Lister's explanation is too convoluted for the video camera to handle and it explodes. [[Kryten]] dismisses the whole incident as "garbled" and more "boring than an in-flight magazine produced by [[Air Belgium (1979–2000)|Air Belgium]]."

Unfortunately disaster has struck - ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Starbug|Starbug]]'' is still damaged from the battle and as a consequence all the [[Indian food]] supplies have been destroyed; not even a single [[papadum]] survived. Lister proposes that the crew obtain the time drive again and go back in time to an Indian take-away and order 500 curries (even though [[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|Out of Time]] established that travel to other places (such as Earth) would also require a star drive). [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]] and Kryten  are against the idea and oppose going back in time, having seen the kind of people they could possibly become. Lister argues that they can use a time drive and avoid that consequence if they don't abuse it like their future selves did; however he finds himself outnumbered and seemingly concedes defeat. However, Lister swaps Kryten's head for one of his spare heads and removes the guilt chip from it, having the now guiltless Kryten reassure the crew that it will be okay. The next morning, Rimmer and Cat are confused when Kryten serves them high-calorie breakfasts, starts smoking and using phrases like ''"you bet your ass"''. However, when Kryten assures them it'll be ok to pick up the time drive the two assent and board the ship containing it, intending to go back to the 21st Century to one of Lister's favourite curry houses to pick up a large order.

Their [[time travel]] calculations are a little off and they find themselves in [[Dallas, Texas]] on 22 November 1963. They appear at the [[Texas School Book Depository]] just as [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|firing]] at U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]. They inadvertently knock him out the window to his death below, thereby preventing Kennedy's assassination. The crew use the time travel device, to go three years forward to 1966.

The crew find Dallas deserted. Wandering the streets, they find a man who has been trampled to death, indicating people left in a hurry. Reading a nearby newspaper, Kryten finds out what has happened:

{{quote|President Kennedy was impeached in 1964 for sharing a mistress with Mafia boss, Sam Giancana. It was the biggest scandal in American history. Kennedy was sentenced to three years in an open prison in July, '65. J. Edgar Hoover became president; he was forced to run by the mob, who had pictures of him at a transvestite orgy...Soon after his election, the USSR were  allowed to install a nuclear base in Cuba in return for Mafia cocaine trafficking between Cuba and the States. With a Soviet nuclear base 30 miles from the US mainland, people fled from all the major cities.}}

The crew attempt to correct the situation by returning to the day of the shooting and driving Oswald to a higher floor in the building, but this plan still fails to lead to Kennedy's death; by sending Oswald up another floor, they made the shot's trajectory so steep that Kennedy was merely wounded. Lister suggests getting a second gunman to shoot from behind a nearby grassy knoll. With none of the crew willing to shoot the President themselves, Lister travels to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] in 1965 and persuades a post-impeachment Kennedy to travel back to 1963, become a "second gunman" on the [[grassy knoll]], and shoot himself to restore his place in history. The plan works: Kennedy shoots his past self and the timeline is restored.  Kennedy grimly thanks the gang for the chance to restore himself to his proper place in history, and fades away as a result of the resetting timeline. Lister, too late, realises he forgot to ask Kennedy for the name of a good Indian take-away. Having seen that Lister has learned absolutely nothing from the experience, the other members of the crew give him a well-deserved beating in return for all he's put them through.

===Extended Edition/Alternate Ending===

Shown as an option on the Series 7 DVD, the Extended Edition of ''Tikka To Ride'' continues after Cat, Rimmer and Kryten take out their frustrations on Lister. After managing to correctly use the time drive and steal the Indian food supplies from Starbug before the events of the episode began (thus showing an example of a predestination paradox and allowing Lister to re-stock on curry, papadums and lager), the crew end up storing the food in one of Starbug's cargo holds (ostensibly the same cargo hold it was stolen from in the first place - B-deck). Rimmer leaves with Kryten in tow but remarks as he does ''"I must've passed this thing a million times. What the hell's it for?"'' in regards to a lever by the door. It doesn't take long for Lister to give into the curiosity planted by Rimmer and pull the lever. The lever, in fact, activates the separation sequence for Starbug, jettisoning the rear section of the ship into space while allowing the front half to fly away; an ace Rimmer had ''"had up his sleeve for months"''. Lister notes that he's stranded alone in deep space with nothing but three-and-a-half tons of curry, and couldn't be happier before eagerly digging into the crates.

==Production==
Even though the previous series had ended on a cliffhanger, fans had been forced to wait three years for the resolution. This was due to a number of factors, which included [[Craig Charles]] being imprisoned before being cleared of a charge of [[rape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Although tempted to end it, he later agreed to write two more eight-episode series of the show, as this would allow the episode count to reach 52 and therefore be eligible for [[Television syndication|syndication]].&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Writing"/&gt;

"Tikka To Ride" ushered in new production values. The cinematic quality and filming of the new episodes meant that the studio audience was no longer viable (however the show was shown to an audience at a later date and their laughter was added). Also the special effects were increasing every series and the majority of the episodes were pre-recorded.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Production"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_7/production.html | title =Red Dwarf Series VII Production | publisher =Red Dwarf.co.uk |accessdate =17 December 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022124317/http://reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_7/production.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Naylor's desires for a seventh series was the prospect of international syndication and a movie.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Production"/&gt; This vision was helped with the return of [[Ed Bye]] to the director's chair, having previously left due to a scheduling clash with directing his wife [[Ruby Wax]]'s new TV show at the time.&lt;ref name="Interview: Ed Bye"&gt;Interview: Ed Bye, Red Dwarf smegazine, issue 12, January 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, {{ISSN|0965-5603}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to return to helm the seventh series, his first Red Dwarf episode since Series IV's "[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]".

The arrival of the seventh series was also promoted by the show making its first appearance of the front cover of the [[Radio Times]].

Guest stars included [[Michael J. Shannon]] who played John F. Kennedy, Toby Aspin as Lee Harvey Oswald, Peter Gaitens as FBI Agent and Robert Ashe as Cop.

The deserted Dallas scenes were filmed at [[Farnborough Airport]]. The expanded Starbug cargo deck scenes were filmed inside the former [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] wind tunnels at Farnborough. The motorcade scenes were filmed at the [[Chobham]] test track, with additional crowd shots filmed around buildings at [[Shepperton Studios]].

==Cultural and historical references==
The title of this episode is a piece of word-play based on the name of the song "[[Ticket to Ride]]" by [[the Beatles]], in accordance with the theme of curry on which the storyline focuses, tikka being an Indian spice marinade.

When on the [[Grassy Knoll]], Lister, Rimmer and Cat are dressed up as tramps, an outfit which the normally vain and shallow Cat would not be seen dead in: "Superficial is my middle name".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]'', Red Dwarf Series V, episode 6, March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the [[Three tramps]], men that are reported to have been found in a [[boxcar]] behind the Grassy Knoll when the police searched it after the shooting, but were later released. Conspiracy theorists have assumed that they were part of the assassination plot.&lt;ref name="Posner_Case_Closed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Case Closed|first=Gerald|last=Posner|authorlink=Gerald Posner|year=1993|publisher=Warner Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the crew travelling backwards in time and accidentally saving someone's life, leading to a change for the worse in history, was also used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode ''[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]''. In each case the person saved was actually an advocate of peace; however, there were few other similarities between the episodes.

In the commentary for the Series III episode "[[Timeslides]]" when talking about Kryten's shouting "Duck!" at the Grassy Knoll line, they note how their characters actually did something similar later on.

==Plot inconsistencies==
At the start of the episode, Lister explains that the crew survived the [[Out of Time (Red Dwarf episode)|previous cliffhanger]] because of a [[temporal paradox]], which made it impossible for them to be killed by their future selves.  However, later in the same episode, Kennedy is able to kill his younger self without creating the same paradox.  There is no explanation of why there is one rule for the crew of Starbug and another for Kennedy. Similarly, it is explained that by preventing the initial assassination, Russia wins the space race (this is why Starbug disappears). This means the JMC never exists and the time drive would never have been found in the first place.

In the previous episode it was made clear that the time drive was only a ''time'' drive and not a space and time drive, so the crew could travel forward or backward in time but were still stuck in deep space. It was not explained in the episode how the time drive can suddenly transport them through space, or why, given that they could travel to 1963 Earth, they did not simply travel back to 22nd Century Earth as per their original plan.

On the Red Dwarf VII DVD documentary ''Back from the Dead'', director Ed Bye recalled explaining to a fan that the time drive was made up, and was just a lump of plastic.

==Reception==
"Tikka to Ride" has generally been well received by critics. DVDActive called it "a promising start to the series" and noted that it was "beautifully shot, with a movie-style score".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/red-dwarf-vii.html |title=Red Dwarf VII (UK - DVD R2) |publisher=www.dvdactive.com |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Verdict stated "what other sitcom, sci-fi or otherwise, would take on the Kennedy Assassination and an alternative future for the United States had the beloved President not been felled by a rain of bullets?" and concluded that the episode "was majestic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarfseries58.php |title=Red Dwarf: Series 5-8 |publisher=www.dvdverdict.com |accessdate=5 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119032101/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarfseries58.php |archivedate=19 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sci-Fi Online noted that "''Tikka to Ride'' morphs into a surprisingly serious time paradox" but felt that the final plot twist was "a largely pointless contrivance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/reviews/dvd/05-11-07_RedDwarf7.htm |title=DVD Red Dwarf Series 7 |publisher=www.sci-fi-online.com |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BellaOnline called the episode "pure silliness, and I mean of the kind that makes ''Red Dwarf'' great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art40890.asp |title=DVD Review--"Red Dwarf Series VII" |publisher=www.bellaonline.com |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Understanding Poetry''''' was an American college textbook and poetry anthology by [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]], first published in [[1938 in poetry|1938]]. The book influenced [[New Criticism]] and went through its fourth edition in 1976.

The textbook "widely influenced ... the study of poetry at the college level in America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/17] Robert Penn Warren biographical sketch at the Academy of American Poets Web site, accessed January 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]] has named the book one of the "Fifty best books of the century."

''Understanding Poetry'', according to an article at the ''Modern American Poetry'' Web site, "codified many of the so-called New Critical ideas into a coherent approach to literary study. Their book, and its companion volume, Understanding Fiction (1943), revolutionized the teaching of literature in the universities and spawned a host of imitators who dominated English departments well into the 1960s."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/warren/life.htm] Bohner, Charles, "Robert Penn Warren's Life and Career", accessed February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Even those who are highly critical of the textbook's approach to poetry have acknowledged the reach and influence of the volume. Poet [[Ron Silliman]] has called it "the hegemonic poetry textbook of the period."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epoetry.org/issues/issue4/text/prose/silliman1.htm] Silliman, Ron, "The Desert Modernism", article in ''The Electronic Poetry Review'', accessed February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Warren's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "''Understanding Poetry'' and ''Understanding Fiction'', which he wrote with Mr. Brooks, taught an entire generation how to read a work of literature and helped make the New Criticism dominant in the decade surrounding World War II. It was an approach to criticism that regarded the work at hand as autonomous, as an artifact whose structure and substance could be analyzed without respect to social, biographical and political details."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/09/reviews/warren-obituary.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin]"Robert Penn Warren, Poet and Author, Dies", obituary article, no byline noted on New York Times Web page, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 16, 1989, page 1, accessed February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', Harold B. Sween said: "Among the rank and file of university faculty in the English-speaking world, few works of this century have gained the influence of two of his [Brooks'] textbooks written in collaboration with Warren, Understanding Poetry (1938) and Understanding Fiction (1943). They revolutionized the teaching of literature in thousands of classrooms for 25 years. . .Brooks and Warren gained universal recognition for changing the focus of reading poetry (and fiction).'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1998/winter/sween-cleanth-brooks-courtly/] Sween, Harold B., "Cleanth Brooks: Courtly Enigma", a review of ''Cleanth Brooks and the Rise of Modern Criticism'', by Mark Royden Winchell, in ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]], Winter 1998, accessed February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
These contents refer to the third edition (1960), which may differ in some respects, particularly in poems used as examples, from other editions.

===Preface===
{{cquote|Poetry gives us knowledge. It is a knowledge of ourselves in relation to the world of experience, and to that world considered, not statistically, but in terms of human purposes and values.}}
&amp;mdash; '''''from the Preface'''''

Poetry is inherently "dramatic," the authors say, defining dramatic as something concrete which involves a process and a conflict in an effort to find meaning. There are other ways to think of poetry other than as knowledge, the authors concede, but that is "the assumption behind this book."

Poems should not be thought of as carrying messages or statements that can be translated more concisely or exactly in prose. Instead, the reader must "surrender to" the impact of the poem as a whole, which includes comprehending the form of the poem. In fact, the kind of knowledge that poetry gives readers can be comprehended "only through form." Readers should carefully observe the human events, images, rhythms, and statements of the poem.

Context is also important. The form of a poem is a person's attempt to deal with a certain problem, "poetic and personal." Poems are written within a historical and cultural context, and the reader also has a context and needs to understand the "dramatic implications of the form."

====Preface in the third edition====
For the third edition, the authors add in the preface (in a section dated January 24, 1960) that the introductions to the several sections have been expanded, some discussions from the previous edition have been dropped and others added. The exercises have been changed and expanded; selections of poems have been changed to better represent some periods; two appendices have been dropped ("Ambiguity, Added Dimension, and Submerged Metaphor" and "the Poem Viewed in Wider Perspective"), with much of their material put into the exercises and discussions; "How Poems Come About: Intention and Meaning" has been revised, with new material added; Section VII, "Poems for Study" has turned into an anthology, although not a systematic survey, of modern poetry.

===Introduction===
People communicate not just to convey information for businesslike practical reasons, they also convey feelings and attitudes. Telling a joke, passing the time in conversation and greeting old friends are some examples, and poetry is another. Some propositions &amp;mdash; including many involving values, emotions, feelings, attitudes and judgments &amp;mdash; can't be conveyed  through communicating practical information or with scientific precision. Like science, literature (and especially poetry) uses a specialized language for the purposes of precision in matters different from science.

In ordinary life, people must deal with forms of communication that use some of the methods of poetry, including editorials, sermons, political speeches, advertisements and magazine articles. Yet when approaching poems, many people confuse practical or "scientific" kinds of communication with poetic communication, sometimes as a way of justifying their interest in poetry, and so fall into certain mistakes.

One mistake is "message-hunting" &amp;mdash; looking only for a profitable statement or idea in a poem. A short prose statement can work better than a poem for communicating advice. Something else is at work in poetry.

Another mistake is thinking that poetry deals only with emotion or sensation, or even thinking that poetry can express an emotion such as grief the way tears would express it, or bring up the emotion in the reader. But poetry can never do that as well as real experience, the authors say, and a poem, such as [[John Keats|Keats']] ''Ode to a Nightingale'', used as an example here, may really convey the poet's interpretation of an experience.

A third common mistake is an attempt to mechanically combine the first two, defining poetry as the "beautiful statement of some high truth", or "truth" with "decorations". This mistake can lead to thinking of poems as collections of pretty language pleasing for its associations with pleasant things. But even Shakespeare and Milton wrote fine passages bringing up unpleasant and disagreeable associations. The things represented don't themselves shape the poetic effect, which depends on the "kind of use the poet makes of them."

These mistakes look at poems in a mechanical way rather than in an organic way in which the elements (such as meter, rhyme, figurative language, along with attitude and emotion) need to be understood to be acting in a fundamental, intimate, organic way with each other.

The introduction also states (but doesn't develop the thought )that poems are inherently dramatic, with an implied speaker who reacts to a situation, scene or idea.

==="I. Narrative Poems"===
In a "Foreword" introducing discussions of individual poems, the authors say that poetry takes the general human interest that people have in other people (expressed at other times in news articles about such things as outlaws, lovers killing lovers or other tragedies, to cite some examples) and put into a form "that preserves it" even after initial curiosity wanes.

Poems that tell a story use the reader's natural curiosity about how a story will turn out (the most obvious way we become interested in literature), although readers or listeners who know the ending still enjoy the poems. The story element can be prominent, as in [who?] "Frankie and Johnny" or much less prominent, as in [[Robert Frost|Robert Frost's]], "Out, Out". Narrative is a way for the poet to provoke certain emotional reactions and ideas in readers.

Using the ballad "Johnie Armstrong" as an example, the authors show how a narrative poem, far more than a novel or even a short story, will use bare "facts" in a dramatic way that gives them an emotional and intellectual meaning, whether or not the reader or listener has analyzed those or other elements. Poems are more concentrated or "closely" organized than prose in that they tend to present concentrated, sharper selected details in a concentrated, carefully arranged way, giving them more "intensity." By presenting concrete, explicit statements (as in "The Wife of Usher's Well"), the poet can convey an emotional impact as well as information, which more abstract language can't do. The reader can also be drawn into a more immediate appreciation of a poem by drawing out ideas from suggestions rather than the poet making explicit statements. Yet not every implication of a poem needs to be understood consciously for a reader to enjoy the work.

The theme of a poem can be properly described (to give a fuller understanding of the poem) without the process becoming "message hunting" if the reader understands that "the poem gives the theme its force", not the other way around.

==="II. Descriptive Poems"===

The poems in this section give readers an impression of some scene or object showing the impression they gave the poet either through his senses or imagination. Conveying fresh, vivid impressions of things is fundamental to good poetry, the authors assert.

Descriptions in poetry are linked closely to our lives and our values, just as narratives are. When a poet describes an object it is separated from its context in the natural world and therefore looks different to the reader. We feel it carries associations, emotional or intellectual or both, that the natural object doesn't. If nothing else, we know that the poet has chosen the object to describe and we wonder why.

==="III. Metrics"===
Rhythmical language in poetry is one of the ways we can see the tendency of poems towards a high degree of organization &amp;mdash; there tends to be far more emphasis on rhythm in poetry than in prose. 

Verse, a specialized form of rhythm in language, is one of the elements that, when related to other elements in a poem, combines to form poetry. Rhythm is often associated with powerful or intense states of emotion, and while poetry is not concerned with only the emotional elements of human experience, it does try to "do justice to" those elements. "[P]oetry is a result of a relationship among various elements and does not ever inhere specially in any single element. It is the fusion of all the elements that counts." (page 152, 3rd edition)

Verse may seem trivial but is a powerful way of "establishing a pervasive impression of unity." Stanza patterns do the same. They reveal a "certain formality" to the text and focus our attention. Since poetry frequently defies common sense, metrical form, in a way, offers the reader hope that the text will ultimately make sense, even that all parts of the poem will ultimately make sense. 

Meter can also be a subtle way for a poet to emphasize and de-emphasize. By occasionally breaking the metrical pattern, the poet can emphasize a word, for example. Certain metrical situations don't automatically produce particular effects &amp;mdash; the use of meter achieves an effect only within the context of sense and feeling. The same is true for stanza forms, which are worth considering only as far as they help produce the particular effect of any given poem. Free verse, with varying line lengths and sometimes little else to distinguish it from prose, uses the particular lengths and line breaks to call attention to particular words or details.

==="IV. Tone"===
In poems, tone is the expression of attitude. Tone is also linked with poetic voice.

==="V. Imagery"===
metaphor
simile
personification

==="VI. Theme: Statement and Idea"===

==="VII. Poems for Study"===
Poems are simply presented here without "critical apparatus" directing the student. The poems are meant to be modern (although, in the third edition at least, the authors recognize that it's a stretch to include [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]). With poets who are relatively recent and mostly still living, the works come from the same world as the student. The poems are put in "natural groupings" for convenience, although other groupings of the same poems could also be made.

==="VIII. How Poems Come About: Intention and Meaning"===
The poem itself is what's important to the reader, but knowing something about the origin of a poem may help us better understand and appreciate it and poetry in general. Understanding the cultural context of a work of literature is also vital.

[[File:Casket b and w.jpg|thumb|Front view of the Uttoxeter casket]]
The '''Uttoxeter Casket''', also known as '''Philip Nelson's Casket''', is an [[Anglo Saxon]] [[reliquary]] from [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]] in the United Kingdom. As of 2017, it is held at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in [[Ohio]], USA. 
House-shaped and carved from a single piece of [[boxwood]], it remains the only known surviving wood carving with such an elaborate iconographic programme from this period of British history.

==History==
The lid of the box was found at a cottage near [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]] in the mid-19th century. The Uttoxeter historian Francis Redfern in his ''History of the Town of Uttoxeter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redfern|first1=Francis|title=The History of the Town of Uttoxeter|date=1850|publisher=J Russell Smith, London}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in the 1850s mentions that at Croxden “''A curious carved oak panel of Jesus and the Twelve Apostles has lately come to light, and been a subject of discussion at a meeting of a brotherhood of antiquaries at Manchester''.”

The ruined [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[Croxden Abbey]] as the largest religious building in the locality, would be the most logical source of such an object. The box might have been pillaged or hidden at the time of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] when Croxden Abbey surrendered to the Crown in 1538.

In 1936, the lid, which had first been re-discovered in Uttoxeter eight decades earlier, entered the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) for an opinion. It was by this time owned by the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Hammersmith (London). 
A Liverpool collector and specialist, Philip Nelson (1872–1953), had purchased the bottom piece in 1921 from a private owner in [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]], for the sum of £175.  Nelson was a man of independent means who devoted much of his energy and resources to antiquarian pursuits. He was well known in numismatic circles for a number of publications.
The lid came to Nelson's attention and it was realised that the two wooden items belonged together. Nelson convinced the convent to sell the lid to him for £120. The box and its lid were reunited for the first time in at least a century and possibly much longer.

Nelson lent the box to the V&amp;A where it remained on exhibit from 1937 until his death in 1953.  He published an article on it in the academic publication ''[[Archaeologia (London)|Archaeologia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Philip|title=IV.—An Ancient Box-Wood Casket|journal=Archaeologia|date=January 1937|volume=86|pages=91–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1937.  After Nelson's death the reliquary was sold to an American dealer, and subsequently to The Cleveland Museum of Art.

==Description==
The casket is a rare, possibly unique, example of high-quality Anglo Saxon wood carving, dating from c. 1050. It is decorated with scenes from Christ's life. On one long side, the Christ child rests in the manger. Above, the Crucifixion is shown with mourners gathered below the cross and two angels flanking it on either side. On the other long side is the Ascension, God's hand pulling Christ heavenward. Christ in Majesty appears above. The short sides show Christ’s  entry into Jerusalem and the other his baptism though it is possibly first bath at the hands of the Emea (midwife) and [[Salome]]. It has a similar design influence to the [[Hereford Gospels]] and Troper, where the figures are said to resemble one another stylistically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Backhouse |first1=Janet |author1-link=Janet Backhouse |last2=Turner |first2=D.H. |author2-link=D. H. Turner |last3=Webster |first3=Leslie |author3-link=Leslie Webster (art historian) |title=The Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art|publisher=British Museum Press|isbn=0714105325|edition=First Edition (26 Nov. 1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The box measures 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;in) in length, 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm (2¾&amp;nbsp;in) in width, and has a total height of 8.5&amp;nbsp;cm (3½&amp;nbsp;in). It is missing its lock and one hinge. The remaining hinge is made from a copper alloy.
This type of portable house-shrine was based on the earliest classical form of full-sized [[feretory]] or sarcophagus, aptly denominated by early medieval witnesses as a domunculus
– or domuncula as in Bede – i.e. ‘little house’ – or even tugurium ‘hut’, which in the case of St Chad’s shrine alluded to by Bede was made of wood rather than stone.
The portable form, suitable for displaying on an altar, is well represented in Anglo-Saxon art by the hip-roofed Uttoxeter casket.

[[Catherine Karkov]], in her book ''The Art of Anglo Saxon England'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karkov|first1=Catherine|title=The Art of Anglo Saxon England|publisher=Boydell|isbn=1783270950|pages=348|edition=Reprint edition (17 Mar. 2016)}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that if the box is a reliquary, the way in which the figure of Christ appears centrally suggests it may have held a relic from one of the events of Christ’s life. As the box is made of wood, a piece of the [[True Cross]] would have been especially appropriate.

'''''Yusuf Khan and Sherbano''''' is a famous [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] amorous [[Folklore|folktale]]. Its format is an extended narrative described as ''qissa'' or ''dastan'', and is listed along with ''[[Adam Khan and Durkhanai]]'', ''Ramadad Khan'' and ''Ajab Khan'' as important Pashto ''dastan'' which are available as [[chapbooks]] or in audio formats.&lt;ref&gt;Hanaway, William L. "Dastan" in Claus, Peter J., Sarah Diamond, and Margaret Ann Mills. South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003. p143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaan2011"/&gt;

A famous version of the story was put to verse by poet [[Ali Haydar Joshi]] (Joshi was a pen name) in the 1960s and was turned into a film, ''[[Yousuf Khan Sher Bano]]'', released in 1969. The poem was translated into French by Benedict Johnson (in 1982) and into English by Heston and Nasir (in 1988). The story is transmitted by ''qissa-khwans'', a term usually translated as "storytellers" who "say" or "sing" (''Wayel'') the verses. Joshi's account of the origin of the material is that he found a manuscript containing the story written in [[Persian language|Persian]] at a local fair wrapped around some medicine. He returned to the seller and got more of the manuscript.&lt;ref name="Heston1994"&gt;Heston, Wilma L. ''Footpath Poets of Peshawar''. in Appadurai, Arjun, Frank J. Korom, and Margaret Ann Mills. Gender, genre, and power in South Asian expressive traditions. Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1994. p310-311, 326-327&lt;/ref&gt; Joshi's account is given in a Lok Virsa tape recorded by Mumtaz Nasir in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Heston, W. L. "Verse Narrative from the Bazaar of the Storytellers." Asian folklore studies (1986): 79-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has supernatural elements, such as five holy men (''pirs'') who give the heroine the ability to travel large distance in thirty steps, [[jinn]]s who bring a woman and a bed to a mosque at night for the pleasure of a [[yogi]]. These elements suggest an influence to the story from outside [[Pathan]] culture. However, the social structures in the story, particularly the use as villains of paternal male cousins is typical to Pathan stories, and many Pathans of various social classes identify the story as one of their own, according to ethnologist Wilma L. Heston.&lt;ref name="Heston1994"/&gt;

==Film==

A film version of ''[[Yousuf Khan Sher Bano]]'' was produced by Nazir Hussain.1st Evergreen Pashto Movie Yousaf khan sherbano...Aziz Tabussam was the director of the film as shown in the film title but it is said he was basically hired as Pakhtoon translator where as the film actually directed by the Nazir hussain the producer of the film.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}
