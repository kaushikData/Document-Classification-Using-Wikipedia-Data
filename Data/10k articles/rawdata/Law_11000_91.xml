The '''Australian Digital Alliance''' ('''ADA''') is an [[Australia]]n [[non-profit]] coalition of public and private sector interests, formed to promote balanced [[copyright law]] by providing a voice for the public interest perspective in debates about copyright change and reform. The ADA engages with government through submissions, lobbying, and media activities.

The ADA works closely with its sister organisation, the [[Australian Libraries Copyright Committee]] (ALCC). The ALCC is the main consultative body and policy forum for the discussion of copyright issues affecting Australian libraries. It develops policy and advocates action appropriate for the role of libraries as information providers and preservers in Australia. The two bodies share a copyright adviser, and generally make joint submissions to government.

== IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009)   ==
The [[Nine Network]] sued [[IceTV]] for copyright infringement after IceTV used parts of Nine Network’s programme schedules for its electronic program guide. The case raised questions about the threshold of the originality requirement for copyright, and the nature of the protection for compilations (collections of facts) in Australia.

The ADA was granted leave by the [[High Court of Australia]] to intervene as a [[Amicus curiae|friend of the court]]. The ADA’s submissions outlined the importance of public interest considerations and the implications that this case could have on copyright users.

The High Court found in favour of IceTV, with the joint judgment of [[William Gummow|Gummow]], [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]] and [[Dyson Heydon|Heydon]] making reference to the ADA’s submissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2009/14.html ''IceTV Pty Limited v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[2009]&lt;/nowiki&gt; HCA 14].&lt;/ref&gt;  The High Court recognised the importance of maintaining a robust public domain which allows people and organisations to use, re-use and build on materials to produce innovative new works.

== ''A User’s Guide to the Flexible Dealing Provision'' ==

Together with the ALCC, the ADA produced a handbook on the new flexible dealing provision of the [[Australian copyright law|Copyright Act]] ([http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s200ab.html section 200AB]). The handbook outlines how the provision operates and provides examples to assist libraries, archives, galleries and educational institutions to take advantage of the provision and use copyright materials.

The formal launch of the handbook was attended by ADA members, senior public servants, and other copyright figures. The [http://digital.org.au/sites/digital.org.au/files/documents/Flexible%20Dealing%20Handbook%20final.pdf Flexible Dealing Handbook] is available for free download under [[Creative Commons]] license.

== Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ==

Significantly increased intermediary responsibility, among other things, is currently the subject of negotiations in the proposed [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA). The ADA encouraged greater transparency by the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (DFAT) regarding the progress of its negotiations.

The ADA formed a coalition with other concerned organisations including [[Australian Consumers' Association|Choice]], the [[Australian Library and Information Association]], and the [[Internet Industry Association]]. The coalition was involved in a number of government meetings, and submitted a joint statement of [http://digital.org.au/sites/digital.org.au/files/documents/PrinciplesforACTAnegotiations.pdf principles for ACTA negotiations] to DFAT.

The submission agreed that reducing counterfeiting is important where it endangers consumer health or safety, or constitutes commercial scale infringement. However, the coalition urged that pursuit of that goal should not threaten legitimate commercial, social, innovative and creative activities, the rights of consumers or the free flow of information. The coalition noted the current proposed treaty raised concerns with respect to transparency, increased customs search powers, increased penalties for IP infringement, and lack of due process.

{{italic title}}
{{inline|date=November 2018}}
The '''''Basilika''''' was a collection of laws completed c. 892 AD in [[Constantinople]] by order of the [[Byzantine]] Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] during the [[Macedonian dynasty]]. This was a continuation of the efforts of his father, [[Basil I]], to simplify and adapt the Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' code of law issued between 529 and 534 which had become outdated. The term "Basilika" comes not from the Emperor Basil's name, but rather from  {{lang-el|τὰ βασιλικά}} meaning "Royal Laws".

==Background==
Many changes had taken place within the [[Byzantine Empire]] in between [[Justinian I|Justinian]] and [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]]'s reign, chiefly the change in language. During Justinian's era, [[Latin]] was still in common use and Court documents were written in it. However, by the 9th century the use of Latin was obsolete, which in turn made the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' code hard to use for Greek speakers. Furthermore, many of the laws within the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' no longer pertained to most people, and new laws rose up to take their place. This necessitated an overhaul of the Byzantine legal system. ''[[Code of Justinian|Justinian's Codex]]'' had effectively ended juristic developments for the next couple of centuries. Moreover, the Byzantine legal system operated as a codified system, wherein the sentence given by a judge needed to be grounded in a passage of law previously issued by a legislator. This made it impossible for a judge to set precedents. There was vast confusion amongst judges as to which legal documents they should refer to (''Justinian's Codex'' or other books of law which had been written in the ensuing centuries). Additionally, ''Justinian's Codex'' had officially stripped the legislative branch of its authority, making it hard for judges to know which law codes they should adhere to. With a code of law in Greek, lawyers were able to use it in their cases, making its practicality invaluable. This was a stark contrast to the ''Corpus Juris'', which proved to be too complex and comprehensive to be used practicably even within its own time.

The ''Basilika'' also presents itself as a connection back to earlier times before the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]], lending the [[Macedonian dynasty]] a sense of religious legitimacy. This began with [[Basil I]] and his desire to distance himself from the Iconoclasts, and to connect himself and his sons with their Great Predecessor, Justinian I.

==Structure of the ''Basilika''==
The sixty books of the ''Basilika'' have had a profound impact on the scholarship of the Byzantine Empire because they preserved many legal documents. Within the sixty books of law, in addition to the preservation of ''Justinian's Codex'', new legal customs were also included which had evolved in the centuries. It also included works of law initiated by Basil I, including the ''Prochiron'' (a handbook of civil laws and customs which excluded those no longer in use) and the ''[[Epanagoge]]'' (an expanded ''Prochiron'' which included an introduction and summary) as well as numerous decrees of the Iconoclast Emperors. However, the Code still followed the tradition of the ''Corpus Juris'', beginning with ecclesiastical law, sources of law, procedure, private law, administrative law, and criminal law.

It greatly differed however in its use of commentaries ([[scholia]]), which were pieces of juristic works from the sixth and seventh centuries as well as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Previously, Justinian I had outlawed commentary on his set of laws, making the scholia on the ''Basilika'' unique. The actual format of the books themselves vary greatly. Some are represented in one manuscript, which may or may not contain scholia or full parts of other juristic works which have been mentioned. Likewise, some books have been lost entirely.

==Implications of the ''Basilika''==
Unlike Justinian's Codex which continued to have an impact in the West as the continuation of [[Roman Law]], the ''Basilika'''s influence was limited to the Eastern Empire. This included having a lasting impact on Greece's modern law code. Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] against Turkey in 1821, the ''Basilika'' was adopted for thirteen years before the present Civil Code of Greece (''Hexabiblos'') was adopted. This long continuation of Roman influenced Byzantine law presents a stark contrast to the legal system of the West.

It is a partial online database of British and Irish legislation, case law, law reform reports, treaties and some legal scholarship.&lt;ref name="University of Strathclyde - Legal Research Skills -  BAILII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/Blog/tabid/3585/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/98/British-and-Irish-Legal-Information-Institute--BAILII-Website-of-the-Week.aspx|title=British and Irish Legal Information Institute - BAILII - Website of the Week|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621080240/http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/Blog/tabid/3585/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/98/British-and-Irish-Legal-Information-Institute--BAILII-Website-of-the-Week.aspx#|archive-date=21 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BAILII - About BAILII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/bailii/|title= About BAILII|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|Law report|Case citation}}
Traditionally, legal information was accessible through a [[law report]], usually written by private individuals or groups. While court judgments have had official reports more recently, historically a court judgment would simply be spoken, and so publication of the precedents built up depended on their record by interested third parties. The [[Year Books]], which recorded judgments from 1268 to 1535, were probably compiled by law students. Other people, like the judge [[Sir Edward Coke]] from 1572 to 1615, then created their own series of reports. These would not necessarily be an accurate record of what was said. What was recorded might have been selective, or inaccurate. As the reporting industry developed, more people became involved and specialised in particular areas of law. The [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting]] was created in 1885, and released copies of various cases. There still could be gaps in reporting however. With the advent of the Internet, it was possible to access multiple databases for a fee online, particularly [[Westlaw]] or [[LexisNexis|Lexis]]. However a freely available source had not yet been made.

BAILII was set up after a long and hard campaign by various activists including senior members of the Society for Computers &amp; Law, such as then-Chairman Neil Cameron, barrister [[Laurie West-Knights QC]], Lord Saville and [[Henry Brooke (judge)|Lord Justice Brooke]], who were concerned about the lack of availability of court judgments to ordinary court users and were inspired by the [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]] (AustLII) LII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Valedictory Address for Lord Justice Brooke |division=Civ| court=EWCA|year=2006|num=B1|date=2006-08-16}}(see ¶ 18)&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to provide free access to publicly available legal information.&lt;ref name="University of Strathclyde - Legal Research Skills -  BAILII"/&gt; In 2006, BAILII included 5 [[jurisdiction]]s' fourteen databases.&lt;ref name="University of Leicester - Library - BAILII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/li/digital/BritishandIrishLegalInformationInstituteBAILII.html|title=BAILII (British and Irish Legal Information Institute)|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622061951/http://www.le.ac.uk/li/digital/BritishandIrishLegalInformationInstituteBAILII.html#|archive-date=22 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

BAILII has received criticisms due to the restrictions it imposes on its usage: in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, it was noted that BAILII had "done a wonderful job of making case law freely accessible to lawyers", including "historic and European data that is otherwise very difficult to find." However, it was also noted that as a small charity the service "struggles to afford to host its 297,000 judgments, and does not allow search engines to index them. In some instances it is not even clear whether the crown or the judge concerned holds the [[copyright]] to the words, and reproducing them on any other site is forbidden." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web&lt;!--|title=Guardian article discussing BAILII--&gt;|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/25/criminal-justice-uk-digital-database|title=Courts: judgement day|work=The Guardian|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is an editorial... --&gt;

An organization known as Judgmental had been established to scrape information from BAILII and make it indexable by search engines. Founding members of Judgmental included [[Francis Irving]], one of the developers of [[TheyWorkForYou]].&lt;ref name="judgemental-home-page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgemental Home Page|url=http://judgmental.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729164453/http://judgmental.org.uk/|archive-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgmental shut down under threat of legal action regarding the court records for a libel case.&lt;ref name="judgmental-libel-github"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic judgmental page on github |url=https://github.com/frabcus/judgmental/blob/da575486c39821d00c11662e56e89d83660810a7/public_html/brb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{better source|date=September 2016}}

Former BAILII chairman [[Henry Brooke (judge)|Henry Brooke]] defended criticisms, stating that the restrictions on indexing were to ensure that records could be retroactively edited or removed for clerical or legal reasons, such as errors, information that was not authorized to be published, or records that have not been properly anonymized. Brooke went on to explain that BAILII "[does] not consider that taking the extra step of making the judgments searchable, using Google or other search engines, is necessary in order to achieve the primary objective of making judgments of the courts freely available to the public." He also stated that the restriction on redistribution was to protect its "value-added content", such as "converting it into a suitable format and making efforts to prevent the publication of material that must not be published."&lt;ref name="scl-judgementday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgment Day for BAILII|url=http://www.scl.org/site.aspx?i=ed22972|publisher=SCL - The IT Law Community|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to case law ==

Much of the material available on BAILII is duplicated elsewhere, for example legislation and rulings of some courts (such as the Supreme Court). BAILII has an agreement with the Ministry of Justice indemnifying it from some legal prosecutions.&lt;ref name="scl-judgementday"/&gt; BAILII has historically received payment as part of this contract. In the 2010/2011 tax year BAILII received {{Currency|35468|GBP}} as part of this contract.&lt;ref name="bailii-contract-foi"&gt;{{cite web|title=FOI request regarding BAILII's contract with the Ministry of justice|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/73838/response/189463/attach/html/3/FOI%2070820%20Mark%20Goodge%20response%20290611.doc.html|publisher=What to they know}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The CBS/Fox Company''', or '''CBS/Fox Video''' was a [[home video]] entertainment company formed and established in June 1982, as a merger between [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century-Fox Video]], (formerly [[Magnetic Video]] Corporation), and [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]] which sold film libraries from major American film studios and was the North American licensee of [[2 Entertain|BBC Video]] releases. These products were released in the [[VHS]], Laserdisc, and [[Betamax]] home video formats.

The company was based in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] (home of its predecessor Magnetic Video) until 1985, when it moved to [[Livonia, Michigan]]. In 1989, it moved its headquarters to [[New York City]], where it stayed until it became Fox Video (now [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]) in 1991.

CBS/Fox Video was founded under a 50-50 venture with [[20th Century Fox]] in 1982 when CBS broke off a previous venture formed in 1980 with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]. During this period, both companies continued to operate independently while maintaining their partnership. A reorganization occurred in 1990 with CBS selling products under the '''CBS Video''' name (which had been sparingly used since the 1970s) and mainstream Fox titles being controlled by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|FoxVideo]]; the change was enacted in 1991. In the early 2000s, CBS/Fox ceased operations. Since CBS/Fox disbanded, their film rights have been brought by 20th Century Fox and CBS merged with [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]].

== History ==

=== Video rental library ===
Before CBS/Fox Video existed, 20th Century Fox Video released a select few titles for rental only, including ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', ''[[Rocky]]'', ''[[Taps (film)|Taps]]'', ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. While sale tapes were in big boxes that were later used by CBS/Fox in its early years, Video Rental Library tapes were packaged in black clamshell cases. Similar approaches were taken by [[Fotomat]], [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]], [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]], [[Warner Home Video]], and MGM/CBS Home Video around that time.

FoxVideo, Inc. was the home video arm of [[20th Century Fox]] that replaced CBS/Fox Video, which was founded in 1982 after CBS Home Video left MGM Home Video (MGM/CBS Home Video from 1979 to 1982) when [[United Artists]] merged with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1981 to form MGM/UA Entertainment Co. (1981–1986, renamed MGM/UA Communications Co. in 1986 after ending that year's only deal with [[Turner Broadcasting System]]) and [[MGM Home Entertainment|its video arm]].

In 1982, CBS formed a 50-50 venture with 20th Century Fox after [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] broke off a joint venture with CBS, that was agreed in 1980, to market videocassettes and videodiscs.&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=cbs+fox+video+1982#v=onepage&amp;q=cbs%20fox%20video%201982&amp;f=false|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|last=Rudie Harrigan|first=Kathryn|publisher=Beard Books|year=1985|isbn=978-1-58798-195-1|location=|page=173|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was publicly announced on June 18, 1982, where they announced CBS's 40-acre film and production facility in Studio City, California would be operated by both companies.&lt;ref name="cf" /&gt; In the process, CBS and Fox continued to independently supply programs for the home video market, while CBS/Fox supplied films from motion picture studios.&lt;ref name=venture /&gt;

In 1985, CBS/Fox became the American licensee of [[BBC]] Video products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS-Fox Video|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/03/business/cbs-fox-video.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS/Fox brought large amounts of film libraries such as the [[United Artists]] films. The library brought consisted mainly of pre-MGM merger titles (although at the time, MGM holds the video rights to some pre-merger films that are not yet released on video), films from the [[James Bond]] and [[Rocky]] series, although the post-merger Bond and Rocky [[1980s]] sequels were released by CBS/Fox as well, and some low profile post-merger films under license from MGM/UA. These UA films were later issued through MGM/UA Home Video (now, [[MGM Home Entertainment]]) starting in 1989 (although Fox would later release the post-April 1986 MGM library years later). CBS/Fox also secured rights from [[George Lucas]] for the video release of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' for $12 million on August 30, 1984. Lucas claimed the deal was to prevent the film from being broadcast on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home Video Rights Sold To 'Empire Strikes Back'|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LH&amp;s_site=kentucky&amp;p_multi=LH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7370637CEC4D0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=Lexington Herald Leader | date=August 31, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ecw8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vi4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3601,3847529&amp;dq=home+video+rights+sold+to+empire+strikes+back&amp;hl=en|title=Home Video Right to 'Empire' Sold|date=August 31, 1984|newspaper=The Press Courier|access-date=March 30, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no|agency=Associated Press|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, CBS and 20th Century Fox secured a financial package that saw both companies generate between $75 and $100 million. The deal also included the offering of bonds with the investment firm [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]].&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-02/business/fi-24127_1_financing-package|title=CBS, Fox Discussing Financing Package for Video Partnership|last=Harris|first=Kathryn|date=March 2, 1985|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 30, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 1987, CBS/Fox's home video rights to the [[Associated Artists Productions|a.a.p.]] library reverted to [[Ted Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Chris (December 26, 1987). "Colorful Home Vid Co. for Turner?" ''Billboard'' (p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the a.a.p. and pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries were purchased by Turner after its short-lived ownership of MGM/UA, which resulted in the formation of [[Turner Entertainment]] Co. In 1987, the company increased its rights from BBC Video after buying the rights to 600 broadcasts. When asked about how the agreement came to light, then-CBS/Fox president Leonard White said "The deal is timed to coincide with the BBC's 50th anniversary".&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-17/entertainment/8701290500_1_akai-monty-python-troupe-bbc-video|title=CBS-Fox Video Buys Rights To 600 British Broadcasts|date=April 17, 1987|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=March 30, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month of the announcement, CBS/Fox released a definitive line-up of films named "Five Star Collection IV" which included 28 films. Such films included ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'', ''[[Cat's Eye (1985 film)|Cat's Eye]]'' and ''[[Oxford Blues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-05-01/entertainment/8702020767_1_omen-cannon-video-ipcress-file|title=CBS/Fox Video Continues Lowered Prices With 28 Titles|last=Stevens|first=Mary|date=May 1, 1987|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=March 30, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, CBS/Fox lost the home video rights to the Lorimar library to [[Warner Home Video]], after [[Warner Communications]] (which merged with [[Time Inc.]] that year to form [[Time Warner]]) purchased Lorimar. In November of that year, the company filed a lawsuit against MGM/UA over a video distribution agreement that was broken. The claim was that CBS/Fox lost revenue after video releases ended up being films that did not perform well in cinemas while MGM/UA distributed higher-grossing films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-17/business/fi-1657_1_home-video-distribution|title=CBS/Fox Suing MGM/UA Over Video Distribution Pact|last=Sanchez|first=Jesus|date=November 17, 1989|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 30, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies were placed in a bad relationship since 1981 when MGM/UA brought United Artists which created its own video subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/17/business/the-media-business-cbs-fox-sues-mgm-ua.html|title=The Media Business; CBS/Fox Sues MGM/UA|date=November 17, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 30, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled on June 26, 1992, when both companies resolved their differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS/FOX, METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER RESOLVE PENDING LITIGATION|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CBS%2fFOX%2c+METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER+RESOLVE+PENDING+LITIGATION-a012282034|newspaper=PR Newswire|date=June 26, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1990s ===

In 1990–1991, CBS/Fox began releasing titles from the then bankrupt [[Media Home Entertainment]]. At the end of 1990, CBS/Fox reported they controlled 6.5% of the home video market and reported revenues of $249 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-23/business/fi-564_1_joint-venture|title=CBS May Reduce Role in Fox Video Venture|last=Lippman|first=John|date=January 23, 1991|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=March 30, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1991, a reorganization of the company was made, which would give Fox greater control of the joint venture. All of CBS/Fox's distribution functions were transferred to the newly formed [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|FoxVideo]], which would also take over exclusive distribution to all 20th Century Fox products. CBS began releasing their products under the "CBS Video" name, with CBS/Fox handing marketing and FoxVideo handling distribution. CBS/Fox would retain the license to non-theatrical products from third parties, including those from BBC Video.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeting, Paul (March 2, 1991). "FoxVideo Born as New Logo in CBS/Fox Shifts." ''Billboard'', pages 1 and 78.

In 1992, [[ABC Sports]] and CBS/Fox agreed to a collaboration that allowed men's fragrance company [[Drakkar Noir]] to promote their products on a nationwide scale on television. The advertisements cost Drakkar Noir in excess of $1.3 million, which included footage from ABC's ''The Thrill of Victory'' and CBS/Fox's ''[[The Agony of Defeat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Sports Video and CBS/Fox Video Sports team up with Men's Fragance Drakkar Noir|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ABC+SPORTS+VIDEO+AND+CBS%2FFOX+VIDEO+SPORTS+TEAM+UP+WITH+MEN'S...-a012171399|newspaper=PR Newswire Association|date=April 27, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, CBS/Fox broadened its appeal to include gay audiences with the release of ''[[The Lost Language of Cranes (film)|The Lost Language of Cranes]]'', a BBC production that was shown on [[PBS]] in 1992. Video rental stores took advantage of a gay and lesbian audience, which was a small demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/01/movies/home-video-244593.html|title=Home Video|last=Nicols|first=Peter|date=April 1, 1993|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 30, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, CBS/Fox secured a 10-year agreement that would allow the company to distribute On Ice's Inc. production of ''Nutcracker on Ice'' that was aired by [[NBC]] on January 1, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beachport's on ice signs agreements with NBC and CBS/Fox Video|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beachport's+on+ice+signs+agreements+with+NBC+and+CBS%2fFox+Video.-a017648395|newspaper=Business Wire|date=October 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The end of CBS/Fox Video ===
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment was founded in 1995. Fox then had 3 video arms during that era. In 1998, CBS/Fox Video folded into [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (CBS and [[Viacom (original)|the original Viacom]] had merged in 1970. [[Paramount Pictures]] was also a division of [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf + Western]] [renamed Paramount Communications in 1989] from 1966–1994. Since Viacom bought Paramount in 1994, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] distributed CBS Home Entertainment titles), FVI, and TCFHE. FVI eventually folded into TCFHE in 1999.

In early 1998, [[Fox Entertainment Group]] (then-owned by [[News Corporation]]) acquired CBS/Fox Video and the rest of CBS/Fox's non-shopping (film and TV) assets, and renamed CBS/Fox Video to [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].

In May 1998, CBS/Fox released ''[[FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue]]'' and ''[[Our Friend, Martin]]''. In 2000, CBS's merger with [[Viacom]] was finalized, and the CBS/Fox partnership ceased existence, although even after the corporate split CBS/Fox did still own some ancillary rights to two [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] film properties, ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', until 20th Century Fox was able to fully assume CBS/Fox's former share of these films. The BBC's license with CBS/Fox ended in Summer 2000 and [[Warner Home Video]] took over distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-g8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=cbs/fox+walking+with+dinosaurs#v=onepage&amp;q=cbs%252Ffox%2520walking%2520with%2520dinosaurs&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=|first=|date=2000-07-15|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialty labels==
CBS/Fox used specialty labels for children's and family's videos, music videos, and sports videos. In addition to its main CBS/Fox label, which was mostly [[A-list]] fare, (although the three ''[[Porky's]]'', first ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]'' (1984) and first two ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' (1984 &amp; 1987) movies with their low budgets and concepts and mostly young or unknown casts were also released on it), CBS/Fox maintained two other labels, '''[[Key Video]]''' (mostly [[B-film|B]] and [[drive-in]] fare and some [[made for television]] films, plus some of the a.a.p./United Artists back catalogue and low-profile TriStar, MGM/UA and Fox releases); and '''[[Playhouse Video]]''' (children's and family films and programs, including ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' 1968-1973 films, [[Shirley Temple]]'s films, [[Muppet|The Muppets]] videos, [[Mr. Rogers]] videos, and [[Dr. Seuss]] specials by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]]); this label was also used on the earliest ''Doctor Who'' VHS releases. These became inactive by 1991, though 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment reactivated the Key Video label as '''Key DVD'''.

==Anti-piracy measures==
In the attempt to prevent unauthorized tape duplication, CBS/Fox became an early adopter of [[Macrovision]] anti-piracy technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/arts/video-tanglesin-the-anti-copying-thicket.html|title=Video; Tanglesin the Anti-Copying Ticket|last=Fantel|first=Hans|work=New York Times|date=August 30, 1987|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries such as Australia, the company introduced a colored spine that was either yellow or blue on VHS tapes. On Betamax cassettes, a polarized seal was present. These measures were taken to ensure that consumers would be guaranteed that their products were of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGCJ7qYI48E&amp;feature=related|title=Home Video Anti Piracy Advices - Redux [Australia]|work=YouTube|time=02:14-03:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charter 97''' ({{lang-be|Хартыя'97}}; {{lang-ru|Хартия'97}}) is a declaration calling for democracy in [[Belarus]] and a pro-[[human rights]] news site taking its inspiration from the declaration. The document – the title of which deliberately echoes the [[Czechoslovak]] human rights declaration [[Charter 77]] 20 years earlier – was created on the anniversary of a [[Belarusian referendum, 1996|referendum held in 1996]], and which, in the words of the organisation of the same name, declares:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"devotion to the principles of independence, freedom and democracy, respect to the human rights, solidarity with everybody, who stands for elimination of dictatorial regime and restoration of democracy in Belarus".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Belarusian journalist [[Pavel Sheremet]] acted as the group's spokesman at the declaration's public launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/29562.stm |title=Belarus government accused of human rights abuses |author= |date=11 November 1997 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter 97, as a citizens' human rights organisation based on the principles outlined in this document, is a non-partisan organisation which has organised protest rallies and has provided a springboard for other democratic movements in the country. It also maintains a website of news with a focus on human rights developments.  The site's editor-in-chief, [[Natalya Radina]], received the 2011 [[CPJ International Press Freedom Award|International Press Freedom Award]], "an annual recognition of courageous journalism", for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/awards/ |title=CPJ International Press Freedom Awards 2011 |year=2011 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2010, the body of the founder of Charter 97, [[Aleh Byabenin]], was found in his house near [[Minsk]]. According to initial statements by the Belarusian government, Bebenin committed suicide by hanging himself. However, friends of Bebenin have rejected this, stating that there was no indication Bebenin was planning to commit suicide, and that there were no messages or notes left behind.

In the weeks following the disputed [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|December 2010 presidential election]] – in which pro-democracy candidate [[Andrei Sannikov]] lost to Lukashenko, often called "Europe's last dictator"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belarus/8214397/Alexander-Lukashenko-Europes-last-dictator.html |title=Alexander Lukashenko: "Europe's last dictator" |author=Andrew Osborn |date=20 December 2010 |work= |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a number of [[2011 Belarusian protests|opposition protesters]] took to the streets, alleging fraud. Radina and the ''Charter 97'' staff posted numerous articles documenting arrests and injuries to the protesters by state security forces.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/world/europe/22belarus.html |title=Clashes in Belarus Show Resilience of Both Sides |author=Michael Schwirtz |date=21 December 2010 |work= |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December 2010, the ''Charter 97'' office was raided by agents of the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (known in Russian as the "KGB"). Radina only had time to post "We're all at the KGB" on the site before being arrested and taken away.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

On 30 December 2011, ''Charter 97'' fell victim to a hacking attack that deleted archives and posted false news articles to the site; it also suffered a [[denial of service]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifex.org/belarus/2011/01/05/khalip_radina_charged/ |title=Pro-opposition news website attacked, shut down |author= |date=30 December 2011 |work= |publisher=IFEX |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Constitution of 1833''' was the constitution used in [[Chile]] from 1833 to 1925 when it was replaced by the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|Constitution of 1925]]. One of the most long-lived constitutions of [[Latin America]] it was used to endorse both an authoritarian presidentialist system and from 1891 onwards an oligarchic parliamentary system. 

The constitution emerged after the [[Chilean Civil War of 1829]] in which the conservative [[Pelucones]] (Whigs) defeated the [[Pipiolos]] (liberals). Its main ideologues where [[Mariano Egaña]], [[Manuel José Gandarillas]] and [[Diego Portales]] all of whom saw from a conservative point of view the necessity of a [[unitarian state]] under a strong leadership. The constitution made [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] the [[state religion]] and forbade the practise of other religions, both in public and private life.&lt;ref&gt;Lagos Schuffeneger, Humberto and Chacón Herrera, Arturo. 1987. ''Los Evangélicos en Chile: Una lectura sociológica.'' Ediciones Literatura Americana Reunida. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The first president to be elected under the constitution was the general [[José Joaquín Prieto]]. The constitution allowed for 5 year terms with the possibility of one reelection which resulted in 3 consecutive conservative presidents ruling Chile each for 10 years. [[Mariano Egaña]] had initially aimed at not putting any restriction on reelection. 

Chilean liberals considered the constitution authoritarian and made attempts to overthrow the government.  During the failed [[Revolution of 1851]] liberals in [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] declared the constitution abolished. After the first liberal 10-year-long government the constitution was amended in 1871 to eliminate reelections.     

After the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] the constitution was amended in 1891, 1892 and 1893, and was interpreted
to endorse a parliamentary system. Chilean historiography refers to this period as the "[[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891–1925)|pseudo-parliamentary epoch]]".

It was not until the turmoils of the 1920s that the constitution was replaced by the [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|Constitution of 1925]].

{{Contract law}}

A '''collateral contract''' is usually a single term [[contract]], made in [[consideration]] of the party for whose benefit the contract operates &lt;!-- i almost inserted a comma here, but i realized at the last minute that the lack of a comma may have been intentional. Ambiguity is better than than an unambiguous error.... right?  ????? --&gt; agreeing to enter into the principal or main contract, which sets out additional terms relating to the same subject matter as the main contract.&lt;ref&gt;Aherns Lawyers, [http://www.ahernslawyers.com.au/latest-news/contracts-collateral-inconsistent/ Contracts Collateral &amp; Inconsistent]&lt;/ref&gt; The collateral contract co-exists side by side.{{vague|reason= gosh, {{sarcasm|IANAL, so does that mean laying them next to each other on the table is ''not'' good enuf? I mean, do they have to be stapled at 3 points, left edge to right edge? Or is top-right-corner to top-left-corner sufficient?}} |date=March 2018}}  For example, a collateral contract is formed when one party pays the other party a certain sum for entry into another contract. A collateral contract may be between one of the parties and a third party.

It can also be epitomized as follows: a collateral contract is one that induces a person to enter into a separate "primary" contract. For example, if X agrees to buy goods from Y that will, accordingly, be manufactured by Z, and does so on the strength of Z's assurance as to the high quality of the goods, X and Z may be held to have made a collateral contract consisting of Z's promise of quality given in consideration of X's promise to enter into the main contract with Y.

== Elements of a valid collateral contract ==
A party to an existing contract may attempt to show that a collateral contract exists if their claim for a breach of contract fails because the statement they relied upon was not held to be a [[Contractual term|term]] of the main contract. It has been held that for this to be successful, the statement must have been promissory in nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''J J Savage &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney'' (1970) 119 CLR 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Remedies may be awarded for breach of a collateral contract.

=== Promissory in nature ===
A collateral contract is one where the parties to one contract enter into or promise to enter into another contract. Thus, the two contracts are connected and it may be enforced even though it forms no constructive part of the original contract.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''[[JJ Savage and Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney]]'' a mere expression of opinion was held insufficient to be satisfied as a promise. In ''[[Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd]]'' a statement by a landlord made to intending tenants when negotiating a lease that they would be “looked after at renewal time”, would not bind the landlord to offer a further five year lease.&lt;ref&gt;Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd [2016] HCA 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intention to induce ===
The promisor must have expressly or impliedly requested about the main contract and his promissory statement must have intended to induce the entry of the other party into the main contract.&lt;ref&gt;JJ Savage &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney (1970) 119 CLR 435.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]], a collateral contract is held binding "when a person gives a promise, or an assurance to another, intending that he should act on it by entering into a contract'.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Sons Ltd v Andrea Merzario Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 1078.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consistency ===
A collateral contract, if forged between the same parties as the main contract, must not contradict the main contract. That is, if the term was agreed upon prior to the completion of the formal contract (but was still included as a term, and could not be executed until completion of the second term), the first term will still be allowed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' (1919) 27 CLR 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the collateral contracts cannot contradict any element of the main contract nor the rights created by it.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' (1919) 27 CLR 133; see also ''Jacobs v Batavia &amp; General Plantations Trust Ltd'' [1924] 1 Ch. 287.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Letter of credit ==
A theory sustains that is feasible to typify [[letter of credit]] as a collateral [[Third-party beneficiary|contract for a third-party beneficiary]] because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application of the theory of [[Jean Domat]] the cause of a letter of credit is that a bank issue a credit in favor of a seller to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller with [[legal tender]]. There are in fact three different entities participating in the letter of credit transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Therefore, a letter of credit theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct, or in other words, an [[implied-in-fact contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2019474 Letter of Credit, its Relation with Stipulation for the Benefit of a Third Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exception to other legal rules ==

=== Privity of contract ===
Collateral contracts are an exception to the [[Privity of contract|privity of contract doctrine]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shanklin Pier Ltd v Detel Products Ltd]]'' (1951) 2 KB 854.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides that a contract cannot impose obligations or confer rights on a non-contracting party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/law/scope-privity.html|title=Australian Contract Law {{!}} Julie Clarke|website=www.australiancontractlaw.com|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in circumstances where a collateral contract is established between a third party and one of the contracting parties, the Court may allow rights or impose obligations on the non-contracting party, as illustrated in the earlier tortious case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parol evidence rule ===
[[Common law]] recognises collateral contract as an exception to [[parol evidence rule]], meaning that admissible evidence of a collateral contract can be used to exclude the operation of the [[parol evidence rule]]. Practically, it is rare to find collateral contract as an exception as it must be strictly proved; and the burden of proof is only eased if the subject matter with which the main contract deals is more unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co v Buckleton [1912] UKHL 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
In the English case of ''[[Barry v Davies]]'', it was held that an auctioneer and a buyer had formed a collateral contract.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Barry v Davies t/as Heathcote Ball &amp; Co'' [2001] 1 All ER 944; [2000] 1 WLR 1962&lt;/ref&gt; It was held that even though the main contract does not involve the auctioneer, benefits given to the auctioneer for increasing the price of a bid constitutes a good consideration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In ''[[Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer]]'', a landlord has promised orally not to exercise the right to termination in the principal contract if tenant signed the contract; landlord ended up terminating the main contract, whereas tenant's appeal was dismissed by the Court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution''', often abbreviated as '''Air Pollution''' or '''CLRTAP''', is intended to protect the human environment against [[air pollution]] and to gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including long-range transboundary air pollution. It is implemented by the [[European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme]] (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).

==Overview==
The convention opened for signature on 1979-11-13 and entered into force on 1983-03-16.

The Convention, which now has 51 Parties, identifies the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) as its secretariat. The current parties to the Convention are shown on the map.

The Convention is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) (short for ''Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe'').&lt;ref&gt;EMEP History and Structure, [http://www.emep.int/index.html EMEP website]&lt;/ref&gt; Results of the EMEP programme are published on the EMEP website, [http://www.emep.int/ www.emep.int].

Since 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants:

* Protocol on Long-Term Financing of the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) (1984)
* [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]]
* [[Nitrogen Oxide Protocol]] (1988)
* [[Volatile Organic Compounds Protocol]] (1991)
* [[1994 Oslo Protocol on Further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]]
* [[Protocol on Heavy Metals]] (1998)
* [[Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (1998)
* [[Multi-effect Protocol|1999 Gothenburg Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone]] (1999)

The aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Parties develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants through exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring.

The Parties meet annually at sessions of the Executive Body to review ongoing work and plan future activities including a workplan for the coming year. The three main subsidiary bodies - the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body to EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review - as well as the Convention's Implementation Committee, report to the Executive Body each year.

Currently, the Convention's priority activities include review and possible revision of its most recent protocols, implementation of the Convention and its protocols across the entire UNECE region (with special focus on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and South-East Europe) and sharing its knowledge and information with other regions of the world.

The '''Convention on the Continental Shelf''' was an [[international treaty]] created to codify the rules of international law relating to [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. The treaty, after entering into force 10 June 1964, established the rights of a sovereign state over the continental shelf surrounding it, if there be any. The treaty was one of three agreed upon at the first [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS I).&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf Text of the UN treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been superseded by a new agreement reached in 1982 at UNCLOS III.

The treaty dealt with seven topics: the regime governing the superjacent waters and airspace; laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipelines; the regime governing navigation, fishing, scientific research and the coastal state's competence in these areas; delimitation; tunneling.&lt;ref name="topics"&gt;{{cite book

==Historical background==
The Convention on the Continental Shelf replaced the earlier practice of nations having sovereignty over only a very narrow strip of the sea surrounding them, with anything beyond that strip considered International Waters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This policy was used until President of the United States Harry S Truman proclaimed that the resources on the continental shelf contiguous to the United States belonged to the United States through an Executive Order on 28 September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450928a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many other nations quickly adapted similar policies, most stating that their portion of the sea extended either 12 or 200 nautical miles from its coast.

==Rights of states==
Article 1 of the convention defined the term shelf in terms of exploitability rather than relying upon the geological definition. It defined a shelf "to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas" or "to the seabed and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of islands".&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{cite book

==UNCLOS II and III==
In 1960, the United Nations held another conference regarding the Laws of the Sea, UNCLOS II, but no agreements were reached. However, another conference was called in 1973 to address the issues. UNCLOS III, which lasted until 1982 due to a required consensus, adjusted and redefined many principles stated in the first UNCLOS. The new definition of the Continental shelf in the new Convention rendered the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf obsolete. The principal reason for this was technological advancements.&lt;ref name="advancements"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
Broadlands Finance repossessed the fishing vessel "Concord" jointly owned by Cuff and Ahern. On board the vessel at the time, was items owned personally by Cuff, as well as goods jointly owned by Cuff and Ahern. Items owned by Patrick were also on board.

Broadlands refused to return these goods, and the parties sued them in tort for conversion of these goods.

In the District Court, the judge awarded damages to Cuff of $12,000, and damages of $1,289 to Ahern.

On appeal to the High Court, Broadlands was successful in having these awards set aside.

Cuff appealed.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal restored the award to Cuff.

'''Footnote:''' When the award for damages was first set aside, Cuff was subsequently declared bankrupt, and special leave by the Official Assignee was required for him to file this appeal.

{{Taxation|expanded=Policies}}
'''Double taxation''' is the levying of tax by two or more jurisdictions on the same declared income (in the case of [[income tax]]es), [[asset]] (in the case of [[Wealth tax|capital taxes]]), or [[financial transaction]] (in the case of [[sales taxes]]). Double liability is mitigated in a number of ways, for example:

* the main taxing jurisdiction may exempt foreign-source income from tax,
* the main taxing jurisdiction may exempt foreign-source income from tax if tax had been paid on it in another jurisdiction, or above some benchmark to not include [[tax haven]] jurisdictions,
* the main taxing jurisdiction may tax the foreign-source income but give a credit for foreign jurisdiction taxes paid.

Another approach is for the jurisdictions affected to enter into a [[tax treaty]] which sets out rules to avoid double taxation.

The term "double taxation" can also refer to the double taxation of some income or activity. For example, in some jurisdictions, [[Corporate tax|corporate profits]] are taxed twice, once when earned by the corporation and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders as a [[dividend]] or other distribution.

==The Types of Double Taxation==

There are two types of double taxation: economical and juridical (international).

==International double taxation agreements== &lt;!-- Note to US editors, 'International' includes the US --&gt;
{{Main|Tax treaty}}
It is not unusual for a business or individual who is resident in one country to make a taxable gain (earnings, profits) in another.  This person may find that he is obliged by domestic laws to pay tax on that gain locally ''and'' pay again in the country in which the gain was made.  Since this is inequitable, many nations make bilateral double taxation agreements with each other. In some cases, this requires that tax be paid in the country of residence and be exempt in the country in which it arises.  In the remaining cases, the country where the gain arises deducts taxation at source ("[[withholding tax]]") and the taxpayer receives a compensating [[foreign tax credit]] in the country of residence to reflect the fact that tax has already been paid. To do this, the taxpayer must declare himself (in the foreign country) to be non-resident there.  So the second aspect of the agreement is that the two taxation authorities exchange information about such declarations, and so may investigate any anomalies that might indicate tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;Darren Rykers (2009): A Critical Analysis of how Double Tax Agreements can facilitate Fiscal Avoidance and Evasion;  The Taxpayer and the Lotus, 17 Nov.2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While individuals, or ''natural persons'' can have only one residence at a time; ''corporate persons'', owning foreign subsidiaries, can be simultaneously resident in multiple countries. Control of unreasonable tax avoidance of corporations becomes more difficult and requires investigation of [[transfer pricing]] set for transfer of goods, [[intellectual property]] rights, and services, among its subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold (2013): Valuing Intellectual Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens; Springer Verlag, 2013, Chap.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union savings taxation==
{{Main|European Union withholding tax}}
{{see also|Tax residence}}

In the [[European Union]], member states have concluded a [[Tax information exchange agreements|multilateral agreement on information exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0048:EN:HTML|title=Announcement: server inaccessibility - European Commission|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that they will each report (to their counterparts in each other jurisdiction) a list of those people who have claimed exemption from [[withholding tax|local taxation]] on grounds of not being a resident of the state where the income arises. These people should have declared that foreign income in their own country of residence, so any difference suggests [[tax evasion]].

(For a transition period, some states have a separate arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;See (17) and (18) of above, for a "temporary" period, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg may apply a [[withholding tax]] to non-resident accounts rather than exchange information.&lt;/ref&gt; They may offer each non-resident account holder the choice of taxation arrangements:  either (a) disclosure of information as above, or (b) deduction of local tax on savings interest at source as is the case for residents).

A recent [http://www.svensktnaringsliv.se/english/international-double-taxation-a-serious-problem-within-the-eu_212525.html study]&lt;ref&gt;Double Taxation Cases Outside the Transfer Pricing Area, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; by BusinessEurope confirms that double taxation remains a problem for European MNEs and an obstacle for cross border trade and investments. In particular, the problematic areas are limitation in interest deductibility, foreign tax credits, permanent establishment issues and diverging qualifications or interpretations. Germany and Italy have been identified as the Member States in which most double taxation cases have occurred.

===Cyprus double tax treaties===
[[Cyprus]] has completed over 45 Double Taxation Treaties up to today and is also in negotiations with many countries for signing Treaties with them. The main purpose of these treaties is the avoidance of double taxation on income earned in any of these countries. Under these agreements, a credit is usually allowed against the tax levied by the country in which the taxpayer resides for taxes levied in the other treaty country and as a result the tax payer pays no more than the higher of the two rates. Further, some treaties provide for tax sparing credits whereby the tax credit allowed is not only with respect to tax actually paid in the other treaty country but also from tax which would have been otherwise payable had it not been for incentive measures in that other country which result in exemption or reduction of tax.

If a foreign citizen is in Germany for less than a relevant 183-day period (approximately six months) and is [[tax resident]] (''i.e.'', and paying taxes on his or her salary and benefits) elsewhere, then it may be possible to claim tax relief under a particular Double Tax Treaty. The relevant 183 day period is either 183 days in a calendar year or in any period of 12 months, depending upon the particular treaty involved.

So, for example, the Double Tax Treaty with the UK looks at a period of 183 days in the German tax year (which is the same as the calendar year); thus, a citizen of the UK could work in Germany from 1 September through the following 31 May (9 months) and then claim to be exempt from German tax. As the double taxation avoidance agreements will give the protection of income from some countries,

==India ==
India has comprehensive DTAAs with 88 countries, out of which 85 have entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=93330|title=Double Taxation Avoidance agreement (DTAA) with South Korea|publisher=Press Information Bureau|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there are agreed rates of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the [[The Income-tax Act, 1961|Income Tax Act 1961 of India]], there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief  to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 (Bilateral Relief)is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed DTAA, while Section 91 (unilateral relief) provides benefit to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed a DTAA. Thus, India gives relief to both kinds of taxpayers.The rates differ from country to country.

Example of DTAA benefit -  If suppose interest on NRI bank deposits attracts 30 per cent TDS (tax deduction at source) in India. And since India has signed DTAAs with several countries, so tax may be  deducted at only 10 to 15 per cent instead of 30%.

It is to be noted that in case of any conflict between the provisions of the Income Tax Act or DTAA, the provisions of DTAA would prevail.

A large number of foreign institutional investors who trade on the Indian stock markets operate from [[Singapore]] and the second being [[Mauritius]]. According to the [[tax treaty]] between India and Mauritius, capital gains arising from the sale of shares are taxable in the country of residence of the shareholder and not in the country of residence of the company whose shares have been sold. Therefore, a company resident in Mauritius selling shares of an Indian company will not pay tax in India. Since there is no [[capital gains tax]] in Mauritius, the gain will escape tax altogether.
The Protocol for amendment of the India-Mauritius Convention signed on 10 May 2016, provides for source-based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares acquired from 1 April 2017 in a company resident in India. Simultaneously, investments made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered and will not be subject to capital gains taxation in India.  Where such capital gains arise during the transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019, the tax rate will be limited to 50% of the domestic tax rate of India. However, the benefit of 50% reduction in tax rate during the transition period shall be subject to the Limitation of Benefits Article. Taxation in India at full domestic tax rate will take place from financial year 2019-20 onwards.

In an article written for [[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]], Indian lawyer Ashish Goel argued that the May 2016 protocol rewrites treaty provisions with a view to increasing India’s tax take on the noble pretext of tackling treaty abuse. According to Goel, the problem of treaty abuse could have been easily solved by introducing special anti-avoidance rules in the treaty without India having to tax capital gains&lt;ref&gt;https://thewire.in/economy/the-india-mauritius-tax-protocol-using-a-sledgehammer-to-swat-a-fly&lt;/ref&gt;.

The revised DTAA between India and Cyprus signed on 18 November 2016, provides for source based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares, instead of residence based taxation provided under the DTAA signed in 1994. However, a grandfathering clause has been provided for investments made prior to 1 April 2017, in respect of which capital gains would continue to be taxed in the country of which taxpayer is a resident. It also provides for assistance between the two countries for collection of taxes and updates the provisions related to Exchange of Information to accepted international standards.

The India-Singapore DTAA at present provides for residence based taxation of capital gains of shares in a company. The Third Protocol amends the DTAA with effect from 1 April 2017 to provide for source based taxation of capital gains arising on transfer of shares in a company. This will curb revenue loss, prevent double non-taxation and streamline the flow of investments. In order to provide certainty to investors, investments in shares made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause as per 2005 Protocol. Further, a two-year transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019 has been provided during which capital gains on shares will be taxed in source country at half of normal tax rate, subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause.
 
The Third Protocol also inserts provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure and is in line with India’s commitments under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases. The Third Protocol also enables application of domestic law and measures concerning prevention of tax avoidance or tax evasion. Singapore’s investment of $5.98 billion has over taken Mauritius’s investment of $4.85 billion as the single largest investor for the year 2013-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=156015|title=Press Information Bureau|author=|date=|website=pib.nic.in|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia ==
In principle, an Australian resident is taxed on all worldwide income, while a non-resident is taxed only on Australian-sourced income. Both legs of the principle offer an opportunity for taxation in more than one jurisdiction. To avoid double taxation of income by different jurisdictions, Australia has entered into [[Tax treaty|double taxation avoidance agreement]]s (DTAs) with a number of other countries, under which both countries agree on which taxes will be paid to which country. For example, in the case of royalties, the DTA with the United States says that the US will tax Australian residents at the rate of 5%, and Australia will tax it at normal rates (i.e., 30% for companies) but give a credit for the 5% already paid. For Australian residents, this ends up working out the same as if the money had been earned within Australia - whilst still providing a 5% credit to the US.

==United States==

===U.S. citizens and resident aliens abroad===

The U.S. requires its citizens to file [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]] reporting their earnings wherever they reside. However, there are some measures designed to reduce the international double taxation that results from this requirement.&lt;ref name=us54&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54/index.html|title=Publication 54 (2015),  Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, an individual who is a [[bona fide]] resident of a foreign country or is physically outside the United States for an extended time is entitled to an exclusion (exemption) of part or all of their [[earned income]] (that is, personal service income, as distinguished from income from capital or investments). That exemption is $100,800 for 2015, pro-rated.&lt;ref name=us54/&gt;  (See IRS form 2555.)

Second, the United States allows a [[foreign tax credit]] by which [[income tax]] paid to foreign countries can be offset against U.S. income tax liability attributable to any foreign income not covered by this exclusion.  This can be a complex issue that often requires the services of a [[tax advisor]].  The foreign tax credit is not allowed for tax paid on earned income that is excluded under the rules described in the preceding paragraph (i.e. no double dipping).&lt;ref name=us54/&gt;

=== Double taxation within the United States ===
Double taxation can also happen within a single country. This typically happens when subnational jurisdictions have taxation powers, and jurisdictions have competing claims. In the United States a person may legally have only a single [[Domicile (law)|domicile]]. However, when a person dies different states may each claim that the person was domiciled in that state. [[Intangible property|Intangible personal property]] may then be taxed by each state making a claim. In the absence of specific laws prohibiting multiple taxation, and as long as the total of taxes does not exceed 100% of the value of the tangible personal property, the courts will allow such multiple taxation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Also, since each state makes its own rules on who is a resident for tax purposes, someone may be subject to the claims by two states on his or her income.  For example, if someone's legal/permanent domicile is in state A, which  considers only permanent domicile to which one returns for residency but he or she spends 7 months of the year (say April–October) in state B where anyone who is there longer than 6 months is considered a part-year resident, that person will then owe taxes to both states on money earned in state B.  College or university students may also be subject to claims of more than one state, generally if they leave their original state to attend school, and the second state considers students to be residents for tax purposes. In some cases one state will give a credit for taxes paid to another state, but not always.

===Taxation of corporate dividends===
{{main|Dividend tax}}
In the United States, the term "double taxation" is also used to refer to [[dividend tax]]ation. It refers to the taxation of [[dividend]] income when received by a shareholder that had been previously taxed at the corporate level.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Carroll (2010) {{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/26384.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705184139/http://taxfoundation.org/publications/show/26384.html |archivedate=2011-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign shareholders are subject to a 30% tax on the dividends, called the [[branch profits tax]]. Foreign corporations are subject to United States income tax on their "effectively connected income", and are also subject to the branch profits tax on any of their profits not reinvested in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==China==
In recent years, the development of overseas investment of Chinese enterprises is growing rapidly and becomes rather influential. Thus, dealing with cross-border taxation matters turns into one of the significant financial and trade projects of China, and the problems of cross-border taxation is still increasing. In order to solve the problems, the multilateral [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] between countries, which can provide legal support to help enterprises from both sides with double taxation avoidance and tax issues solutions, are established. To fulfill the [[Go Out policy|"going global" strategy]] of China and support the domestic enterprises to adapt to the globalization situation, China has been making efforts on promoting and signing multilateral [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] with other countries to achieve mutual interests. By the end of November 2016, China has officially signed 102 double taxation avoidance agreements. Out of which 98 agreements have already entered into force. In addition, China signed double taxation avoidance arrangement with Hong Kong and Macau [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Region]]. China also signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Taiwan in August 2015, which has not entered into force yet. According to the Chinese [[State Administration of Taxation]], the first double taxation avoidance agreement was signed with Japan in September 1983. The latest agreement was signed with Cambodia in October 2016. As for the situation of state disruption, China would continue the signed agreement after the disruption. For example, China first signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic in June 1987. In 1990, Czechoslovakia divided into two countries, Czech Republic and Slovakia Republic, and the initial agreement signed with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic was continually used in two new countries. In August 2009, China signed the new agreement with Czech Republic. And when it comes to the special case of Germany, China continued using the agreement with The Federal Republic of Germany after two Germanys reunited. China have signed double taxation avoidance agreement with many countries. Among them, there are not only countries which have made large investment in China, but also countries which as well-relationship recipient of Chinese investment. As for the agreement quantity, China is now next only to United Kingdom. For those countries which have not signed the double taxation avoidance agreements with China, some of them signed information exchange agreements with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=国家税务总局|url=http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/n810341/n810770/|website=www.chinatax.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are mainly four effects of signing Double Taxation Avoidance agreement.

1. Eliminate the double taxation, decrease the tax cost of [[Go Out policy|"going global"]] enterprises.

2. Increase the certainty of taxation, decrease the risk of cross-border taxation

3. Decrease the tax burden of [[Go Out policy|"going global"]] enterprises in the host country, improve the competitiveness of those enterprises.

4. When taxation disputes occur, the agreements can provide bidirectional consultation mechanism, solve the existed disputed problems.

Under general conditions, the tax rate under [[tax treaty]] is often lower than the domestic tax rate under the law of host country. Take Russia as an example, in Russia, the standard [[withholding tax]] rate of interest and royalty under domestic law is both 20%. According to the newest [[tax treaty]] China signed with Russia, the [[withholding tax]] rate of interest is 0 and the [[withholding tax]] rate of royalty is 6%. This can obviously reduce the tax cost of enterprises, increase the willing of [[Go Out policy|"going global"]] and the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, and bring the goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=避免双重征税 中国已签订99个税收协定中华人民共和国商务部网站|url=http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/i/jyjl/l/201505/20150500980488.shtml|work=www.mofcom.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Though signing double taxation avoidance agreement is a way to solve the tax problems, there still can be other problems led out, or we can call it "side effect".

The intention of [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] is to avoid or eliminate double taxation. The term double taxation which existed in the [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] is mostly juridical double taxation, which "refers to circumstances where a taxpayer is subject to tax on the same income (or capital) in more than one jurisdiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krishna|first1=Vern|title=Income tax law|date=2012|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-235-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the economic double taxation "is related to the taxation of two and more taxes from one tax basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concept of Double Taxation|url=https://www.mbaknol.com/business-taxation/concept-of-double-taxation/|website=MBA Knowledge Base|date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solving economic double taxation mostly is not the main aim of the agreements, but this type of double taxation is not totally ignored.

The initial aim of [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]] is to avoid double taxation between two countries. Later, with closer the transnational economic relationships are, and the development of transnational enterprises, the governments realized it was necessary to enhance the cooperation through more well-established law together to face the [[tax evasion]] of transnational enterprises. Thus, some terms were added into the initial treaties, especially the information exchange terms and tax collection assistance terms. In this way, the second aim, to avoid [[tax evasion]] was appear in the theme.

The impact and the aim of the tax treaties are integrated, they are both to avoid double taxation in order to improve economic exchanges and relationships, to enhance the government cooperation in order to avoid [[tax evasion]]. However, the side effect gradually appeared. The tax provides possibilities of [[Tax avoidance|avoiding tax in a legal way]] to transnational taxpayers. In order to avoid double taxation, the agreement divided the jurisdiction of taxation, including shared and excluded jurisdiction of taxation. It also established the limited tax rate in the origin countries. These all can be called the preferential treatments of the taxation agreement. The transnational enterprises, in order to get maximized profit, can use the terms of domestic law and taxation agreement, to avoid both taxation from origin country and residence country legally and achieve double taxation free. This can be a severe undermine to the international order, and a challenge to the domestic governments.

'''FILE_ID.DIZ''' is a [[plain text]] file containing a brief content
description of the [[archive formats|archive]] in which it is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fong | first1 = B. C. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = D. J. | doi = 10.1016/0020-7101(95)01126-Y | title = Renal function tests for windows — a model for the development and distribution of medical software on the Internet | journal = International Journal of Bio-Medical Computing | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | year = 1995 | pmid =  8557407| pmc = }} "Short ANSI text file (31 characters wide) often automatically extracted by Bulletin Board Service  programs."&lt;/ref&gt;
It was originally used in archives distributed through [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS), and still in the [[warez scene]].

Bulletin boards commonly accept uploaded files from their users. The BBS software would prompt the user to supply a description for the uploaded file, but these descriptions were often less than useful. BBS system operators spent many hours going over the upload descriptions correcting and editing the descriptions. The &lt;tt&gt;FILE_ID.DIZ&lt;/tt&gt; inclusion in archives was designed to address this problem.

''&lt;tt&gt;FILE_ID&lt;/tt&gt;'' stands for "file identification". &lt;tt&gt;DIZ&lt;/tt&gt; stands for Description In Zipfile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Ron |date=July 2001 |title=Mystery Files |journal=Ziff Davis Smart Business |volume=14 |issue=7 |page=100 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= |issn=1535-9891 |quote=DIZ stands for Description in Zip.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clark Development]] and the [[Association of Shareware Professionals]] supported the idea of this becoming a standard for file descriptions. Clark rewrote the PCBDescribe program and included it with their [[PCBoard]] BBS software. The ASP urged their members to use this description file format in their distributions. Michael Leavitt, an employee of Clark Development, released the file specification and his PCBDescribe program source code to the public domain and urged other BBS software companies to support the DIZ file.

SysOps could add a common third-party script written in PPL, called "DIZ/2-PCB"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimerdes|first1=Shawn|title=DIZ/2-PCB PPE script for PCBoard}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would process, rewrite, verify, and format DIZ files from archives as they were uploaded to a BBS.  The software would extract the archive, examine the contents, compile a report, import the DIZ description file and then format it according to your liking.  During this time, it was usual practice to add additional lines to the description, such as ads exclaiming the source of the uploaded BBS.

Traditionally, a FILE_ID.DIZ should be "up to 10 lines of text, each line being no more than 45 characters long." according to the specification v1.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.textfiles.com/computers/fileid.txt |title=FILEID.TXT v1.9|first=Richard |last=Holler |date=1994-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of DIZ files was to allow a concise description of uploaded files to be automatically applied. Advertisements and "[[Code page 437|high ASCII]]" artwork were specifically prohibited.

Even since the decline of the [[dial-up]] [[bulletin board system]], FILE_ID.DIZ files are still utilized by the [[warez scene]] in their releases of [[warez|unlicensed software]].  They are commonly bundled as part of the complete packaging by self-described pirate groups, and indicate the number of disks, and other basic information. Along with the [[.nfo|NFO]] file, it's essential to the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Craig | first1 = P. | last2 = Honick | first2 = R. | last3 = Burnett | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1016/B978-193226698-6/50030-1 | chapter = The Release | title = Software Piracy Exposed |page=95 | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-93-226698-6 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially in terms of [[warez|unlicensed software]] ("warez"), it was common for each file in a sequential compressed archive (an archive intentionally split into multiple parts at creation so the parts can then be individually downloaded by slower connections like dial-up. Example: .rar, .r00, .r01, .r02, etc.), to contain this file.  This probably contributed to it's extended popularity after the decline of the [[bulletin board system]] in the late 1990's and early 2000's until now, since even casual consumers of [[warez|unlicensed software]] would have stumbled upon it due to it's abundance.

==Formal structure==
While real-world use among BBSs varied, with the [[software piracy|NPD]] world and even different BBS brands coming up with expanded versions, the official format is:

Plain, 7 bit ASCII text, each line no more than 45 characters wide.

# '''Program/file name:''' Ideally, all uppercase, and followed by one space. Carriage returns are ignored in this file
# '''Version number:''' in the format v1.123, followed by a space
# '''ASP number:''' only if an actual ASP member, otherwise ignored
# '''Description separator:''' a single short hyphen "-"
# '''Description:''' The description of the file. The first two lines should be the short summary, as older boards cut off the rest. Anything beyond that should be extended description, for up to eight lines, the official cutoff size. Additional text could be included beyond that, but might not be included by the board. 
Many archives would stick strictly to the 45 character plain ascii format for the first 8 lines, then contain an appended 80 character wide 8 bit ASCII or ANSI graphic page with better-formatted documentation after that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcmicro.com/getdiz/file_id.html Copy of official FILE_ID.DIZ documentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3080">Under [[Brehon Laws|Brehon Law]] '''Gavelkind''', also known as '''[[partible inheritance]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connolly S.J|title =The Oxford Companion to Irish History | publisher = Oxford University Press
| year =1998 | page =219 | isbn =0-19-211695-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the system of land inheritance. The [[Normans]] gave this Irish inheritance law the name ''Gavelkind'' due to its apparent similarity to Jute [[Gavelkind|inheritance in Kent]].

==The law==
Upon the death of a land-holder, his land was divided equally among his sons. The sons of concubines, if accepted by the father as being his sons, had the same rights of inheritance as their legitimately born brothers. The adopted sons of the land-holder, if any, may also receive a share of his lands, but only if the land-holder had made specific and public provision for this before his death, and the extent of land thus received by an adopted son was not necessarily equal to that received by the land-holder's own sons.

While sons received equal shares of the land, the father often prescribed the division, stating which parcel of land was to go to which son. Another known custom was for the youngest son to divide the land into equal parts, and for his brothers to choose their parcels. The eldest chose first, followed by the second, and so on, until the youngest received the remaining land. The purpose of this system was to ensure equitable division of the land.

In cases where a land-holder had no sons, his widow and unwed daughters, if any, would collectively hold a life-interest on the entire land. Their rights on the produce of the land would lapse upon their marriage or death, as the case may be. Upon the last such lapse of [[usufruct]], the land would devolve upon the [[agnatic]] kin of the last male land-holder.

==Queen Anne's law==
In [[1703 in Ireland|1703]], in the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], a law was enacted ([[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701 to 1800#2 Anne (1703)|2 Anne c6 (Ir))]] by the English parliament, which is commonly known as the [[Popery Act|''Gavelkind Act'']].&lt;ref name=AL&gt;Andrew Lyall; Land Law in Ireland; {{ISBN|1-85800-199-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law made sectarian affiliation a primary determinant of the inheritance of land. When a [[Catholic]] died, his estate would normally be divided equally among his sons. However, if his eldest son converted to the Protestant faith, that eldest son alone would inherit all the land, and all his Catholic brothers would be disinherited. The law was intended to put land into the hands of Protestants, and to reduce the size, and therefore influence, of Catholic landed estates.&lt;ref name="AL"/&gt;

[[Palestinian people]] have a history that is often linked to the history of the [[Arab]] Nation. When Islam was started by [[Muhammad]] in [[Mecca]] in AD 610, [[Christianity]] was the major religion of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Soon after the rise of Islam, Palestine was conquered and brought into the rapidly expanding Islamic empire. The [[Umayyad]] empire was the first of three successive dynasties to dominate the Arab-[[Islamic world]] and rule Palestine, followed by the [[Abbasids]] and the [[Fatimids]]. Muslim rule was briefly challenged and interrupted in parts of Palestine during the [[Crusades]], but was restored under the [[Mamluks]].

After toppling the Mamluk state in 1517, the [[Ottoman Turks]] took control of most of the [[Arab world]]. Palestine existed within the [[Ottoman Empire]] as two districts, also referred to as [[Sanjaks]]. The legal origin of citizenship in the [[Middle East]] was born of the Ottoman Citizenship Law of 19 January 1869 and the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].

==Origins==
{{see also|Timeline of the name Palestine}}
[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[citizenship]] has developed over the last century starting during the British Mandate era and in different form following the Oslo Peace process, with the former British Mandate definition including the Jews of Palestine and the Arabs of Jordan and the latter excluding them. There has never been a sovereign Palestinian authority to explicitly define who is a Palestinian, but the term evolved from a geographic description of citizenship to a description of geographic citizenship with an Arab ethnicity.

==British Mandate period==
{{see also| Palestinian Citizenship Order, 1925}}
The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] came into force on August 6, 1924. It stated that the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] nationals who were "habitually residents" of what became Palestine "will become ipso facto" nationals of that state.&lt;ref&gt;Hurewitz 1956, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Article 7 of the Mandate for Palestine stipulated that the British mandatory power "shall be responsible for enacting a nationality law". The British authority via the structure of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] was directed to "facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews who take up their permanent residence in Palestine." Article 15 stated that "No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants of Palestine on the ground of race, religion or language. No person shall be excluded from Palestine on the sole ground of his religious belief."&lt;ref&gt;Hurewitz 1956, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palestinian Citizenship Order, 1925]] was enacted by Britain on 24 July 1925.&lt;ref name=PG147&gt;Official Gazette of the Government of Palestine, No. 147, September 16, 1925, pp. 460–466.&lt;/ref&gt; It began by granting Palestinian citizenship to "Turkish subjects habitually resident in the territory of Palestine upon the 1st day of August, 1925".&lt;ref name=PG147/&gt; Transjordan was specifically excluded.&lt;ref name=PG147/&gt; Provision for citizenship under some conditions was also defined for some persons habitually resident abroad, as well as the children or wife of a Palestinian man.&lt;ref name=PG147/&gt; The Order contained no test based on race or religion, except that non-Arabs could opt out of Palestinian citizenship if they were accepted by another state in which their race was a majority.&lt;ref name=PG147/&gt;

This order held until 14 May 1948, when the People's Council, representative of the [[Yishuv]] or Jewish Community, declared the creation of the [[Jewish State]] of [[Israel]] pursuant to the relevant UN resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of Israel===
The creation of the State of Israel coincided with the expiration of the pre-existing British Mandate. This meant that Palestinian Arabs had no citizenship, but could be categorized in 4 ways: 1. Arabs who remained in Israel; 2. Those who became [[refugees]]; 3. Palestinian Arabs who became citizens of [[Jordan]]; and 4. Arabs who remained in or relocated to the [[Gaza Strip]].
Palestinians then ceased to be only Palestinian, but were either [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Palestinians]], Jordanian-Palestinians, [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] Palestinians, and Gaza Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Israeli nationality law|Israeli Nationality Law]] was passed on the 14 July 1952. From the time that Israel was created to July 1952, Palestinians were "[[Stateless nation|stateless]]." Israeli courts rendered the former Palestinian citizenship, given by the British administration to Jews, Arabs and other inhabitants of the region, "devoid of substance," "not satisfactory and is inappropriate to the situation following the establishment of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;International Law Report, 1950, 111&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli Nationality Law effectively denationalized Palestinians. It granted every "Jew" who immigrated to Israel, or, following the 1971 amendment, even expressed the desire to immigrate to Israel, "immediate" Israeli citizenship without taking any formal steps. It retroactively altered the Palestinian Citizenship Orders, stating that they had to be "repealed with effect from the day of the establishment of the State".&lt;ref&gt;Article 18 of Laws of the State of Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to obtain Israeli citizenship, Palestinians had to prove that they had: been registered in the Inhabitants Registration in 1949; had been an inhabitant of Israel on 14 July 1952; had been in Israel or in an area that later came into Israel between the establishment of Israel and July 14, 1952; or had entered legally during that period. These proved difficult for many Palestinians to fulfill because many at the time had no proof of Palestinian citizenship, and those who had identity cards were forced to surrender them to the Israeli army during or soon after the war.&lt;ref name="Middle East p. 205"&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attaining status as a Registered Inhabitant was also difficult because there was a "deliberate attempt [by Israeli Forces] to not register many [Palestinian] villages"/&lt;ref name="Middle East p. 205"/&gt; Those who failed to attain legal status remained in Israel as stateless persons.

An amendment to the Israeli Nationality Law was passed in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;22 Laws of the State of Israel 1968&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment stipulated that a Palestinian must apply within 3 years of turning 18 years of age, and had to prove that they had been a resident of Israel for five consecutive years prior to their application. A further amendment was passed in 1980&lt;ref&gt;34 Laws of the State of Israel&lt;/ref&gt; which alleviated the article that had previously required the applicant to have been in Israel between May 1948 and July 1952.

Following the 1980 amendment to Israel's Nationality Law, Palestinians are strictly legal citizens of the State of Israel. They have "[[passport]] citizenship" rights, but are excluded from several aspects of the Jewish welfare state and are therefore denied equal "democratic citizenship". While enjoying the fruits of Jewish civil rights (such as access to courts of law and private property) and political rights (access to the ballot and to government) they are denied social rights and economic rights in the form of social security, education and welfare, or access to land and water resources of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1995, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palestinians====
=====Living in the West Bank=====

The citizenship of Palestinians living on the [[West Bank]], within the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], also went through three stages.

After the creation of the state of Israel and before the passing of a new Jordanian Citizenship Law in 1954, Palestinians were incorporated into the Kingdom of Jordan.

In 1949, the Jordanian Council of Ministers added an article to their Citizenship Law of 1928 that read:

{{quote|All those who at the time when this Law goes into effect habitually reside in Transjordan or in the Western part [of the Jordan] which is being administered by [the Kingdom], and who were holders of Palestinian citizenship, shall be deemed as Jordanians enjoying all rights of Jordanians and bearing all the attendant obligations.|&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A new Citizenship Law was passed in 1954. It granted Jordanian citizenship to the Palestinians living in the West Bank and refugees that had fled during the war. The third stage of citizenship for Jordanian-Palestinians began on the 31 of July 1988 when Jordan severed its relationship with the West Bank-they now decreed all those residing in the West Bank as "Palestinians".

=====UNRWA=====

Following the war of 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations established the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). It was created to give direct aid to the Palestinians that had fled from the war. These refugees were placed in 5 neighbouring Arab states, and these countries granted Palestinians traveling documents, which granted them few rights. The Casablanca Resolution of 1965, which was passed by the [[League of Arab States]], resolved to grant the Palestinians living in the host countries the right to work in, travel from and return to the country of their residence, obtain traveling documents and receive entry visas to the Arab countries as any other national.&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lebanon=====

When Palestinians first arrived in [[Lebanon]] in 1948 they were warmly received. In 1959 the Palestinian Refugees Department was created. This body was charged with dealing with refugee affairs, namely issuing travel documents, regulating personal status affairs such as birth and death certificates, locating sites for refugee camps, and so on. Palestinian refugees were issued travel documents that allowed them to travel abroad and to return to Lebanon. Refugees were also allowed, like Lebanese citizens, to travel between [[Syria]] and Lebanon without having their travel document.

In 1995, the minister of interior issued Decree No. 478 which provided that Palestinians who have been refugees in Lebanon since 1948 have to apply for an exit visa from Lebanon and an entry visa in order to return to Lebanon.

The right to work in Lebanon was also granted to Palestinians, as outlined in the Labour Law of 1962. This decreed that a foreigner is allowed to work in Lebanon provided that his country allows Lebanese to work in that country, and that he obtains in advance a work permit. The first half of that regulation proved problematic for Palestinians due to the lack of the principle of reciprocity-no state of Palestine existed to enact a reciprocity rule. As for the second half of the rule, the Lebanese authorities issued a list of 60 activities that excluded workers with permits-this list excluded almost all menial jobs. The result of this law has been that more than one-half of the Palestinian refugees currently live below the [[poverty line]].&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Egypt=====

Palestinians who lived in the [[Gaza Strip]] when Israel came into being were issued with Egyptian travel documents which allowed them to move outside of the Gaza Strip, and [[Egypt]]. Their status as refugees has been deteriorating rapidly since the 1970s. After 1948 they were allowed rights similar to Egyptian nationals, and in 1963 they were allowed to own agricultural land, nor did they have to acquire work visas. In 1964 the government decreed that Palestinian refugees had to obtain an exit visa, an entry visa or a transit visa. In 1976 a law was passed stating that no foreigners could own real property, although Palestinians were later granted the right to own agricultural land. In 1978 the ability of Palestinians to work in the civil service was revoked. Gradually the process of attaining travel documents for Palestinians has become more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian Palestinians who hold two year passports are now required to obtain entry and exit visas to travel to Egypt.

=====Syria=====

Syria afforded Palestinians refugees all rights of residence, travel, work, business, and ownership on a temporary basis in 1948. In 1956 this status was cemented in the Law No. 260. Its first article states that all Palestinians residing in Syria at the date of its issuance shall be considered as Syrians in areas of employment, labour, trade, and national service provided they keep their Palestinian Citizenship. They thus enjoy equal rights in all aspects. They have equal rights of employment, in both public and private sectors, and are entitled to social security benefits, labour benefits, residence, education and travel. With regards to travel, the Syrian government issued Palestinian refugees with travel documents.

=====Iraq=====

Those who fled to [[Iraq]] enjoy equal rights concerning residence, work, and ownership of residential areas. They also have the right to join the civil service, with all the subsequent benefits. Given the current economic and political situation in Iraq, the quality of life for Palestinian refugees residing there has a questionable future.

===Oslo Peace Process===
====Palestinian Nationality Authority defines "Palestinian"====

The [[Palestinian National Authority]] drafted, but did not pass, a piece of legislation in 1995 outlining its Citizenship Law. Article 7 of this legislation defines a Palestinian as anyone who "(1) was a holder of Palestinian citizenship (other than Jews) before 15 May 1948; (2) was born to a Palestinian father; (3) was born in Palestine to a Palestinian mother even if the citizenship of the father is not known; (4) was born in Palestine to unknown parents; and (5) was born outside of Palestine to a Palestinian mother and to a father whose nationality was not known – provided that this person opts for Palestinian citizenship within one year after reaching maturity, that he notifies the minister of interior of his intention to become a Palestinian citizen, that he becomes habitually a resident of Palestine, and that the minister does not object to this applicant within one year from the time he receives the notice from the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Draft circulated by the Council for Opinion and Legislation as cited in "Citizenship and the State in the Middle East", p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Draft law does not take into account those Palestinians living in their diaspora. The PNA’s draft Citizenship Law does not address the criteria in terms of which the UNRWA-Palestinians could attain citizenship. The PNA’s concept of citizenship, when combined with their Election Law, incorporates the concepts of jus soli, [[jus sanguinis]] and [[naturalization]].

====Doctrine of return====

[[Resolution 194]] of the UN General Assembly in 1948, "refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so." But the Resolution also states: "Instructs the Conciliation Commission to facilitate the repatriation, resettlement and economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees" as an alternative to "return". Some argue that this has been converted into customary international law, enshrined as 'the right of return,' but UN General Assembly Resolutions do not establish international law. Those who argue for a [[right of return]] usually support a geographical basis as opposed to a religious one. But so-called "right of return" is not the equivalent of the Israeli [[Law of Return]] (1950) which grants citizenship to any Jewish person and their family wishing to enter Israel.

====Citizenship Regulation====

The PNA's draft Citizenship Law bestows the executive branch the right to grant, annul, or withdraw citizenship.

===Citizens without a State===

[[Social citizenship]], T.H. Marshall's utopian stage of development of nationality, is inconceivable without an established political citizenship (and an industrial economy), and political citizenship presupposes civil citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Butenschon, Nils. A Ed. "Citizens and the State in the Middle East", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; To apply Marshall's standards of citizenship to the Middle East citizens, or Palestinians more specifically, is difficult. Citizenship requires the institutionalization of social and political rights within the framework of a given state, which the Palestinians do not have. Palestinians remain unable to access constituent demos in nearly every country they have come to reside in.

'''''In re Boucher''''' ([[case citation]]: No. 2:06-mJ-91, 2009 WL 424718), is a [[federal law#United States|federal]] [[criminal law|criminal]] [[legal case|case]] in [[Vermont]], which was the first to directly address the question of whether investigators can compel a suspect to reveal their [[encryption]] [[passphrase]] or [[password]], despite the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection against [[self-incrimination]]. A [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judge]] held that producing the passphrase would constitute self-incrimination. In its submission on appeal to the District Court, the Government stated that it does not seek the password for the encrypted hard drive, but only sought to force Boucher to produce the contents of his encrypted hard drive in an unencrypted format by opening the drive before the grand jury. A District Court judge agreed with the government, holding that, given Boucher's initial cooperation in showing some of the content of his computer to border agents, producing the complete contents would not constitute self-incrimination.

In late 2009, Boucher finally gave up his password and investigators found numerous images and videos [[Child pornography|depicting sexual abuse of children]]. In January 2010, Boucher was sentenced to 3 years in prison and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-man-sentenced-in-u-s-child-porn-case-1.904930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
On 17 December 2006, the [[laptop computer]] of [[defendant]] Sebastien D. Boucher (born in 1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/15/AR2008011503663.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Ellen | last=Nakashima | title=In Child Porn Case, a Digital Dilemma | date=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katzjustice.com/boucherdocket.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was inspected when he crossed the border from Canada into the United States at [[Derby Line]], Vermont. The laptop  was powered-up when the border was crossed, which allowed its contents to be browsed. Images containing [[child pornography]] were allegedly seen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border agents who seized the laptop, questioned Boucher and then arrested him on a complaint
charging him with transportation of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(1). The laptop was subsequently powered-down. When the laptop was switched on and booted on 29 December 2006, it was not possible to access its entire storage capability. This was because the laptop had been protected by [[PGP Disk]] encryption.&lt;ref name="In Re Boucher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://federalevidence.com/pdf/2009/03-March/InreBoucherI.pdf |title=In Re Boucher |first=Jerome J. |last=Niedermeier |format=PDF|accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, investigators working for the US government were unable to view the contents of drive "Z:", which allegedly contained the illegal content. A grand jury then [[subpoena]]ed the defendant to provide the password to the [[key (cryptography)|encryption key]] protecting the data.

==Decision of the United States District Court==
On November 29, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge [[Jerome Niedermeier]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont]] stated "Compelling Boucher to enter the password forces him to produce evidence that could be used to incriminate him."&lt;ref name="In Re Boucher"/&gt; Accordingly, Niedermeier quashed the subpoena.

On January 2, 2008, the United States appealed the magistrate's opinion to the District Court in a sealed motion (court docket, case #: 2:06-mJ-00091-wks-jjn-1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/07/america/legal.php |title=U.S. courts consider legality of laptop inspections |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |first=Adam |last=Liptak |date=January 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was heard by U.S. District Judge [[William K. Sessions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9854034-38.html |title=Feds appeal loss in PGP compelled-passphrase case | publisher=[[The Iconoclast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments were scheduled for April 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecf.vtd.uscourts.gov/doc1/1851300930 |title=CM/ECF Filer or PACER Login}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2009, Judge Sessions reversed the magistrate's ruling and directed  Boucher "to provide an unencrypted version of the Z drive viewed by the ICE agent."

{{quote|Boucher accessed the Z drive of his laptop at the ICE agent's request. The ICE agent viewed the contents of some of the Z drive's files, and ascertained that they may consist of images or videos of child pornography. The Government thus knows of the existence and location of the Z drive and its files. Again providing access to the unencrypted Z drive 'adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411.
 
Boucher's act of producing an unencrypted version of the Z drive likewise is not necessary to authenticate it. He has already admitted to possession of the computer, and provided the Government with access to the Z drive. The Government has submitted that it can link Boucher with the files on his computer without making use of his production of an unencrypted version of the Z drive, and that it will not use his act of production as evidence of authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/files/BoucherDCT.1.pdf |title=In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher, Memorandum of Decision |date=February 19, 2009 |format=PDF |work=The Volokh Conspiracy |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10620">{{short description|Formal accusation that a person has committed a crime}}
An '''indictment''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|ˈ|d|aɪ|t|m|ə|n|t}} {{respell|in|DYT|mənt}}) is a [[criminal accusation]] that a person has committed a [[crime]]. In [[jurisdiction]]s that use the concept of [[felony|felonies]], the most serious [[criminal offence]] is a felony; jurisdictions that do not use the concept of felonies often use that of an [[indictable offence]]—an offence that requires an indictment.

==Indictments by country==
=== India ===
The criminal law in [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/police-cant-dodge-fir-if-cognisable-offence-is-disclosed/article5342930.ece |title=Police can’t dodge FIR if cognisable offence is disclosed |publisher=The Hindu |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the colonial-era British system, does not use a [[jury]] system and is codified in the [[Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (India)|Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)]]. Criminal offenses are divided into two broad categories: cognisable offenses and non-cognisable offenses. The police are empowered to start investigating a cognisable offense. The complaint is considered merely an accusation.  However, in both cognisable and non-cognisable offenses, the trial starts only with the "Framing of Charges" similar to the concept of indictment. The trial court does not proceed with the trial if the evidence is insufficient to make out a charge.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====
In [[England and Wales]] (except in [[private prosecution]]s by individuals) an indictment is issued by the public prosecutor (in most cases this will be the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]) on behalf of the [[The Crown|Crown]], which is the nominal [[plaintiff]] in all public prosecutions under [[English law]].
This is why a public [[prosecution]] of a person whose surname is Smith would be referred to in writing as "R v Smith" (or alternatively as "Regina v Smith" or "Rex v Smith" depending on the gender of the Sovereign, ''Regina'' and ''Rex'' being Latin for "Queen" and "King" and in either case may informally be pronounced as such) and when cited orally in court would be pronounced "the Crown against Smith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/subjects/law/research/file70250.pdf |format=PDF |title=Understanding UK Case Law |website=Soas.ac.uk |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All proceedings on indictment must be brought before the [[Crown Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810054_en_6#pt2-ch3-l1g52 |title=Senior Courts Act 1981 |website=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of practice directions issued under section 75(1) of the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]], an indictment must be tried by a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]], a [[Circuit judge (UK)|circuit judge]] or a [[recorder (judge)|recorder]] (which of these it is depends on the offence).

As to the form of an indictment, see the [[Indictments Act 1915]] and the [[Indictment Rules 1971]] made thereunder.

The Indictment Rules 1971 were revoked by the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/699/article/3/made |title=The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2007 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2014-01-06 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (on the whole) incorporated into the Criminal Procedure Rules 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/criminal/rulesmenu |title=Rules and Practice Directions |website=Justice.gov.uk |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form and content and the service of an indictment are governed by Rule 14 of the CPR 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1726/part/14/made |title=The Criminal Procedure Rules 2012 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2015-08-03 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional guidance is contained in the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction Part IV.34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/criminal/practice-direction/part4#id6328219 |title=Part IV: Further Practice Directions Applying in The Crown Court - Criminal Procedure Rules |website=Justice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the preferring of a bill of indictment and the signing of an indictment, see section 2 of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 and the Indictments (Procedure) Rules 1971 (S.I. 1971/2084) made thereunder, as amended and modified by the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1983 (S.I. 1983/284), the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1988 (S.I. 1988/1783), the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1992 (S.I. 1992/284), the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1997 (S.I. 1997/711), the Indictments (Procedure) (Modification) Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3045) and the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 2000 (S.I. 2000/3360).

==== Northern Ireland ====
See the Indictments Act (Northern Ireland) 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1945/16/contents |title=Indictments Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scotland ====
In Scotland, all of these cases brought in the [[High Court of Justiciary]] are brought in the name of the [[Lord Advocate]] and will be tried on indictment. In a [[sheriff court]] where trials proceed using the [[solemn proceedings]] they will also be tried on indictment and are brought in the name of a [[procurator fiscal]].

=== United States ===
The [[Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]] states in part: "No person shall be held to answer for a [[Capital punishment in the United States#Crimes subject to capital punishment|capital]], or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia when in actual service in time of War or public danger". The requirement of an indictment has not been [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated]] against the states; therefore, although the federal government uses grand juries and indictments, not all U.S. states do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= [[Hurtado v. California]] |vol= 110 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= 516 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1884 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/110/516/case.html |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many, but not all, [[United States]] jurisdictions that use grand juries, prosecutors often have a choice between seeking an indictment from a [[grand jury]] and filing a charging document directly with the court. Such a document is usually called an ''[[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]]'', ''accusation'', or ''complaint'', to distinguish it from a grand-jury indictment.  To protect the suspect's [[Due process|due-process]] rights in felony cases (where the suspect's interest in liberty is at stake), there is usually a [[preliminary hearing]], at which a judge determines whether there was probable cause to arrest the suspect who is in custody.  If the judge finds such probable cause, he or she binds, or holds over, the suspect for trial.

The substance of an indictment or other charging instrument is usually the same, regardless of the jurisdiction: it consists of a short and plain statement of where, when, and how the defendant allegedly committed the offense. Each offense usually is set out in a separate ''count''. Indictments for complex crimes, particularly those involving [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] or numerous counts, may run to hundreds of pages. However, in other cases an indictment for a crime as serious as [[murder]], may consist of a single sheet of paper.

Indictable offenses are normally tried by [[jury]], unless the accused waives the right to a jury trial. Although the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] mandates the right to a jury trial in any criminal prosecution, the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are resolved by the [[Plea bargain|plea-bargaining]] process.

== Direct indictment (Canada) ==
A direct indictment is one in which the case is sent directly to trial before a preliminary inquiry is completed or when the accused has been discharged by a preliminary inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XIX_1::bo-ga:l_XX//en?page=13&amp;isPrinting=false#codese:577|title=Criminal Code, Revised Statutes of Canada 1985, c.

==Sealed indictment==
An indictment can be sealed so that it stays non-public until it is unsealed. This can be done for a number of reasons. It may be unsealed, for example, once the named person is arrested or has been notified by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sealed-indictment/|title=USLegal - Legal Help|accessdate=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A superseding indictment takes the place of the previous indictment in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7845">{{Tort law|intentional}}

An '''intentional tort''' is a category of [[torts]] that describes a civil wrong resulting from an intentional act on the part of the [[tortfeasor]] (alleged wrongdoer).  The term [[negligence]], on the other hand, pertains to a tort that simply results from the failure of the tortfeasor to take sufficient care in fulfilling a duty owed, while [[strict liability|strict liability torts]] refers to situations where a party is liable for injuries no matter what precautions were taken.

==Why intentional torts are different==
As a matter of [[public policy]], damages available for intentional torts tend to be broader and more generous than for negligent torts. To preserve individual well-being and overall social welfare, [[society]] generally wishes to deter its members from intentionally attacking each other.  For example, in the [[United States]], it is easier to get [[punitive damages]] (damages above and beyond [[compensatory damages]]) if one can prove that the tort was intentional. Similarly, in most Australian jurisdictions, intentional torts are not included in civil liability legislation, thus excluding the threshold of injury and damages payouts from various legislated limitations and caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodland|first1=C|last2=O'Brien|first2=P|title=Intentional Tort Litigation in Australia Assault, False Imprisonment, Malicious Prosecution and Related Claims|date=2015|publisher=Federation Press|location=Sydney, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it is harder to prove intentional torts because as with many felony crimes, one must prove subjective elements involving the content of the defendant's mind, and defendants do not always express their harmful intent out loud or in writing.

==How to tell the difference==
The key difference between intentional torts and negligent torts is that the plaintiff must prove the ''additional'' element that the defendant acted with the specific '''intent''' to perform (''i.e.,'' acted with a mental state of intentionally performing) the act that was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries (so-called [[Malice (law)|malice]]). "The concept of 'intention' in the intentional torts does not require that defendants know that their acts will result in harm to the plaintiffs. Defendants must know only that their acts will result in certain consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Klar, Lewis. Tort Law. Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2008, p32.&lt;/ref&gt; Under doctrines such as [[transferred intent]], the plaintiff need not always prove that the defendant acted with the intent to bring about the specific injury that actually occurred.

Not every intentional action qualifies as an intentional tort.  Suppose an investor holding more than half of a corporation's stock votes on changes the other stockholders find detrimental. If the other stockholders suffer [[damages]] as a result, this is not a tort (in the majority of jurisdictions), as the powerful investor had a right to vote whichever way he liked.  Thus, the other stockholders cannot sue the aforementioned investor for damages.  (California is the notable exception to this rule, at least as to closely held corporations.&lt;ref&gt;''Stephenson v. Drever'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/16C4t1167.htm 16 Cal. 4th 1167] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v. H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/1C3d93.htm 1 Cal. 3d 93] (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;)  If, however, John Doe physically attacks a passerby in the street, John is liable for these costs, as he is guilty of the tort of [[battery (tort)|battery]]. Actual damages are not required for a prima facie case of battery.

To successfully sue a [[defendant]] liable for an intentional tort, the [[plaintiff]] must prove that the defendant performed the action leading to the damages the plaintiff alleges, and that the defendant acted with purpose, or that he had knowledge with [[Substantial certainty doctrine|substantial certainty]] that an act would result in a tortious result.  A famous case in the 1800s involved a hemophiliac child (Vosburg) who was kicked by another child (Putney) at school, resulting in severe disability of the leg.  Although the kicker could not have reasonably foreseen that the kick would cause severe disability, he certainly could have foreseen that it would cause discomfort, and was found liable.

For example, a plaintiff attempting to prove that a defendant committed the intentional tort of [[battery (tort)|battery]] must fulfill several elements: intent, an act, cause, and harmful or offensive contact.

Here, "intent" means either purpose or "knowledge with substantial certainty," as elucidated in [[Garratt v. Dailey]]. "Cause" in an intentional tort need only be "actual cause;" that is, but for the defendant's action the tortious result would not have occurred.  The plaintiff need not allege or prove proximate cause, which would indicate that the result of the defendant's actions was reasonably foreseeable.

[[Common law]] intentional torts include the following:
*[[Assault (tort)|Assault]]
*[[Battery (tort)|Battery]]
*[[Conversion (law)|Conversion]]
*[[False imprisonment]]
*Trespass to land
*Trespass to chattels (Personal property)
*[[Intentional infliction of emotional distress]]

An assault is the immediate intentional creation of apprehension of another without consent or privilege. A battery is the intentional harmful or offensive touching of another without consent or privilege. A conversion is the intentional exercise of dominion and control of another's property without their consent or privilege. False imprisonment is the intent to confine or bound someone without a means of egress. Trespass to land is the intentional interference with the land of another without consent or privilege. Trespass to chattel is the intentional interference with the personal property of another without consent or privilege.

==Property torts==
[[Property tort]]s are a specific class of intentional torts that arise when the right invaded is a property right rather than a personal right.(land is taken from someone, and they didn't know it was theirs because it was passed down.) These include [[trespass to land]] (entering someone's land without permission), [[trespass to chattels]] (handling items owned by another without permission), and [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] (taking possession of someone else's property with the intent not to return it). 
Some older, and largely obsolete, property law concepts include [[detinue]], [[replevin]], and [[trover]].

==Dignitary torts==
[[Dignitary torts]] are the class of intentional tort, including [[slander and libel]], that arise when the right invaded involves the reputation or privacy of the individual claiming industry.

==Insurability==
Generally, intentional torts are uninsurable as a matter of public policy, meaning that tortfeasors guilty of such torts must pay damages out of their own pocket (if they have any money worth going after).  Otherwise, professional criminals could obtain [[liability insurance]] to insure against the risk of being caught and prosecuted by the state, or sued in civil actions by their victims.

Of course, this rule has not stopped criminals from attempting to litigate whether particular intentional torts are not really intentional (meaning that their liability insurers would have a duty to defend and indemnify them).  The [[Supreme Court of California]] forcefully shot down one such attempt: "[California Insurance Code] Section 533 precludes coverage in this case because [[child molestation]] is ''always'' intentional, it is ''always'' wrongful, and it is ''always'' harmful."&lt;ref&gt;''J. C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M. K.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/52C3d1009.htm 52 Cal. 3d 1009] (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Montecitorio Rom 2009.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Palazzo Montecitorio]], seat of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Italian Republic]], one of the two branches of the Parliament.]]

The '''Italian Electoral law of 2017''', colloquially known by the nickname '''''Rosatellum bis''''' or simply '''''Rosatellum''''', after [[Ettore Rosato]], the Democratic leader in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] who first proposed the new law, is a [[parallel voting|parallel voting system]], which act as a mixed system, with 37% of seats allocated using a [[first past the post electoral system]] and 61% using a proportional method, with one round of voting. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not differ in the way they allocated the proportional seats, both using the [[largest remainder method]] of allocating seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/cards/come-funziona-rosatellum/iter_principale.shtml Rosatellum, come funziona la legge elettorale e cosa prevede]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2017-09-21/rosatellum-20-tutti-rischi-nuovo-patto-nazareno-082520.shtml?uuid=AEVDe3WC Rosatellum 2.0, tutti i rischi del nuovo Patto del Nazareno]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new electoral law was supported by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] and its government ally [[Popular Alternative]], but also by the opposition parties [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]], [[Lega Nord]] and [[Liberal Popular Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/10/07/il-patto-a-quattro-pd-ap-lega-fi-regge-primo-ok-al-rosatellum-martedi-in-aula-alla-camera_a_23235808/ Il patto a quattro Pd-Ap-Lega-Fi regge. Primo ok al Rosatellum, ma da martedì in Aula entra nel mirino dei franchi tiratori]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many protests from the [[Five Star Movement]], the [[Article 1 – Democratic and Progressive Movement|Democratic and Progressive Movement]], [[Italian Left]] and [[Brothers of Italy]], the electoral law was approved on 12 October by the Chamber of Deputies with 375 votes in favor and 215 against,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/10/12/news/il_rosatellum_alla_prova_del_voto_segreto_finale-178045315/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P3-S1.8-T1 Rosatellum approvato alla Camera. Evitata la trappola dello scrutinio segreto. Via libera al salva-Verdini]&lt;/ref&gt; and on 26 October by the Senate with 214 votes against 61.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/10/26/news/legge_elettorale_verdini_noi_sempre_in_maggioranza_e_ci_resteremo_-179372181/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P1-S1.8-T1 Il Rosatellum bis è legge dello Stato: via libera definitivo al Senato con 214 sì]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law regulates the election of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Italian Senate|Senate of the Republic]], replacing the ''[[#Porcellum (2005-2015)|Porcellum]]'' of 2005 and the ''[[Italian electoral law of 2015|Italicum]]'' of 2015, both modified by the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] after judging them partly unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.camera.it/leg17/465?tema=riforma_elettorale] {{lang|it|Riforma elettorale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ettore Rosato 2015.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Ettore Rosato]], Democratic leader in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] and main proponent of the new electoral law.]]
As a consequence of the result of the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 2016|December 2016 constitutional referendum]], in which the Senate reform was rejected, the two chambers of the Italian Parliament ended up with two different electoral laws, which lacked uniformity. As a matter of fact, the electoral law for the Chamber of Deputies passed by Matteo Renzi's government, the so-called ''Italicum'', based on a strong winner-take-all principle, was still in effect, whereas in the Senate a pure proportional system (the remnants of the so-called ''Porcellum'', the electoral law approved by the cabinet of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in 2005 and then declared extensively [[unconstitutional]] by the Constitutional Court in January 2014) was in force. The two systems differed on several aspects, among which the possibility of forming coalitions before the elections (only allowed at the Senate) and the election thresholds.

In June 2017, the Democratic Party together with the Five Star Movement, Forza Italia and Lega Nord agreed on a law, known as ''Tedeschellum'', which was based on a similar system to the one used in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2017/06/04/legge-elettorale-regge-accordo-su-tedescum-saltano-capilista-bloccati_780d2f92-8093-4108-b7bd-f7ebaedcce36.html Ecco il "Fianum", poco tedesco e molto senatoriale]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agreement among the four parties did not survive a secret-ballot vote during the first reading at the Chamber of Deputies and the bill was put aside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2017-06-08/dai-cinque-stelle-l-idea-filmare-propri-voti-segreti-aula-100414.shtml?uuid=AEQSNmaB Franchi tiratori in azione, salta patto Pd-M5s. Fiano: la legge elettorale è morta]&lt;/ref&gt;

After few weeks [[Ettore Rosato]], the leader of the group of the Democratic Party at the Chamber of Deputies, proposed a new bill based on a mixed system, with half of the seats allocated using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and the other half using a proportional allocation. The bill was not popular in its original version, since several opposition parties considered the number of seats allocated with the FPTP system too high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/05/11/news/legge_elettorale_la_proposta_pd_un_mattarellum_corretto_in_senso_proporzionale-165182409/ Cos'è il Rosatellum proposto dal Pd come legge elettorale: un Mattarellum corretto]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later and revised version of the ''Rosatellum'', known as ''Rosatellum bis'' was approved by PD, FI, LN, AP and ALA in October 2017, becoming the new electoral law for both the houses of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.internazionale.it/notizie/2017/10/27/rosatellum-legge-elettorale-cosa-prevede Cosa prevede il Rosatellum, la nuova legge elettorale]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characteristics and operation==
The national elections use a [[parallel voting|parallel voting system]], with 36.{{overline|825396}}% of seats allocated using a [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] electoral system and 63.{{overline|174603}}% using a proportional method (the latter including the seats allocated to Italians abroad), with one round of voting. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not differ in the way they allocated the proportional seats, both using the [[largest remainder method]] of allocating seats.

The [[Italian Senate|Senate of the Republic]] included 315 elected members, of whom:
* 116 are directly elected in single-member districts.
* 193 are elected by regional proportional representation.
* 6 are elected by the Italians abroad.
* a small, variable number of [[senator for life|senators-for-life]] include former presidents of the Republic and several other persons appointed for life by a president of the Republic (no more than 5), according to special constitutional provisions (scientists, writers, artists, social workers, politicians, tycoons).

The Senate is elected on a single ballot. The ballot includes the district's member, on a purely plurality basis and the parties and party-lists were listed that supported him, which was used to determine the proportional seats, allocated within one single national constituency, with a 3% minimum threshold for party representation.

The [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] had 630 members, of whom
* 232 are directly elected in single member districts.
* 386 are elected by national proportional representation.
* 12 are elected by the Italians abroad.

As the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies is elected on a single ballot.

The complicated mechanism known as [[scorporo]], which was used to tabulate PR votes in the ''Mattarellum'', was abolished in the new electoral law.

The law also re-introduced a [[closed list]] system for the party lists on the second ballot, i.e., excluding voters from the decision as to which members of that party would enter parliament, thereby guaranteeing reelection of party leaders whose popular support was rapidly declining (new elections were to be held once the new electoral law was fully implemented).

===Voting paper===
[[File:Rosatellum's voting paper.svg|thumb|The voting paper]]
The voting paper, which is a single one for the first-past-the-post and the proportional systems, shows the names of the candidates to single-member constituencies and, in close conjunction with them, the symbols of the linked lists for the proportional part, each one with a list of the relative candidates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.it/politica/elezioni/politiche-2018/come-si-vota.html Elezioni, come si vota con il Rosatellum, debutta la nuova scheda elettorale]&lt;/ref&gt;

The voter will be able to cast his vote in three different ways:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agi.it/politica/rosatellum_come_funziona-2295382/news/2017-10-27/ Il Rosatellum bis è legge. Ma come funziona?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drawing a sign on the symbol of a list: in this case the vote extends to the candidate in the [[single-member constituency]] which is supported by that list.
* Drawing a sign on the name of the candidate of the single-member constituency and another one on the symbol of one list that supports him: the result is the same as that described above; [[panachage]] is not permitted, meaning voters can not vote simultaneously for a candidate in the FPTP constituency and for a party list which is not linked to him.
* Drawing a sign only on the name of the candidate for the FPTP constituency, without indicating any list: in this case, the vote is valid for the candidate in the single-member constituency and also automatically extended to the list that supports him; if that candidate is however connected to several lists, the vote is divided proportionally between them, based on the votes that each one has obtained in that constituency.

In an effort to mitigate fragmentation, [[split-ticket voting]] is not allowed.

===Italicum (2015–2017)===
{{main|Italian electoral law of 2015}}
The Italian electoral law of 2015, better known as ''Italicum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{it}}[http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2015-05-08&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=15G00066&amp;elenco30giorni=true {{lang|it|LEGGE 6 maggio 2015, n. 52}}].&lt;/ref&gt; a name given to it in 2014 by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] secretary and subsequently [[President of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|head of government]] [[Matteo Renzi]], who was its main proponent (until the end of January 2015 with the support of [[Forza Italia]]'s leader [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) provides for a [[two-round system]] based on [[party-list proportional representation]] (the former being ruled out as unconstitutional),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italicum run-off KO'd, bonus OK'd|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2017/01/25/italicum-run-off-kod-bonus-okd_2c243c33-e49e-4758-bed0-01ea38bd6ee3.html|website=ANSA English}}&lt;/ref&gt; corrected by a [[majority bonus]] and a 3% [[election threshold]]. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] with [[open list]]s, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.

The law, which came into force on 1 July 2016, regulates the election of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], replacing the [[#Porcellum (2005-2015)|previous electoral law]] of 2005, modified by the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] in December 2013 after judging it partly unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.camera.it/leg17/465?tema=riforma_elettorale] {{lang|it|Riforma elettorale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was written under the assumption that, by the time it came into force, the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|upper house]] would have become an indirectly-elected body representing [[regions of Italy|regions]], with greatly reduced powers, thus making a reform of its electoral system unnecessary. The upper-house reform, rejected in [[Italian constitutional referendum, 2016|the 4 December 2016 Constitutional Referendum]], was originally assumed to be adopted without a Referendum by 1 July 2016.

It is the first electoral law approved by the Italian Parliament but never used in a general election.

==== History ====
The electoral law passed by the centre-right government in 2005 immediately received widespread criticism: among other things, critics called into question the use of long [[closed list]]s of candidates (which gave party executives great power in deciding the composition of the Parliament), and the regional mechanism of allocation of seats in the Senate (which made the existence of a "clear winner" of the elections less likely).

After two unsuccessful attempts at repealing the law by referendum, in the [[Italian general election, 2013|2013 general election]] the law failed to produce a majority in the Senate; as a consequence, the only way to form a government was by means of a [[grand coalition]] between left-wing and right-wing parties that had harshly fought each other in the election. The resulting [[Letta Cabinet]] was perceived by many people as the second "unelected government" in a row (after the [[Monti Cabinet]]).

While the coalition agreed that a new electoral law was needed, it failed to agree on a specific model. The Democratic Party executive and prime minister [[Enrico Letta]] even went as far as requesting that his party vote against a parliamentary initiative by fellow democrat [[Roberto Giachetti]] to restore the previous Mattarella law. This was probably done out of concern that the grand coalition supporting his government would not hold.

On 4 December 2013, the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Constitutional Court]] judged the electoral law of 2005 partly unconstitutional: in particular, its unlimited [[majority bonus]] was repealed. This made an electoral reform ever more urgent, since proportional representation without majoritarian correction is thought to be incompatible with the competitive party system of Italy.

A few days after, on 8 December 2013, [[Matteo Renzi]] became the new leader of the Democratic Party. In his victory speech, he vowed to change the electoral law against the risk of "''stabilized grand coalitions''". Renzi's initiative ultimately led to him taking Letta's place as the prime minister. Finally, Renzi made a deal with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] for a set of institutional reforms, including a new majority-assuring law based on a two-round system, conceived to make the event of a forced Grand Coalition impossible.

The bill still faced harsh opposition, even from members of the proposing parties: however it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 March 2014 and, in an amended form, by the Senate on 27 January 2015 with the support of a large majority.

After the election of [[Sergio Mattarella]] as the new President of Italy on 31 January 2015, Berlusconi withdrew his support of the bill. In order for it to receive its final approval by the Chamber of Deputies, the government decided to link it to a confidence vote (hinting at a [[snap election]] in case of a negative outcome). The bill was finally approved on 4 May 2015 and signed by President Mattarella two days later.

==== Main characteristics and operation ====
The Italicum system regulates the attribution of 617 of the 630 seats of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], excluding 12 seats attributed to representatives of Italians living abroad, and one seat for the [[Aosta Valley]] region. An uncommon feature of this system is that it is ''majority assuring'', thanks to a [[majority bonus|jackpot]] that is assigned to the winning party, possibly after a second electoral round.

The territory of Italy is divided into 100 [[constituency|constituencies]] electing between 3 and 9 deputies depending on their size. For each constituency, the parties designate a list of candidates: "head of list" candidates can run in up to 10 constituencies, while other candidates are limited to a single constituency. Gender balance is promoted by requiring that, in each [[Regions of Italy|region]], head of lists of either sex for the same party should not exceed 60% of the total; additionally, candidates in all lists must be in a sequence alternating by gender.

At the first round, electors receive a ballot allowing them to vote for a single party and for its head of list candidate (pre-printed on the ballot), and are given the option to express up to two additional [[open list|preference votes]] for other candidates of that party, by writing their name next to the party symbol. If two preference votes are expressed, they must be of a different sex: otherwise, the second preference is discarded.

Only parties passing a 3% minimum threshold in the first round are assigned seats. If the party receiving the plurality of the votes passes a 40% threshold, it is attributed a minimum of 340 seats (54%). The remaining seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, and no second round takes place.

If no party has been able to pass the 40% threshold, a second round takes place two weeks after the first one: this time electors receive a ballot where they are allowed to choose between the two parties that received most votes in the first round. The party winning the second round is attributed 340 seats, and the remaining 277 seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, according to the results of the first round.

The proportional allocation of seats follows the [[largest remainder method]]. Each party receives a certain number of seats depending on its national result: these seats are then projected onto the 100 constituencies and attributed to the candidates of that constituency, starting from the head of list and then according to the number of preference votes.

An amendment, known as "Erasmus amendment", makes sure Italians studying abroad in the [[Erasmus programme]] can vote.

====Constitutional review====

On February 24, 2016 a court in Messina sent the election law for review to the [[Constitutional Court]]: declaring admissible the application&lt;ref&gt;To save the Italicum from the application that hangs over its head, it would have been enough to pass an amendment to Article 66 of the Constitution, thereby eliminating the electoral esclusive cognisaince of the elected House, which is unknown in other countries : {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Legge elettorale: l’Italicum e la Corte|journal= Mondoperaio edizione online|date=2015| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89427357}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; by petitioners,&lt;ref&gt;They objected to the law mainly on the grounds that it awards an unfairly large bonus to the winner and does not sufficiently enable voters to pick their MPs: http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/02/24/court-sends-election-law-to-constitutional-court-2_650916ba-6698-4589-8f83-68469f3234bb.html&lt;/ref&gt; the judges called for the Constitutional Court to decide whether eight out of the petitioners' 13 claims that the Italicum breached the Italian Constitution. The Constitutional Court might still decide that the unconstitutionality hypothesis is not founded, and even refuse to examine it. The court's decision is not expecting until after 2017 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.italy24.ilsole24ore.com/art/politics/2016-09-20/italicum-130742.php?uuid=ADuoy2NB|title=Constitutional Court postpones judgment on new electoral law after referendum a done deal|website=Constitutional Court postpones judgment on new electoral law after referendum a done deal|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constitutional reform bill passed by the Italian Parliament in April 2016, which is still awaiting popular confirmation by referendum, will require the Constitutional Court to decide on the consititutional legitimacy of the electoral law even if the aforementioned application is rejected. This extraordinary procedure will only take place if the referendum confirms the bill.

===Porcellum (2005–2015)===
The previous electoral law had a series of thresholds to encourage parties to form coalitions. It replaced an [[Additional Member System|Additional Member]] electoral system which had been introduced in the 1990s. The attempt to change the law with the referendum failed&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/2065806/Inammissibilità_del_ritaglio_referendario_e_revisione_del_diritto_elettorale Giampiero Buonomo, {{lang|it|Perché non-poteva essere considerato ammissibile}}].&lt;/ref&gt; and was the Constitutional Court, the judgment no. 1 of 2014, to eliminate various unconstitutional elements that were part of the law.

The [[Preferential block voting|block voting]] system is nationwide-based for the House, and regional-based for the Senate. Italy is divided into a certain number of districts for the Chamber of Deputies, whereas each Region elects its senators. Each district is assigned a number of seats proportionate to its total of the population of Italy. The winning coalition receives at least 55% of the seats on national level in the House, and on regional level in the Senate, while the remaining seats are proportionally divided between minority parties. For the House, seats won by each party are then allocated at district level to decide the elected candidates. Candidates on the lists are ranked in order of priority, so if a party wins for example ten seats, the first ten candidates on its list receive seats in parliament.

The law officially recognized coalitions of parties: to be part of a coalition, a party must sign its official program and indicate its support for the coalition's candidate to the prime-ministership.

====Chamber of Deputies====
For the Chamber of Deputies, Italy is divided into 26 constituencies: [[Lombardy]] has three constituencies, [[Piedmont]], Veneto, [[Lazio]], Campania, and [[Sicily]] each have two, and all other [[Regions of Italy|regions]] have one. These constituencies jointly elect 617 MPs. Additionally one MP is elected from the [[Aosta Valley]] and 12 are elected by a constituency consisting of Italians living abroad.
Seats are allocated among the parties that pass thresholds of the total vote on a ''national basis'':
* Minimum 10% for a coalition. If this requirement is not met, the 4% limit for single parties apply.
* Minimum 4% for any party not in a coalition.
* Minimum 2% for any party in a coalition, except that the first party below 2% in a coalition does receive seats.

Also, parties representing regional linguistic minorities obtain seats if they receive at least 20% of the ballots in their constituency.

In order to guarantee a working majority, a coalition or party which obtains a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the vote, but less than 340 seats, is assigned additional seats to reach that number, corresponding roughly to a 54% majority.

Inside each coalition, seats are divided between parties with a [[Counting single transferable votes#Hare method|Hare method]], and consequently assigned to each constituency to elect single candidates.

====Senate of the Republic====
[[File:Rome Palazzo Madama 10-01-2011 13-00-15 adjusted.JPG|313x313px|right|thumb|[[Palazzo Madama]], hosts the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate of the Republic]], the upper branch.]]
For the Senate, the constituencies correspond to the 20 [[regions of Italy]], with 6 senators allocated for Italians living abroad. The electoral system is partly similar to the one for the lower house, but is in many ways transferred to regional basis. After judgment 1/2014 of the Constitutional Court, the voting system for the Senate aims at party-list proportional representation without majority bonus. The thresholds are different, and applied on a ''regional basis'':
* Minimum 20% for a coalition.
* Minimum 8% for any party not in a coalition.
* Minimum 3% for any party in a coalition.

The electoral system for the senate, proportional representation without majority bonus, does not guarantee a clear majority for any party-list in the Senate, unlike the national super-assignment system in the Chamber of Deputies.

====Criticism====

The new electoral law has come under wide criticism from the centre-left opposition since its introduction for a series of reasons:
;Instability:The system is considered by its opposers to be less stable than the previous [[additional member system]]. The region-based system in the upper house is not guaranteed to produce a clear majority, and may pave the way for governmental crises. In reality, it's not clear how previous AM system could itself eliminate this problem. Despite this criticism, Berlusconi's coalition won a clear majority after 2008 elections, both in House and Senate.

;Large Party Bias
:It was widely alleged in the press at the time of its introduction, that the new system had been custom-designed by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s government to give advantage to his [[House of Freedoms]] coalition in the 2006 elections, by eliminating seats for the numerous small parties on the Left that might not reach the 2% threshold. In the event however, these small parties formed alliances to reach the threshold, and the Center-Left won a surprise victory despite the system.

;"Partitocracy"
:It has been alleged that Italian parties have retained too much power in the [[Politics of Italy#First Republic: 1946-1994|First Republic]], screening the choices citizens had in elections; this electoral law would maintain fixed electoral lists, where voters can only express a preference for a list but not for a specific candidate. This can be used by parties to all but guarantee re-election to unpopular but powerful figures, who would be weaker in a [[first past the post electoral system]] (a system never used in Italy in its pure form after WWI).

;Adaptation to [[Opinion poll|Gallup]]s
:In Italian elections the left-wing tends to fare better in direct confrontation than in proportional voting, a sign there are voters who trust left-wing candidates but right-wing political parties, for reasons that can be debated. It is alleged that the centre-right majority in the Parliament undertook this reform to boost their chances in the upcoming elections of 2006 (they indeed lost by a very small margin).

;No agreement with the opposition
: The law was passed by the majority against the opinion of the opposition. Many felt that the "rules of the game" should be agreed upon by everybody, and not imposed by one side.

===Mattarellum (1993–2005)===
Between 1991 and 1993, resulting from two referendums and legislation, Italian [[electoral]] law was altered substantially. Electoral law in Italy is determined by Parliament, not by the constitution. This, along with the concurrent collapse of the Italian [[party system]], marks the transition between the First and Second Italian Republics.

====Two referendums====
The nearly pure [[proportional representation]] system of the First Republic had resulted not only in party fragmentation and therefore governmental instability, but also insulation of the parties from the electorate and civil society. This was known in Italian as ''partitocrazia'', in contrast to democracy, and resulted in corruption and pork-barrel politics. The Italian constitution allows, with substantial hurdles, ''abrogative referendums'', enabling citizens to delete laws or parts of laws passed by Parliament (with exceptions).

A reform movement known as ''COREL'' (Committee to Promote Referendums on Elections), led by maverick DC-member [[Mario Segni]], proposed three referendums, one of which was allowed by the Constitutional Court (at that time packed with members of the PSI and hostile to the movement). The June 1991 referendum therefore asked voters if they wanted to reduce the number of [[Open list|preferences]], from three or four to one, in the Chamber of Deputies, to reduce the abuse of the open-list system by party elites and ensure accurate delegation of parliamentary seats to candidates popular with voters. With 62.5% of the Italian electorate voting, the referendum passed with 95% of those voting in favor. This was seen as a vote against the ''partitocrazia'', which had campaigned against the referendum.

Emboldened by their victory in 1991, and encouraged by the unfolding [[Mani pulite]] scandals and the substantial loss of votes for the traditional parties in the 1992 general elections, the reformers pushed forward with another referendum, abolishing the proportional representation system of the Italian Senate, implicitly supporting a plurality system that would theoretically force parties to come together around two ideological poles, thereby providing governmental stability. This referendum was held in April 1993, and passed with the support of 80% of those voting. This caused the Amato government to collapse three days later.   Municipal elections were held in June 1993, further illustrating the lack of legitimacy the sitting parliament held. The President of Italy, [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], thereupon appointed a [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic government]], led by former head of the Bank of Italy, [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], with the sole task of writing a new electoral law.

As it was under no constitutional obligation to enact a purely majoritarian system (nor were they under obligation to promulgate a new electoral law for the Chamber of Deputies), and cognizant of its declining popular support, the sitting parliament enacted a new electoral law in August 1993 that provided for single-member districts while reflecting their own interests. Despite this, many of them would be voted out of office in the national election in March 1994.

====The electoral law====
The national elections used an [[Additional Member System]], which in Italy was a mixed system, with 75% of seats allocated using a [[First Past the Post electoral system]] and 25% using a proportional method, with one round of voting. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not differ in the way they allocated the proportional seats, both using the [[D'Hondt method]] of allocating seats.

The [[Italian Senate|Senate]] included 315 elected members, of whom:
* 232 are directly elected in single-member districts.
* 83 are elected by regional proportional representation.
* a small, variable number of [[senator for life|senators-for-life]] include former presidents of the Republic and several other persons appointed for life by a president of the Republic (no more than 5), according to special constitutional provisions (scientists, writers, artists, social workers, politicians, tycoons).

The Senate was elected on a single ballot. All those votes not contributing to a winning candidate were thrown into a regional pool, where the seats were allocated proportionally. There was no [[electoral threshold]] for the Senate.

The [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] had 630 members, of whom
* 475 are directly elected in single member districts.
* 155 are elected by regional proportional representation.

The Chamber of Deputies used two ballots. The first ballot elected that district's member, on a purely plurality basis. The second ballot, in which only parties and party-lists were listed, was used to determine the proportional seats, allocated within one single national constituency, with a 4% minimum threshold for party representation.

A complicated mechanism known as [[scorporo]], a previously unknown word in Italian politics, was used to tabulate PR votes. The number of votes cast for candidates coming in second place on the ''first ballot (SMD)'' would be subtracted from the number of votes earned on the ''second ballot (PR)'' by the party of the winning candidate in the first ballot. This would be repeated for each single-member district. This was developed – against the overwhelming opinion expressed in the referendums – to dampen the effect of the first-past-the-post system, which it was feared that it might promote the prevalence of one political party, especially parties that were strong in one geographical area.

The law also introduced a [[closed list]] system for the party lists on the second ballot, i.e., excluding voters from the decision as to which members of that party would enter parliament, thereby guaranteeing reelection of party leaders whose popular support was rapidly declining (new elections were to be held once the new electoral law was fully implemented). Ironically, that is what allowed Mario Segni, the leader of the reform movement, to enter parliament on the proportional ballot after the March 1994, elections, having broken with his party in March 1993, and then reunited with one of its shattered remnants that December.

The system did not accomplish the goals desired by the voters. The first parliament elected after the electoral reform produced [[Berlusconi I Cabinet|Silvio Berlusconi's first government]], which lasted eight months. Small parties still enter parliament and form unstable coalitions. On the other hand, political parties in Italy seem to be coalescing around two poles, if imperfectly so, and governments have lasted much longer, at least by Italian standards. On that level, the electoral reform can be seen as an improvement over the electoral law prior to it, even if Italy has now returned to a party-list system.

===The 1946–1993 electoral system===
Between 1946 and 1993, Italy used an electoral system that was a nearly pure proportional representation system, which was subject to two insignificant thresholds:

#that a party needed to achieve 300,000 votes at the national level;
#Italy was divided into 32 electoral regions (''circoscrizioni''), of unequal size, which were awarded a certain number of seats in Parliament based on population (e.g., Rome received more than 50). Within these regions, seats were divided proportionally; in order to become a member of parliament, a party member needed to be directly elected within one of these regions – approximately 60,000 votes. This system allocated 90% of the seats in both houses of parliament. The votes that did not go to a winning candidate were then thrown into one national electoral district, which was then divided proportionally and used to determine the remaining 10%, thereby going to candidates not directly elected.

Furthermore, voters were able to list their preferences for candidates on a party list, in order to prevent the parties from exploiting the power they acquired from being able to write their party lists. In practice, however, parties were able to manipulate these numbers so that preferred members, i.e., members loyal to one faction within a party, could enter parliament.

As neither of these thresholds was difficult to achieve, this system naturally benefitted the small parties. This was exacerbated by the fact that the Lower House has 630 seats. Because of the design of the electoral law did not provide for any mechanism to exclude small parties (indeed, it seemed designed to encourage them) or provide any incentives to avoid splintering, this resulted in highly unstable coalition governments (the average length was nine months) and political turbulence; and because voters had little control over which candidates entered parliament, political parties were insulated from the wishes of civil society. Relations between political elites and the masses therefore became clientelistic; voter behavior and politics in general became a contest as to which party could secure more pork-barrel investment for a specific region. It also allowed politicians to become corrupt.

'''''Kingstreet Investments Ltd v New Brunswick''''' [2007] [http://canlii.ca/t/1q7z6 1 SCR 3] is a Canadian [[unjust enrichment]] case, concerning to what extent enrichment of the defendant must be at the expense of the claimant.

==Facts==
Kingstreet Investments ran licensed nightclubs in New Brunswick. They bought alcohol from provincial retailers, paying a user charge on top of the retail price as regulation prescribed. They claimed the user charge was unconstitutional and sought relief with compound interest.

The Queen’s Bench held the user charge was an unconstitutional indirect tax, but denied recovery because Kingstreet had passed the burden on in increased prices. There was a passing on defence. Moreover, ultra vires taxes cannot generally be recovered. Robertson JA for the Court of Appeal held by a majority that restitution should be made for money from the time of legal proceedings, as that was the start of the protest. Before then, the passing on defence applied.

==Judgment==
Bastarache J for the Supreme Court, because unjust enrichment principles are ill-suited to determine constitutional issues of ultra vires taxes, that is the wrong approach. There should be a remedy as of constitutional right. When governments collect taxes ultra vires it undermines the rule of law. So there must be a right to restitution. Parliament can prevent fiscal chaos by suspending declarations of invalidity and enacting valid taxes and applying them retroactively. The passing on defence is inconsistent with restitution law, it confuses compensation matters, and is not concerned with the possibility that the claimant may receive a windfall. It is economically misconceived and creates difficulties of proof. There is no need to consider the counter arguments to passing on, of protest and compulsion. The six year limitation in the New Brunswick Limitation of Actions Act s 9 applied. There was no right to compound interest, which might be warranted to express a moral sanction.

{{Cquote|44. There are three major criticisms of the passing-on defence: first, that it is inconsistent with the basic premise of restitution law; second, that it is economically misconceived; and third, that the task of determining the ultimate location of the burden of a tax is exceedingly difficult and constitutes an inappropriate basis for denying relief.

45. The defence of passing on has developed almost exclusively in the context of recovery of taxes and other charges paid under a mistake of law...

46. [Quoting Brennan J in the Australian ''Royal Insurance'' case...] The fact that Royal had passed on to its policy holders the burden of the payments made to the Commissioner does not mean that Royal did not pay its own money to the Commissioner. The passing on of the burden of the payments made does not affect the situation that, as between the Commissioner and Royal, the former was enriched at the expense of the latter...

48. Unless the elasticity of demand is very low, the plaintiff is bound to suffer a loss, either because of reduced sales or because of reduced profit per sale. Where elasticity is low, and it can be demonstrated that the tax was passed on through higher prices that did not affect profits per sale or the volume of sales, it would be impossible to demonstrate that the plaintiff could not or would not have raised its prices had the tax not been imposed, thereby increasing its profits even further. LeBel J. referred to these various figures as "virtually unascertainable" (para. 205, citing White J. in ''[[Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.]]'', 392 U.S. 481 (1968), at p. 493). LeBel J. ultimately concluded that "[t]he passing on defence would, in effect, result in an argument that no damages are ever recoverable in commercial litigation because anyone who claimed to have suffered damages but was still solvent had obviously found a way to pass the loss on" (para. 206, citing Ground J. in ''[[Law Society of Upper Canada v. Ernst &amp; Young]]'' 2002 CanLII 49466 (ON SC), (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 214 (S.C.J.), at para. 40).

49. ...unlike restitution law, tort law is premised on the concept of compensation for loss, such that concerns about potential windfalls are appropriate.}}

This is a list of [[Treaty|treaties]] to which the [[United States]] has been a party or which have had direct relevance to U.S. history.

It is a very incomplete list.  For an official list, updated at least annually, of U.S. treaties and international agreements currently in force (i.e., excluding those, some of which are included on this page, that are no longer in force, and that are signed but not ratified or otherwise have not yet entered into force), divided between (1) bilateral treaties organized by state and then by topic, and (2) multilateral treaties organized by topic, see the annual State Department publication [https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/tif/ Treaties in Force].

==Pre-Revolutionary War treaties==

Before the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, the sovereign of the [[United Kingdom]] and the leaders of various North American colonies negotiated treaties that affected the territory of what would later become the USA.

* 1722 – [[Great Treaty of 1722]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlytreaties.unl.edu/treaty.00001.html The Great Treaty of 1722 Between the Five Nations, the Mahicans, and the Colonies of New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania], University of Nebraska–Lincoln&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. international treaties==
These are treaties which the United States has made with other sovereign international states. This is mostly to distinguish them from the next category. Under the [[Treaty Clause#Full text of the clause|treaty clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], treaties come into effect upon final ratification by the [[President of the United States]], provided that a two-thirds majority of the [[United States Senate]] concurs.&lt;ref&gt;However, not all ''international agreements'' are considered to be ''treaties'' requiring Senate concurrence. This is explained somewhat in a letter from U.S. Ambassador [[Thomas C. Hubbard]] to Philippine Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] in connection with the RP-US Vishe other countries, derives from the President's responsibilities for the conduct of foreign relations (Art. II, Sec. 1) and his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Senate advice and consent is not needed, inter alia, because the VFA and similar agreements neither change US domestic nor require congressional appropriation of funds. It is important to note that only about five percent of the international agreement entered into by the US Governments require Senate advice and consent.".

From 1778 to 1871, [[Outline of United States federal Indian law and policy|the United States government]] entered into more than 500 [[Treaty rights|treaties]] with the Native American tribes; all of these treaties have since been violated in some way or outright broken by the US government,&lt;ref name=Vargo&gt;{{cite web|last=Vargo |first=Samuel |title=With more than ..500 treaties already broken, the government can do whatever it wants, it seems...|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/11/21/1345986/-With-more-than-500-treaties-already-broken-the-government-can-do-whatever-it-wants-it-seems |accessdate=9 October 2016|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=21 November 2014|quote=More than 500 treaties have been made between the government and Indian tribes and all were broken, nulllified or amended.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toensing&gt;{{cite web|last=Toensing |first=Gale Courey  |title='Honor the Treaties': UN Human Rights Chief's Message |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/08/23/honor-treaties-un-human-rights-chiefs-message-150996 |accessdate=9 October 2016|publisher=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|date=23 August 2013|quote=The U.S. federal government entered into more than 500 treaties with Indian nations from 1778 to 1871; every one of them was "broken, changed or nullified when it served the government's interests," Helen Oliff wrote in "Treaties Made, Treaties Broken."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Egan |first=Timothy |title=Mending a Trail of Broken Treaties|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/25/weekinreview/the-nation-mending-a-trail-of-broken-treaties.html|accessdate=17 September 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeLoria&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLoria, Jr.|first=Vine|title=Behind the Trail of Broken Treaties: An Indian Declaration of Independence|year=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70754-2}} Entire book is dedicated to examining these broken treaties.&lt;/ref&gt; while at least one treaty was violated or broken by Native American tribes.&lt;ref name=Michno&gt;{{cite web|last=Michno|first=Gregory|title=The Indian Trail of Broken Treaties|year=2006|publisher=Wild West|page=42|quote=The ink, as they say was hardly dry on the treaty, when the signatory Indians rode off to Texas to take more captives.|url=http://studythepast.com/378_spring11/materials/broken_treaties.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, violations by one party do not nullify the treaties under US law; the treaties still have legal effect today, and Native Americans and [[First Nations]] peoples are still fighting for their treaty rights in federal courts and at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Toensing/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wildenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Wildenthal|first=Bryan H.|title=Native American Sovereignty on Trial: A Handbook with Cases, Laws, and Documents|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=122 |isbn=1-57607-625-3 |quote=The field of Indian law rests mainly on the old treaties.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Treaty Clause|treaties]], which are ratified by the US Senate and signed by the US President, there were also [[Acts of Congress]] and Executive Orders which dealt with land agreements. The U.S. military and representatives of a tribe, or sub unit of a tribe, signed documents which were understood at the time to be treaties, rather than [[armistice]]s, [[Ceasefire|ceasefires and truces]].

{{wiktionary|catchphrase}}

The following is a '''list of political [[catchphrase]]s''', that is, distinctive statements uttered by political figures that have gone on to become well known.

Catchphrases may originate as [[political slogan]]s, as portions of prepared [[speech]]es, or from spontaneous utterances, including [[gaffe]]s.  Most catchphrases are in the form of [[sound bite]]s.

==Argentina==

*"¡Seamos libres, que lo demás no importa nada!" ("Let us be free, for the rest doesn't matter!") – Said in a pre-battle speech in 1817 by General [[José de San Martín]] to his troops just before the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] during the [[Crossing of the Andes]].
*"Tomar a todo el país como Dios y el hombre lo han hecho." ("Take the whole country as God and man have made it.") – Spoken by [[Bartolomé Mitre]] after the [[Battle of Pavon]] in 1861, about the need for national unification and federalization of all Argentine provinces.
*"Ahora comienza una época de paz y administración." ("Now we begin a period of peace and administration.") – Spoken by then President [[Julio Argentino Roca]] during his inauguration speech in 1880, promising that peace and national organization would be achieved in his presidency after nearly thirty years of civil war and internal conflict.
*"Que se rompa, pero que no se doble." ("Let it break, but never bend.") – The last words of [[Leandro Alem]], leader of the [[Unión Cívica Radical]], in his suicide letter, which was written in 1896. The phrase refers to his party's intransigent doctrine. Now commonly used as a slogan for the UCR.
*"La única verdad es la realidad." ("The only truth is reality.") – A phrase typically used by President [[Juan Domingo Perón]] when telling his allies to be rational.&lt;ref name="peron"&gt;[http://www.pjchaco.org/pagina?id=6628 Frases célebres de Juan Domingo Perón] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041531/http://www.pjchaco.org/pagina?id=6628 |date=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Mejor que decir es hacer, y mejor que prometer es realizar." ("Better than saying is doing, and better than promising is accomplishing.") – Perón, in a speech when he was Secretary of Labour and Welfare.&lt;ref name="peron"/&gt;
*"El año 2000 nos encontrará unidos o dominados." ("The year 2000 will find us united or dominated".) – Perón, talking about the need for [[Latin American integration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://juanfilloy.bib.unrc.edu.ar/completos/corredor/corredef/comi-c/CANDELAR.HTM Unidos o dominados: La visión de la integración latinoamericana en el pensamiento de Juan Domingo Perón en "La Hora de los Pueblos"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041531/http://juanfilloy.bib.unrc.edu.ar/completos/corredor/corredef/comi-c/CANDELAR.HTM |date=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Cuando uno de los nuestros caiga, caerán cinco de los de ellos." ("For each one of ours that falls, five of theirs will fall.") – Spoken by President Juan D. Perón on 31 August 1955, addressing his supporters to take revenge for the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombing of Buenos Aires by the military]] on 16 June the same year, which had caused around 300 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elortiba.org/160655.html The Bombing of Plaza de Mayo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027005302/http://www.elortiba.org/160655.html |date=27 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Ni vencedores ni vencidos." ("Neither victors nor beaten.") – General [[Eduardo Lonardi]] in September 1955, after [[Revolución Libertadora|overthrowing the government of Juan Perón]], and before being displaced by the [[hard-line]] antiperonists within the new government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encuentro.gov.ar/gallery/2206.pdf "La ‘Libertadora’ y la resistencia peronista"], page 4 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128183710/http://www.encuentro.gov.ar/gallery/2206.pdf |date=28 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Se acabó la leche de la clemencia." ("The milk of clemency is over.") – Deputy [[Américo Ghioldi]], inciting the [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu|military dictatorship of Aramburu]] to execute the [[Juan José Valle|leaders]] of a failed uprising, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/hoover_argentina_guide_eng.pdf 20TH Century Argentina in the Hoover Institution Archives] (page 16).&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Hay que pasar el invierno." ("We have to endure the winter.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elortiba.org/ayernomas2.html Ayer Nomas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415133628/http://www.elortiba.org/ayernomas2.html |date=15 April 2008 }}. Retrieved 26 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; – Said in 1960 by [[Álvaro Alsogaray]], Minister of Economy in the [[Arturo Frondizi|Frondizi]] government, referring to the hardships required to get through the economic troubles in the country, which was in dire need of oil.
*"No renunciaré, no me suicidaré, no me iré del país" ("I will not resign, I will not commit suicide, I will not leave the country.") – Said in 1962 by President [[Arturo Frondizi]] under the threat of a military coup d'état. He initially resisted his ousting but was eventually forced at gunpoint into arrest in the Isla Martín García Prison.
*"El comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas soy yo." ("The commander in chief of the armed forces is I.") – Said in 1966 by then President [[Arturo Illia]] to [[Juan Carlos Onganía|General Juan Carlos Onganía]] when the latter told the president that the armed forces were starting a coup d'état.

*"Estúpidos imberbes." ("Young idiots.") – Insult infamously used by Juan Perón to refer to the [[Montoneros]] faction of his party while expelling them from Plaza de Mayo.
*"Este viejo adversario despide a un amigo." ("This old adversary bids farewell to a friend.") – Said in 1974 by former head of the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]], [[Ricardo Balbín]] at [[Juan Domingo Perón]]'s funeral. Balbín had been Perón's biggest enemy during his political career, but the phrase symbolizes how, despite their enmity, Balbín was respectful enough to solemnly attend his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/b/balbin.php Biography of Ricardo Balbín] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128221706/http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/b/balbin.php |date=28 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the votes from the [[Romanian diaspora]] came in, Traian Băsescu won the elections, turning Mircea Geoană into the loser, his winning speech taking a ridiculous note in retrospect, with the part in which he thanks his wife, Mihaela Geoană, coming off as particularly memorable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/alegeri_2009/mircea-geoana-impreuna-am-invins-e-si-victoria-lui-crin-antonescu.html Pro TV News: We won together].

{{Criminal law}}
'''Malfeasance in office''', or '''official misconduct''', is
the commission of an [[Crime|unlawful]] act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties.  Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a [[just cause]] removal of an elected official by [[statute]] or [[recall election]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

An exact definition of [[malfeasance]] (or misfeasance (''Brit'')) in office is difficult: many highly regarded [[secondary source]]s (such as books and commentaries) compete over its established elements based on reported cases.  This confusion has arisen from the [[courts]] where no single consensus definition has arisen from the relatively few [[reporter (law)|reported]] appeal-level cases involving malfeasance in office.

==England and Wales==
Under [[English law]], '''misconduct''' (or '''misfeasance''') '''in public office''' is an offence at [[common law]] which dates back to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="CPS"&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/misconduct_in_public_office/ Crown Prosecution Service - Guidelines on Misconduct In Public Office]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Origin&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/nick-clegg-says-journalists-tried-paying-public-officials-should-have-clearer-public-interest |title= Nick Clegg says journalists tried for paying public officials should have clearer public interest defence in law |publisher=PressGazette |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence carries a maximum penalty of [[life imprisonment]].  It is confined to those who are [[public office]] holders, and is committed when the office holder acts (or neglects to act) in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/misconduct_in_public_office/|title=Misconduct in Public Office|last=|first=|date=|website=cps.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] guidelines on this offence&lt;ref name="CPS"/&gt; say that the elements of the offence are when:
# A public officer acting as such.
# Wilfully neglects to perform ones duty and/or wilfully misconducts oneself.
# To such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public's trust in the office holder.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/articles/decision_on_prosecution_-_mr_christopher_galley_and_mr_damian_green_mp/ the decision not to prosecute] [[Damian Green]] the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] formulated this as "the breach must have been such a serious departure from acceptable standards as to constitute a criminal offence; and to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public's trust in the public official;" citing the [[Court of Appeal]] in the case of Attorney General's Reference No.3 of 2003 [2004] EWCA Crim 868&lt;/ref&gt;
# Without reasonable excuse or justification.

The similarly named [[misfeasance in public office|malfeasance (or misfeasance) in public office]] is a [[tort]].  In the [[House of Lords]] judgement on the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] malfeasance case it was held that this had 3 essential elements:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000518/rivers-1.htm House of Lords judgements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313092450/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldjudgmt/jd000518/rivers-1.htm |date=2006-03-13 }} on [[Three Rivers District Council]] and Others v. Governor and Company of The [[Bank of England]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The defendant must be a public officer
# The defendant must have been exercising his power as a public officer
# The defendant is either exercising targeted malice or exceeding his powers

"Misconduct in public office" is often but inaccurately rendered as "misconduct in ''a'' public office", which has a different meaning.

==United States==
The [[West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] summarized a number of the definitions of malfeasance in office applied by various appellate courts in the [[United States]].

{{cquote|Malfeasance has been defined by [[appellate court]]s in other jurisdictions as a [[wrongful]] act which the actor has no legal right to do; as any wrongful conduct which affects, interrupts or interferes with the performance of official duty; as an act for which there is no authority or warrant of [[law]]; as an act which a person ought not to do; as an act which is wholly wrongful and unlawful; as that which an officer has no authority to do and is positively wrong or unlawful; and as the unjust performance of some act which the party performing it has no right, or has contracted not, to do.|||''Daugherty v. Ellis'', 142 W. Va. 340, 357-8, 97 S.E.2d 33, 42-3 (W. Va. 1956) (internal citations omitted).}}

The court then went on to use yet another definition, "malfeasance is the doing of an act which an officer had no legal right to do at all and that when an officer, through [[ignorance]], inattention, or [[Malice (law)|malice]], does that which they have no legal right to do at all, or acts without any authority whatsoever, or exceeds, ignores, or abuses their [[Political power|powers]], they are guilty of malfeasance."

Nevertheless, a few "elements" can be distilled from those cases. First, malfeasance in office requires an affirmative act or omission. Second, the act must have been done in an official capacity—under the [[color (law)|color of office]]. Finally, that that act somehow interferes with the performance of official duties—though some debate remains about "whose official" duties.

In addition, jurisdictions differ greatly over whether [[intent (law)|intent]] or [[knowledge]] is necessary.  As noted above, many courts will find malfeasance in office where there is "ignorance, inattention, or malice", which implies no intent or knowledge is required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">'''"Mixed motive" discrimination''' is a category of [[discrimination]] under [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

Where the [[plaintiff]] has shown intentional discrimination in a mixed motive case, the [[defendant]] can still avoid liability for [[Monetary damages|money damages]] by demonstrating by a [[Legal burden of proof|preponderance of the evidence]] that the same decision would have been made even in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor. If the defendant establishes this defense, the plaintiff is then entitled only to [[declaratory relief|declaratory]] and [[Injunction|injunctive relief]], attorney’s fees, and costs. Orders of reinstatement, as well as the substitutes of back and front pay, are prohibited if a same decision defense is proven. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(g)(2)(B).

[[Supreme Court of the United States|The Supreme Court]] has ruled that [[direct evidence]] is not required for a plaintiff to prove that discrimination was a motivating factor in a "mixed-motive" case, i.e., a case in which an employer had both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for making an employment decision.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Desert Palace Inc. v. Costa]]'', 539 U.S. 90 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between "mixed-motive" cases and "pretext" cases is generally determined by whether the plaintiff produces direct rather than [[circumstantial evidence]] of discrimination. If the plaintiff produces direct evidence of discrimination, this is sufficient to show that the defendant’s activity was motivated at least in part by [[animus nocendi|animus]] toward a [[protected class]], and therefore a "mixed-motive" instruction is given. If the evidence of discrimination is only circumstantial, the appropriate framework is the [[McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting|McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework]]. See generally ''Fakete v. Aetna, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;''Fakete v. Aetna, Inc.'' 308 F.3d 335 (3d Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; (using "direct evidence" to describe "mixed-motive" cases and noting that pretext cases arise when the plaintiff presents only indirect or circumstantial evidence of discrimination). 

On the proper use of mixed-motive instructions, see Matthew Scott and Russell Chapman, Much Ado About Nothing — Why Desert Palace Neither Murdered [[McDonnell Douglas]] Nor Transformed All [[Employment discrimination|Employment Discrimination]] Cases To Mixed-Motive, 36 St. Mary’s L.J. 395 (2005): 

&lt;!-- This is all verbatim from some external article - don't modify the text! --&gt;
:Thus, a case properly analyzed under [42 U.S.C.] § 2000e-2(a) (what some commentators refer to as pretext cases) involves the plaintiff alleging an improper motive for the defendant’s conduct, while the defendant disavows that motive and professes only a non-discriminatory motive. On the other hand, a true mixed motive case under [42 U.S.C.] § 2000e-2(m) involves either a defendant who . . . admits to a partially discriminatory reason for its actions, while also claiming it would have taken the same action were it not for the illegitimate rationale or . . .  [there is] otherwise credible evidence to support such a finding.

&lt;!-- This is all verbatim from some external article - don't modify the text! --&gt;
:The rationale for the distinction . . . is simple. When the defendant renounces any illegal motive, it puts the plaintiff to a higher standard of proof that the challenged employment action was taken because of the plaintiff’s race/color/religion/sex/national origin. But, the plaintiff, if successful, is entitled to the full panoply of damages under § 2000e-5.  . . .

&lt;!-- This is all verbatim from some external article - don't modify the text! --&gt;
:At the same time, where the defendant is contrite and admits an improper motive (something no jury will take lightly), or there is evidence to support such a finding, the defendant’s liability risk is reduced to [[declaratory relief]], attorneys’ fees and costs if the defendant proves it would have taken the same action even without considering the protected trait. The quid pro quo for this reduced [[financial risk]] is the lesser standard of liability (the challenged employment action need only be a motivating factor).

'''Non-economic damages caps,''' including '''[[medical malpractice]] caps,'''  are controversial [[tort reform]]s to limit (''i.e.'', "cap") [[damages]] in lawsuits for non-pecuniary harms such as permanent [[disability]], [[disfigurement]], [[blindness]], loss of a limb, [[paralysis]], [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], or physical pain and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hotcoffeethemovie.com/default.asp?pg=caps | title=Hot Coffee - FAQs About Caps | publisher=Susan Saladoff| accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is opposed to economic damages, which encompasses pecuniary harms such as medical bills, lost wages, and lost future income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending the Confusion: Economic, Non-Economic, and Punitive Damages|url=https://www.facs.org/advocacy/federal/liability/ending-the-confusion|website=American College of Surgeons|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-economic damages, sometimes described as quality-of-life damages, compensate injury victims and their families for injuries and losses that are not easily quantified by a dollar amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Tracy A.|title=Restriction of tort remedies and the constraints of due process: The right to an adequate remedy|journal=Akron Law Review|date=2006|volume=39|page=975|url=http://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1199&amp;context=ua_law_publications|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical malpractice damages caps==
In the area of [[medical malpractice]], tort reform advocates have claimed that with the imposition of damages caps insurance premiums would decrease, both making medical care more affordable and eliminating a disincentive for doctors to practice. Critics responded that high medical malpractice insurance rates are a result of the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, lack of competition, mismanagement of reserves and a decline in investment income.

===History===
Many jurisdictions, including U.S. states, have debated, passed legislation or amended their constitutions to impose caps on non-economic damages. Former President [[George W. Bush]] proposed a nationwide $250,000 cap in [[medical malpractice]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush outlines medical liability reform|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/16/bush.malpractice/|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=CNN|date=16 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on healthcare costs===
From the start, some disputed whether damages caps would reduce overall medical costs for patients.  A study by the U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]] published in 2004 found that "Malpractice costs account for less than 2 percent of [[health care]] spending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/49xx/doc4968/01-08-medicalmalpractice.pdf | title=Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice | publisher=Congressional Budget Office | date=8 January 2004 | accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of caps suggested other possible effects of limiting tort liability, such as reducing the extent to which physicians practice “defensive medicine”, the provision of unnecessary medical care in order to avoid potential liability, and would increase access to health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packer-Tursman|first1=Judy|title=The defensive medicine balancing act|url=http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/defensive-medicine-balancing-act?page=full|website=Medical Economics|publisher=UBM Media, LLC|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herner|first1=Laura D.|last2=Brody|first2=Howard|title=Defensive Medicine, Cost Containment, and Reform|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=May 2010|volume=25|issue=5|pages=470-473|pmc=2855004|pmid=20143176|doi=10.1007/s11606-010-1259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is scant evidence, either anecdotal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gawande|first1=Atul|title=The Cost Conundrum|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum|accessdate=3 October 2017|agency=The New Yorker|publisher=Conde Nast|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or empirical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waxman|first1=Daniel A, et al|title=The Effect of Malpractice Reform on Emergency Department Care|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=16 October 2014|volume=371|pages=1518–1525|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1313308#t=article|accessdate=3 October 2017|doi=10.1056/nejmsa1313308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Millman|first1=Jason|title=Study: Don’t expect big health-care savings from medical malpractice reform|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/15/study-dont-expect-big-health-care-savings-from-medical-malpractice-reform/|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waxman|first1=Daniel|title=Threat of Malpractice Lawsuits May Not Be Driving Defensive Medicine|url=http://www.acepnow.com/article/threat-malpractice-lawsuits-may-not-driving-defensive-medicine/|website=ACEP Now|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that doctors significantly change their approach to providing health care services as a result of tort reform measures.

===Impact on malpractice insurance premiums===
Although proponents of damages caps in medical malpractice cases argue that the caps reduce malpractice insurance premiums for doctors,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=J. Nelson, III|last2=Morrisey|first2=Michael A|last3=Kilgore|first3=Meredith L.|title=Damages Caps in Medical Malpractice Cases|journal=Milbank Quarterly|date=June 2007|volume=85|issue=2|pmc=2690332|pmid=17517115|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2007.00486.x|pages=259–86}}, {{cite journal|last1=Seabury|first1=Seth A.|last2=Helland|first2=Eric|last3=Anupam|first3=B.

Within the United States, the impact of damages caps on the number of malpractice claims paid out by insurance companies varies by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muhlestein|first1=David B.|last2=Shoben|first2=Abigail|last3=Wickizer|first3=Thomas|title=Caps on noneconomic damages’ effect on the number of paid malpractice claims in various American states|journal=International Journal of Healthcare|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|page=45|url=http://www.sciedupress.com/journal/index.php/ijh/article/download/8863/5836|accessdate=3 October 2017|doi=10.5430/ijh.v2n2p45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many states, reviews of malpractice premiums following the implementation of damages caps showed that the caps had no effect on premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Caps' Do Not Lower Insurance Premiums for Doctors|url=https://centerjd.org/sites/default/files/ckfinder/userfiles/files/CapsDontWorkF(1).pdf|website=Center for Justice &amp; Democracy|publisher=New York Law School|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on patients===
In a [[personal injury]] lawsuit, the two basic forms of compensatory damages that may be awarded are economic damages, compensation for the injured person's past and future financial costs and losses, and non-economic damages, compensation for the pain and suffering that results from an injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Are Damages Calculated After an Injury or Lawsuit|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/damages/damages.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-economic damages are thus the only compensation an injured person can receive for the injury itself, as opposed to reimbursement of [[out-of-pocket expenses]] such as lost wages, medical bills, and court costs. Non-economic damages can be especially important for injured people who do not work outside the home, including the elderly, children, and homemakers.  The "worth" of a homemaker's work inside the home is not easily measured by a dollar amount, and a claim of lost capacity to earn income may not have much value.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Andler v. Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., 670 F. 3d 717 (6th Cir. 2012)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18347765375943966241|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tort reform supporters argue that it is difficult for juries to assign a dollar value to these losses with the guidance they are normally given.  They argue that there is no basis for non-economic damages, and uncapped non-economic damages violate the equitable principles of [[justice]] by being inherently quite random, because different juries will always come to different results. Because of the highly charged environment of personal injury trials, they contend that some awards will inevitably be unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studdert|first1=D.M.|last2=Kachalia|first2=A.|last3=Saloman|first3=J.A.|last4=Mello|first4=M.M.|title=Rationalizing noneconomic damages: a health-utilities approach|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=2011|volume=74|issue=3|pages=57-101|url=https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/487/2012/09/damages_pdf.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Ernst v. Merck'', a Texas [[Vioxx]] products liability case, the jury issued a verdict of $24 million in compensatory damages, which includes non-economic damages, for a widow of a 59-year-old triathlete who died from arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat, that could have been prevented had Merck provided warnings about the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=352067741109998327&amp;q=ernst+v.+merck+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,37 | title=Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Ernst, 296 SW 3d 81 - Tex: Court of Appeals 2009 | publisher=Google Scholar | date=4 June 2009 | accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tort reform supporters argue that the widow had not been married a long time, and suggest that the damage award was excessive. However, since the basis for non-economic damages are not easily measured by a dollar amount (which tort reform supporters themselves argue), by the same logic there is no basis to assume that the award was, in fact, excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hensler|first1=Deborah R.|title=Jurors in the Material World: Putting Tort Verdicts in Their S ocial Context|journal=Roger Williams University Law Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=13|issue=1|page=8|url=http://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1376&amp;context=rwu_LR|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tort reform supporters argue that juries give arbitrary non-economic damage awards, but fail to argue that the legislature's assignment of non-economic damage caps is any less arbitrary. Opponents of tort reform would argue that members of the legislature are at a greater risk for assigning arbitrary dollar values to non-economic damages than juries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emison|first1=Brett|title=The Legal Examiner|url=http://kansascity.legalexaminer.com/medical-malpractice/florida-overturns-arbitrary-unconstitutional-damage-caps/|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=Langdon &amp; Emison|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the legislature are not present at trial and do not get to observe evidence, witness testimony, and other factors that contribute to a verdict.

Opponents of tort reform contend that jurors should assess damages on a case-by-case basis, that the risk of loss should not be shifted from those who cause harm or could prevent harm onto the innocent victim, and that damages should not be arbitrarily capped by a legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=R.J.|title=Capping Non-Economic Medical Malpractice Damages: How the Florida Supreme Court Should Decide the Issue|journal=Stetson Law Review|date=2012|volume=42|page=113|url=https://lawreviewdrake.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/lrvol53-3_murphy-ps-final.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Overall, non-economic damages throughout the United States cover pain, suffering, and other nonpecuniary injuries, and in [[Medical malpractice in the United States|medical malpractice]] cases many states have imposed caps that range from $250,000 to $750,000 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morgenstern|first1=Michael|title=Medical Malpractice Damages Caps: A State By State Comparison|url=https://www.theexpertinstitute.com/medical-malpractice-damages-caps-a-state-by-state-comparison/|website=The Expert Institute|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage caps have various purposes; for instance, they can discourage malicious lawsuits and prevent the costs of transacting business from being overly inflated, but have also been criticized as unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Michelle|title=This GOP Health Bill Proposes New Limits To Medical Malpractice Awards|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/28/534465478/this-gop-health-bill-proposes-new-limits-to-medical-malpractice-awards|accessdate=2 July 2017|agency=Kaiser Health News|publisher=NPR|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions with non-economic damage caps have defined non-economic damages by statute.

===Constitutionality of caps===

====Right to trial by jury====

Opponents of caps on damages argue that caps on the amount of damages jurors can award violate the right to a [[trial by jury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jurisprudence of Access to Justice: From Magna Carta to Romer v. Evans via Marbury v. Madison|url=http://www.seanet.com/~rod/marbury.html|publisher=Schroeter, Goldmark &amp; Bender|accessdate=7 May 2012|author=Leonard W. Schroeter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because tort law has historically been a question of state law, states have the power to establish a constitutional right to a trial by jury in civil cases.  Historically, juries have decided both the question of liability and the question of how much damages to award in tort cases, subject to instructions on the law by a judge.  Several state appellate courts that have considered the issue have struck down damages caps as a violation of state constitutions.

====Separation of powers====

Some tort reform supporters, such as the conservative Federalist Society, have criticized court decisions that overturn damages caps legislation as a violation of the concept of [[separation of powers]].

In contrast, critics of caps contend and state courts  have held that legislatures violate the principle of separation of powers when they attempt to impose arbitrary damage caps on juries, who function as part of the judicial branch of government.  In ''Best v. Taylor Machine Works'', the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a $500,000 cap on non-economic damages functioned as a "legislative remittitur" and invaded the power of the judiciary, in violation of the separation of powers clause.  The court noted that courts are empowered to reduce excessive verdicts where appropriate in light of the evidence. The cap, however, reduced damages by operation of law, without regard to the specific circumstances of the case.

===State law===

Roughly half of U.S. states have imposed damages caps in medical malpractice litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Medical Malpractice Law By State|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/malpractice_by_state/index.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven states impose damages caps for all general tort and personal injury cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Caps On Compensatory Damages: A State Law Summary|url=https://centerjd.org/content/fact-sheet-caps-compensatory-damages-state-law-summary|website=Center for Justice &amp; Democracy|publisher=New York Law School|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Illinois====
The [[Illinois Supreme Court]] found in the 1997 case ''Best v. Taylor Machine Works'' found that a $500,000 cap on noneconomic damages was (in addition to serving as a "legislative remittitur") special legislation that made an arbitrary distinction between those who sustained major noneconomic damages in a single tort versus multiple tortious actions and between those that suffered minor amounts of noneconomic damages versus amounts about the $500,000 cap (such as a plaintiff who becomes permanently disabled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best v. Taylor Mach. Works 689 NE 2d 1057, 179 Ill. 2d 367 (1997)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16924074404448677591|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 case ''Lebron v. Gottlieb Memorial Hospital'', the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Section 2-1706.5 of Public Act 94-677, which placed caps on non-economic damages in medical malpractice actions, violated the separation of powers clause in the Illinois Constitution and was therefore facially invalid.  Additionally, because Public Act 94-677 contains an inseverability provision, the entire Act was held void and invalid in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Illinois Supreme Court Strikes Down Statutory Cap on Non-Economic Damages in Medical Malpractice Actions|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/illinois-supreme-court-strikes-down-statutory-cap-non-economic-damages-medical-malpractice-a|publisher=Troutman Sanders LLP|work=The National Law Review|date=2010-02-16|accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====

In California, non-economic damages awarded in medical malpractice actions are capped at $250,000. Non-economic damages are meant "to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, [[physical impairment]], [[disfigurement]] and other nonpecuniary damage."&lt;ref&gt;Ann.Cal.Civ.Code § 3333.2(a) (West)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maryland====

In Maryland, non-economic damages are capped at $800,000. In personal injury cases, non-economic damages are defined as "pain, suffering, inconvenience, [[physical impairment]], [[disfigurement]], loss of consortium, or other nonpecuniary injury" . In wrongful death cases non-economic damages are defined as "mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, care, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education, or other noneconomic damages authorized under Title 3, Subtitle 9 of this article." &lt;ref&gt;Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. § 11-108 (West)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michigan====

Michigan normally has a cap of $280,000 for "noneconomic loss," which is defined as "damages or loss due to pain, suffering, inconvenience, [[physical impairment]], or physical [[disfigurement]], loss of society and companionship, whether claimed under section 29222 or otherwise, loss of consortium, or other noneconomic loss.&lt;ref&gt;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 600.1483 (West)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cap is increased to $500,000 where the plaintiff, due to physician negligence, is made "[[hemiplegic]], [[paraplegic]], or [[quadriplegic]] resulting in a total permanent functional loss of 1 or more limbs caused by [either] injury to the [[brain]] [or] injury to the [[spinal cord]]"; "when the plaintiff has permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living"; or "there has been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate." &lt;ref&gt;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 600.1483 (West)&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Virginia====

In West Virginia, non-economic damages are capped at $500,000. Non-economic damages are "(1) [[wrongful death]]; (2) permanent and substantial physical [[deformity]], loss of use of a limb or loss of a bodily organ system; or (3) permanent physical or mental functional injury that permanently prevents the injured person from being able to independently care for himself or herself and perform life sustaining activities."&lt;ref&gt;W. Va. Code Ann. § 55-7B-8 (West)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wisconsin====

In 2005, a Wisconsin court ruled that a $350,000 cap on non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases violates the state's [[equal protection]] guarantee.  In ''Ferdon v. Wisconsin Patient's Compensation Fund'',&lt;ref name="ferndon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdon ex rel. Petrucelli v. Wisconsin Patients Compensation Fund, 284 Wis.2d 573, 701 N.W.2d 440 (2005)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15788507432628914384|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that there was no rational relationship between the objectives identified by the legislature that were intended to prevent a medical liability crisis in Wisconsin and treating people with more severe injuries and higher non-economic damage awards different from people with lower non-economic damage awards.&lt;ref name="ferndon"/&gt;

In Wisconsin, non-economic damages for medical malpractice are capped at $750,000. Non-economic damages means "moneys intended to compensate for pain and suffering; humiliation; embarrassment; worry; mental distress; noneconomic effects of disability including loss of enjoyment of the normal activities, benefits and pleasures of life and loss of mental or physical health, well-being or bodily functions; loss of consortium, society and companionship; or loss of love and affection.".&lt;ref&gt;Wis. Stat. Ann. § 893.55 (West)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piracy Act 1721''' (c.24) was an Act of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].

The long title and preamble of the Act were:
{{cquote|''An Act for the more effectual suppressing of [[Piracy]].

Whereas the number of persons committing piracies, felonies, and robberies upon the seas is of late very much increased, and notwithstanding the laws already made and now in being, many idle and profligate persons have turned [[pirates]], and betaken themselves to that wicked course of life, whereby the trade and navigation into remote parts will greatly suffer unless some further provision be speedily made for bringing such persons and all others who shall be any ways aiding and assisting, or in confederacy with them, to condign punishment:''}}

Parts of the Act were superseded by the [[Piracy Act 1837]].

All remaining parts of the Act were repealed on 11 May 1993 by the [[Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1993]].

He is known for filing a high number of lawsuits against media organizations on behalf of photographers who assert that their images have been used without permission. This practice has polarized the U.S. media industry.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Justin|title=Why Every Media Company Fears This Guy|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/richard-liebowitz-why-media-companies-fear-and-photographers-love-this-guy.html|date=24 May 2018|accessdate=25 May 2018|work=Slate Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Long Island]] native, Liebowitz worked as an intern for veteran New York press photographer [[Bruce Cotler]]. His experience with Cotler, about which he wrote a book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liebowitz|first1=Richard P.|title=Apprentice!: a teen learns lessons on the frontlines of life|date=2006|publisher=New Voices Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0974810348}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a member of the [[New York Press Photographers Association]] motivated Liebowitz to pursue a career in copyright law.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt; He established his practice in New York and filed his first lawsuit in January 2016. He works on a [[Contingent fee|contingency]] basis and has filed, on average, about five lawsuits per week.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt; Contrary to other copyright lawyers, his practice is to immediately file suit rather than pursue a settlement, and to claim [[statutory damages]] far in excess of the images' ordinary licensing prices.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt;

His approach to copyright litigation earned him a reputation as "the scourge of the media industry (...) and the salvation of the underpaid photographer", according to ''Slate''.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt; Media organizations and their lawyers have asserted that Liebowitz is abusing the legal system by overloading the courts with dubious cases in which he attempts to leverage mistakes by overworked editorial staff into financial windfalls.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt; On occasion, courts have agreed: in one case, Judge [[Lewis A. Kaplan]] ordered Liebowitz's client to pay the defendant's legal fees for what the judge considered "frivolous litigation",&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt; and in another, Judge [[Denise Cote]] determined that Liebowitz was a "[[copyright troll]]", fined him and imposed ethics classes on him.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt; On his part, Liebowitz has argued that copyright law is the only tool that photographers have to protect their rights and livelihood in a digital media environment in which images are often reused without regard to proper licensing.&lt;ref name="Slate 25 May 2018" /&gt;

An '''S corporation''', for [[Income tax in the United States|United States federal income tax]] purposes, is a [[Closely held corporation|closely held]] [[corporation]] (or, in some cases, a [[limited liability company]] (LLC) or a [[Partnership taxation in the United States|partnership]]) that makes a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. In general, S corporations do not pay any [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]]es. Instead, the corporation's income or losses are divided among and passed through to its shareholders. The shareholders must then report the income or loss on their own individual income tax returns.

==Overview==

S corporations are ordinary business corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S Corporations|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service, United States Treasury|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is an S Corporation|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/s_corporation.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "S corporation" means a "small business corporation" which has made an election under § 1362(a) to be taxed as an S corporation.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 1361(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The S corporation rules are contained in Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (sections 1361 through 1379).  Congress, acting on the Department of Treasury's suggestion of 1946, created this chapter in 1958 as part of a larger package of miscellaneous tax items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branham|first1=David|title=Has the S-Corp Run Its Course-The Past Successes and Future Possibilities of the S Corporation|journal=Journal of Legislation|date=16 January 2016|volume=42|issue=1|page=90|url=https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1650&amp;context=jleg|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; S status combines the legal environment of C corporations with U.S. federal income taxation similar to that of partnerships.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

As with partnerships, the income, deductions, and tax credits of an S corporation flow through to shareholders annually, regardless of whether distributions are made.&lt;ref name=taxfound&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Kyle|last2=Borean|first2=Richard|title=The Dual Tax Burden of S Corporations|url=https://taxfoundation.org/dual-tax-burden-s-corporations/|website=Tax Foundation|accessdate=4 February 2018|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, income is taxed at the shareholder level and not at the corporate level. Payments to S shareholders by the corporation are distributed tax-free to the extent that the distributed earnings were previously taxed.

===S corporations vs. C corporations===
Like a [[C corporation]], an S corporation is generally a corporation under the law of the state in which the entity is organized.&lt;ref name=taxfound/&gt; However, with modern incorporation statutes making the establishment of a corporation relatively easy, firms that might traditionally have been run as partnerships or sole proprietorships are often run as corporations with a small number of shareholders in order to take advantage of the beneficial features of the corporate form; this is particularly true of firms established prior to the advent of the modern [[limited liability company]]. Therefore, taxation of S corporations resembles that of partnerships.

Unlike a C corporation, an S corporation is not eligible for a [[dividends received deduction]].

Unlike a C corporation, an S corporation is not subject to the 10 percent of taxable income limitation applicable to charitable contribution deductions.

==Eligibility==
A corporation is "eligible" if it:&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;
* Has no more than 100 shareholders, 
* Has shareholders who are all individuals (exceptions are made for various tax exempt organizations, estates, and trusts)
* Has no nonresident aliens as shareholders, and
* Has only one class of stock.&lt;ref name=IRC&gt;{{usc|26|1361(b)(1)(A)-(D)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYSSCPA&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landau|first1=Zev|title=Recent Reform and Simplifications for S Corporations|journal=The CPA Journal|date=2005|volume=75|issue=11|pages=46-50|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/ca5d945a0942e22a61b53237c33cb1d1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=41798|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited liability company (LLC) is eligible to be taxed as an S corporation under the check-the-box regulations at § 301.7701-2. The LLC first [[entity classification|elects to be taxed as a corporation]], at which point it becomes a corporation for tax purposes; then it makes the S corporation election under section 1362(a).

===Shareholder requirements===
Shareholders must be U.S. citizens or residents (not nonresident aliens), and must be natural persons, so corporations and partnerships are ineligible shareholders. However, certain trusts, estates, and tax-exempt corporations, notably [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] corporations, are permitted to be shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 1361(c)(6)&lt;/ref&gt; An S corporation may be a shareholder in another, subsidiary S corporation if the first S corporation owns 100% of the stock of the subsidiary corporation, and an election is made to treat the subsidiary corporation as a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" (QSub). After the election is made, the subsidiary corporation is not treated as a separate corporation for tax purposes, and all "assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit" of the QSub are treated belonging to the parent S corporation.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 1361(b)(3)(A)-(B)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spouses (and their estates) are automatically treated as a single shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 1361(c)(1)(A)(i)&lt;/ref&gt; Families, defined as individuals descended from a common ancestor, plus spouses and former spouses of either the common ancestor or anyone [[lineal descendant|lineally descended]] from that person, are considered a single shareholder as long as any family member elects such treatment.&lt;ref name=NYSSCPA /&gt;

===Stock requirements===
An S corporation may only have one class of stock.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 1361(b)(1)(D)&lt;/ref&gt; A single class of stock means that all outstanding shares of stock confer "identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds," i.e. profits and losses are allocated to shareholders proportionately to each one's interest in the business. § 1.1361-1(l)(1). Differences in voting rights are disregarded, which means that an S corporation may have voting and nonvoting stock.&lt;ref&gt;26 U.S.C. § 1361(c)(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

If a corporation meets the foregoing requirements and wishes to be taxed under Subchapter S, its shareholders may file [[Form 2553]]: "Election by a Small Business Corporation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2553.pdf |title=Form 2553 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |access-date=2017-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2553.pdf |title=Instructions for Form 2553 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |access-date=2017-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). The Form 2553 must be signed by all of the corporation's shareholders. If a shareholder resides in a [[community property]] state, the shareholder's spouse generally must also sign the 2553.

The S corporation election must typically be made by the fifteenth day of the third month of the tax year for which the election is intended to be effective, or at any time during the year immediately preceding the tax year.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|1362(b)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress has directed the IRS to show leniency with regard to late S elections. Accordingly, often, the IRS will accept a late S election.

If a corporation that has elected to be treated as an S corporation ceases to meet the requirements (for example, if as a result of stock transfers, the number of shareholders exceeds 100 or an ineligible shareholder such as a nonresident alien acquires a share), the corporation will lose its S corporation status and revert to being a regular C corporation.

An S corporation's election will also terminate if, for each of three consecutive years, (i) its passive investment income exceeds 25% of gross receipts and (ii) it has accumulated earnings and profits. § 1362(d)(3). An S corporation will only have accumulated earnings and profits if it was a C corporation at some time, or acquired or merged with a C corporation.
[http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Sec._1362._Election%3B_revocation%3B_termination]

==Taxation==
The S election affects the treatment of the corporation for Federal income tax purposes. The election does not change the requirements for that corporation for other Federal taxes such as FICA and Federal unemployment taxes.

===Distributions===
While an S corporation is not taxed on its profits, the owners of an S corporation are taxed on their proportional shares of the S corporation's profits.

Actual distributions of funds, as opposed to distributive shares, typically have no effect on shareholder tax liability. The term "pass through" refers '''not''' to assets distributed by the corporation to the shareholder, but instead to the portion of the corporation's income, losses, deductions or credits that are reported to the shareholder on Schedule K-1 and are shown by the shareholder on his or her own income tax return. However, a distribution to a shareholder that is in excess of the shareholder's basis in his or her stock is taxed to the shareholder as capital gain.

Quarterly estimated taxes must be paid by the individual to avoid tax penalties, even if this income is "phantom income".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

====Example====
Widgets Inc, an S-Corp, makes $10,000,000 in net income (before payroll) in 2006 and is owned 51% by Bob and 49% by John. Keeping it simple, Bob and John both draw salaries of $94,200 (which is the [[Social Security Wage Base]] for 2006, after which no further Social Security tax is owed).

Employee salaries are subject to [[FICA tax]] (Social Security &amp; Medicare tax) --currently 15.3 percent--(6.2% Social Security paid by the employee; 6.2% Social Security paid by the employer; 1.45% employee medicare and 1.45% employer medicare). The distribution of the additional profits from the S corporation will be done without any further FICA tax liability.

If for some reason, Bob (as the majority owner) were to decide not to distribute the money, both Bob and John would still owe taxes on their [[pro-rata]] allocation of business income, even though neither received any cash distribution. To avoid this "phantom income" scenario, S corporations commonly use shareholder agreements that stipulate at least enough distribution must be made for shareholders to pay the taxes on their distributive shares.

===Conversion from C corporation===
S corporations that have previously been [[C corporations]] may also, in certain circumstances, pay income taxes on untaxed profits that were generated when the corporation operated as a C corporation.  This is very common with uncollected accounts receivable or appreciated real estate.

For example, if an S corporation that was formerly a [[C corporation]] sells an [[appreciated asset]] (such as real estate) and the appreciation occurred during the time the corporation was a [[C corporation]], the S corporation will probably pay [[C corporation]] taxes on the appreciation—even though the corporation is now an S corporation.  This Built In Gain (BIG) tax rate is 35% on the appreciated property, but is only realized if the BIG property is sold within 10 years (starting from the first day of the first tax year of conversion to S-Corp status.) The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] reduced that 10-year recognition period to 7 years (if that 7th year precedes either 2009 or 2010.) The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 further reduced the recognition period to 5 years.

===Federal tax===
====Taxable Income to Shareholders====
If a shareholder owns more than 2% of the outstanding stock, amounts paid for group health insurance for that shareholder are included on their [[Form W-2|W-2]] as "wages."  The same applies to amounts contributed to [[Health Savings Accounts]] (HSA).

====Filing Form 1120S====
Form 1120S generally must be filed by March 15 of the year immediately following the calendar year covered by the return or, if a fiscal year (a year ending on the last day of a month other than December) is used, by the 15th day of the third month immediately following the last day of the fiscal year. The corporation must complete a Schedule K-1 for each person who was a shareholder at any time during the tax year and file it with the IRS along with Form 1120S. The second copy of the Schedule K-1 must be mailed to the shareholder.

====FICA====
As is the case for any other corporation, the [[FICA tax]] is imposed only with respect to employee wages and not on distributive shares of shareholders. Although FICA tax is not owed on distributive shares, the IRS and equivalent state revenue agencies may recategorize distributions paid to shareholder-employees as wages if shareholder-employees are not paid a reasonable wage for the services they perform in their positions within the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S Corporation Employees, Shareholders and Corporate Officers|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporation-employees-shareholders-and-corporate-officers|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of Treasury|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting compliance====
In 2005, the IRS launched a study to assess the reporting compliance of S corporations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=141441,00.html |title=IRS Launches Study of S Corporation Reporting Compliance |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=irs.gov |publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study began in late 2005 and examined 5,000 randomly selected S corporation returns from tax years 2003 and 2004. The IRS intends to use the results to measure compliance in recording of income, deductions and credits from S corporations, and to formulate future audit criteria to better target likely non-compliant returns.  This is part of a larger IRS effort to improve tax compliance and reduce the estimated $300 billion gap in gross reported figures each year.  A large portion of that gap is thought to come from small businesses, and particularly S corporations, which are now the most common corporate entity, numbering over 3 million in 2002, up from about 750,000 in 1985.

===State tax===
States impose tax laws and regulations for corporate income and distributions, some of which may be directed specifically at S Corporations. Some but not all states recognize a state tax law equivalent to an S corporation, so that the S corporation in certain states may be treated the same way for state income tax purposes as it is treated for Federal purposes. A state taxing authority may require that a copy of the Form 1120S return be submitted to the state with the state income tax return.

Some states such as New York and New Jersey require a separate state-level S election in order for the corporation to be treated, for state tax purposes, as an S corporation.

====California====
S corporations pay a franchise tax of 1.5% of net income in the state of [[California]] ([[California minimum franchise tax|minimum]] $800). This is one factor to be taken into consideration when choosing between a [[limited liability company]] and an S corporation in California. For highly profitable enterprises, the LLC franchise tax fees (minimum $800), which are based on gross revenues, may be lower than the 1.5% net income tax.  Conversely, for high-gross-revenue, low-profit-margin businesses, the LLC franchise tax fees may exceed the S corporation net income tax.

====Delaware====
S Corporations operating in the City of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] are not subject to the city's 1.25% net profits tax, however, S corporation employee wages are subject to the city's 1.25% wage tax.

====New York City====
In New York City, S corporations are subject to the full corporate income tax at an 8.85% rate. However, if the S corporation can demonstrate that a portion of its business was done outside the city, that portion will not be subject to the additional tax.

====Philadelphia====
In [[Philadelphia]], S corporations are subject to the city's income tax (6.35%) and gross receipts tax (1.415%), but not the net profits tax (3.8907%). S corporations also benefit from [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania's]] flat personal income tax of 3.07% instead of the high corporation tax rate of 9.99%.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The '''Saltire Prize''', named after the [[flag of Scotland]], is the national award for advances in the commercial development of [[marine energy]].

To be considered for the £10 million award teams must demonstrate, in [[Scottish waters]], a commercially viable [[Wave energy|wave]] or [[tidal stream energy]] technology "that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea."

The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/challenge |title=The Challenge | publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already there are five competitors registered.

==Additional prizes==

• The '''Saltire Prize Lecture''' - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring.  The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government.

• The '''Saltire Prize Medal''' - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner.

• The '''Junior Saltire Prize''' - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential.  It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6.

• A '''Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate''' in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012.  The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment.

• '''Power of the Sea''' - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy.	In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners.

==History==
When it was first announced in 2008 it was the world's largest ever single prize for innovation in marine renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/04/02151533 |title=World to compete for Saltire Prize| publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is overseen by the Challenge Committee. Saltire Prize policy is the responsibility of the Offshore Renewables Policy Team in the Scottish Government's Energy and Climate Change Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/about-us |title=About us| publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">Justice '''Samuel Elkana Bosire''' was a former appeal judge in the [[High Court of Kenya]] alongside others like Justices Nyamu and Riaga.
His rise to fame stems from the time when he was appointed the chairman of the Goldenberg Commission of Inquiry by President [[Mwai Kibaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/magazine/-/434746/633184/-/item/10/-/ttedtkz/-/index.html |title=Goldenburg: Story of a whistleblower |publisher=The East African |date=3 August 2009|first=Billy|last=Kahora |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosire is a church elder at The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] Church-Nairobi Central, well known as Maxwell.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Vetting Board verdict==
In April 2012, the [[Kenya Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board]] found Justice Bosire unsuitable to hold office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Four-senior-Kenyan-judges-sent-home/-/1064/1393432/-/ainrcnz/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons cited by the board included condoning torture of suspects during [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|1982 coup]] trials,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Four-senior-Kenyan-judges-sent-home/-/1064/1393432/-/ainrcnz/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring a High Court order to summon retired President [[Daniel Moi]], Prof [[George Saitoti]], Mr [[Musalia Mudavadi]] and Mr [[Nicholas Biwott]] as witnesses. Justice Bosire appealed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Bosire-fights-to-keep-his-job-/-/1064/1397776/-/kx0bgq/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2012, the board also upheld its earlier ruling on Justice Bosire and other [[Court of Appeal of Kenya|Court of Appeal]] judges [[Riaga Omollo]], [[Emmanuel O’kubasu]], and [[Joseph Nyamu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/1458952/-/9ereni/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simmonsite''' is a halide mineral, being a tertiary light metal fluoride, with formula [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[lithium|Li]][[aluminum|Al]][[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. It was first discovered in nature in Mineral County in the Gillis Range of [[Nevada]], U.S.A. The mineral is found intergrown with [[cryolite]], cryolithionite and trace elpasolite. The mineral has a [[monoclinic]] structure of P2 or P2/m. The ideal chemical formula for simmonsite is [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[lithium|Li]][[aluminum|Al]][[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The mineral has a no visible cleavage, Mohs hardness of 2.53, a pale white color with a white streak and feels somewhat greasy. Simmonsite was named for the Professor of Mineralogy and Petrology at the [[University of New Orleans]], William B. Simmons.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Simmonsite, cryolite and cryolithionite form together as part of the alumino-fluoride aassemblage in a late stage [[breccia]] pipe structure that cross the Zapot amazonite-topaz-zinnwaldite pegmatite located in the described location above in Nevada.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt; This assemblage occurs with around a third of each of theses phases. The three phases form an intergrowth of anhedral to subhedral grains that can be micrometers to approximately two or three hundred micrometers in size. The main anhydrous alumino-fluorides results in size almost 20cm or more across and weight more than 1kg. &lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;Another assemblage of alumino-fluorides exist, some that contain water or hydroxyl, pachnolite, weberite, thomsenollite, prosopite, ralstonite, as well as a second generation of cryolithionite.

==Physical properties==
Simmonsite contains no observable euhedral crystals but it does have complex polysynthetic twinning. Its color is pale buff to cream in the hadn specimens accompanied by a white streak and has a greasy appearance. It exhibits a hardness of 2.5-3 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. There is no apparent cleavage, a subconchoidal fracture, no parting, and is not brittle. The measured density is 3.05(2) g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==Optical properties==
The optical properties of this mineral were discovered by using the standard optical spindle stage procedure in 589 nm light. It was determined to have [[birefringence]] with a Berek compensator. &lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Simmonsite is a fairly simple mineral chemically as the only elements present in major or minor amounts are Na, Al, Li, and F.  The empirical chemical formula for simmonsite is [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[lithium|Li]][[aluminum|Al]][[fluorine|F]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The four primary alumino-fluorides behave distinctly different under an electron beam with elpasolite and cryolithionite showing no beam damage with time, even though simmonsite did have some and cryolite having the greatest extent of damage.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
Natural simmonsite is monoclinic with P2 or P2/m. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.5006(6) Å, b= 7.474(1) Å, c= 7.503(1) Å, β = 90.847(9)°, V= 420.6(1) Å3, Z= 4. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. Simmonsite has had a long history of it being difficult to understand as there have been previous studies trying to understand the [[crystallography]]. Errors were discovered in previous work by Holm and Holm(1970) that suggested it was monoclinic, B-centered, a=7.54 Å, b= 7.52 Å, c= 7.53 Å, β = 90.81°.&lt;ref name=Foord/&gt;

'''SolarWall''' is the brand name of a [[Solar thermal collector|transpired collector]] designed and manufactured by the [[Toronto, Canada]] based company [[Conserval Engineering]].  

==History and Design==
The SolarWall design was developed in 1989 by John Hollick of Conserval Engineering in partnership with the U.S. [[Department of Energy]]’s [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL).&lt;ref name="DOE"&gt;[https://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/FTA_trans_coll.pdf Transpired Collectors (Solar Preheaters for Outdoor Ventilation Air)]. Federal Energy Management Program, U.S. Department of Energy. Federal Technology Alert #DOE/GO-10098-528. April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEO"&gt;Siegele, Lindsey. [https://www.motherearthnews.com/green-homes/natural-building/solarwall-solar-air-heating-zw0z10zsieSolarWall Solar Air Heating Technology: Transpired air collectors, marketed as SolarWall, bring solar air heating to businesses, warehouses and even residential buildings]. [[Mother Earth News]]. 8 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge"&gt;Dodge, David. [https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/david-dodge/solar-air-heater_b_6249742.html How We Made Our Own Solar Air Heater for Under $100]. [[Huffington Post]]. 1 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The system consists of perforated metal panels mounted on a building's sun-facing exterior wall, the panels absorb heat from the sun and in turn heat the air space between the panel and the building's wall. The heated air is then pulled into the building's ventilation or [[HVAC]] system via a fan, saving building owners on their heating costs and reducing the amount of fossil fuels used.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;  According to [[Mother Earth News]], for every {{conv|5|sqm}} of SolarWall panels installed, about 1 ton of carbon dioxide emissions is displaced each year.&lt;ref name=MEO/&gt;  An unglazed design is used for heating or preheating large volumes of fresh air, and a partially glazed 2-stage heater is available for achieving higher temperatures when heating buildings in colder climates.  The SolarWall technology can also be installed as a hybrid solar system that generates both heat and electricity from the same surface area. By combining [[photovoltaics]] with the air heating technology, the heat produced by the [[solar panel]]s is removed and drawn into the collector, helping to cool the solar panels and preheat the building’s ventilation system at the same time.

Compared to traditional roof mounted solar thermal panels designed to heat domestic hot water, a vertical orientation eliminates any snow buildup and was found to increase winter solar gain, being angled more towards the lower winter [[Solar azimuth angle|solar angle]].  Reflective snow on the ground was found to increase solar energy as much as 50%.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Three of Conserval's early SolarWall installations have been closely monitored to determine real energy savings.  In 1990, [[Ford Motor Company]] installed a system on their [[Oakville, Ontario]] manufacturing plant, saving approximately 17% on their heating costs at that plant alone.&lt;ref name=DOE/&gt;  The company eventually installed six more SolarWall systems on other facilities, and as of 2014 have reportedly saved more than [[USD|$]]10 million over all their installations.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;  In 1991, [[General Motors]] had a system installed at their [[Oshawa|Oshawa, Ontario]] plant and, as of 1998, reported a savings of approximately $10,200 per year.

The '''Asiatic Society of Mumbai''' (formerly ''Asiatic Society of Bombay'') is a [[learned society]] in the field of [[Asian studies]] based in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. It can trace its origin to the Literary Society of Bombay which first met in Mumbai on November 26, 1804, and was founded by [[Sir James Mackintosh]]. It was formed with the intention of "promoting useful knowledge, particularly such as is now immediately connected with India". After the [[Royal Asiatic Society|Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] was established in [[London]] in 1823, the Literary Society of Bombay became affiliated with it and was known as the '''Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society''' (BBRAS) since 1830. The ''Bombay Geographical Society'' merged with it in 1873, followed by the ''Anthropological Society of Bombay'' in 1896. In 1954, it was separated from the Royal Asiatic Society and renamed the Asiatic Society of Bombay.&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavadam|first=Lyla|date=May 8–21, 2010|title=Treasure house|journal=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|volume= 27|issue= 10|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2710/stories/20100521271008200.htm|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002,&lt;ref&gt;According to its [http://asiaticsociety.org.in/index.php/history official website], it was renamed in 2005&lt;/ref&gt; it acquired its present name.&lt;ref name="frontline"/&gt; It is funded by an annual grant from the Central Government of India.

==Holdings==
[[File:Asiatic Town Hall, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|'The Society in its early days']]
The library of the Society has over a hundred thousand books out of which 15,000 are classified as rare and valuable. It also has priceless artifacts and over 3,000 ancient manuscripts in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]], mostly on paper but some on palm leaf. The numismatic collection of 11,829 coins includes a gold coin of [[Kumaragupta I]], a rare gold [[mohur]] of [[Akbar]] and coins issued by [[Shivaji]]. Its map collection comprises  1300 maps.&lt;ref name="frontline"/&gt;
The collection of the Society include:
# One of only two known original copies of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.&lt;ref name="frontline"/&gt;
# The manuscript of ''Vasupujyacharita'' (1242), a Sanskrit text on the life of the [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]] [[Vasupujya]].
# ''The manuscript of [[Shahnama]] of Firdausi'' (1853), written in [[Persian language|Persian]].
# ''The Aranyakaparvan'' (16th century) manuscript contains illustrated text from the [[Mahabharat]] and is written in Sanskrit.
# Five [[Buddhist]] caskets excavated in the ancient port town of [[Sopara]] near the suburb of [[Nala Sopara]].

===The Divine Comedy===
[[File:ಏಶಿಯಾಟಿಕ್ ಲೈಬ್ರೆರಿ, ಹಾರ್ನಿಮನ್ ಸರ್ಕಲ್, ಮುಂಬಯಿ.jpg|thumb|'Asiatic Library, Fort, Mumbai']]
The manuscript of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', a poem composed by [[Dante Alighieri]] in the 14th century, was written in the second half of the 15th century. It is a beautiful codex on parchment and richly illustrated. It was given to the Society by [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], governor of Bombay and President of the Society from 1819–1827 and bears his signature.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Tharoor, Ishaan (Jan 02, 2009).

In 1930, the [[Italy|Italian]] government under [[Benito Mussolini]] offered the society one million [[pound sterling|pounds]], calling the book a national treasure.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Mussolini believed that the offer could not be refused, but to his shock, the Society turned down his request stating that it was donated by an ex-member of the Society and hence it was their property.

==Functions of the society==

===Silver Medal===
The Silver Medal is awarded to a member of the Society who has written a book adjudged as the best in the given 3-year period.

==Town Hall==
The Town Hall (colloquially Called "Tondal" in the 19th century) that houses the Asiatic Society of Bombay was not built in 1804, the year in which the Literary Society of Bombay was formed. Though Sir James Mackintosh mooted the proposal for a grand edifice, it was not completed until the year 1830 (year to be confirmed with tablet on the entrance) after many fits and starts, when the Government of Bombay agreed to make up for the shortfall in funds in return for office-space. The after-effects of this compromise can still be seen in the unseemly crowds gathered at the Stamp Office and other government departments in the Town Hall.

It is now classified a heritage structure. Heavily influenced by Greek and Roman architecture, it has a portico with eight [[Doric column]]s. A flight of 30 steps lead up to the town hall and a [[wrought iron]] divided Regency staircase leads to the vestibule. In 1830 Sir [[John Malcolm]], governor of [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] stated: "It is the most magnificent structure that taste and munificence combined have as yet erected in India."

The edifice is in the prime Fort area of [[South Mumbai]] overlooking the [[Horniman Circle Gardens]] and the Reserve Bank of India.

[[File:Treaty of Livadia.pdf|thumb|Treaty of Livadia]]
The '''Treaty of Livadia''' was a treaty between the [[Russian Empire]] and the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] signed in [[Livadiya, Crimea]], on 2 October 1879,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npm.gov.tw/exh100/diplomatic/page_en02.html |title=Lessons of History |date=9 August 2011 |website=A Century of Resilient Tradition: Exhibition of the Republic of China's Diplomatic Archives |publisher=[[National Palace Museum]] |language=English |access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Russia agreed to return a portion of the lands it had occupied in [[Xinjiang]] during the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt of 1862–1877]]. Although Qing forces [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang|had reconquered]] the area, the resulting treaty was so unfavorable to China that the Qing government refused to ratify it and the emissary who made the negotiations was sentenced to death. Seventeen months later, the two nations signed the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], which apart from territorial matters, largely had the same terms as the Treaty of Livadia.

==Background==
{{See also|Xinjiang under Qing rule|Qing reconquest of Xinjiang}}
The [[Qing dynasty]] under the [[Qianlong Emperor]] conquered Xinjiang from the [[Dzungar Khanate]] in the late 1750s. However, Qing China declined in the late 19th century following the [[First Opium War]]. A major revolt known as the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] occurred in the 1860s and 1870s in [[Northwest China]], and [[Xinjiang under Qing rule|Qing rule]] almost collapsed in all of Xinjiang except for places such as [[Tacheng]]. Taking advantage of this revolt, [[Yakub Beg]], commander-in-chief of the army of [[Kokand]] occupied most of Xinjiang and declared himself the [[Emir]] of [[Kashgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8vAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=Tso Tsung-tʼang and the Muslims: statecraft in northwest China, 1868-1880|first=Lanny B. |last=Fields|year=1978|publisher=Limestone Press|location=|page=81|isbn=0-919642-85-3|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia was officially neutral during the conflict, but as a result of the [[Treaty of Tarbagatai]] in 1864, had already gained about {{convert|350000|mi2|km2}} of territory in Xinjiang.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=29}} Furthermore, the Russian Governor-General of [[Turkestan]] had sent troops into the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili Valley]] in 1871, ostensibly to protect his citizens during the rebellion, but they had extensively built up infrastructure in the Ili capital of [[Yining|Ghulja]].{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=133}}  This was typical of the Russian strategy of taking control over a region and negotiating recognition of its sovereignty after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/UserFiles/File/en/A60000000E-I52-e2704.doc | title=The Negotiations on Ili Contract between China and Russia in the Last Half 19th Century: A Case Study of Treaties and Border Maps in Nation Palace Museum | first=Wei-hsing | last=Chen | journal=Research Quarterly | publisher=[[National Palace Museum]] | location=Taipei, Taiwan | volume=27 | issue=1 | year=2009 | format=Microsoft Word}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang|Qing counterinsurgency]], led by General [[Zuo Zongtang]] began in September 1876 and concluded in December 1877, having completely retaken the lands that were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AtduqAtBzegC&amp;pg=PA176|title=Holy war in China: the Muslim rebellion and state in Chinese Central Asia, 1864-1877|first=Ho-dong |last=Kim|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=|page=176|isbn=0-8047-4884-5|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Russia had promised to return all occupied lands to China.{{sfn|Millward|2007|pp=133–134}}

==Terms of the treaty==
The Treaty of Livadia actually consisted of two separate agreements.

===Border treaty===
The first treaty consisted of eighteen articles, and stipulated that:{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=133–134}}
# Russia would return a portion of Xinjiang to China, keeping the western Ili Valley and the [[Tekes River]] – ensuring that Russia would have access to the southern portion of Xinjiang
# In the lands that were being returned, Russia would retain any property rights it had established during the occupation
# Any of the [[Dungan people]] who rebelled could choose to become Russian citizens, and those who did not would not be punished for their activities during the rebellion
# Russia was given the right to open seven new consulates in Xinjiang and Mongolia
# Russia could engage in trade without [[tariff|duties]] in Xinjiang and Mongolia
# Russian merchants were given access to trade routes extending as far as [[Beijing]] and [[Hankou]] on the [[Yangtze]]
# China would pay an [[indemnity]] of five million [[ruble]]s to cover Russia's occupation costs and property losses

===Commercial treaty===
The second treaty contained seventeen articles that focused on the [[logistics]] of conducting trade, such as tax issues, passport requirements, and certification procedures, the total effect of which was very preferential to Russian commercial interests and represented unprecedented access to the Chinese interior. There was also an unrelated supplementary article that reaffirmed Russia's right to navigate the [[Songhua River]] as far as [[Tongjiang, Heilongjiang|Tongjiang]] in [[Manchuria]].{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=134}}

==Uproar in China==
[[File:Chonghou.jpg|thumb|upright|Chonghou, the Qing negotiator of the treaty]]
At the time of negotiations, China was in a strong position. Zuo's army was still in the region and far outnumbered the Russian troops that remained. Furthermore, Russia had recently concluded the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] had not been particularly favorable to them. Military expenditures during that war had also drained the national treasury, so the fact that the terms of Livadia were so heavily in their favor came as quite a shock among government officials when they became widely known.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=134}}

The Qing court laid the blame on the chief negotiator, [[Chonghou]], who was described as being inexperienced and over-eager to return home.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=134}} Upon his return to Beijing in January 1880, he was denounced as a traitor, stripped of his rank and office, and imprisoned. The government decided it needed to [[Face (sociological concept)|save face]] and following the Chinese proverb "kill a chicken to scare the monkeys", ordered his execution.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=140}}&lt;ref name="Anonymous1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous|title=Russia's March Towards India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAIoAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA270|accessdate=22 February 2018|year=1894|publisher=S. Low, Marston &amp; Company|pages=270–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Zhidong]] stated that "The Russians must be considered extremely covetous and truculent in making the demands and Chonghou was extremely stupid and absurd in accepting them ... If we insist on changing the treaty, there may not be trouble; if we do not, we are unworthy to be called a state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|volume=Volume 11, Part 2 of The Cambridge History of China Series|title=Late Ch'ing, 1800-1911|editor1-first=John King | editor1-last=Fairbank |editor2-first=Kwang-Ching |editor2-last=Liu |editor3-first=Denis Crispin |editor3-last=Twitchett |edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&amp;q=Liu+Chin-t%27ang%27s+big+German+guns+Pai+Yen-hu+without+resistance#v=onepage&amp;q=chang%20chih-tung%20covetous%20truculent&amp;f=false|year=1980|accessdate=18 January 2012|location=|page=94|isbn=0-521-22029-7|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the government declared it would refuse to [[ratification|ratify]] the treaty and pressed Russia to reopen negotiations. Naturally, Russia wanted to keep the treaty terms, but their only options were to risk another war in Xinjiang, which they were ill-prepared to fight, or agree to China's request. Russia understood that the [[Great power|Great Powers]] would not ignore an attempt to enforce an unratified treaty and had even kept the conditions a secret, fearing that European powers would intervene on China's behalf if the terms became known. Given their financial situation and the fact that Ili was not crucial to Russian security, they agreed to discuss a new treaty, but on one condition: that Chonghou was [[pardon]]ed and his life was spared.{{sfn|Paine|1996|pp=140–141}}&lt;ref name="Anonymous1894"/&gt;

As the months passed, tensions between the two countries remained high and both sides prepared for war. China dispatched [[Zeng Jize]] as their new negotiator. The foreign emissaries in Beijing pleaded on behalf of Chonghou, and even [[Queen Victoria]] personally interceded. Finally, on 12 August 1880, it was announced that Chonghou would be freed, and negotiations resumed. The resulting [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]] kept many of the same provisions as the Treaty of Livadia, with the major exceptions being that Russia would return almost all of Xinjiang, less a small area reserved for Dungans who wanted to become Russian citizens, and amount of the indemnity payment increased.&lt;ref name="Anonymous1894"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles1898"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Herbert Allen|title=A Chinese Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxH0PqdGTVUC&amp;pg=PA210|accessdate=22 February 2018|year=1898|publisher=Bernard Quaritch|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
For many years, the story that Chonghou was solely responsible for the debacle was perpetuated by the Chinese government, and this was the view put forth by historians as well. Although Chonghou had survived, he was turned into a [[nonperson]] by the government; he was expunged from government records and his letters were not published posthumously, as was the custom for Chinese court officials. Furthermore, neither the Chinese nor Russian governments retained any documents from the negotiations, thus making it difficult to determine how China ended up with an [[unequal treaty]] despite being in the better negotiating position.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=132}}

Historian {{nowrap|S. C. M.}} Paine investigated the circumstances around the treaty and discovered that contrary to the official story, Chonghou was an experienced diplomat and had a career of over thirty years in negotiations with France, England, and the United States.{{sfn|Millward|2007|p=134}} In fact, he led the delegation to France to offer the Chinese apology after the [[Tianjin Massacre]] in 1870.&lt;ref name="Hummel"&gt;{{Cite ECCP| title = CH'UNG-HOU | first=Lien-Chê | last=Tu |  accessdate = 25 February 2016| url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/CH'UNG-HOU.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Paine believes blame should be laid on the Qing government as a whole. At the [[Zongli Yamen]] (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), [[Prince Gong]], who had founded the ministry, had plenty of experience dealing with Russia during negotiations for the [[Convention of Peking]] in 1860, and during the Russian occupation period, there was plenty of communication between the two countries that Russian territorial and commercial demands should have been known long before negotiations started. However, despite its charter, the Zongli Yamen was not the only agency that dealt with foreign affairs. Even within the ministry, there was a split between those who were open to foreigners (such as Prince Gong) and those were not.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=138}}

Paine argues that given Chonghou's experience, because the terms were so unfavorable to China, it is unlikely that he would have made those concessions on his own, as evidenced from the subsequent outrage. It was only when [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] sought comment on the treaty from others that it turned into a scandal.{{sfn|Paine|1996|pp=136–137}} Cixi's installation of [[Guangxu Emperor|her nephew]] as emperor also created a power struggle in the government between her and Prince Gong, whose son was also in contention to succeed the [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. Thus, Prince Gong may have been distracted and unable to apply his foreign affairs expertise. In addition, [[Wenxiang]], another diplomat who was also experienced in negotiating with Westerners, had died in 1876.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=139}}

In short, Paine believes that Chonghou was poorly advised by the Zongli Yamen and when the court became outraged by the treaty, he became the scapegoat, otherwise the ministry and by extension [[Manchu people|Manchus]] (who made up the majority of Zongli Yamen officials) would have to take the blame.{{sfn|Paine|1996|p=140}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3979">The '''Uniform Partnership Act''' ('''UPA'''), which includes revisions that are sometimes called the '''Revised Uniform Partnership Act''' ('''RUPA'''), is a [[uniform act]] (similar to a model [[statute]]), proposed by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] ("NCCUSL") for the governance of business [[partnership]]s by [[U.S. State]]s.  Several versions of UPA have been promulgated by the NCCUSL, the earliest having been put forth in 1914, and the most recent in 1997.

==Revised Uniform Partnership Act==
The NCCUSL's first revision of UPA was promulgated in 1992 and amended in 1993 and 1994.  The 1994 revision was often referred to as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA).  Confusion arose when the 1996 and 1997 versions were also called RUPA.  Because of this confusion, the NCCUSL now officially refers to each UPA version as "Uniform Partnership Act (year)," where "year" is replaced by the actual year that NCCUSL approved it.  Many people still use the term "RUPA" to mean any version from 1994 forward.  Thus, "RUPA" may actually imply any version of UPA except the 1914 version.

==UPA and RUPA  differences==
The UPA and RUPA provide rules as to many aspects of a partnership relationship including formation, the ownership of partnership assets, the assessment of [[fiduciary]] duties, the settlement of partnership disputes, and termination.  Each allows modification of these rules in the individual agreement among the partners.  RUPA is significantly more detailed than is the UPA as to the degree to which the partnership agreement may modify the default rules set forth in the statute.  RUPA also clarifies the nature of a partnership itself by clearly defining it as an entity rather than an aggregation of individuals.  There are also a number of other important differences between UPA (1914) and subsequent versions.

==Enactment by states==
The 1914 version of the UPA was enacted into law in every state except [[Louisiana]]. The most recent revision has been enacted into law by 37 states.  The NCCUSL website lists the states that it considers to have adopted these and other uniform acts.  However, due to state variations it is not appropriate to rely upon this listing.  

The NCCUSL website lists these states as having adopted UPA (1997): [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], 
[[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[District of Columbia]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]],
[[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], [[Mississippi]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]], [[South Dakota]] (substantially similar), [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]] (substantially similar), [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Utah]], [[Vermont]], [[Virginia]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]].

The '''Village Building Convergence''' (VBC) is an annual 10-day event held every May in [[Portland, Oregon]], [[United States]]. The event is coordinated by the [[City Repair Project]] and consists of a series of workshops incorporating [[natural building]] and [[permaculture]] design at multiple sites around the city. Many of the workshops center on "intersection repairs" which aim to transform street intersections into public gathering spaces.

==Background==
In 1996, neighbors in the [[Sellwood, Portland, Oregon|Sellwood neighborhood]] of Portland at the intersection of 9th and Sherrett created a tea stand, children's playhouse and community library on the corner and renamed it "Share-It Square".&lt;ref&gt;Bergeson, Laine. [http://www.utne.com/issues/2004_124/promo/11257-1.html The Enlightened Intersection: A Portland, Oregon, neighborhood turns a street corner into a convivial gathering place.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525232131/http://www.utne.com/issues/2004_124/promo/11257-1.html |date=May 25, 2007 }} ''[[Utne Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Community organizers founded the City Repair Project that same year, seeking to share their vision with the community. In January 2000, the [[Portland, Oregon City Council|Portland City Council]] passed ordinance #172207, an "Intersection Repair" ordinance, allowing neighborhoods to develop public gathering places in certain street intersections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=998 Street-corner Revolution, Stephen Silha, [[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|Yes Magazine]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites==
The first Village Building Convergence took place in May 2002, then called the Natural Building Convergence.
During its history, the VBC has coordinated the creation of over 72 natural building and permaculture sites in Portland, including information kiosks, painted intersections, [[cob (material)|cob]] benches, and a [[Straw-bale construction|strawbale house]] at [[Dignity Village]]. The sites are primarily located in the southeast quadrant of Portland. Natural builders from around the world have coordinated the activities at many of the construction sites at the Village Building Convergence. Most of the labor taking place at the sites is done by volunteers.

==Workshops==
The VBC hosts a series of workshops, many of which are free to the public. Topics of the workshops are usually related to [[sustainability]] and [[natural building]]. Past workshops have included [[aikido]] lessons, outdoor mushroom cultivation, [[bioswale]] creation, and [[nonviolent communication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=35416 Streets meet; so can people, Jennifer Anderson, [[Portland Tribune]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speakers==
The VBC also hosts speakers and entertainment during the evenings of its convergences. Presentations for the 2007 convergence were made at [[Disjecta]] by [[Starhawk]], [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], and [[Paul Stamets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandtribune.com/sustainable/story.php?story_id=117918161387604900 Ideology, action converge and prosper, Rebecca Ragain, [[Portland Tribune]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior years' presentations have been given by [[Malik Rahim]], [[Toby Hemenway]], and Judy Bluehorse.
