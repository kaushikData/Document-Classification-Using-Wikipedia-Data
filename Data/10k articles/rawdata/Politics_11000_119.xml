The '''Ban 1080 Party''' is an unregistered [[political party]] in [[New Zealand]]. The party was founded in 2014 by Bill Wallace. It opposes the use of [[Sodium fluoroacetate|1080 poison (sodium fluoroacetate)]], which is widely [[1080 usage in New Zealand|used in New Zealand]] for controlling mammalian pests such as [[Common brushtail possum in New Zealand#Control|possums]] and rats.&lt;ref name=stuff1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10172333/Ban-1080-party-in-push-for-election |title=Ban 1080 party in push for election |publisher=Stuff |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11277899 |title=1080 battle gets political - National - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Laura |url=http://www.greystar.co.nz/content/1080-political-party-proposed |title=1080 political party proposed &amp;#124; Greymouth Star |publisher=Greystar.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's co-leaders are Bill Wallace and Mike Downard.&lt;ref name="plist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1408/S00324/ban-1080-candidates-announced-for-2014-general-election.htm |title=Ban 1080 Candidates announced for 2014 General Election |publisher=Ban 1080 Party |date=2014-08-19 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies ==
The Ban 1080 Party's stated policy is:

"to develop a pathway to a solution that includes the following elements:
# To immediately stop the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]]'s controlled aerial 1080 poison programme.
# To develop a science-based, measurable programme that includes
#* Species specific protection plans,
#* Targeted pest control, using people not poison,
#* Community conservation involvement.
# To protect all waterways by ensuring no future aerial poison drops."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ban1080.co.nz/party-policy/|title=Party Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=Ban 1080|publisher=|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The party considers that the Department of Conservation "has an important task in working to protect and preserve our natural environment", but believes that aerial 1080 drops harm native species and are ineffective at controlling rat and stoat populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ban1080.co.nz/|title=Aerial 1080 drops need to stop|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Ban 1080|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2014 general election===
The Ban 1080 Party contested the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 election]].&lt;ref name="stuff1" /&gt; The party applied for registration with the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] in mid-2014 and was approved on 8 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/application-register-ban1080-party |title=Application to Register Ban1080 Party |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |date=2014-07-08 |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/registration-ban1080-and-logo |title=Registration of Ban1080 and Logo |publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission |date=2014-08-08 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 2014, the party announced a party list of nine candidates, of which five were also electorate candidates.&lt;ref name="plist" /&gt;

The party received 0.21% of the party vote, below the 5% threshold, and did not win any electorates, so did not win any seats in Parliament. Of the electoral candidates, the most successful was Pete Salter, who stood in [[West Coast-Tasman]]. He received 2,318 electoral votes, which was 6.5% of electoral votes cast and placed him fourth.

===2017 general election===
In the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 election]] the Ban 1080 party nominated nine list candidates, including three electorate candidates. Pete Salter contested [[West Coast-Tasman]] again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/information-voters-who-when-and-where&lt;/ref&gt; The Ban 1080 Party gained only 0.1% of the party vote (3,005) and failed to win any seats in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="2017 general election results"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 General Election - Official Result|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CONELRAD''' ('''''Con'''trol of '''El'''ectromagnetic '''Rad'''iation'') was a method of [[State of emergency|emergency]] [[broadcasting]] to the public of the [[United States]] in the event of enemy attack during the [[Cold War]]. It was intended to allow continuous broadcast of [[civil defense]] information to the public using radio stations, while rapidly switching the transmitter stations to make the broadcasts unsuitable for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bombers that might attempt to [[radio direction finding|home in]] on the signals (as was done during [[World War II]], when German radio stations, based in or near cities, were used as beacons by pilots of bombers).

U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] established CONELRAD in 1951. After the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] reduced the likelihood of a bomber attack, CONELRAD was replaced by the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] (EBS) on August 5, 1963, which was later replaced by the [[Emergency Alert System]] (EAS) on January 1, 1997; all have been administered by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940303,00.html|title=Sign-off for conelrad|date=July 12, 1963|work=Time|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the EBS and EAS, CONELRAD was never intended to be used for local civil emergencies such as severe weather.

==History==
[[Image:CONELRAD AM DIAL LARGE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|"CD Mark" symbols (usually simple white or red triangles) at CONELRAD's 640 and 1240 kHz frequencies were on the dials of most radios sold in the US between 1953 and 1963.&lt;ref name="tvt"/&gt;]]

Prior to 1951, there was no systematic way for the U.S. government to communicate with citizens during an emergency. However, broadcasters would typically interrupt normal programming to issue emergency bulletins, as happened during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941 and [[1948 Tinker Air Force Base tornadoes|the first successful tornado warning]] in 1948. Such bulletins were the forerunner to CONELRAD.

The CONELRAD concept was originally known as the ''Key Station System''. According to an FCC document created during the "Informal Government–Industry Technical Conference" on March 26, 1951:

{{quote|The primary plan for alerting broadcast stations that is currently being considered by the FCC Study Group is known as the Key Station System. The arrangement requires certain telephone circuits (private wire or direct line to Toll Board) between the Air Defense Control Centers (A.D.C.C.) and specified radio stations to be known as "Basic Key Stations."

Additional telephone circuits (direct line to Toll Board) will be required in certain cases, between "Basic Key Stations" and other stations to be known as "Relay Key Stations". Each "Basic Key Station" receiving an alert or warning signal from the A.D.C.C. shall, if so directed, proceed to broadcast a predetermined message and also relay the message by telephone to all "Relay Key Stations" under his control as specified." CONELRAD was officially introduced on December 10, 1951.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/09/16/archives/citys-civil-defense-sirens-will-be-tested-tomorrow.html|title=City's Civil Defense Sirens Will Be Tested Tomorrow|date=September 16, 1963|work=New York Times|pages=30|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

CONELRAD had a simple system for alerting the public and other "downstream" stations, consisting of a sequence of shutting the station off for five seconds, returning to the air for five seconds, again shutting down for five seconds, returning to the air again (for 5 seconds), and then transmitting a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone for 15 seconds. Key stations would be alerted directly. All other broadcast stations would monitor a designated station in their area.

In the event of an emergency, all United States [[television]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio station]]s were required to stop broadcasting. Upon alert, most [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[medium wave|medium-wave]] stations shut down. The stations that stayed on the air would transmit on either 640 or 1240&amp;nbsp;kHz. They would transmit for several minutes and then go off the air, and another station would take over on the same frequency in a "round robin" chain. This was to confuse enemy aircraft who might be navigating using [[radio direction finding]]. By law, radio sets manufactured between 1953 and 1963 had these two frequencies marked by the triangle-in-circle ("CD Mark") symbol of [[Civil Defense]].&lt;ref name="tvt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/66838|title=An Emergency Alert System for the Digital Era|last=Rhodes|first=Charles|date=September 17, 2008|work=[[TV Technology]]|publisher=New Bay Media|pages=30–34|accessdate=2008-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008051854/http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/66838#|archive-date=2008-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the system by which the CONELRAD process was initiated (switching the transmitter on and off) was simple, it was prone to numerous false alarms, especially during lightning storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Mishkind| first = Barry| title = Broadcast History| work = The Broadcast Archive |date = 22 March 1999| url = http://www.oldradio.com/current/bc_conel.htm | accessdate = 29 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmitters could be damaged by the quick cycling. The switching later became known informally as the "EBS Stress Test" (due to many transmitters failing during tests) and was eventually discontinued when broadcast technology advanced enough to make it unnecessary.

Beginning January 2, 1957,  U.S. [[amateur radio]] came under CONELRAD rules and amateur stations were also required to stop transmitting if commercial radio stations went off the air due to an alert. Several companies marketed special receivers that monitored local broadcast stations, sounding an alarm and automatically deactivating the amateur's transmitter when the broadcast station went off the air.&lt;ref name="SterlingO'Dell2011"&gt;{{citation|author1=Christopher H. Sterling|author2=Cary O'Dell|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of American Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmmLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|date=9 February 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-17684-6|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article featured in the November 14, 1960 issue, the author details why the warning system consisting of localized [[Civil defense siren]]s and the CONELRAD radio-alert system was "basically unsound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711937,00.html |work=TIME | title=CIVIL DEFENSE: Buzzers Mean Bombs | date=14 November 1960 | accessdate=19 May 2010 |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author's alternative was to advocate for the [[National Emergency Alarm Repeater]] as a supplement, which did not need a radio or television to be switched on to warn citizens, nor a large CD siren to be in their vicinity.

=== False alarms ===
On May 5, 1955, the [[Continental Air Defense Command]] Western Division went to yellow alert for 3 to 10 minutes (depending on the alerted state), beginning at 10:40 AM PDT. The alert was raised by a Canadian radar emplacement which was unaware of an outbound United States [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47 bomber]] training exercise, due to communication failures. A yellow alert meant "attack expectable", and word was sent to government and civil defense organizations. In the seven minute window, the city of Oakland, the Sacramento Capitol Building, and others quickly sounded their alert sirens. In contrast, the City of Sacramento civil defense director waited for further confirmation before sounding the citywide siren; ultimately, he never did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/80325430|title='Yellow Alert' Sounds in Pacific Coast Cities as U.S. Jets Fail to Get Proper Radar Clearance in Canada|last=UP|first=|date=1955-05-06|work=Statesman Journal|access-date=2018-05-22|page=2-7|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alert was not acted on at all in Colorado due to the short length, and in Nevada, there was no alert because the person responsible for acting on it "did not know what to do with it".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/162732404|title=Mixup Causes Air Alert in West|last=AP|first=|date=1955-05-06|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2018-05-22|page=1|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Utah, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, and Louisiana, a yellow alert was not passed along to civil authorities at all, and those states issued a "white" (military emergency) alert to units in their state instead.

On the evening of November 5, 1959, WJPG, the CONELRAD control station for Northeast Wisconsin and Upper Michigan was incorrectly sent an alert status message, "This is an air defense radio alert", rather than what should have been sent for a test, "This is an air defense line check." All three of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s television stations ([[WFRV-TV|WFRV]], [[WLUK-TV|WLUK]], and [[WBAY-TV|WBAY]]), as well as Green Bay radio stations WBAY-AM and [[WNFL|WJPG]] (and other Upper Michigan radio stations) were immediately taken off line as preparations were made for high priority stations to begin broadcasting on the two authorized CONELRAD AM frequencies. The transmission error was realized and CONELRAD alert preparation (and its media blackout) reversed for affected stations about 20 minutes later.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/287867856|title=SAGE Alert Causes Brief TV Blackout|last=|first=|date=1959-11-06|work=The Post-Crescent|access-date=2018-05-21|page=A1|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar false attack alarm was sent to radio and television stations through CONELRAD's replacement, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]], in 1971.

[[File:Ignacio María Barreda - Las castas mexicanas.jpg|thumb|250px|Depiction of the casta system in [[Mexico]].]]

A '''casta''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkasta|lang}}) was a term to describe mixed-race individuals in Spanish America, resulting from unions of European whites (''españoles''), Amerindians (''indios''), and Africans (''negros''). Racial categories had legal and social consequences, since racial status was an organizing principle of Spanish colonial rule. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European elites created a complex hierarchical system of race classification.  The ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'' was used in the 17th and 18th century in New Spain, a vast area of land starting just below Alaska stretching all the way to the Isthmus of Panama, plus the entire Caribbean, the Floridas and [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Philippines]], to formally rank the [[mestizo|mixed-race]] people who were born during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|post-Conquest period]]. The process of mixing ancestries in the union of people of different races was known as '''mestizaje''' ({{lang-pt|mestiçagem}} {{IPA-pt|meʃtʃiˈsaʒẽj|}}, {{IPA-pt|mɨʃtiˈsaʒɐ̃j|}}). In Spanish colonial law, mixed-race castas were classified as part of the ''república de españoles'' and not the ''república de indios'', which set Amerindians outside the Hispanic sphere. Other terminology for classification is categorization based on the degree of acculturation to [[Hispanic|Hispanic culture]], which distinguished between ''[[gente de razón]]'' (Hispanics, literally, "people of reason") and ''gente sin razón'' (non-acculturated natives), concurrently existed and supported the idea of the racial classification system. 

Created by Hispanic elites, the ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'', varied largely due to their birth, color, race and origin of ethnic types. The system of casta was more than socio-racial classification. It had an effect on every aspect of life, including economics and taxation. Both the Spanish colonial state and the Church required more tax and tribute payments from those of lower socio-racial categories.&lt;ref name=cahill1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Colour by Numbers: Racial and Ethnic Categories in the Viceroyalty of Peru|author=David Cahill|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|year=1994|volume=26|pages=325–346|url=http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/ahern1/SpanishH680/secure/Cahill%20-%20colour%20by%20numbers,%2012%20pages.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0022216x00016242|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200024/http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/ahern1/SpanishH680/secure/Cahill%20-%20colour%20by%20numbers%2C%2012%20pages.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mm1&gt;{{cite web|author=Maria Elena Martinez|title=The Spanish Concept of Limpieza de Sangre and the Emergence of the Race/caste System in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, PhD dissertation|publisher=University of Chicago|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to Spanish ideas about purity of blood (which historically also related to its reconquest of Spain from the Moors), the colonists established a caste system in Latin America by which a person's socio-economic status generally correlated with race or racial mix in the known family background, or simply on phenotype (physical appearance) if the family background was unknown. From the colonial period, when the Spanish imposed control, many wealthy persons and high government officials were of peninsular (Iberian) and/or European background, while African or indigenous ancestry, or dark skin, generally was correlated with inferiority and poverty.  The "whiter" the heritage a person could claim, the higher in status they could climb; conversely, darker features meant less opportunity.

Casta paintings were a new, secular art form primarily produced in eighteenth-century Mexico. A notable exception to the secular nature of the genre is [[Luis de Mena]]'s 1750 painting of [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] with castas.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, [http://msem.ucpress.edu/content/31/2/218 “Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting.”] Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{History of New Spain}}

''Casta'' is an Iberian word (existing in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and other Iberian languages since the Middle Ages), meaning "[[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]", "[[breed]]" or "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]". It is derived from the older Latin word ''castus'', "chaste", implying that the lineage has been kept pure. ''Casta'' gave rise to the [[English language|English]] word ''[[caste]]'' during the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern Period]].&lt;ref&gt;"Caste," ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 10th edition. (Springfield, 1999.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Caste," ''New Oxford American Dictionary'', 2nd edition. (Oxford, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Purity of blood" and the evolution of racial classification==
The idea of "purity of blood", ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'', originating under Moorish rule, developed in Christian Spain to denote those without the "taint" of Jewish (or, later Muslim/Moorish) heritage ("blood"). It was directly linked to religion and notions of legitimacy, lineage and honor following Spain's reconquest of Moorish territory. It was institutionalized during the [[Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Elena Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions: Limpieza de Sangre, Religion, and Gender in Colonial Mexico,'' Stanford: Stanford University Press 2008, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition only allowed those Spaniards who could demonstrate not to have Jewish and Moorish blood to emigrate to Latin America. Both in Spain and in the New World [[crypto-Jews]] (converts who continued to secretly practice Judaism) were aggressively prosecuted. Some emigrated as Portuguese merchants to Mexico City and Lima, following the successful revolt of Portugal in 1640 against the Castillian Crown. Several spectacular [[auto da fe|autos de fe]] in New Spain in the mid-seventeenth century featured the public punishment of those convicted of being "Judaizers" (''judaizantes'').&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan I. Israel, ''Race, Class, and Politics in Colonial Mexico, 1610-1670.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press 1975, pp. 245-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish America, the idea of purity of blood was in a complex fashion linked to ideas of race, particularly pertaining to mixing of whites ("españoles") and non-whites (Indians and mixed-race castas). Spaniards had become obsessed with lineage, following the expulsion of Moors and Jews, and forced conversion of those who chose to remain. Evidence of lack of purity of blood had consequences for marriage, eligibility for office, entrance into the priesthood, and emigration to Spain's overseas territories. Having to produce genealogical records to prove one's pure ancestry gave rise to a trade in the creation of false genealogies.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions'', p. 266-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the concept of purity of blood was transferred overseas, it retained the concerns about tainted ancestry of Jews or Muslims in a family line. During the early colonial decades, the Spanish in the New World had unions and marriages with indigenous women, resulting in generations of mixed-race children. In the late sixteenth century, some investigations of ancestry classified as "stains" any connection with Black Africans ("negros", which resulted in "mulatos") and sometimes mixtures with indigenous that produced [[Mestizos]].&lt;ref name="Martinez, p. 267"&gt;Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; While some illustrations from the period show men of African descent dressed in fashionable clothing and as aristocrats in upper-class surroundings, the idea that any hint of black ancestry was a stain developed by the end of the colonial period. It was illustrated in eighteenth-century paintings of racial hierarchy, known as casta paintings.

The idea in [[New Spain]] that native or Indian (''indio'') blood in a lineage was an impurity may well have come about as the optimism of the early [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]] faded about creating Indian priests trained at the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]], which ceased that function in the mid-sixteenth century.  In addition, the Indian nobility, which was recognized by the Spanish colonists, had declined in importance, and there were fewer formal marriages between Spaniards and indigenous women than during the early decades of the colonial era.&lt;ref name="Martinez, p. 267"/&gt; In the seventeenth century in New Spain, the ideas of purity of blood became associated with "Spanishness and whiteness, but it came to work together with socio-economic categories", such that a lineage with someone engaged in work with their hands was tainted by that connection.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indians in Central Mexico were affected by ideas of purity of blood from the other side. Crown decrees on purity of blood were affirmed by indigenous communities, which barred Indians from holding office who had any non-Indians (Spaniards and/or Blacks) in their lineage. In indigenous communities "local [[caciques]] [rulers] and principales were granted a set of privileges and rights on the basis of their pre-Hispanic noble bloodlines and acceptance of the Catholic faith."&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous nobles submitted proofs (''probanzas'') of their purity of blood to affirm their rights and privileges that were extended to themselves and their communities. This supported the ''república de indios'', a legal division of society that separated indigenous from non-Indians (''república de españoles'').&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, ''Genealogical Fictions'', p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late eighteenth century, the pace of race mixture ('''mestizaje''') increased in New Spain, political changes of the [[Bourbon Reforms]] privileged peninsular Spaniards over American-born Spaniards, and casta paintings began to be produced in great numbers in Mexico. It'' was also the period when the power of the sistema de castas declined significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Nodin Valdés, "The Decline of the ''Sociedad de Castas'' in Mexico City".'' PhD dissertation, University of Michigan, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castas==
[[Image:Cabrera Pintura de Castas.jpg|thumb|250px|''De español y mulata, morisca''. [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763, oil on canvas, 136x105 cm, private collection.]]

In Spanish America (and many other places), racial categories were formal legal classifications.  Initially in Spanish America there were three racial categories. They generally referred to the multiplicity of indigenous American peoples as "Indians" (''indios''), a Spanish term applied to, but seldom used by Amerinds themselves.  Those from Spain called themselves ''españoles'', which in the late colonial period was further refined to those born in Iberia, called politely ''peninsulares'', while American-born españoles were called criollos. The third group were black Africans, called ''negros'' ("Blacks"), brought as slaves from the earliest days of Spanish empire in the Caribbean.  There were fewer Spanish women than men who immigrated to the New World and fewer black women than men, so that mixed-race offspring of Spaniards and of Blacks were often the product of liaisons with indigenous women. The process of race mixture was termed '''mestizaje'''. 

In the sixteenth century, the term ''casta'', a collective category for mixed-race individuals, came into existence as the numbers grew, particularly in urban areas. The crown had divided the population of its overseas empire into two categories, separating Indians from non-Indians. Indigenous were the '''República de Indios''', the other the '''República de Españoles''', essentially the Hispanic sphere, so that Spaniards, Blacks, and mixed-race castas were lumped into this category. Official censuses and ecclesiastical records noted an individual's racial category, so that these sources can be used to chart socio-economic standard, residence patterns, and other important data.

General racial groupings had their own set of privileges and restrictions, both legal and customary. So, for example, only Spaniards and indigenous, who were deemed to be the original societies of the Spanish dominions, had recognized aristocracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacLachlan | first = Colin  |author2=Jaime E.

Access to these privileges and even a person's perceived and accepted racial classification, however, were also determined by that person's [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] standing in society.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Passing (racial identity)]] for a discussion of a related phenomenon, although in a later and very different cultural and legal context.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seed | first = Patricia | authorlink = Patricia Seed | title = To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico: Conflicts over Marriage Choice, 1574-1821 | publisher = Stanford University | year = 1988 | location = Stanford | pages = 21–23 | isbn = 0-8047-2159-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bakewell | first =Peter | title = A History of Latin America | publisher = Blackwell | year = 1997 | location = Malden, Mass.| pages = 160–163 | isbn = 0-631-16791-9 | quote= The Spaniards generally regarded [local Indian lords/''caciques''] as ''hidalgos'', and used the honorific 'don' with the more eminent of them.

[…] simple wealth gained from using America's human and natural resources soon became a strong influence on social standing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long lists of different terms found in casta paintings do not appear in official documentation, which count Spaniards, mestizos, Blacks and mulattoes, and indigenous (''indios'') were found in censuses.  By the end of the colonial period in 1821, over one hundred categories of possible variations of mixture existed.&lt;ref name= "Almanac"&gt;{{Citation|editor= Sonia G. Benson|title= The Hispanic American Almanac: A Reference Work on Hispanics in the United States.|edition= Third|year= 2003|publisher= Thompson Gale|isbn= 0-7876-2518-3|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban race mixture===

In his analysis of the 1790 census of [[Mexico City]] and its surrounding area, Dennis Nodin Valdés shows that the major colonial metropolis had a higher proportion of Spaniards and castas than Indians. In addition, there were higher rates of persons of mixed race, or ''mestizaje,'' than in the surrounding countryside, which was dominated by indios.  He compared the population of the capital of [[New Spain]] with the census of the Intendancy of Mexico in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Nodin Valdés, “The Decline”, Table 2.2, p. 58. The census of the Intendancy is found in the Archivo General de la Nación (México), Impresos Officiales, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials.  In both the capital and the intendancy, the European population was the smallest percentage, with 2,335 in the capital (2.2%) and the intendancy 1,330 (.1%).  The listing for Spaniard (español) was 50,371 (48.1%), with the intendancy showing 134,695 (12.9%). For [[mestizo]]s (in which he has merged the castizos), in the capital there were 19,357 (18.5%) and in the intendancy 112,113 (10.7%).  For the [[mulatto]] category, the capital listed 7,094 (6.8%) with the intendancy showing 52,629 (5.0%). There is apparently no separate category for blacks (Negros). The category Indian showed 25,603 (24.4%) in the capital, with the intendancy having 742,186 (71.1).  The capital had the largest concentration of Spaniards and castas, and the countryside was overwhelmingly Indian.  The population of the capital “indicates that conditions favoring mestizaje were more favorable in the city than the outlying area".&lt;ref&gt;Nodin Valdés, “The Decline” p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1811 census of Mexico City by residential sectors, there is no evidence of absolute segregation by race, an important finding.&lt;ref&gt;Nodin Valdés, “The Decline” p. 62; Chart 2.5, p. 64. The census is found in Archivo General de la Nación (México), Padrones 53-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest concentration of Spaniards was around the ''traza'', the central sector of the city where the civil and religious institutions were based and where there was the highest concentration of wealthy merchants. But non-Spaniards also lived there.  Indians were found in higher concentrations in the sectors on the fringes of the capital. Castas appear as residents in all sectors of the capital.

==Racial terminology==
Although the system could contain in excess of thirty categories, practical necessity reduced this number to seven groups ranked as follows : Spaniards, ''castizos'', ''moriscos'', ''mestizos'', ''mulattoes'', Indians, and Africans. The terms for the more complex racial mixtures tended to vary in meaning and use and from region to region. (For example, different sets of casta paintings will give a different set of terms and interpretations of their meaning.) For the most part, only the first few terms in the lists were used in documents and everyday life, the general descending order of precedence being:

===Overview===
The main divisions were as follows:
# ''Español'' (fem. española), i.e. [[Spaniards|Spaniard]] – person of Spanish or other European ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into ''Peninsulares'' and ''Criollos''
#* ''[[Peninsulars|Peninsular]]'' – a European born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;
#* ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' (fem. criolla)&amp;nbsp;– a white person with Spanish or other European descent born in the Americas;
# ''[[Castizo]]'' (fem. castiza) – a person with primarily European and some Amerindian ancestry born into a mixed family; the offspring of a ''castizo'' and an ''español'' was considered ''español''.
# ''Mestizo'' (fem. mestiza) – a person of extended mixed European and Amerindian ancestry;
# ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]]'' (fem. India) – a person of pure Amerindian ancestry;
# ''[[Pardo]]'' (fem. parda) – a person of mixed white European, Amerindian and black African ancestry;
# ''[[Mulatto]]'' (fem. mulata) – a person of mixed white European and black African ancestry;
# ''[[Zambo]]'' – a person of mixed native black African and Amerindian ancestry;
# ''[[Negro]]'' (fem. negra)&amp;nbsp;– a person of black [[Atlantic slave trade|African]] descent, primarily African slaves and their descendants.

=== ''Españoles'' (Spaniards) ===
These were people of Spanish descent. People of other European descent who had settled in Spanish America and adapted to [[Hispanic]] culture, such as [[Pedro de Gante]] (from Ghent) and the Marquises of [[Ambrosio O'Higgins, Marquis of Osorno|Osorno]] and [[Carlos Francisco de Croix, marqués de Croix|Croix]], would have also been considered ''Españoles''. Also, as noted above, and below under "Mestizos" and "''Castizos''", many people with some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] ancestry were considered ''Españoles''.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez O. p. 199"&gt;MacLachlan and Rodríguez O., p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Españoles'' were one of the three original "races", the other two being Amerindians and Blacks. Both immigrant and American-born ''Españoles'' (criollos) generally shared the same rights and privileges, although there were a few cases in which the law differentiated between them.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez O. p. 199"/&gt; For example, it became customary in some [[Cabildo (council)|municipal councils]] for the office of ''[[alcalde]]'' to alternate between a [[Peninsulares|European]] and an [[Criollo people|American]]. Spaniards were therefore divided into:

==== ''Peninsulares'' (Spaniards and other Europeans born in Europe) ====
{{Further|Peninsulares}}

Persons of [[Spain|Spanish]] descent born in Spain (i.e., from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], hence their name). Generally, there were two groups of ''Peninsulares.'' The first group includes those who were appointed to important jobs in the government, the army, and the Catholic Church by the Crown. This system was intended to perpetuate the ties of the governing elite to the Spanish crown. The theory was that an outsider should be appointed to rule over a certain society, therefore a New Spaniard would not be appointed Viceroy of New Spain. These officials usually had a long history of service to the Crown and were moved around the Empire frequently, as in career civil service positions. They usually did not live permanently in any one place in Latin America.

The second group of ''Peninsulares'' did settle permanently in a specific region and came to be associated with it. The first wave were the original settlers, the [[Conquistador]]s, who became [[lord]]s of an area through their act of conquest. In the centuries after the Conquest, more ''Peninsulares'' continued to immigrate to New Spain  under different circumstances, usually for commercial reasons. Some came as [[indentured servant]]s to established Criollo families in order to gain passage. ''Peninsulares'' were of all socioeconomic classes in America. Once they settled, they tended to form families, so ''Peninsulares'' and Criollos were united and divided by family ties and tensions.

==== ''Criollos'' (Spaniards and other Europeans born in America) ====
{{Further|Criollo people}}

A Spanish term meaning "native born and raised", ''criollo'' historically was applied to both white and black non-indigenous persons born in America, in addition to animals and products. Because of the lack of white people in the Spanish colonies, during the first generations after the conquest, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimately-born]] biological criollos were simply considered ''españoles criollos'' (see, [[Hyperdescent]]). In today's historiography, the term "criollo" means only the white people Born in America, who had unmixed Spanish or European ancestry both matrilineal and patrilineal. In the reality of the period, as noted, many criollos ended up interbreeding with the financially successful [[mestizos]] and [[castizos]], who physically appeared white, but had some native ancestry. The knowledge of mixed ancestry was usually disregarded for families that had maintained a certain status and they were accepted as criollos.&lt;ref name="Magali M. Carrera"&gt;{{cite book |title= Imagining Identity in New Spain: Race, Lineage, and the Colonial Body in Portraiture and Casta Paintings (Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Series in Latin American and Latino Art and Culture) |last= Carrera |first= Magali M. |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-292-71245-4  |pages= 12|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the  second- or third-generation criollos became wealthy from the mines, ranches, or [[haciendas]] they owned. Criollo families who became extremely wealthy joined the ranks of the high nobility of the Spanish Empire. Still, most were part of what could be termed the [[petite bourgeoisie]] and some were poor. As lifelong residents of America, they, like all other residents of these areas, often participated in trading [[contraband]], since the traditional monopolies of [[Seville]], and later [[Cádiz]], could not supply all their trade needs.{{citation needed |date=November 2015}} (They were more than occasionally aided by royal officials turning a blind eye to this activity).

Criollos tended to be appointed to the lower-level government jobs&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Lynn V. (2000). ''A Brief History of Central America.''. New York: Facts On File, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8160-3962-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—they had sizable representation in the municipal councils. But, with the sale of offices that began in the late 16th century, they gained access to high-level posts, such as judges on the regional ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]s''. The 19th-century [[Spanish American wars of independence|wars of independence]] have often been characterized as a struggle between ''Peninsulares'' and Criollos, but both groups can be found on both sides of the wars.

=== ''Indios'' (Native Americans) ===
{{Further|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}

The original inhabitants of the Americas were considered to be one of the three "pure races" in [[Spanish America]]; under Spanish colonial law, they were classified and regulated as [[minor (law)|minor]]s, and as such were to be protected by royal officials. In practice, they often suffered repression and abuse by the local elites. After the initial conquest, the elites of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Aztec]] and other Amerindian states were assimilated into the Spanish nobility through intermarriage.&lt;ref name="Rodríguez O. pp. 113-115"&gt;MacLachlan and Rodríguez O., pp. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern 1993 132–134, 163–164, 174–175"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stern | first = Steve | title = Peru's Indian Peoples and the Challenge of Spanish Conquest | publisher = University of Wisconsin | edition = 2nd | year = 1993 | location = Madison | pages = 132–134, 163–164, 174–175 | isbn = 0-299-14184-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional Native nobility, where it existed, was recognized and redefined along European standards by the Spanish.&lt;!--Explain--&gt; It had to deal with the difficulty of existing in a colonial society, but it remained in place until independence in 1821.&lt;!-- What happened then? --&gt; Amerindians could belong to any economic class depending on their personal wealth,&lt;ref name="Rodríguez O. pp. 113-115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern 1993 132–134, 163–164, 174–175"/&gt; but most were peasants and poor.

=== ''Mestizos'' (mixed Native American and European) ===
{{Further|Mestizo}}

Persons with one Spanish parent and one Amerindian parent. The term was originally associated with illegitimacy because in the generations after the Conquest, mixed-race children born ''in wedlock'' were assigned either a simple Amerindian or Spanish identity, depending with which culture they were raised. (''See [[Hyperdescent]] and [[Hypodescent]].'') The number of official Mestizos rises in censuses only after the second half of the 17th century, when a sizable and stable community of mixed-race people with no claims on being either Amerindian or Spanish appeared.

=== ''Castizos'' (European with some Indigenous) ===
{{Further|Castizo}}

One of the many terms, like the ones below, used to describe people with varying degrees of racial mixture. In this case ''Castizos'' were people with one Mestizo parent and one Spanish parent.  The children of a ''Castizo'' with a Spaniard or another ''Castizo'', were often classified and accepted as a Criollo Spaniard.&lt;ref name = "Magali M. Carrera"/&gt;

=== ''Cholos'' (Native American with some Mestizo) ===
{{Further|Cholo}}
Persons with one Amerindian parent and one Mestizo parent.

=== ''Pardos'' (mixed European, African, and Native American)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldesafiodelahistoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=193:silvio-di-bernardo&amp;catid=94:publicate&amp;Itemid=129|title=El Desafío de la Historia|website=Eldesafiodelahistoria.com|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
{{Further|Pardo}}
People who are the product of the mixing over the generations of the European, Black African, and Amerindians. This mix may come about from a white Spaniard mating with a Zambo, an Amerindian mating with a Mulatto, or a Black African mating with a Mestizo. The term is in current use in [[Brazil]], where they form slightly less than one-half the population (although {{lang|pt|pardo}} in Portuguese merely means brown and is used for any sort of mixed-race ancestry other than the mix of white and Asian). Pardos in Spanish America were common in the Caribbean, such as [[Puerto Rico]] (see [[Demographics of Puerto Rico#Genetic studies|here]]), [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Cuba]].

=== ''Mulatos'' (mixed African and European) ===
{{Further|Mulatto}}

Persons of the first generation of a Spanish and Black/African ancestry. If they were born into slavery (that is their mother was a slave), they would be slaves, unless freed by their master or manumitted.  In popular parlance, ''mulato'' could also denote an individual of mixed African and Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name="aim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwaller |first1= Robert C. |year=2010 |title=''Mulata, Hija de Negro y India'': Afro-Indigenous ''Mulatos'' in Early Colonial Mexico|journal=Journal of Social History |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=889–914 |doi=10.1353/jsh.2011.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further terms to describe other degrees of mixture included, among many others, ''Morisco'', (not to be confused with the peninsular ''[[Morisco]]'', from which the term was borrowed) a person of Mulatto and Spanish parents, i.e., a [[quadroon]], and ''Albino'' (derived from [[Albinism|albino]]), a person of ''Morisco'' and Spanish parents, i.e., an octoroon.

=== ''Zambos'' (mixed Native American and African) ===
{{Further|Zambo}}

Persons who were of mixed Amerindian and Black ancestry. As with Mulattoes, many other terms existed to describe the degree of mixture. These included ''Chino'' and ''Lobo''. ''Chino'' usually described someone as having Mulatto and Amerindian parents. The word ''chino'' derives from the Spanish word ''cochino'', meaning "pig",&lt;ref name="Cuervas" &gt;Hernández Cuevas, M.P. The Mexican Colonial Term “Chino” Is a Referent of Afrodescendant. ''The Journal of Pan African Studies, vol.5, no.5,'' June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase ''pelo chino'', meaning "curly hair", is a reference to the ''casta'' known as ''chino'' that possessed kinky or curly hair.&lt;ref name="Cuervas" /&gt;

Since there was some immigration from the [[Spanish East Indies]] during the colonial period, ''chino'' is often confused, even by contemporary historians, as a word for [[Asian people|Asian]] peoples, which is the primary meaning of the word, but not usually in the context of the castas. ''Lobo'' could describe a person of Black and Amerindian parents (and therefore, a [[synonym]] for ''Zambo''), as in the image gallery below, or someone of Amerindian and ''Torna atrás'' parents.

=== ''Negros'' (Africans) ===
{{Further|Black people}}

With Spaniards and Amerindians, this was the third original race in this paradigm, but low on the social scale because of their association with slavery. These were people of full [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n descent. Many, especially among the first generation, were slaves, but there were sizable free-Black communities. Distinction was made between Blacks born in Africa (''[[negro bozal|negros bozales]]'') and therefore possibly less acculturated, Blacks born in the Iberian Peninsula ([[Black Ladinos]]), and Blacks born in the Indies, these sometimes referred to as ''negros criollos''.

Their low social status was enforced legally. They were prohibited by law from many positions, such as entering the priesthood, and their testimony in court was valued less than others. But they could join [[militia]]s created especially for them. In contrast with the binary "[[one-drop rule]]", which evolved in the late-19th-century [[United States]], people of mixed-Black ancestry were recognized as multiple separate groups, as noted above.

===Other terms===
Other fanciful or derogatory terms existed, such as a ''[[tornatrás|torna atrás]]'' (literally, "turns back", but equivalent to the English term "throwback") and ''tente en el aire'' ("hold-yourself-in-midair") in New Spain or a ''requinterón'' in Peru,&lt;ref&gt;{{cit news |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14794012.2015.1022373 |title=The Vitriolic Blood of a Negro: The Development of Racial Identity and Creole Elitism in New Spain and Spanish Louisiana, 1763-1803 |date=April 17, 2015 |last=Wegmann |first=Andrew N. |work=Journal of Transatlantic Studies |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implied that a child of only one-sixteenth Black ancestry is born looking Black to seemingly white parents. These terms were rarely used in legal documents and existed mostly in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spanish]] phenomenon of casta paintings (''pinturas de castas''), which showed possible mixtures down to several generations.&lt;ref&gt;Katzew, ''Casta Painting'' 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Miscegenation in Spanish colonies}}

==Casta paintings in 18th-century Mexico==
[[File:Casta_Painting_by_Luis_de_Mena.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luis de Mena]], [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] and castas, 1750]]
[[Image:Casta painting all.jpg|thumb|350px|''Las castas''. Anonymous, 18th century, oil on canvas, 148x104 cm, Museo Nacional del Virreinato, [[Tepotzotlán]], Mexico.]]

The interest of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]] in organizing knowledge and scientific description, resulted in the commission of many series of pictures that document the racial combinations that existed in the exotic lands that Spain possessed on the other side of the world. Many sets of these paintings still exist (around one hundred complete sets in museums and private collections and many more individual paintings), of varying artistic quality, usually consisting of sixteen paintings representing as many racial combinations. Some of the finer sets were done by prominent Mexican artists, such as [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], José Joaquín Magón (who painted two sets), [[José de Ibarra]], and [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]]. These artists worked together in the painting guilds of New Spain. They were important transitional artists in 18th-century casta painting. At least one Spaniard, [[Francisco Clapera]], also contributed to the casta genre.  In general, little is known of most artists who did sign their work; most casta paintings are unsigned.

The overall themes that emerge in these paintings are the "supremacy of the Spaniards", the possibility that Indians could become Spaniards through miscegenation with Spaniards and the "regression to an earlier moment of racial development" that mixing with Blacks would cause to Spaniards. These series generally depict the descendants of Indians becoming Spanish after three generations of intermarriage with Spaniards (usually the, "''De español y castiza, español''" painting).&lt;ref name="Katzew, Casta Painting."&gt;Katzew, "Casta Painting."&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, mixtures with Blacks, both by Indians and Spaniards, led to a bewildering number of combinations, with "fanciful terms" to describe them. Instead of leading to a new racial type or equilibrium, they led to apparent disorder. Terms such as the above-mentioned ''tente en el aire'' and ''no te entiendo'' ("I don't understand you")—and others based on terms used for animals: ''mulato'' (mule) and ''lobo'' (wolf), ''chino'' (derived from ''cochino'' meaning "pig")&lt;ref name="Cuervas" /&gt;—reflect the fear and mistrust that Spanish officials, society and those who commissioned these paintings saw these new racial types.&lt;ref name="Katzew, Casta Painting."/&gt;

At the same time, it must be emphasized that these paintings reflected the views of the economically established Criollo society and officialdom. ''Castas'' defined themselves in different ways, and how they were recorded in official records was a process of negotiation between the ''casta'' and the person creating the document, whether it was a birth certificate, a marriage certificate or a court deposition. In real life, many ''casta'' individuals were assigned different racial categories in different documents, revealing the fluid nature of racial identity in colonial, [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]]n society.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, ''The Limits of Racial Domination'' and Seed, ''To Love, Honor, and Obey'', in passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Spain]], one of the Viceroyalties of the [[Spanish Empire]], casta paintings illustrated where each person in the New World ranked in the system. These paintings from 18th and 19th centuries were popular in Spain and other parts of Europe. They reflected the Spaniards’ sense of racial superiority by illustrating an orderly hierarchical society where socio-economic status depended on skin color and ''limpieza de sangre'' (purity of blood).&lt;ref name=mm1/&gt;&lt;ref name="María Elena Martínez 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Order in the Spanish New World|author=María Elena Martínez |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service, United States|year=2010|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/when-worlds-collide/pdf/essays-socialorder.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paintings depicted the innate character and quality of people because of their birth and ethnic origin. For example, according to one painting by José Joaquín Magón, a mestizo (mixed Indian + Spanish) was considered ''generally humble, tranquil, and straightforward''; while another painting claims ''from Lobo and Indian woman is born the Cambujo, one usually slow, lazy, and cumbersome.'' Ultimately, the casta paintings are reminders of the colonial biases in modern human history that linked a caste/ethnic society based on descent, skin color, social status, and one's birth.&lt;ref name=mm1/&gt;&lt;ref name="María Elena Martínez 2010"/&gt;

Often, casta paintings depicted commodity items from Latin America like pulque, the fermented alcohol drink of the lower classes. Painters depicted [[Pulque|interpretations of pulque]] that were attributed to specific castas. Pulque abuse was shown in some casta paintings as a social criticism of the lower castas, and the Spanish desire for regulation over pulque consumption and distribution.

===Sample sets of casta paintings===
Presented here are casta lists from three sets of paintings. Note that they only agree on the first five combinations, which are essentially the Indian-White ones. There is no agreement on the Black mixtures, however.  Also, no one list should be taken as "authoritative". These terms would have varied from region to region and across time periods. The lists here probably reflect the names that the artist knew or preferred, the ones the patron requested to be painted, or a combination of both.

The discussion of [[Limpieza de sangre]] makes it appear as if differentiation based upon privileges applied only to the distinction between Christians and Jews and Muslims; this was later extended to distinguish clearly between Catholics and Protestants. (The New World was originally divided between Spain and Portugal, both Catholic countries.) However, certificates of Limpieza de sangre could be bought, and were extended to mulattoes, blacks and others in America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">'''Chicken Bone Beach''' was a [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] section of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] beach at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] (between Missouri and Mississippi Avenues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stansfield|first=Charles A.|title=Vacationing on the Jersey Shore: Guide to the Beach Resorts: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKDxOngkTqkC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2004|publisher=Stackpole|isbn=9780811729703|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;) known for attracting many [[African American]] entertainers.  It was given this name by the locals due to the volume of chicken bones found in this segregated area during regular clean ups.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chickenbonebeach.org/black-history/|website=ChickenBoneBeach.org|accessdate=21 Feb 2016|title=Our History: Black History|last=Hopper|first=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Blacks and whites lived in the area side by side with few problems after the [[American Civil War]].  It wasn't until 1900 that the beach became segregated, due in part to pressures by local businesses.  It remained a ''blacks only'' beach until the passing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name="blackpast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/chicken-bone-beach-atlantic-city-new-jersey-1900| title=Chicken Bone Beach, Atlantic City, New Jersey (1900- )|website=BlackPast.org|last=Stephens|first=Ronald J.|accessdate=21 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were no signs nor laws prohibiting blacks from enjoying the entirety of the beach, the segregation was rigidly enforced by local authorities or more commonly, white beachgoers.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The Atlantic City Beach Patrol was officially desegregated, but its black members were in practice consigned to Chicken Bone Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=John T.|last2=Cole|first2=Kenneth D.|title=Atlantic City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NQm2sacUfwC&amp;pg=PA50|year=2000|publisher=Arcadia|isbn=9780738504261|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reagan receiving concession call from Walter MondaleC25679-5 (1).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ronald Reagan]] receiving a concession phone call from [[Walter Mondale]] after the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 United States presidential election]]]]

In politics, a '''concession''' is the act of a losing candidate publicly yielding to a winning candidate after an [[election]] after the overall result of the vote has become clear.

==History==
The first "concession telegram" occurred when [[William Jennings Bryan]] sent [[William McKinley]] two days after the [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896 US presidential election]].   Prior to that election results took many days and thus candidates maintained an air of detachment from the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Onion|first1=Rebecca|title=When Did Losing Candidates Start Calling the Winner to Concede?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2016/11/when_was_the_first_concession_phone_call.html|accessdate=9 November 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concession speech==
In the broadcast age, the concession speech of a candidate for high office reaches a wide audience and is seen as the final [[swan song]] of a lost campaign. Out of courtesy, the winner of the campaign usually waits for a concession speech, if one is forthcoming, before delivering the acceptance speech.

A losing candidate usually thanks their supporters for their valiant efforts and points to the non-electoral successes of the campaign in building party strength and raising issues to attention that would not otherwise be in public discussion. It is also traditional, unless the campaign has been exceptionally bitter, to congratulate and wish well the winning candidate, perhaps even offering a parting word of advice &lt;ref&gt;Myers-Gallardo, Alfonso (2014) El consentimiento político de los perdedores y su rol en la democracia, Universidad de Salamanca, UNAM Fes Acatlán, Ed. Ratio Legis, España. https://www.academia.edu/31906054/El_consentimiento_Pol%C3%ADtico_de_los_Perdedores_Su_rol_en_la_Democracia&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Timing of concession==
If the vote is relatively close, it can be unclear when it is appropriate for a losing candidate to concede an election.  On election night, pressures from a media looking for news to report, an opposition campaign anxious to declare victory, and one's own campaign unwilling to concede defeat if there is any hope of a last-minute turnaround all weigh on the decision of the losing candidate.

It is exceedingly rare for a concession, once issued, to be retracted; such an event occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|United States 2000 presidential election]], when [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Al Gore, Jr.]] telephoned [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]] to concede the contest. Gore was apparently unaware of the close vote count in the state of [[Florida]], and when he realized it, he proceeded to cancel his concession address.

A losing candidate commonly offers a private concession directly to the winning candidate, usually by telephone, before any public announcement is made.

==Refusal to concede==
Concession is entirely optional, and candidates sometimes refuse to concede defeat despite the vote count being against them, especially if they suspect [[electoral fraud]]. In that case, the candidate would likely demand a recount of the votes or other investigations into the alleged fraud.  Sometimes, concession may be denied not because of any specific fraud allegations but simply because of ill will accumulated over the campaign.

It is not necessary for the losing candidate to concede for the winning candidate to be seated, and the losing candidate is not obliged to concede once defeat has been conclusively demonstrated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14099">{{about|a predicted future conversion of Jews to Christianity|the topic more generally|Jewish Christian|and|Conversion to Christianity|the short story by Philip Roth|Goodbye, Columbus}}
The widespread '''conversion of the Jews''' to [[Christianity]] is a future event predicted by many Christians, often as an [[end time]] event. Some Christian groups consider the conversion of the Jews to be imperative and pressing and make it their mission to bring this about. However, since the [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], the [[Christian Church]] has formally upheld ''Constitution pro Judæis'' (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated:&lt;ref name="BaskinSeeskin2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baskin|first1=Judith R.|last2=Seeskin|first2=Kenneth|title=The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture|date=12 July 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521869607|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Quote|We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them [the Jews] to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse. ... }}

Despite such papal declarations, personal, economic and cultural pressure on the Jews to convert persisted, often stirred by clerics. [[Persecution]] and [[Forced migration|forcible displacements]] of Jews occurred for many centuries, and were regarded as not inconsistent with the papal bull because there was no "violence to force baptism". There were occasional gestures to reconciliation. [[Pogroms]] and forcible conversions were common throughout Christian Europe, including organized violence, restrictive land ownership and professional lives, forcible relocation and [[ghetto]]ization, mandatory dress codes, and at times humiliating actions and [[torture]]. The object often was for the Jews to choose between conversion, migration or dying. The [[Church of England]]'s [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|Ministry Among Jewish People]], founded in 1809, used non-coercive means in its outreach and missionary efforts.

Attempts by Christians to convert Jews to Christianity is an important issue in [[Christian-Jewish relations]] and [[Christian-Jewish reconciliation]]. Jewish groups such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]] have described attempts to convert Jews to Christianity as [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and have [[Silent_Holocaust#Referring_to_assimilation_of_Jews|directly compared those efforts to the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://ejpress.org/article/29965 US group denounces call by evangelical alliance for conversion of European Jews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728062438/http://ejpress.org/article/29965 |date=July 28, 2009 }}. ''European Jewish Press''. Published September 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2011 suggested that the church should not be targeting Jews for conversion efforts, since "Israel is in the hands of God, who will save it ‘as a whole’ at the proper time."&lt;ref name=AllenJohn&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=John L.|title=Church should not pursue conversion of Jews, pope says|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/church-should-not-pursue-conversion-jews-pope-says|accessdate=20 January 2013|newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christian]] denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews|proselytize Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=1499 Ecumenical Considerations on Jewish-Christian Dialogue] (World Council of Churches)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jcon3.htm Policies of mainline and liberal Christians towards proselytizing Jews] (religioustolerance.org)&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Christian]] and [[Confessionalism (religion)|conservative Christian]] churches have said they will continue their efforts to evangelize among Jews, saying that this is not antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/march/31.76.html Why Evangelize the Jews?] By Stan Guthrie. ''[[Christianity Today]]''. Published March 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2008 survey of [[Christianity in America|American Christians]] by the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] found that over 60% of most [[Christian denomination|denominations]] believe that Jews will receive [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] after [[human death|death]] alongside Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=380 Many Americans Say Other Faiths Can Lead to Eternal Life]. [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]]. Published Dec. 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the New Testament==
The biblical basis for this expectation is found in {{bibleverse||Romans|11:25-26a|NIV}}: 
:I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved... ([[NIV]]). 

The meaning of Romans 11:25-26a has been disputed. [[Douglas J. Moo]] calls Romans 11:26a "the storm center in the interpretation of {{bibleverse||Romans|9-11|NIV}} and of New Testament teaching about the Jews and their future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moo|first=Douglas J.|author-link=Douglas J. Moo|title=The Epistle to the Romans|year=1996|publisher=[[Eerdmans]]|page=719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moo himself interprets the passage as predicting a "large-scale conversion of Jewish people at the end of this age"&lt;ref&gt;Moo, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; through "faith in the gospel of Jesus their Messiah".&lt;ref&gt;Moo, p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in his book ''Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week]] |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor |location=Huntington |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-58617-500-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011) has suggested that the church should not be targeting Jews for conversion efforts, since "Israel is in the hands of God, who will save it ‘as a whole’ at the proper time."&lt;ref name=AllenJohn/&gt;

==In church history==
Throughout the history of the Christian church, there have been times when people predicted or expected the conversion of the Jews as an imminent event. Most famous among these is [[Martin Luther]]'s early enthusiasm that the event would occur through Protestant gospel preaching. When this did not occur, Luther [[Martin Luther and antisemitism|changed his attitude]] and wrote  ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'',&lt;ref name=Noble1&gt;Graham Noble, "Martin Luther and German anti-Semitism," ''History Review'' (2002) No. 42:1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he appears to reject the possibility of Jewish conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael, [http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-antisemitism&amp;month=0003&amp;week=&amp;msg=d/Mm3G6S5/qS2nh0s2eKJg&amp;user=&amp;pw= "Christian racism, part 2"], ''H-Net Discussions Networks'', 2 Mar 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Protestant Reformers]] accepted the idea of a conversion of the Jews, including [[Martin Bucer]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli|Peter Martyr]] and [[Theodore Beza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Iain|author-link=Iain Murray (author)|title=The Puritan Hope|year=1971|publisher=[[Banner of Truth Trust]]|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a popular idea among the [[Puritans]]. Puritan works on the subject included ''The Calling of the Jews'' ([[William Gouge]], 1621), ''Some Discourses upon the Point of the Conversion of the Jews'' ([[Moses Wall]], 1650) and ''The Mystery of Israel's Salvation Explained and Applied'' ([[Increase Mather]], 1669).&lt;ref&gt;Murray, ''The Puritan Hope'', 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; There was disagreement over when this conversion would take place – a significant minority, beginning with [[Thomas Brightman]] (1607) and [[Elnathan Parr]] (1620) predicted a Jewish conversion before the end of time, one that would inaugurate an era of worldwide blessing.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, ''The Puritan Hope'', 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The view of an era of blessing preceding the return of Christ became known as [[postmillennialism]].

The conversion of the Jews continued to be the hope of British evangelicals in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]] says of [[Charles Simeon]] that "the conversion of the Jews was perhaps the warmest interest in his life", and that he would choose the conversion of 6 million Jews over the conversion of 600 million Gentiles, since the former would lead to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, ''The Puritan Hope'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a key concern of the [[Church of Scotland]], which in 1839 sent [[Robert Murray M'Cheyne]] and [[Andrew Bonar]] to Palestine on a "Mission of Inquiry into the state of the Jews".

The conversion of the Jews plays a part in some, but not all, [[premillennial]] [[dispensationalist]] thinking. [[Hal Lindsey]], one of the most popular American promoters of dispensationalism, has written in ''[[The Late Great Planet Earth]]'' that per [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] ([[War of Ezekiel 38–39|39:6-8]]), after Jews fight off a "[[Russia]]n" invasion, Jews will see this as a miracle and convert to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Lindsey, Carole C. Carlson, ''[[The Late Great Planet Earth]]'', Zondervan, 1970, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cWt3rSMgmm8C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=The+late+great+planet+earth%E2%80%8E++Jews&amp;num=50&amp;ei=-G-FSoSsDqfuygTNk6m0Dg&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Zechariah%2013%3A8&amp;f=false p. 167], {{ISBN|0-310-27771-X}}, 9780310277712&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasions people have predicted a specific date for this event to occur. [[Henry Archer (Fifth Monarchist)|Henry Archer]], for example, in his 1642 work ''The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth'', predicted the conversion of the Jews to occur in the 1650s, 1290 years (a number derived from [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:11) after [[Julian the Apostate]].

==Christian liturgy==
{{main article|Good Friday prayer for the Jews}}
In Catholic liturgy, a prayer for the conversion of the Jews is found in the [[Good Friday]] prayer for the Jews. The wording of the prayer has undergone numerous changes in wording, and although the specific hope of a mass conversion is not envisaged in the prayer, the 2008 version of the prayer makes reference to Romans 11:26 ("''all Israel be saved''"). The 2008 version of the prayer reads:&lt;ref&gt;''Oremus et pro Iudaeis: Ut Deus et Dominus noster illuminet corda eorum, ut agnoscant Iesum Christum salvatorem omnium hominum.'' ''(Oremus.'' ''Flectamus genua.'' ''Levate.'') ''Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui vis ut omnes homines salvi fiant et ad agnitionem veritatis veniant, concede propitius, ut plenitudine gentium in Ecclesiam Tuam intrante omnis Israel salvus fiat. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen''.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Let us also pray for the Jews: That our God and Lord may illuminate their hearts, that they acknowledge Jesus Christ is the Savior of all men... Almighty and eternal God, who want that all men be saved and come to the recognition of the truth, propitiously grant that even as the fullness of the peoples enters Thy Church, all Israel be saved. ...}}

A 2011 retranslation now reads:
{{Quote|Let us pray also for the Jewish people, to whom the Lord our God spoke first, that he may grant them to advance in love of his name and in faithfulness to his covenant... Almighty ever-living God, who bestowed your promises on Abraham and his descendants, hear graciously the prayers of your Church, that the people you first made your own may attain the fullness of redemption....}}

The [[Directory of Public Worship]] approved by the [[Westminster Assembly]] states that a prayer is to be made for the conversion of the Jews. The service of [[Vespers]] on Great Friday in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Byzantine Catholics|Byzantine Catholic churches]] uses the expression "impious and transgressing people",&lt;ref&gt;Second sticheron at Lord, I Have Cried. Mother Mary and Metropolitan Kallistos Ware. ''The Lenten Triodion''. 2nd ed. South Canaan: St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, 2002. 612. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but the strongest expressions are in the [[Orthros]] of Great Friday, which includes the same phrase,&lt;ref&gt;Second sticheron at the Aposticha. ibid, page 598.&lt;/ref&gt; but also speaks of "the murderers of God, the lawless nation of the Jews"&lt;ref&gt;Third sticheron at the Beatitudes. ibid, page 589.&lt;/ref&gt; and referring to "the assembly of the Jews", prays: "But give them, O Lord, their reward, for they devised vain things against Thee."&lt;ref&gt;Thirteenth antiphon. ibid, page 586. The phrase "plotted in vain" is drawn from {{bibleverse||Psalm|2:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2015, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was still using the term "lawless synagogue" in their Great Friday Vespers.&lt;ref&gt;http://lit.royaldoors.net/2015/03/25/april-3-2015-great-and-holy-friday/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The conversion of the Jews is occasionally used in literature as a symbol of the far distant future. In [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem ''[[To His Coy Mistress]]'', it says, "And you should, if you please, refuse / Till the conversion of the Jews."

[http://www.theparisreview.org/fiction/4830/the-conversion-of-the-jews-philip-roth "The Conversion of the Jews"] is also the title of a 1958 short story by [[Philip Roth]] about a Jewish youth who threatens to commit suicide unless his co-religionists accept Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;See {{smallcaps|Paris Review}} (Spring 1958, No. 18). The story was also published a year later in {{smallcaps|Philip Roth, Goodbye, Columbus, and Five Short Stories}} (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporate governance''' is the mechanisms, processes and relations by which [[corporation]]s are controlled and directed.&lt;ref&gt;Shailer, Greg. ''An Introduction to Corporate Governance in Australia'', Pearson Education Australia, Sydney, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Governance structures and principles identify the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives, 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance includes the processes through which corporations' objectives are set and pursued in the context of the social, regulatory and market environment. Governance mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders. Corporate governance practices are affected by attempts to align the interests of stakeholders.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/oecdprinciplesofcorporategovernance.htm|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Adrian, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An A–Z Guide'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the corporate governance practices of modern corporations, particularly in relation to accountability, increased following the high-profile collapses of a number of large corporations during 2001–2002, most of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis in 2008]].

[[Corporate scandals]] of various forms have maintained public and political interest in the [[regulation]] of corporate governance. In the U.S., these include [[Enron]] and [[MCI Inc.]] (formerly WorldCom). Their demise led to the enactment of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002, a [[U.S. federal law]] intended to restore public confidence in corporate governance. Comparable failures in Australia ([[HIH Insurance|HIH]], [[One.Tel]]) are associated with the eventual passage of the [[CLERP 9]] reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Janet &amp; Shailer, Greg. The Effect of Board-Related Reforms on Investors Confidence. ''Australian Accounting Review'', 18(45) 2008: 123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar corporate failures in other countries stimulated increased regulatory interest (e.g., [[Parmalat]] in Italy).

==Stakeholder interests==
In contemporary business corporations, the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders, debtholders, trade [[creditor]]s and suppliers, customers, and communities affected by the corporation's activities. Internal stakeholders are the [[board of directors]], [[Executive (management)|executives]], and other employees.

Much of the contemporary interest in corporate governance is concerned with mitigation of the [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interests]] between stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, International Corporate Governance, (Prentice Hall 2012) {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large firms where there is a separation of ownership and management and no controlling shareholder, the [[principal–agent problem|principal–agent issue]] arises between upper-management (the "agent") which may have very different interests, and by definition considerably more information, than shareholders (the "principals"). The danger arises that, rather than overseeing management on behalf of shareholders, the board of directors may become insulated from shareholders and beholden to management.&lt;ref&gt;Pay Without Performance – the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004, 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect is particularly present in contemporary public debates and developments in regulatory [[policy]].&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; More explicitly, the danger is that executives paid by stock option have incentive to divert the retained earnings of the firm into buying shares of own company stock, which will then cause the share price to rise.  However, retained earnings will then not be used to purchase the latest equipment or to hire quality people. Over the thirty or forty years that the model has been in place, the diversion of retained earnings to stock price manipulation has gradually eroded the competitiveness of the US industrial base.  While the public blames low wages in China for eliminating US jobs, the reality is that many US firms compete with high wage nations such as Canada, Germany, or Japan.  It is failure of large publicly-held corporations to invest in new equipment and people that holds the US back and erodes the middle class (fewer engineers, chemists, CNC machinists, accountants are needed as plants are left to age out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/36211184/Deindustrialization_in_the_Granite_State_Part_2_Rising_Asset_Bubbles_Distort_the_Industrial_Base; see also https://www.npr.org/2017/02/06/513713606/glass-house-chronicles-the-sharp-decline-of-an-all-american-factory-town; see also https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways of mitigating or preventing these conflicts of interests include the processes, customs, policies, laws, and institutions which affect the way a company is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Financial Times Lexicon|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=corporate-governance|work=[[The Financial Times]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; An important theme of governance is the nature and extent of [[corporate accountability]]. A related discussion at the macro level focuses on the effect of a corporate governance system on [[economic efficiency]], with a strong emphasis on shareholders' welfare.&lt;ref name="DainesKlausner"&gt;Daines, Robert, and [[Michael Klausner]], 2008 "corporate law, economic analysis of," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

==Other definitions==
Corporate governance has also been more narrowly defined as "a system of law and sound approaches by which corporations are directed and controlled focusing on the internal and external corporate structures with the intention of monitoring the actions of management and directors and thereby, mitigating agency risks which may stem from the misdeeds of corporate officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sifuna|first=Anazett Pacy|title=Disclose or Abstain: The Prohibition of Insider Trading on Trial|journal=Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation|year=2012|volume=27|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate governance has also been defined as "Is the act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating a corporation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/corporate-governance |title=Corporate Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to the definition of Governance as "The act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating an entity, process or resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/governance |title=Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, governance and corporate governance are different from management because governance must be EXTERNAL to the object being governed. Governing agents do not have personal control over, and are not part of the object that they govern. For example, it is not possible for a CIO to govern the IT function. They are personally accountable for the strategy and management of the function. As such, they “manage” the IT function; they do not “govern” it. At the same time, there may be a number of policies, authorized by the board, that the CIO follows. When the CIO is following these policies, they are performing “governance” activities because the primary intention of the policy is to serve a governance purpose. The board is ultimately “governing” the IT function because they stand outside of the function and are only able to externally direct, control and evaluate the IT function by virtue of established policies, procedures and indicators. Without these policies, procedures and indicators, the board has no way of governing, let alone affecting the IT function in any way.

==Principles==
Contemporary discussions of corporate governance tend to refer to principles raised in three documents released since 1990: The [[Cadbury Report]] (UK, 1992), the Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD, 1999, 2004 and 2015), and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 (US, 2002).  The Cadbury and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) reports present general principles around which businesses are expected to operate to assure proper governance.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, informally referred to as Sarbox or Sox, is an attempt by the federal government in the United States to legislate several of the principles recommended in the Cadbury and OECD reports.
* '''Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles II and III|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial service Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should respect the rights of shareholders and help shareholders to exercise those rights. They can help shareholders exercise their rights by openly and effectively communicating information and by encouraging shareholders to participate in general meetings.
* '''Interests of other stakeholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Preamble and Article IV|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should recognize that they have legal, contractual, social, and market driven obligations to non-shareholder stakeholders, including employees, investors, creditors, suppliers, local communities, customers, and policy makers.
* '''Role and responsibilities of the board''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Article VI|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.4&lt;/ref&gt; The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance. It also needs adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment.
* '''Integrity and ethical behavior''':&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.33, 4.51 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title I, 101(c)(1), Title VIII, and Title IX, 406&lt;/ref&gt; Integrity should be a fundamental requirement in choosing corporate officers and board members.  Organizations should develop a code of conduct for their directors and executives that promotes ethical and responsible decision making.
* '''Disclosure and transparency''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principals of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles I and V|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should clarify and make publicly known the roles and responsibilities of board and management to provide stakeholders with a level of accountability. They should also implement procedures to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company's financial reporting. Disclosure of material matters concerning the organization should be timely and balanced to ensure that all investors have access to clear, factual information.

==Models==
Different models of corporate governance differ according to the variety of capitalism in which they are embedded. The Anglo-American "model" tends to emphasize the interests of shareholders. The coordinated or [[multistakeholder model]] associated with Continental Europe and Japan also recognizes the interests of workers, managers, suppliers, customers, and the community. A related distinction is between market-oriented and network-oriented models of corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;[Sytse Douma] &amp; [Hein Schreuder] (2013) ''[http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page Economic Approaches to Organizations]'', 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe (Two-tier board system) ===
{{main article|Aktiengesellschaft}}
Some continental European countries, including Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, require a two-tiered board of directors as a means of improving corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Bob, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An A–Z Guide, Second Edition'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the two-tiered board, the executive board, made up of company executives, generally runs day-to-day operations while the supervisory board, made up entirely of non-executive directors who represent shareholders and employees, hires and fires the members of the executive board, determines their compensation, and reviews major business decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Hopt, Klaus J., "The German Two-Tier Board (Aufsichtsrat), A German View on Corporate Governance" in Hopt, Klaus J. and Wymeersch, Eddy (eds), ''Comparative Corporate Governance: Essays and Materials'', de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, {{ISBN|3-11-015765-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance defines corporate governance as the "acceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the true owners of the corporation and of their own role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders. It is about commitment to values, about ethical business conduct and about making a distinction between personal  &amp; corporate funds in the management of a company."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the SEBI Committee on Corporate Governance, February 2003|url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/commreport/corpgov.pdf|work=[[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance|accessdate=2011-07-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928135443/http://www.sebi.gov.in/commreport/corpgov.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mia Mahmudur Rahim|author2=Sanjaya Kuruppu|editor1-last=Franklin|editor1-first=Ngwu|editor2-last=Onyeka|editor2-first=Osuji|editor3-last=Frank|editor3-first=Stephen|title=Corporate Governance in Developing and Emerging Markets|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9781315666020|chapter=Corporate Governance in India: The Potential for Ghandism}}&lt;/ref&gt; India is a growing economy and it is quite important to safeguard the interests of investors and also ensure that the responsibility of management is fixed. The Satyam scandal, also known as India's Enron, wiped off billions of shareholders' wealth and threatened foreign investment in India. This is the reason that corporate governance in India has taken the centre stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIRA006061.pdf Advantages of Corporate Governance for Indian Enterprises], By Shailendra Sial.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States, United Kingdom===
The so-called "Anglo-American model" of corporate governance emphasizes the interests of shareholders. It relies on a single-tiered board of directors that is normally dominated by non-executive directors elected by shareholders. Because of this, it is also known as "the unitary system".&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallin, Christine A., "Corporate Governance Developments in the UK" in Mallin, Christine A (ed), ''Handbook on International Corporate Governance: Country Analyses, Second Edition'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84980-123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this system, many boards include some executives from the company (who are [[ex officio]] members of the board). Non-executive directors are expected to outnumber executive directors and hold key posts, including audit and compensation committees. In the United Kingdom, the [[CEO]] generally does not also serve as Chairman of the Board, whereas in the US having the dual role has been the norm, despite major misgivings regarding the effect on corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, William G, ''The Board Book: An Insider's Guide for Directors and Trustees'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York &amp; London, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-393-06645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of US firms combining both roles is declining, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russellreynolds.com/newsroom/splitting-the-ceo-and-chairman-roles-yes-or-no&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, corporations are directly governed by state laws, while the exchange (offering and trading) of securities in corporations (including shares) is governed by federal legislation. Many US states have adopted the [[Model Business Corporation Act]], but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which continues to be the place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004&gt;Bebchuck LA. (2004).[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=387940 The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power].''Harvard Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual rules for corporations are based upon the [[corporate charter]] and, less authoritatively, the corporate [[bylaw]]s.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;
Shareholders cannot initiate changes in the corporate charter although they can initiate changes to the corporate bylaws.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;

It is sometimes colloquially stated that in the USA and the UK 'the shareholders own the company'. This is, however, a misconception as argued by Eccles &amp; Youmans (2015) and Kay (2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/materiality-in-corporate-governance-the-statement-of-significant-audiences-and-materiality; https://next.ft.com/content/7bd1b20a-879b-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder centrism===
Recent scholarship from the [[University of Oxford]] outlines a new theory of corporate governance, founder centrism, which is premised upon a narrowing in the separation between ownership and control. Through the lens of concentrated equity ownership theory, a new theory of the firm, the traditional checklist of best practices are inapplicable, as evidenced by the significant outperformance of technology companies with dual-class share structures and integrated CEO/Chairman positions:

{{Cquote|
"Founder-run companies, such as Facebook, Netflix and Google are at the forefront of a new wave of organizational structure better suited to long-term value creation. Founder centrism, an inclusive concept within CEO theory, integrates the capacity of founder and non-founder senior leadership to adopt an owner’s mindset in traditionally structured corporations, such as Thomas J. Watson Sr. and Thomas Watson Jr. with IBM, Steve Jobs and Tim Cook with Apple, Jamie Dimon with JPMorgan Chase, Lloyd Blankfein with Goldman Sachs, Rick George with Suncor Energy, and many others. In substance, all fall within the ambit of founder centrism – leaders with a founder’s mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation without enslavement to a quarter-by-quarter upward growth trajectory. In traditionally structured firms, high performing executives gain deference, become highly influential, and take on the qualities of concentrated equity owners. To the extent these leaders embrace founder centrism, their companies will experience efficiency advantages relative to competitors operating within traditional parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Claudio|title=Eclipse of the Public Corporation Revisited: Concentrated Equity Ownership Theory|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership|publisher=The University of Oxford|accessdate=June 27, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;|100%|cquote}}

An article published by the Australian Institute of Company Directors called 'Do Boards Need to become more Entrepreneurial?' written by Nigel Hennessy FAICD also considered the need for Founder Centrism behaviour at board level to appropriately manage disruption. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hennessy|first1=Nigel|title=Do boards need to become more Entrepreneurial|url=http://www.aicd.companydirectors.com.au/-/media/cd2/resources/advocacy/governance-leadership-centre/pdf/the-entrepreneurial-board.ashx|publisher=AICD|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

Corporations are created as [[legal person]]s by the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. These may vary in many respects between countries, but a corporation's legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute. This allows the entity to hold property in its own right without reference to any particular real person. It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction, corporations are subject to [[common law]] in some countries, and various laws and regulations affecting business practices. In most jurisdictions, corporations also have a constitution that provides individual rules that govern the corporation and authorize or constrain its decision-makers. This constitution is identified by a variety of terms; in English-speaking jurisdictions, it is usually known as the Corporate Charter or the [[memorandum of association|Memorandum]] and Articles of Association. The capacity of shareholders to modify the constitution of their corporation can vary substantially.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The U.S. passed the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) in 1977, with subsequent modifications. This law made it illegal to bribe government officials and required corporations to maintain adequate accounting controls. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Substantial civil and criminal penalties have been levied on corporations and executives convicted of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/guidance/ DOJ Website – Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance – May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK passed the [[Bribery Act 2010|Bribery Act]] in 2010. This law made it illegal to bribe either government or private citizens or make facilitating payments (i.e., payment to a government official to perform their routine duties more quickly). It also required corporations to establish controls to prevent bribery.

===Sarbanes-Oxley Act===
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 was enacted in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate scandals. It established a series of requirements that affect corporate governance in the U.S. and influenced similar laws in many other countries.  The law required, along with many other elements, that:
* The [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) be established to regulate the auditing profession, which had been self-regulated prior to the law. Auditors are responsible for reviewing the financial statements of corporations and issuing an opinion as to their reliability.
* The [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) and [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) attest to the financial statements. Prior to the law, CEOs had claimed in court they hadn't reviewed the information as part of their defense.
* Board audit committees have members that are independent and disclose whether or not at least one is a financial expert, or reasons why no such expert is on the audit committee.
* External audit firms cannot provide certain types of consulting services and must rotate their lead partner every 5 years. Further, an audit firm cannot audit a company if those in specified senior management roles worked for the auditor in the past year. Prior to the law, there was the real or perceived conflict of interest between providing an independent opinion on the accuracy and reliability of financial statements when the same firm was also providing lucrative consulting services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/pdf/PLAW-107publ204.pdf Text of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codes and guidelines==
Corporate governance principles and codes have been developed in different countries and issued from stock exchanges, corporations, institutional investors, or associations (institutes) of directors and managers with the support of governments and international organizations. As a rule, compliance with these governance recommendations is not mandated by law, although the codes linked to stock exchange [[Stock exchange#Listing requirements|listing requirements]] may have a coercive effect.

===Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles===
One of the most influential guidelines on corporate governance are the [[G20]]/[[OECD]] Principles of Corporate Governance, first published as the OECD Principles in 1999, revised in 2004 and revised again and endorsed by the G20 in 2015.&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt; The Principles are often referenced by countries developing local codes or guidelines. Building on the work of the OECD, other international organizations, private sector associations and more than 20 national corporate governance codes formed  the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting]] (ISAR) to produce their Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/iteteb20063_en.pdf Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.]&lt;/ref&gt; This internationally agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/c2isard31_en.pdf TD/B/COM.2/ISAR/31&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; benchmark consists of more than fifty distinct disclosure items across five broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Standards of Accounting and Reporting, Corporate Governance Disclosure |url=http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |work=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123092039/http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Auditing
* Board and management structure and process
* Corporate responsibility and compliance in organization
* Financial transparency and information disclosure
* Ownership structure and exercise of control rights

The [http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/guidelines-corporate-governance-soes.htm OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises] are complementary to the [http://www.oecd.org/corporate/principles-corporate-governance.htm G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance], providing guidance tailored to the corporate governance challenges unique to [[state-owned enterprise]]s.

===Stock exchange listing standards===
Companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and other stock exchanges are required to meet certain governance standards. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires, among many other elements:
* Independent directors: "Listed companies must have a majority of independent directors...Effective boards of directors exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. Requiring a majority of independent directors will increase the quality of board oversight and lessen the possibility of damaging conflicts of interest." (Section 303A.01) An independent director is not part of management and has no "material financial relationship" with the company.
* Board meetings that exclude management: "To empower non-management directors to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management directors of each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management." (Section 303A.03)
* Boards organize their members into committees with specific responsibilities per defined charters. "Listed companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors." This committee is responsible for nominating new members for the board of directors. Compensation and Audit Committees are also specified, with the latter subject to a variety of listing standards as well as outside regulations.

===Other guidelines===
The investor-led organisation International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) was set up by individuals centered around the ten largest pension funds in the world 1995. The aim is to promote global corporate governance standards. The network is led by investors that manage 18 trillion dollars, and members are located in fifty different countries. ICGN has developed a suite of global guidelines ranging from shareholder rights to business ethics.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) has done work on corporate governance, particularly on [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515141435/http%3A//www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID%3D80%26NoSearchContextKey%3Dtrue Accounting and Reporting], and in 2004 released [https://archive.is/20140625080626/http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID=15610&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Issue Management Tool: Strategic challenges for business in the use of corporate responsibility codes, standards, and frameworks]. This document offers general information and a perspective from a business association/think-tank on a few key codes, standards and frameworks relevant to the sustainability agenda.

In 2009, the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact released a report, [http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/Corporate_Governance/Corporate_Governance_IFC_UNGC.pdf Corporate Governance - the Foundation for Corporate Citizenship and Sustainable Business], linking the environmental, social and governance responsibilities of a company to its financial performance and long-term sustainability.

Most codes are largely voluntary. An issue raised in the U.S. since the 2005 Disney decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf The Disney Decision of 2005 and the precedent it sets for corporate governance and fiduciary responsibility, Kuckreja, Akin Gump, Aug 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615105810/http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the degree to which companies manage their governance responsibilities; in other words, do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold, or should they create governance guidelines that ascend to the level of best practice.  For example, the guidelines issued by associations of directors, corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary, but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== United States of America ===
[[Robert E. Wright]] argues in ''Corporation Nation'' (2014) that the governance of early U.S. corporations, of which over 20,000 existed by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] of 1861-1865, was superior to that of corporations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because early corporations governed themselves like "republics", replete with numerous "checks and balances" against fraud and against usurpation of power by managers or by large shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright, Corporation Nation (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; (The term [[Robber baron (industrialist)|"robber baron"]] became particularly associated with US corporate figures in the [[Gilded Age]] - the late 19th century.)

In the immediate aftermath of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] legal scholars such as [[Adolf Augustus Berle]], Edwin Dodd, and [[Gardiner C. Means]] pondered on the changing role of the modern corporation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Berle and Means' ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', (1932, Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Chicago school of economics]], [[Ronald Coase]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Coase, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the notion of transaction costs into the understanding of why firms are founded and how they continue to behave.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt;

US economic expansion through the emergence of multinational corporations after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] (1939-1945) saw the establishment of the [[managerial class]]. Several [[Harvard Business School]] management professors studied and wrote about the new class: [[Myles Mace]] (entrepreneurship), [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (business history), [[Jay Lorsch]] (organizational behavior) and Elizabeth MacIver (organizational behavior). According to Lorsch and MacIver "many large corporations have dominant control over business affairs without sufficient accountability or monitoring by their board of directors".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the 1980s, [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] ''The Separation of Ownership and Control'', (1983, Journal of Law and Economics)&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[principal–agent problem]] as a way of understanding corporate governance: the firm is seen as a series of contracts.&lt;ref&gt;See also the 1989 article by [[Kathleen Eisenhardt]]: "Agency theory: an assessment and review", ''Academy of Management Review'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 1977 to 1997, corporate directors' duties in the U.S. expanded beyond their traditional legal responsibility of duty of loyalty to the corporation and to its shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Curtis J. (2007).

In the first half of the 1990s, the issue of corporate governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Honeywell]]) by their boards. The [[CalPERS|California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS)]] led a wave of ''institutional'' shareholder activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently [[Options backdating|back-dated]]).

In the early 2000s, the massive bankruptcies (and criminal malfeasance) of [[Enron]] and [[Worldcom]], as well as lesser [[corporate scandals]] (such as those involving [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia Communications]], [[AOL]], [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Global Crossing]], and [[Tyco International|Tyco]]) led to increased political interest in corporate governance. This was reflected in the passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002. Other triggers for continued interest in the corporate governance of organizations included the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis of 2008/9]] and the level of CEO pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steven N. Kaplan, Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance in the U.S.: Perceptions, Facts and Challenges, Chicago Booth Paper No. 12-42, Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, Chicago, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
In 1997 the [[East Asian Financial Crisis]] severely affected the economies of [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]] through the exit of foreign capital after property assets collapsed. The lack of corporate governance mechanisms in these countries highlighted the weaknesses of the institutions in their economies.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}



===Saudi Arabia===
In November 2006 the [[Capital Market Authority (Saudi Arabia)]] (CMA) issued a corporate governance code in the [[Arabic language]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adel Al-Hussain|Al-Hussain]], A. (2009).

[[Adel Al-Hussain|Al-Hussain]], A. and Johnson, R. (2009) found a strong relationship between the efficiency of corporate governance structure and [[Saudi]] bank performance when using [[return on assets]] as a performance measure with one exception - that government and local ownership groups were not significant. However, using [[stock return]] as a performance measure revealed a weak positive relationship between the efficiency of corporate governance structure and bank performance.&lt;ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==
Key parties involved in corporate governance include stakeholders such as the board of directors, management and shareholders. External stakeholders such as creditors, auditors, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and the community at large also exert influence. The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights (control) and entrusts the manager to act in the shareholders' best (joint) interests. Partly as a result of this separation between the two investors and managers, corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers' incentives with those of shareholders. Agency concerns (risk) are necessarily lower for a [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In private for-profit corporations, shareholders elect the board of directors to represent their interests. In the case of nonprofits, stakeholders may have some role in recommending or selecting board members, but typically the board itself decides who will serve on the board as a 'self-perpetuating' board.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, George W., Corporate Governance Without Shareholders: A Cautionary Lesson from Non-Profit Organizations (2014). Delaware Journal of Corporate Law (DJCL), Vol. 39, No. 1, 2014; Case Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-34. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2481646 Available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of leadership that the board has over the organization varies; in practice at large organizations, the executive management, principally the CEO, drives major initiatives with the oversight and approval of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/2YHV-KXNR|title=Why Nonprofits Have a Board Problem - HBS Working Knowledge - Harvard Business School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Harvard Business School|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibilities of the board of directors===
Former Chairman of the Board of [[General Motors]] John G. Smale wrote in 1995: "The board is responsible for the successful perpetuation of the corporation.  That responsibility cannot be relegated to management."&lt;ref name="HBRGov1"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Harvard Business Review
| first = HBR
| year = 2000
| title = HBR on Corporate Governance | publisher = Harvard Business School Press
| isbn = 1-57851-237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[board of directors]] is expected to play a key role in corporate governance. The board has responsibility for: CEO selection and succession; providing feedback to management on the organization's strategy; compensating senior executives; monitoring financial health, performance and risk; and ensuring accountability of the organization to its investors and authorities. Boards typically have several committees (e.g., Compensation, Nominating and Audit) to perform their work.&lt;ref name="Charan 2005"&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-7879-7139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2004) describe the responsibilities of the board; some of these are summarized below:&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;
* Board members should be informed and act ethically and in good faith, with due diligence and care, in the best interest of the company and the shareholders.
* Review and guide corporate strategy, objective setting, major plans of action, risk policy, capital plans, and annual budgets.
* Oversee major acquisitions and divestitures.
* Select, compensate, monitor and replace key executives and oversee succession planning.
* Align key executive and board remuneration (pay) with the longer-term interests of the company and its shareholders.
* Ensure a formal and transparent board member nomination and election process.
* Ensure the integrity of the corporation's accounting and financial reporting systems, including their independent audit.
* Ensure appropriate systems of internal control are established.
* Oversee the process of disclosure and communications.
* Where committees of the board are established, their mandate, composition and working procedures should be well-defined and disclosed.

===Stakeholder interests===
All parties to corporate governance have an interest, whether direct or indirect, in the [[financial performance]] of the corporation. Directors, workers and management receive salaries, benefits and reputation, while investors expect to receive financial returns. For lenders, it is specified interest payments, while returns to equity investors arise from dividend distributions or capital gains on their stock. Customers are concerned with the certainty of the provision of goods and services of an appropriate quality; suppliers are concerned with compensation for their goods or services, and possible continued trading relationships. These parties provide value to the corporation in the form of financial, physical, human and other forms of capital. Many parties may also be concerned with [[corporate social responsibility|corporate social performance]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A key factor in a party's decision to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner consistent with their desired outcomes, they are less likely to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

===’Absentee landlords’ vs. capital stewards===
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]]  experts insist that “institutional asset owners now seem more eager to take to task [the] negligent CEOs” of the companies whose shares they own.&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development is part of a broader trend towards more fully exercised asset ownership – notably from the part of the [[board of directors|boards of directors]] (‘trustees’) of large UK, Dutch, Scandinavian and Canadian pension investors:

: “No longer ‘[[absentee landlords]]’, {{bracket|[[pension fund]]}} trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Benelux]] and [[America]]: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups […] to ‘shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment’.”&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American,] UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In Britain, “The widespread social disenchantment that followed the [2008-2012] [[great recession]] had an impact” on all stakeholders, including [[pension fund]] board members and investment managers.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the UK’s largest pension funds are thus already active stewards of their assets, engaging with [[corporate board]]s and speaking up when they think it is necessary.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control and ownership structures===
Control and ownership structure refers to the types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due to the existence of e.g. '''dual-class shares''', '''ownership pyramids''', '''voting coalitions''', '''proxy votes''' and '''clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders'''.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, Chapter 3, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"/&gt; Researchers often "measure" control and ownership structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving [[corporate group]]s include pyramids, [[cross ownership|cross-shareholdings]], rings, and webs. German "concerns" (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese [[keiretsu]] (系列) and South Korean [[chaebol]] (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding is an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/1397.html]. Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.

====Family control====
Family interests dominate ownership and control structures of some corporations, and it has been suggested that the oversight of family-controlled corporations are superior to corporations "controlled" by institutional investors (or with such diverse share ownership that they are controlled by management). A recent study by Credit Suisse found that companies in which "founding families retain a stake of more than 10% of the company's capital enjoyed a superior performance over their respective sectorial peers." Since 1996, this superior performance amounts to 8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ Error 404&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111151350/http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ |date=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forget the celebrity CEO.

====Diffuse shareholders====
The significance of institutional investors varies substantially across countries. In developed Anglo-American countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K., U.S.), institutional investors dominate the market for stocks in larger corporations. While the majority of the shares in the Japanese market are held by financial companies and industrial corporations, these are not institutional investors if their holdings are largely with-on group.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The largest pools of invested money (such as the mutual fund '[[Vanguard 500]]', or the largest investment management firm for corporations, [[State Street Corp.]]) are designed to maximize the benefits of diversified investment by investing in a very large number of different corporations with sufficient [[liquidity]]. The idea is this strategy will largely eliminate individual firm [[financial risk|financial]] or other risk. A consequence of this approach is that these investors have relatively little interest in the governance of a  particular corporation. It is often assumed that, if institutional investors pressing for changes decide they will likely be costly because of "[[golden handshake]]s" or the effort required, they will simply sell out their investment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Mechanisms and controls==
Corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from [[moral hazard]] and [[adverse selection]]. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt; Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) in the case of privately held companies or a firm belonging to a [[business group]]. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the [[external auditor]]) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing [[incentive alignment]] toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"/&gt;

===Internal corporate governance controls===
Internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective actions to accomplish organisational goals. Examples include:
* '''Monitoring by the board of directors''': The board of directors, with its legal authority to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagat &amp; Black, "The Uncertain Relationship Between Board Composition and Firm Performance", 54 Business Lawyer&lt;/ref&gt; Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management on the basis of the quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ''ex ante''. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Internal control procedures and internal auditors''': Internal control procedures are policies implemented by an entity's board of directors, audit committee, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance of the entity achieving its objectives related to reliable financial reporting, operating efficiency, and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditors are personnel within an organization who test the design and implementation of the entity's internal control procedures and the reliability of its financial reporting.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Balance of power''': The simplest balance of power is very common; require that the President be a different person from the Treasurer.  This application of separation of power is further developed in companies where separate divisions check and balance each other's actions.  One group may propose company-wide administrative changes, another group review and can veto the changes, and a third group check that the interests of people (customers, shareholders, employees) outside the three groups are being met.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Remuneration''': Performance-based remuneration is designed to relate some proportion of salary to individual performance. It may be in the form of cash or non-cash payments such as [[share (finance)|shares]] and [[share option]]s, [[superannuation]] or other benefits. Such incentive schemes, however, are reactive in the sense that they provide no mechanism for preventing mistakes or opportunistic behavior, and can elicit myopic behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Monitoring by large shareholders''' and/or '''monitoring by banks and other large creditors''': Given their large investment in the firm, these stakeholders have the incentives, combined with the right degree of control and power, to monitor the management.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, pp. 104–105, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In publicly traded U.S. corporations, boards of directors are largely ''chosen'' by the President/CEO and the President/CEO often takes the Chair of the Board position for him/herself (which makes it much more difficult for the institutional owners to "fire" him/her). The practice of the CEO also being the Chair of the Board is fairly common in large American corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Tom C. W., The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives (2011). 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt;

While this practice is common in the U.S., it is relatively rare elsewhere. In the U.K., successive codes of best practice have recommended against duality.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===External corporate governance controls===
External corporate governance controls the external stakeholders' exercise over the organization. Examples include:
* competition
* debt covenants
* demand for and assessment of performance information (especially [[financial statements]])
* government regulations
* managerial labour market
* media pressure
* takeovers
* [[proxy firm]]s

===Financial reporting and the independent auditor===
The board of directors has primary responsibility for the corporation's internal and external [[financial report]]ing functions. The [[chief executive officer]] and [[chief financial officer]] are crucial participants, and boards usually have a high degree of reliance on them for the integrity and supply of accounting information. They oversee the internal accounting systems, and are dependent on the corporation's [[accountant]]s and [[internal auditor]]s.

Current accounting rules under [[International Accounting Standards]] and U.S. [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] allow managers some choice in determining the methods of measurement and criteria for recognition of various financial reporting elements.  The potential exercise of this choice to improve apparent performance increases the [[information risk]] for users. Financial reporting fraud, including non-disclosure and deliberate falsification of values also contributes to users' information risk. To reduce this risk and to enhance the perceived integrity of financial reports, corporation financial reports must be audited by an independent [[external auditor]] who issues a report that accompanies the financial statements.

One area of concern is whether the auditing firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This may result in a conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor.  Changes enacted in the United States in the form of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the [[Enron scandal]]) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India.

==Systemic problems==
* Demand for information: In order to influence the directors, the shareholders must combine with others to form a voting group which can pose a real threat of carrying resolutions or appointing directors at a general meeting.&lt;ref name=6.9&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA9&amp;dq=%22A+barrier+to+shareholders+using+good+information+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E_vkT8HeH66I2gW44dTZCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20barrier%20to%20shareholders%20using%20good%20information%20%22&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management] 6.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring costs: A barrier to shareholders using good information is the cost of processing it, especially to a small shareholder. The traditional answer to this problem is the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (in finance, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are efficient), which suggests that the small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;
* Supply of accounting information: Financial accounts form a crucial link in enabling providers of finance to monitor directors. Imperfections in the financial reporting process will cause imperfections in the effectiveness of corporate governance. This should, ideally, be corrected by the working of the external auditing process.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;

==Issues==

===Executive pay===
{{main article|Say on pay}}
Increasing attention and regulation (as under the [[Swiss referendum "against corporate rip-offs" of 2013]]) has been brought to executive pay levels since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Research on the relationship between firm performance and [[executive compensation]] does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=current/&gt; Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

Some argue that firm performance is positively associated with share [[Option (finance)|option]] plans and that these plans direct managers' energies and extend their decision horizons toward the long-term, rather than the short-term, performance of the company.  However, that point of view came under substantial criticism circa in the wake of various security scandals including mutual fund timing episodes and, in particular, the backdating of option grants as documented by University of Iowa academic Erik Lie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X06001644 | doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2005.12.003 | volume=83 | issue=2 | title=Does backdating explain the stock price pattern around executive stock option grants? | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Financial Economics | pages=271–295 | last1 = Heron | first1 = Randall A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported by James Blander and Charles Forelle of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name=current&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA14&amp;lpg=SA6-PA14&amp;dq=Some+researchers+have+found+that+the+largest+CEO+performance+incentives+came+from+ownership+of+the+firm%27s+shares&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ihr3qx-hpF&amp;sig=P9L9MBVyoD8BsKIvr6nxOn8NPj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xuDkT4fuHeW42wXIn5XaCQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20researchers%20have%20found%20that%20the%20largest%20CEO%20performance%20incentives%20came%20from%20ownership%20of%20the%20firm%27s%20shares&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/7193 As Companies Probe Backdating, More Top Officials Take a Fall] |Charles Forelle and James Bandler| October 12, 2006| wsj.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal, use of options faced various criticisms.  A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs.  Numerous authorities (including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner) determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests.  These authors argued that, in part, corporate stock buybacks for U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the effect of options.  A compendium of academic works on the option/buyback issue is included in the study [http://ssrn.com/abstract=927111 ''Scandal''] by author [http://ssrn.com/author=665434 M. Gumport] issued in 2006.

A combination of accounting changes and governance issues led options to become a less popular means of remuneration as 2006 progressed, and various alternative implementations of buybacks surfaced to challenge the dominance of "open market" cash buybacks as the preferred means of implementing a [[share repurchase]] plan.

===Separation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles===
Shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn hire a [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) to lead management. The primary responsibility of the board relates to the selection and retention of the CEO.  However, in many U.S. corporations the CEO and Chairman of the Board roles are held by the same person. This creates an inherent conflict of interest between management and the board.

Critics of combined roles argue the two roles should be separated to avoid the conflict of interest and more easily enable a poorly performing CEO to be replaced. [[Warren Buffett]] wrote in 2014: "In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters-Warren Buffett-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that empirical studies do not indicate that separation of the roles improves stock market performance and that it should be up to shareholders to determine what corporate governance model is appropriate for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/opinion/the-jamie-dimon-witch-hunt.html?_r=0 NYT – Jeffrey Sonnenfeld – The Jamie Dimon Witch Hunt – May 8, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 73.4% of U.S. companies had combined roles; this fell to 57.2% by May 2012. Many U.S. companies with combined roles have appointed a "Lead Director" to improve independence of the board from management. German and UK companies have generally split the roles in nearly 100% of listed companies. Empirical evidence does not indicate one model is superior to the other in terms of performance. However, one study indicated that poorly performing firms tend to remove separate CEOs more frequently than when the CEO/Chair roles are combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3290632/SHOULD_THE_USA_FOLLOW_THE_UKS_LEAD_AND_SPLIT_THE_DUAL_CEO_CHAIRPERSONs_ROLE University of Cambridge-Magdalena Smith – Should the USA follow the UK's lead and split the dual CEO/Chairperson role?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dahteste'''{{pronunciation needed}} &lt;!--the pron. "ta-DOT-say" is all over the web, but seems dubious, and likely came from an old version of this WP article--&gt; (circa 1860–1955) was a Choconen [[Apache]] woman warrior.

==Family==
Dahteste was the sister of [[Ilth-goz-ay]], the wife of Chihuahua (also known as Kla-esh), chief of the Chokonen local group of the Chokonen band of the Chiricahua.

==Career==
In her youth she rode with Cochise's band in southeastern Arizona. Despite being married with children, Dahteste took part in raiding parties with her first husband Ahnandia. She was later a compatriot of [[Geronimo]] and companion of [[Lozen]] on many raids. Dahteste was fluent in English and acted as messenger and translator for the Apache. With Lozen, she became a mediator and trusted scout at times for the [[U.S. Cavalry]] and was instrumental in negotiating Geronimo's final surrender to the U.S. Cavalry in 1886.&lt;ref name="Kraft2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraft|first=Louis|title=Gatewood &amp; Geronimo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8a4Q6AG-c60C|year=2000|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-2130-5|pages=114–116, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prison==
She spent eight years as [[prisoner of war]] at [[Castillo de San Marcos|Fort Marion]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in [[Florida]], where she survived [[pneumonia]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Thereafter she was shipped to a military prison in [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = White| first = Julia| title = Dahteste - Mescalero Apache

Henrietta Stockel: Chiricahua Apache Women and Children: ''Safekeepers of the Heritage'', {{ISBN|978-0890969212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After nineteen years of imprisonment at Fort Sill, Dahteste lived out the rest of her life at Whitetail on the [[Mescalero Apache]] [[Indian reservation|Reservation]] in [[New Mexico]]. She married a former Apache Scout named Kuni, dressed traditionally and refused to speak English. She was known to others as "Old Mrs. Coonie" until her death in 1955.&lt;ref name="OveStockel1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ove|first1=Robert S.|last2=Stockel|first2=H.

The '''Egyptian Revolutionary Council''' '''(ERC)''' is a political organization that was founded in 2014 in resistance to the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|July 3 military coup in Egypt]]. As a group of Egyptian political forces and groups outside of Egypt, it supports the right of the Egyptian people to “bread, freedom, social justice and dignity”.&lt;ref name=establishment&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment Statement|url=http://ercegypt.org/egy/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%8A?lang=en|website=Egyptian Revolutionary Council-ERC|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==
The Egyptian Revolutionary Council announced its establishment in August 2014 at the [[Hotels in Istanbul|Retaj Royale Hotel in Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="Moving-abroad - Al-Ahram Weekly"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moving-abroad - Al-Ahram Weekly|url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/7003/17/Moving-abroad.aspx|website = weekly.ahram.org.eg|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group believes in the principles of the January 25th Revolution and seeks to work towards achieving the goals of the revolution. The group states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who We Are {{!}} المجلس الثوري المصري|url = http://ercegypt.org/egy/%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D9%2581-%25D8%25A8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D8%25AC%25D9%2584%25D8%25B3/%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D9%2581-%25D8%25A8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D8%25AC%25D9%2584%25D8%25B3-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AB%25D9%2588%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A?lang=en|accessdate = 2015-07-30|website = Egyptian Revolutionary Council-ERC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“We oppose all aspects of corruption and dictatorship in Egypt. We oppose the military coup and all that ensued from it, and we refuse the interference of the military in political life. We believe in constitutional legitimacy and work for the establishment of a civil state that reflects the will of the Egyptian people and their freedom in choosing their government.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ERC has three main bureaus each with distinct responsibilities: one that oversees the political aspects and international relations, another that documents crimes and violations committed after Morsi was overthrown, and one that is responsible for communicating with media outlets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thecairopost.com/news/121282/news/mb-supporters-launch-egyptian-revolutionary-council|title = MB supporters launch Egyptian Revolutionary Council|last = |first = |date = 2014-08-09|work = Cairo Post|access-date = 2015-07-30|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==
ERC is run by an elected Executive Board of the following individuals:

* '''Dr. Maha Azzam''', President
* '''Walid Al-Sharhabi,''' Vice President and Head of the Human Rights and Legal Office
* '''Mohamed Sherif Kamel''', Secretary General
* '''Dr. Amr Adel''', Head of the Political and Economic Office
* '''Dr. Ahmed Amer''', Head of the International Relations Office
* '''Dr. Mohamed Salah''', Head of the Information and Media Office and the Civil Society 
* '''Samir Al-Aerki''', Head of the Resource Development Committee

== Activities ==
Maha Azzam has said that the ERC’s role is to address the European community to support the group’s mission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In February 2015, Maha Azzam wrote an open letter to President Obama on the occasion of the Countering Violent Extremism summit. In the letter she stated that an autocratic regime such as [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|General Sisi]]’s will lead to the kind of destabilized society that leads to [[violent extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Egyptian Revolutionary Council writes to Obama|url = https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/articles/africa/17112-egyptian-revolutionary-council-writes-to-obama|accessdate = 2015-07-30|website = Middle East Monitor|date = 2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ties to Muslim Brotherhood ==
The Egyptian Revolutionary Council has strong ties to the [[Muslim Brotherhood|Global Muslim Brotherhood]]. sometimes ERC leaders have been a part of delegations and conference panels that were composed mostly of Muslim Brotherhood members and leaders. In January 2015, then Secretary General, now Deputy President, Waleed Sharaby and Maha Azzam were part of a delegation of Muslim Brotherhood-aligned leaders that was hosted by the U.S. State Department for meetings about the Muslim Brotherhood’s ongoing efforts to oppose the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = US State Department Hosts Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Delegation|url = http://www.globalmbwatch.com/2015/01/28/state-department-hosts-egyptian-muslim-brotherhood-delegation/|website = The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hamas-Supporting MB Figures Meet With Congress, State Dept.|url = http://www.investigativeproject.org/4765/hamas-supporting-mb-figures-meet-with-congress#|accessdate = 2015-07-30|first = John|last = Rossomando}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, Sharaby has also openly praised Hamas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In February 2015, Maha Azzam was scheduled to speak at a conference titled “Islam and Democracy” hosted by the Cordoba Foundation at which a wide range of Global Muslim Brotherhood leaders were scheduled to speak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Egyptian Revolutionary Council has been criticized by Egyptian leadership as being “another front for the Muslim Brotherhood’s international wing” that is a strategy by Turkey to exert pressure on the Egyptian state.&lt;ref name="Moving-abroad - Al-Ahram Weekly"/&gt;

Maha Azzam has said that Muslim Brotherhood members make up less than 20% of the group, but this number has not been substantiated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Emergencies Act''''' ({{lang-fr|Loi sur les mesures d’urgence}}) (the ''Act'') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] to authorize the taking of special temporary measures to ensure [[safety]] and [[security]] during national emergencies and to amend [[List of Acts of Parliament of Canada|other Acts]] in consequence thereof.

It received [[Royal Assent|royal assent]] on July 21, 1988, replacing the ''[[War Measures Act]]''.

The ''Emergencies Act'' differs from the'' War Measures Act'' in two important ways:

# A declaration of an emergency by the Cabinet must be reviewed by Parliament
# Any temporary laws made under the ''Act'' are subject to the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

Thus any attempt by the government to suspend the [[civil right]]s of Canadians, even in an emergency, will be subject to the "reasonable and justified" test under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the Charter.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

{{English Feudalism}}
Under the [[English feudal system]] several different forms of [[land tenure]] existed, each effectively a contract with differing rights and duties attached thereto. Such tenures could be either free-hold, signifying that they were hereditable or perpetual, or non-free where the tenancy terminated on the tenant's death or at an earlier specified period. The main varieties are as follows:

==Military tenure==
(Generally freehold)
*'''by [[English feudal barony|barony]]''' (''per baroniam''). Such tenure constituted the holder a [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]], and was the highest degree of tenure. It imposed duties of military service and required attendance at [[Parliament of England|parliament]]. All such holders were necessarily [[tenants-in-chief]].
*'''by [[knight-service]]'''. This was a tenure ranking below barony, and was likewise for military service, of a lesser extent. It could be held ''[[tenant-in-chief|in capite]]'' from the king or as a ''[[mesne lord|mesne]]'' tenancy from a tenant-in-chief.
*'''by [[castle-guard]]'''. This was a form of military service which involved guarding a nearby castle for a specified number of days per year.
*'''by [[scutage]]''' where the military service obligations had been commuted, or replaced, by money payments.

==Non-military tenure==
*'''by [[frankalmoin]]age''', generally a tenure restricted to clerics.
*'''by [[Farm (revenue commutation)|fee-farm]]''', a grant of the right to collect and retain revenues in return for a fixed rent. Usually a royal grant.
*'''by [[copyhold]]''', where the duties and obligations were tailored to the requirements of the [[lord of the manor]] and a copy of the terms agreed was entered on the [[Manorial roll|roll of the manorial court]] as a record.
*'''by [[socage]]'''. A form of tenure, involving payment in produce or in money.
*'''[[Quit-rent]]'''. The payment of an annual fee in exchange for freedom from all other [[feudal obligations]].

==Uncategorised==
*'''by [[serjeanty]]'''. Such tenure ranged from non-standard service in the king's army, to petty renders scarcely distinguishable from those of the rent-paying tenant or socager. Service in a ceremonial form is termed "grand serjeanty" whilst that of a more functional or menial nature is termed "petty serjeanty".
*'''[http://medieval_terms.enacademic.com/1707/In_paragio Parage]'''. A joint tenancy where the estate is not partitioned, but the senior tenant alone is responsible for estate obligations; it appears frequently in ''[[Domesday Book]]''. (''Coolf tenuit in paragio de rege'', manor of Welige, IoW).
*'''[[Burgage|Free burgage]]''', tenure within a town or city.&lt;ref&gt;Inq.p.m. of John Beverley, d.1438, for Free Burgage in the City of London held from the King&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2018}}
*'''[[Curtesy tenure]]'''. A tenant "by the curtesy of England", being a widower of a wife by whom he has issue by her born alive, in respect of her enseized right in land, generally originating in a paternal inheritance. [[Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk|Roger Bigod]] claimed it unsuccessfully on the death of his wife Aliva.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, F. ''Annals of an Old Manor House: Sutton Place'', Guildford. London, 1899, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Tenancy at will|Tenant-at-will]]'''. Such tenant had no security of tenure whatsoever. It developed into the more secure "copyhold tenure", where the terms were set out in an entry on the manorial roll.
*'''[[Gavelkind]]'''. Frequently found in mediaeval Kent, "held according to the custom of gavelkind". It withdrew a dower from a widow if she remarried.&lt;ref&gt;Gavelkind: see e.g. Inq p.m. Richard Charles, 1190, Cal inq pm, vol. XV, p.10. Held "Hertachehop" by gavelkind tenure from prior of Rochester&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2018}}
*'''[[Fee simple]]''', a tenure with no service obligations attached which could be a free-holding (i.e. hereditable) or non-free (expiring on the tenant's death).&lt;ref&gt;Fee simple, see e.g. Cal. Patent Rolls, 3 July 1290, Inspeximus of charter granting lands by Otto de Grandison in fee simple&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2018}} On the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|abolition of feudal tenure in 1660]], all existing tenures were converted to this tenure.

''' Food quality''' is the quality characteristics of food that is acceptable to consumers. This includes external factors as appearance (size, shape, colour, gloss, and consistency), texture, and flavour; factors such as federal grade standards (e.g. of [[egg (food)|eggs]]) and internal (chemical, physical, microbial).

Food quality in the [[United States]] is enforced by the Food Safety Act 1990. Members of the public complain to trading standards professionals,{{specify|date=April 2016}} who submit complaint samples and also samples used to routinely monitor the food marketplace to [[public analyst]]s. Public analysts carry out scientific analysis on the samples to determine whether the quality is of sufficient standard.

Food quality is an important food manufacturing requirement, because food consumers are susceptible to any form of contamination that may occur during the manufacturing process&lt;ref&gt;Mayounga, A. T. (2018) "Antecedents of recalls prevention: analysis and synthesis of research on product recalls." Supply Chain Forum: An International Journal, 19(3). https://doi.org/10.1080/16258312.2018.1530575. Retrieved 2018-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many consumers also rely on manufacturing and processing standards, particularly to know what ingredients are present, due to dietary, nutritional requirements ([[kosher]], [[halal]], [[vegetarian]]), or medical conditions (e.g., [[diabetes]], or [[allergies]]).

Besides ingredient quality, there are also [[sanitation]] requirements. It is important to ensure that the food processing environment is as clean as possible in order to produce the safest possible food for the consumer. A recent example of poor sanitation recently has been the [[2006 North American E. coli outbreak]] involving [[spinach]], an outbreak that is still under investigation&lt;!--  after new information has come to light regarding the involvement of Cambodian nationals --&gt;.

Food quality also deals with product [[traceability]], (e.g., of [[ingredient]], and [[packaging]] suppliers), should a recall of the product be required. It also deals with [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] issues to ensure there is correct ingredient and nutritional information.

There are many existing international quality institutes testing food products in order to indicate to all consumers which are higher quality products. Founded in 1961 in [[Brussels]], The international [[Monde Selection]] quality award is the oldest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espiritu-de-chile.com/197.html?&amp;L=1 ''Monde Selection represents one of the oldest and most influential organisations in terms of quality examination''], espiritu-de-chile.com&lt;/ref&gt; in evaluating food quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monde-selection.com/en/1.0_Activities_and_Awards/1.9_Scientific_and_legal_approach/1.9_Scientific_and_legal_approach.asp  Monde Selection], 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[degustation]]s, the products must meet the following selection criteria, required by the Institute: sensory analysis, bacteriological and chemical analysis, the nutrition and health claims, and the utilisation notice. In short, the judgements are based on the following areas: taste, health, convenience, labelling, packaging, environmental friendliness and innovation.&lt;ref name="Scientific and legal approach"&gt;[http://www.monde-selection.com/en/1.0_Activities_and_Awards/1.9_Scientific_and_legal_approach/1.9_Scientific_and_legal_approach.asp Scientific and legal approach], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As many consumers rely on manufacturing and processing standards, the Institute [[Monde Selection]] takes into account the European Food Law.&lt;ref name="Scientific and legal approach"/&gt;

The '''Galician National-Popular Assembly''' (AN-PG, ''Asemblea Nacional-Popular Galega'' in [[Galician language]]) was suprapartisan [[umbrella organization]] established in 1975 created to coordinate various political ''fronts'' of the [[Left-wing nationalism|left-wing]] [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] movement.

==History==
The principles of the AN-PG were [[self-determination]], [[self-government]], [[anti-colonialism]], [[democracy]] and the promoting the creation of [[Galician people|Galician]] political forces and had as it main objective the formation of a [[Galician people|Galician]] [[provisional government]] after getting power. The AN-PG used the [[estreleira]] as its [[flag]] and organized [[Demonstration (protest)|protests]] on July 25, considered as "[[Día Nacional de Galicia]]" or the "Day of the Galician Fatherland".

The AN-PG held its first plenary in April 1976, which resulted in the split of a sector that considered the AN-PG excessively linked to the [[Galician People's Union]] (UPG). This sector was the [[Galician People's Assembly]]. In the III Plenary held in October 1977 the AN-PG approved its statutes, in which the organization was defined as "interclassist, [[nonpartisan]] organization directed by a collegiate secretary," in which [[Lois Diéguez]] served as [[spokesman]]. After the [[Spanish municipal elections, 1979|municipal elections of 1979]], the AN-PG was restructured to promote greater coordination among its counselors, creating local assemblies.

In 1981 it suffered a major internal crisis that marked the celebration of V Plenary in March 1982, which led to the departure of the organization of two members of the National Direction and a group of 50 militants. Finally, in the last plenary of the organization there were calls for a reformulation of the organizational model. The journey of the AN-PG ended in the same 1982, leading to the formation of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG).

The AN-PG was opposed to the introduction of a [[Statute of Autonomy]] for [[Galiza]], that was considered a [[colony]] that had to achieve [[sovereignty]] through constitutional grounds. The Cultural Front AN-PG was one of the most active sections of the AN-PG, where were people like Darius Xohán Cabana, Manuel María, or Xesús Picouto Emiliano Vázquez. The Cultural Front of the AN-PG was one of the most active sections of the Assembly, with members like [[Darío Xohán Cabana]], [[Manuel María]], [[Emiliano Picouto]] or [[Xesús Vázquez]].

In 1965 Simon and Schuster published Alperovitz’s ''Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam'', based on his Cambridge doctoral thesis. Drawing on the diaries of Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], the work argued that after Germany’s defeat, U.S. policymakers based their strategy toward the Soviet Union on the judgment that the [[Atomic Bomb|atomic bomb]], once demonstrated, would provide leverage in negotiating the postwar world order. Alperovitz also reported that, at the time, there was substantial but not definitive evidence suggesting that gaining diplomatic leverage against the [[Soviet Union]] was a major consideration in the atomic bombing of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Diplomacy-Hiroshima-Gar-Alperovitz/dp/B000JHWU3O/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=PMHFB1PEE12JXC8B9SAR|title=Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam|last=Alperovitz|first=Gar|date=1965|publisher=Vintage|edition=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, published as the Vietnam War generated increasing public concern, became a focal point in the debate over the direction of American foreign policy in the mid- and late 1960s. Although critically reviewed at the time by many, such as former [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman Administration Cabinet]] member Senator [[Clinton Presba Anderson|Clinton Anderson]] in ''The New York Times'', others welcomed it. Historian [[Michael Beschloss]] observed in a 1985'' New York Times'' retrospective that ''Atomic Diplomacy'' had immense “shock value” during a time when the public was less skeptical “about the motives of our leaders and the origins of the cold war” and that Alperovitz’s argument “pushed other scholars to re-examine their assumptions about Hiroshima and Nagaski.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/30/books/did-we-need-to-drop-it.html|title=Did We Need to Drop It?|last=Beschloss|first=Michael R.|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale historian [[Gaddis Smith]] wrote in ''The New York Times'' in 1995 that “the preponderance of new evidence that has appeared since 1965 tends to sustain the original argument.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/18/books/was-moscow-our-real-target.html|title=WAS MOSCOW OUR REAL TARGET?|last=Smith|first=Gaddis|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alperovitz has written extensively on the decision to use the atomic bomb in such publications as ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. He revisited the subject in ''The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb and the Architecture of an American Myth'' published by Knopf in 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/30/books/did-we-need-to-drop-it.html|title=Did We Need to Drop It?|last=Beschloss|first=Michael R.|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work added further research demonstrating that top American and British World War II military leaders believed the war would end in the Pacific Theater long before an invasion of Japan could begin in November, and that they had attempted to convince top civilian leaders, including the president, that this was likely. The book demonstrated that virtually every top World War II U.S. military leader, including President (previously General) [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], went public after the war with statements suggesting that the use of the atomic bomb was unnecessary. A major part of the work documented the sophisticated public relations effort the Truman administration mounted to sustain public belief that using the bomb was necessary and, as Beschloss observed in a ''New York Times'' review, “why the public clings so tenaciously to the original explanation of why Truman gave the order.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/30/books/did-we-need-to-drop-it.html|title=Did We Need to Drop It?|last=Beschloss|first=Michael R.|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Marilyn B. Young|Marilyn Young]] observed in a featured review of the book in the American Historical Review that “few historians I know have taken up the central ethical and historical issues surrounding the first, and thus far only, use of nuclear bombs as seriously as Alperovitz.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marilyn|first=Young,|date=December 1995|title=Gar Alperovitz. &lt;italic&gt;The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb and the Architecture of an American Myth&lt;/italic&gt;.

Other documentaries including one by the BBC and a dramatization by a German television network helped increase international interest.

== Community Wealth-Building and the Pluralist Commonwealth Model ==
Alperovitz’s work as a [[Political economy|political economist]] has centered on theoretical and practical alternatives to both [[corporate capitalism]] and traditional [[state socialism]]. He holds that the architecture of both suffers from centralized power that fails to support liberty, equality, ecological sustainability, genuine [[participatory democracy]], and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pluralistcommonwealth.org/historical-development.html|title=Historical Development|website=The Pluralist Commonwealth|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenging both theories of reform and of revolution, he emphasizes a model based on the evolutionary reconstruction of economic institutions, communities, and the nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pluralistcommonwealth.org/|title=The Pluralist Commonwealth|website=The Pluralist Commonwealth|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''American Beyond Capitalism'' and other books and essays, Alperovitz offers an integrated systemic model for a Pluralist Commonwealth based on democratizing ownership of economic institutions at all levels, a regional decentralization of economic and political power, and the building of forms of community wealth-holding and a culture of participatory democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pluralistcommonwealth.org/|title=The Pluralist Commonwealth|website=The Pluralist Commonwealth|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pluralist Commonwealth model includes diverse forms of democratized ownership, from worker-community cooperatively owned production firms to municipally owned institutions, [[public bank]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Public utility|utilities]], [[Community land trust|land trusts]], and [[public transport]]ation. Regional scaling of larger public enterprises and longer-term political decentralization are proposed as ways to transform and displace extractive elements of [[Financialization|financialized]] corporate capitalism. Alperovitz also acknowledges the utility of certain forms of private enterprises and [[Market (economics)|markets]] along with participatory [[economic planning]]. This model attempts to expand the limits of political economic possibilities beyond the polarity between state ownership and capitalism. The model also proposes a reduction in the workweek, providing workers more free time and allowing for more liberty and democratic participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenextsystem.org/principles-introduction#footnote1_g0r4o3g|title=Principles of a Pluralist Commonwealth: Introduction|website=TheNextSystem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that as population continues to grow, a long-term devolution of the national state in the direction of regional structures can allow for democratic participation and democratic management of ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenextsystem.org/principles-introduction#footnote1_g0r4o3g|title=Principles of a Pluralist Commonwealth: Introduction|website=TheNextSystem.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 profile, biographer [[Ron Chernow]] wrote: “Alperovitz believes that [[Worker cooperative|co-ops]] and other experimental enterprises can flourish in strong, stable communities…When Alperovitz talks about socialism (and he usually avoids the term, as much for its imprecision as its emotional charge), he doesn’t mean a group of Soviet-style commissars and technocrats handing down production quotas from Washington. Rather, he foresees thousands of local planning boards acting as conduits for citizen participation. Decisions would trickle up from below, forming a barrier against the sort of bureaucratic monolith that most people equate with planning,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=ron+chernow+gar+alperovitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-GWyVh-e_u&amp;sig=drRt1lHBZR1drUNgyRubTFOBGtg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6h7O14dPbAhXyqFkKHZo9BqUQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ron%20chernow%20gar%20alperovitz&amp;f=false|title=Mother Jones Magazine|last=Jones|first=Mother|date=April 1978|publisher=Mother Jones|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with corporate capitalism. Alperovitz has said his work is influenced by his studies at the University of Wisconsin with historian [[William Appleman Williams]], at Cambridge University with [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] theoretical economist Joan Robinson, and by his work with Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, an early environmentalist and the founder of [[Earth Day]].

== Building Experimental Economic Centers and Developing Community, Regional, and Related System Altering Legislation ==
Alperovitz’s interest in developing alternative economic models based on community wealth building began while he was in the federal government. Over 40 years, he has worked to create several institutions to develop an expansive theory and to implement principles on the ground. In addition to those noted at the outset, he co-founded The Cambridge Institute and The National Center for Economic and Security Alternatives. In 1964, while working in the Senate, he was the principal architect of legislation to create several regional planning commissions that might lead to efforts similar to the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] as part of the Johnson Administration’s [[War on Poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capitalinstitute.org/braintrust/gar-alperovitz/|title=GAR ALPEROVITZ - CAPITAL INSTITUTE|work=CAPITAL INSTITUTE|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with John McClaughry, he co-authored the Community Self-Determination Act of 1968, sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of 26 senators, which introduced an expansive ownership-oriented conception of already established [[Community development corporation|Community Development Corporations]] (CDC) as a new institutional form.[http://www.pluralistcommonwealth.org/historical-development.html]

In 1964 Alperovitz met [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and in 1967 he began work with King and high-level aides [[Andrew Young]] and Bernard Lee to explore a possible community-building economic strategy that might also build political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pluralistcommonwealth.org/historical-development.html|title=Historical Development|website=The Pluralist Commonwealth|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was cut short by King’s assassination in 1968.

== Youngstown Activism ==
Alperovitz is recognized as the leading architect of the first modern steel industry attempt at worker ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pluralistcommonwealth.org/historical-development.html|title=Historical Development|website=The Pluralist Commonwealth|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, after failing to invest in the modernization of its production machinery, the holding company that owned the large steel manufacturer Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube shut down its plant in Youngstown, Ohio, and laid off more than 4,000 workers in a single day—still known in the community as Black Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/16/the-day-that-destroyed-the-working-class-and-sowed-the-seeds-for-trump/|title=The day that destroyed the working class and sowed the seeds of Trump|date=2017-09-16|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, these steelworkers and a broad-based community coalition decided to attempt to reopen the mill under Alperovitz's comprehensive plan for worker-community ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=ron+chernow+gar+alperovitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-GWyVh-e_u&amp;sig=drRt1lHBZR1drUNgyRubTFOBGtg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6h7O14dPbAhXyqFkKHZo9BqUQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ron%20chernow%20gar%20alperovitz&amp;f=false|title=Mother Jones Magazine|last=Jones|first=Mother|date=April 1978|publisher=Mother Jones|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the plan argued that the plant became unprofitable only because [[rent-seeking]] corporate owners shifted investments to other locations and industries instead of investing in modernizing the plant, whereas community ownership could foster efficient production and long-term investment.

This coalition asked Alperovitz and the National Center for Economic Alternatives to develop a comprehensive feasibility study and effort. A nationwide campaign led by national religious leaders put the Youngstown effort on the map, and with Alperovitz’s help, the coalition secured support from the Carter administration’s Department of Housing and Urban Development for a sophisticated plan along with a pledge to provide loan guarantees. A comprehensive study by a leading steel industry expert demonstrated that the community could feasibly reopen the mill under a worker-community ownership program after updating it with modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=ron+chernow+gar+alperovitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-GWyVh-e_u&amp;sig=drRt1lHBZR1drUNgyRubTFOBGtg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6h7O14dPbAhXyqFkKHZo9BqUQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=ron%20chernow%20gar%20alperovitz&amp;f=false|title=Mother Jones Magazine|last=Jones|first=Mother|date=April 1978|publisher=Mother Jones|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carter administration later withdrew its loan pledges after the midterm elections of 1978.

== Vietnam War Activism ==
Alperovitz was involved in efforts to stop the escalating Vietnam War for several years, both as a political actor and later as an activist. While still Legislative Director to Senator Gaylord Nelson, Alperovitz authored an amendment to the famed Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that would have pre-empted the massive escalation of the war that ensued after the Resolution passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/09/22/remember-the-gulf-of-tonkin/832ae1c7-9261-4868-956b-5e637640514f/|title=Remember the Gulf of Tonkin|date=2002-09-22|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being appointed and serving for a year as Special Assistant to the U.S State Department, Alperovitz resigned his post discouraged by insider attempts to alter US war policy.

From 1966 to 1968, while a Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics, Alperovitz played a role in the burgeoning antiwar movements coalescing in Cambridge at the time, developing the “Vietnam Summer” activism campaign centered on canvassing and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/08/12/poll-2|title=Poll|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Yorker at the time credited Alperovitz with devising the campaign's strategy, which sought to educate and agitate “undecideds and unaffiliated doves” into taking action against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/08/12/poll-2|title=Poll|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alperovitz arranged for Martin Luther King Jr. and writer and physician [[Benjamin Spock]] to join the effort and formally kick off the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/08/12/poll-2|title=Poll|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role in the [[Pentagon Papers]] ===
In 1971 Alperovitz met [[Daniel Ellsberg]] at a Cambridge dinner party. Alperovitz was unaware that months earlier, while still a [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] employee, Ellsberg had secretly made several sets of photocopies of a classified [[United States Department of Defense]] report on the history of the Vietnam War, giving a portion of one set to New York Times journalist [[Neil Sheehan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-untold-story-of-the-pentagon-papers-co-conspirators|title=The Untold Story of the Pentagon Papers Co-Conspirators|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents, which later became known as the Pentagon Papers, revealed that the US government had known from an early point in the conflict that it could not win the Vietnam War, and further showed that each administration since Eisenhower, and especially the Johnson administration, had “systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress” about the conduct of the war.

To keep the publication of the Pentagon Papers going, Alperovitz developed a strategy to hand off portions of the report to one news publication at a time beginning with ''The Washington Post''—which helped to create an ongoing media spectacle and to keep public interest in the contents of the papers alive for several weeks. With Ellsberg in hiding, Alperovitz handled the logistics of handing off the papers to the press, adopting the moniker “Mr. Boston” when speaking to journalists and exercising great caution in planning elaborate handoffs. In an interview with ''The New Yorker'', Ellsberg said that “Alperovitz, in particular, was critical to the way this thing worked out … it was Alperovitz who devised the strategy of distributing the papers to as many news organizations as possible, including [to [[Ben Bagdikian]] at] ''The Washington Post'', an approach that later proved to be crucial from both a legal and a public-relations standpoint. And it was Alperovitz who came up with the elaborate techniques for slipping the documents to reporters while evading the authorities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-untold-story-of-the-pentagon-papers-co-conspirators|title=The Untold Story of the Pentagon Papers Co-Conspirators|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
=== Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam ===

==== The Use of the Atomic Bomb and The American Confrontation with Soviet Power ====
In this work, Alperovitz investigates the role of the atomic bomb in shaping the formation of the U.S relationship with the Soviet Union and the makeup of the postwar international political order. Alperovitz provides evidence that once the atomic bomb had [[Trinity (nuclear test)|successfully been tested]], the U.S policy towards the Soviet Union under the Truman Administration shifted from "conciliatory" to "tough" and he argues that Truman used the U.S possession of the atomic bomb as a diplomatic tool to force "Soviet acquiescence to American plans" for postwar Europe as the two powers negotiated at the [[Potsdam Conference]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gar-alperovitz/atomic-diplomacy-hiroshima-and-potsdam/|title=ATOMIC DIPLOMACY: HIROSHIMA AND POTSDAM by Gar Alperovitz {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Alperovitz also presents substantive, although not definitive, evidence suggesting that top-level American civilian and military leaders knew the atomic bomb was not necessary to end World War II, but still used it to demonstrate strength vis-á-vis the Soviet Union.

=== The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb ===

==== And the Architecture of an American Myth ====
Drawing upon a host of new evidence that had been declassified since the publication of ''Atomic Diplomacy'', such as the diary of U.S. Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson|Henry L. Stinson]], in this work Alperovitz offers what [[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]] has called "the most definitive account we are likely to see of why Hiroshima was destroyed, and how an official history justifying that decision was subsequently crafted and promulgated by the national security establishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://harpers.org/blog/2016/05/unjust-cause/|title=Unjust Cause|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|date=2016-05-25|website=The Stream - Harper's Magazine Blog|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the preponderance of evidence suggests that it was not military necessity, but rather the U.S.'s geo-strategic motives vis-à-vis the Soviet Union that most influenced Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan. Although Alperovitz acknowledges that "a full and unqualified answer as to why the atomic bomb was used is neither essential nor possible", he says that "what is important is whether, when the bomb was used, the president and his top advisers understood that it was not required to avoid a long and costly invasion, as they later claimed and as most Americans still believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60306686|title=The decision to use the atomic bomb : and the architecture of an American myth|last=Gar.|first=Alperovitz,|date=1996|publisher=Fontana|others=Tree, Sanho.|isbn=0006386806|location=London|oclc=60306686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unjust Deserts ===
With his co-author Lew Daly, Alperovitz explores the connection between the economic impact of socially-created knowledge and rising economic inequality to argue that "a new aristocracy is reaping huge unearned gains from our collective intellectual wealth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/events/2008/12/12/16722/unjust-deserts/|title=Unjust Deserts - Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alperovitz summarizes the work in an interview with ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'': "... our main focus is on the broader problem of inequality, not on undeserved fortunes per se. The problem we see is a society whose wealth is commonly created, by and large, but very unequally distributed and enjoyed. The largely collective way we produce our wealth is morally out of sync with the individualistic way we distribute the wealth and also justify the resulting vast inequalities. So we’re not saying to the Bill Gateses of the world: you don’t deserve anything and we’re going to tax it all away. What we’re saying is that our society should be more equal than it is if we truly believe, first, that people should be rewarded according to what they contribute, and second, that society should be repaid for the large contributions it makes, which enable everything else. These are common beliefs or, at least, reasonable ideas, so that is not the problem. The problem is a mistaken view of wealth-creation, which distorts how these common ideas are applied."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/unjust-deserts-an-interview-with-gar-alperovitz-and-lew-daly|title=Unjust Deserts: An Interview with Gar Alperovitz and Lew Daly {{!}} Dissent Magazine|work=Dissent Magazine|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== America Beyond Capitalism ===
Published in the wake of the Great Recession, in this work Alperovitz chronicles growing discontent with the current political economy status quo, and diagnoses the long-term structural ills of the American political and economic system as inherent to capitalism's systemic architecture. He writes, "The book argues that the only way for the United States to once again honor its great historic values—above all equality, liberty, and meaningful democracy—is to build forward to achieve what amounts to systemic change...fundamental change—indeed, radical systemic change...If equality, liberty, and meaningful democracy can truly no longer be sustained by the political and economic arrangements of the current system, this defines the beginning phases of what can only be called a systemic crisis—an era of history in which the political-economic system must slowly lose legitimacy because the realities it produces contradict the values it proclaims. Moreover, if the system itself is at fault, then self-evidently—indeed, by definition—a solution would ultimately require the development of a new system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767837942|title=America beyond capitalism : reclaiming our wealth, our liberty, and our democracy|last=Gar.|first=Alperovitz,|others=Speth, James Gustave.|isbn=9780984785704|edition= Second|location=Boston, MA|oclc=767837942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alperovitz offers a remedy in the form of grassroots experiments currently underway in thousands of U.S. communities, which he sees as precedents that popular movements can use to plant the seeds of the next, more democratic economy. He points to worker cooperatives, municipal ownership of utilities, community land trusts, and larger institutions such as public banks and public transportation, as a roadmap for "laying foundations to change a faltering system that increasingly fails to support the great American values of equality, liberty, and meaningful democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://will.illinois.edu/mediamatters/program/mediamatters-february-26-2012|title=Gar Alperovitz, author of America Beyond Capitalism.|date=2012-02-26|work=Illinois Public Media|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of India}}
'''[[Human rights]] in India''' is an issue complicated by the country's large size &amp; population, widespread poverty, lack of proper education &amp; its diverse culture, even though being the world's largest [[sovereign]], secular, [[democratic republic]]. The [[Constitution of India]] provides for [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental rights]], which include [[freedom of religion]]. Clauses also provide for [[freedom of speech]], as well as separation of executive and judiciary and freedom of movement within the country and abroad. The country also has an independent judiciary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepressjournal.in/hands-off-supreme-court-tells-govt-reaffirming-its-primacy-in-judicial-appointments/743321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-worry-till-judiciarys-independence-is-maintained-chief-justice-of-india-1251654&lt;/ref&gt; and well as bodies to look into issues of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/act-in-block-grant-teachers-issue-nhrc-to-ohrc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 report of [[Human Rights Watch]] accepts the above-mentioned faculties but goes to state that India has "serious human rights concerns. Civil society groups face harassment and government critics face intimidation and lawsuits. Free speech has come under attack both from the state and by interest groups. Muslim and Christian minorities accuse authorities of not doing enough to protect their rights. But in the recent years, more emphasis is given to minority rights &amp; freedom of speech.The government is yet to repeal laws that grant public officials and security forces immunity from prosecution for abuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/india|title=India|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/india|title=India|date=2016-01-08|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of torture by police==
The Asian Centre for Human Rights estimated that from 2002 to 2008, over four people per day died while in police custody, with "hundreds" of those deaths being due to police use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-34225620080625 | work=Reuters | title=Hundreds die of torture in India every year - report | date=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report written by the Institute of Correctional Administration in Punjab, up to 50% of police officers in the country have used physical or mental abuse on prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070313/punjab1.htm |title=Torture main reason of death in police custody |publisher=The Tribune |first=Saurabh |last=Malik |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303182313/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070313/punjab1.htm |archivedate=3 March 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of torture, such as through a lack of sanitation, space, or water have been documented in West Bengal as well.

==Religious violence==
{{Main|Religious violence in India}}
Communal conflicts between religious groups (mostly between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]]) have been prevalent in India since around the time of its independence from [[British India|British Rule]]. Among the oldest incidences of communal violence in India was the [[Moplah rebellion]], when [[Militant Islamist]]s massacred Hindus in Kerala. Communal riots took place during the [[partition of India]] between Hindus/Sikhs and Muslims where large numbers of people were killed in large-scale violence.

The [[1984 Anti-Sikh Riots]] was a four-day period during which Sikhs were massacred by members of the secular-centrist [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party of India]]; some estimates state that more than 2,000 were killed.&lt;ref name="Nichols_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Politics of Assassination: Case Studies and Analysis |last=Nichols |first=B |journal=Australasian Political Studies Association Conference |year=2003 |url=http://www.utas.edu.au/government/APSA/BNichols.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other incidents include the 1987 [[Hashimpura massacre]] during communal riots in [[Meerut]], 1992 [[Bombay riots]]. The killing was done at the behest of Congress leaders such as Jagdish Tytler. Congress Party officials provided assailants with voter lists, school registration forms, and ration lists. Nanavati Commission also found out that several Congress leaders were behind this lynching. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh apologized in the Loksabha for the involvement of Congress stalwarts in the Lok Sabha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Nanavati-I_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[WikiLeaks cables|2011 WikiLeaks cable leaks]], the United States was convinced of Indian National Congress complicity in the riots and called it "opportunism" and "hatred" by the [[Government of India|Congress government]] of Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-06/india/29515961_1_anti-sikh-riots-gujarat-riots-nanavati-commission-report|title=US saw Cong hand in Sikh massacre, reveal Wiki leaks|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=10 May 2011|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official figures, [[2002 Gujarat riots]] ended with 1,044 dead, 223 missing, and 2,500 injured. Of the dead, 790 were Muslim and 254 Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gujarat riot death toll revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4536199.stm|publisher=BBC|date=11 May 2005}}

The Chief Minister at that time, [[Narendra Modi]], has been accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as have police and government officials who allegedly directed the rioters and gave lists of Muslim-owned properties to them. However, Narendra Modi was acquitted of such charges by none less than the honorable Supreme Court of India. The incident that resulted in the riots was the Muslim mob attack on a train full of Hindu pilgrims in the [[Godhra Train Burning]], where 58 Hindus were killed.&lt;ref name="HRW_2006_265"&gt;{{harvnb|Human Rights Watch|2006|p=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesser incidents plague many towns and villages; representative was the killing of five people in [[Mau]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] during Hindu-Muslim rioting, which was triggered by the proposed celebration of a Hindu festival.&lt;ref name="HRW_2006_265"/&gt; Other such communal incidents include the [[2002 Marad massacre]], which was carried out by the [[militant Islamist]] group [[National Development Front]], as well as communal riots in [[Tamil Nadu]] executed by the Islamist [[Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazagham]] against Hindus.

==Caste related issues==
{{Main|Caste system in India|Caste politics in India|Caste-related violence in India}}

Contemporary India, however, has seen the influence of caste start to decline. This is partly due to the spread of education to all castes which has had a democratising effect on the political system. However, this "equalising" of the playing field has not been without controversy. The [[Mandal Commission]] and its quotas system has been a particularly sensitive issue. It has been argued by Professor Dipankar Gupta that the role of castes in Indian elections have been overplayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-caste-bogey-in-election-analysis/article5811003.ece The caste bogey in election analysis, Dipankar Gupta, March 21, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently there has been a flux in caste politics, mainly caused by [[economic liberalisation in India]]. This upsurge in lower-caste empowerment was accompanied in some regions by a spike in the level of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?283752 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811041518/http://www.outlookindia.com/printarticle.aspx?283752 |archivedate=11 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was partly due to lower caste perceiving development programs and rule of law as tools used by the upper caste to subjugate lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/3u2QUPuXBEFPaBQXU2R8mJ/When-will-the-BrahminBania-hegemony-end.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] says "it is the responsibility of the Indian government to fully enact and apply its legal provisions against discrimination on the basis of caste and descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA2005100705001&amp;lang=e|title=India's Unfinished Agenda: Equality and Justice for 200 Million Victims of the Caste System|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denotified tribes of India]], along with many [[nomadic tribes in India|nomadic tribes]] collectively 60 million in population, continue to face social stigma and economic hardships, despite the fact [[Criminal Tribes Act]] 1871, was repealed by the government in 1952 and replaced by [[Habitual Offender Laws#India|Habitual Offenders Act]] (HOA) (1952), as effectively it only created a new list out of the old list of so-called "criminal tribes. These tribes even today face the consequences of the 'Prevention of Anti-Social Activity Act' (PASA), which only adds to their everyday struggle for existence as most of them live [[Below Poverty Line|below poverty line]]. [[National Human Rights Commission (India)|National Human Rights Commission]] and UN's anti-discrimination body [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) have asked the government to repeal this law as well, as these former "criminalised" tribes continue to suffer oppression and social ostracization at large and many have been denied SC, ST or OBC status, denying them access to [[Reservation in India|reservations]] which would elevated their economic and social status.&lt;ref name=dis&gt;{{cite web

==Freedom of expression==
{{Main|Freedom of expression in India}}
According to the estimates of [[Reporters Without Borders]], India ranks 122nd worldwide in 2010 on the press freedom index (down from 105th in 2009). The press freedom index for India is 38.75 in 2010 (29.33 for 2009) on a scale that runs from 0 (most free) to 105 (least free).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html "Press Freedom Index 2010"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000000/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010%2C1034.html |date=21 July 2011 }}, Reporters Without Borders&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2009,1001.html "Press Freedom Index 2009"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930230930/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2009%2C1001.html |date=30 September 2015 }}, Reporters Without Borders&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 India was down ranked to 140th worldwide (score of 40.34 out of 105) but despite this remains one of the best scores in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2014 "Press Freedom Index 2014"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214000000/http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php |date=14 February 2014 }}, Reporters Without Borders&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Constitution]], while not mentioning the word "press", provides for ''"the right to freedom of speech and expression"'' (Article 19(1) a).  However this right is subject to restrictions under subclause (2), whereby this freedom can be restricted for reasons of "[[sovereignty]] and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, preserving decency, preserving morality, in relation to contempt of court, [[defamation]], or incitement to an offence".    Laws such as the [[Official Secrets Act (India)|Official Secrets Act]] and [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]
&lt;ref name=pota&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(POTA) have been used to limit press freedom. Under POTA, person could be detained for up to six months before the police were required to bring charges on allegations for terrorism-related offenses. POTA was repealed in 2004, but was replaced by amendments to UAPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Anil | last=Kalhan |ssrn=970503|title=Colonial Continuities: Human Rights, Antiterrorism, and Security Laws in India|year=2006|publisher=20 Colum.

For the first half-century of independence, media control by the state was the major constraint on press freedom.
[[Indira Gandhi]] famously stated in 1975 that [[All India Radio]] is "a Government organ, it is going to remain a Government organ..."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url = http://www.pucl.org/from-archives/Media/freedom-press.htm|title = Freedom of the Press
|journal = PUCL Bulletin|publisher = People's Union for Civil Liberties|date=July 1982|author1 = &lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the liberalisation starting in the 1990s, private control of media has burgeoned, leading to increasing independence and greater scrutiny of government.

Organisations like [[Tehelka]] and [[NDTV]] have been particularly influential, in bringing about the resignation of powerful [[Haryana]] minister [[Venod Sharma]]. In addition, laws like [[Prasar Bharati]] act passed in recent years contribute significantly to reducing the control of the press by the government.

==LGBT rights==
{{Main|LGBT rights in India}}
Until the [[Delhi High Court]] decriminalised consensual private sexual acts between consenting adults on 2 July 2009,&lt;ref name="India decriminalises gay sex"/&gt; homosexuality was considered criminal as per interpretations of the ambiguous [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code|Section 377]] of the 150-year-old Indian Penal Code (IPC), a law passed by the colonial British authorities. However, this law was very rarely enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/11/india12399.htm Letter to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh On the arrest of four men on charges of homosexual conduct in Lucknow] letter by [[Scott Long]], director of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights Programme at [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;/ref&gt; In its ruling decriminalising homosexuality, the [[Delhi High Court]] noted that existed law conflicted with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the [[Constitution of India]], and such criminalising is violative of Articles 21, 14 and 15 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms |work=Times of India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427121918/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By state==

===Assam===

A Human Rights Watch report notes that journalists and human rights activists have been arrested for falsely reporting on human rights abuses. Assam continues to be one of the forefront states where the claims of human rights abuses have been committed by India. Resultant secessionist and pro-independence movements have intensified the political situation, with widespread allegations of human rights abuses being committed by Indian security forces yet without any concrete proofs for allegations.Freedom House stated in their 2013 report on India that journalists in rural areas and regions coping with insurgencies — including Assam — are vulnerable and face pressure from both sides of the conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Over-900-human-rights-violation-cases-pending/articleshow/52616112.cms|title=Over 900 human rights violation cases pending|date=Jun 6, 2016|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrdi.in/?p=2312|title=Record of Human Rights Violations in Assam|date=April 8, 2012|website=Human Rights Defence International (HRDI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punjab===
{{main|Human rights abuses in Punjab, India}}

From 1984 to 1994, the state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] in northern India was engaged in a power struggle between the militant secessionist [[Khalistan movement]] and Indian security forces.&lt;ref name="ENSAAF1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Punjab in Crisis: Human Rights in India|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1990|url=http://www.ensaaf.org/pdf/reports/HRW-PunjabinCrisis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government responded to the escalating [[Punjab insurgency]] by launching [[Operation Blue Star]] in 1984, storming the [[Harmandir Sahib]], or Golden Temple complex in [[Amritsar]]—the center of Sikh religious and spiritual life, where some militant groups had retreated. The Operation was controversial and resulted in death of hundreds of civilians, militants and soldiers. After this incident, [[Sikh]] bodyguards assassinated Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], further violence ensued.&lt;ref name="ENSAAF2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaur|first=Jaskaran|title=Twenty Years of Impunity: The November 1984 Pogroms of Sikhs in India|publisher=Ensaaf|year=2004|url=http://www.ensaaf.org/docs/20years.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aftermath of these events were felt for more than a decade.&lt;ref name="SBS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=transcript&amp;dte=2002-04-03&amp;headlineid=427 |title=India-Who Killed the Sikhs |date=4/3/2002 |publisher=Dateline |accessdate=2009-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912235435/http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=transcript&amp;dte=2002-04-03&amp;headlineid=427 |archivedate=12 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Human Rights Watch]] report, state security forces adopted “increasingly brutal methods to stem the insurgency, including arbitrary arrests, torture, prolonged detention without trial, [[forced disappearance|disappearances]] and summary killings of civilians and suspected militants”.&lt;ref name="ENSAAF1" /&gt; Militant organizations responded with increased violence aimed at civilians, state security forces, and Sikh political leaders deemed to be negotiating with the government.&lt;ref name="ENSAAF1" /&gt;

===Jammu and Kashmir===
{{main|Ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus|Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir}}
[[Image:Keeping Watch.jpg|thumb|left|A soldier guards the roadside checkpoint outside Srinagar International Airport in January 2006.]]

Several international agencies and the [[UN]] have reported human rights violations in [[Indian-administered Kashmir]]. In a press release the OHCHR spokesmen stated "The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is concerned about the recent violent protests in Indian-administered Kashmir that have reportedly led to civilian casualties as well as restrictions to the right to freedom of assembly and expression.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/1058F3E39F77ACE5C12574B2004E5CE3?opendocument "OHCHR calls for restraint in Indian-administered Kashmir"], Press release, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations, 27 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 [[Human Rights Watch]] report accuses the Indian military and Indian-government backed paramilitaries of "committ[ing] serious and widespread human rights violations in Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/05/01/india-s-secret-army-kashmir "India’s Secret Army in Kashmir: New Patterns of Abuse Emerge in the Conflict"], Human Rights Watch, 1 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
One such alleged massacre occurred on 6 January 1993 in the town of [[Sopore]]. The Human Rights Watch also wrote of other regular human rights abuses being committed by the Indian forces including "using rape as a means to punish and humiliate communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/INDIA935.PDF|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' described the incident as such: "In retaliation for the killing of one soldier, paramilitary forces rampaged through Sopore's market setting buildings ablaze and shooting bystanders. The Indian government pronounced the event 'unfortunate' and claimed that an ammunition dump had been hit by gunfire, setting off fires that killed most of the victims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,977469,00.html "Blood Tide Rising"], ''Time'', 18 January 1993. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, there have been claims of disappearances by the police or the army in Kashmir by several human rights organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78871.htm "India"], 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6367917.stm "Kashmir's extra-judicial killings"], ''BBC News'', 8 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many human rights organisations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) have condemned human rights abuses in Kashmir by Indians such as "extra-judicial executions", "disappearances", and torture;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kashmir/abuses.htm "Behind the Kashmir Conflict – Abuses in the Kashmir Valley"], Human Rights Watch, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act|Armed Forces Special Powers Act]]", (AFSPA) which "provides impunity for human rights abuses and fuels cycles of violence. The AFSPA grants the military wide powers of arrest, the right to shoot to kill, and to occupy or destroy property in counterinsurgency operations. Indian officials claim that troops need such powers because the army is only deployed when national security is at serious risk from armed combatants. Such circumstances, they say, call for extraordinary measures." Human rights organisations have also asked Indian government to repeal&lt;ref name=HRW-21Nov2007/&gt; the Public Safety Act, since "a detainee may be held in administrative detention for a maximum of two years without a court order.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/kashmir/judiciary.htm Behind the Kashmir Conflict: Undermining the Judiciary (Human Rights Watch Report: July 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; One 2008 report determined that [[Indian Administered Kashmir]], was 'partly Free',&lt;ref name=FH2008&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=487ca21996&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;query=Freedom%20in%20the%20World%202008-kashmir Freedom in the World 2008 – Kashmir (India)], [[Freedom House]], 2008-07-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Human Rights Violations==
Conflicts such as [[Anti-Bihari sentiment in India|Anti-Bihari sentiment]] have sometimes escalated to violence between communal groups, despite government and police efforts to mediate the situation.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Invasive methods like 'narcoanalysis' (controlled anaesthesia), [[Brain mapping]], and [[Polygraph|lie detector]] tests were once commonly permitted by Indian courts for crime investigation. Even though according to Indian constitution "nobody may be made a witness against himself".{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Concerns regarding human rights violations in conducting deception detection tests (DDT)s were raised long back and the [[National Human Rights Commission of India]] had published Guidelines in 2000 for the Administration of Polygraph tests. However, only few of the investigating agencies were seen to follow these guidelines.&lt;ref name="ddtreport"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3171915 | pmid=21808125 | volume=134 | title=Supreme Court judgment on polygraph, narcoanalysis &amp;amp; brain-mapping: a boon or a bane | year=2011 | journal=Indian J. Med. Res. | pages=4–7 | last1 = Math | first1 = SB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on May 5, 2010 the Supreme Court in India (Smt. Selvi vs. State of Karnataka) declared brain mapping, lie detector tests and narcoanalysis to be unconstitutional, violating Article 20 (3) of Fundamental Rights. These techniques cannot be conducted forcefully on any individual and requires consent for the same. When they are conducted with consent, the material so obtained is regarded as evidence during trial of cases according to Section 27 of the Evidence Act.&lt;ref name="ddtreport"/&gt;

Inadequate investigation and hasty rulings by courts have caused some [[Miscarriage of justice|wrongful convictions]] of innocent people causing them to languish in jail for many years. For instance, the Bombay high court in September 2009 asked the Maharashtra government to pay {{INR}} 100,000 as compensation to a 40-year-old man who languished in prison for over 10 years for a crime he didn't commit.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Muslim Woman’s Rights in India==
{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}
One of the vital concerns in [[India]] is the non-discrimination between genders.&lt;ref&gt;Syed Mehartaj Bejum Human Rights in India: Issues and Perspectives (2000, A.P.H. Publishing Corporation, New Delhi) at 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Muslim]] Woman in India are one of the major groups deprived of their equality within the [[Human rights]] framework.&lt;ref name="At 188"&gt;At 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their hardship has derived from cultural and religious reasons.&lt;ref name="At 188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="At 188"/&gt;  This includes being negatively stereotyped within [[religion]], incorporating both Muslim and even Judaic-Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name="At 188"/&gt;  This also includes male interpretations of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="At 188"/&gt;  Where the functions of a woman concerning family matters are seen as less than half, according to [[hijab]], then that of their male counterparts.&lt;ref name="At 190"&gt;At 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brief history of Muslim Law in India ===

[[Muslim law]] in South Asia is different from Islamic law of [[Shariat|Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;Vrinda Narain Gender and Community: Muslim Women’s Rights in India (2001, University of Toronto Press Incorporated, Canada) 2001 at 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shariat law (shari’a or fiqh) law is seen as a body of religious rules that are set out to manage the lives, in all aspects, of every Muslim.&lt;ref name="At 7"&gt;At 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in India there are only a few of these laws that are enforced.&lt;ref name="At 7"/&gt;  This is due to India's laws having been modified by traditional English [[common law]] and equitable principles since the beginning of the [[British imperialism|British imperialist]] regime.&lt;ref name="At 7"/&gt;  It is now called ''Anglo-Muhammadan law''.&lt;ref name="At 7"/&gt;  Although Islamic law is sacred, due to modern political and social developments sacred interpretation of classic Islamic law's in India have changed in response to societal requirements.&lt;ref name="At 7"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]] outlines the [[fundamental right|Fundamental rights in India]] to [[Social equality|equality]] under Article 14.&lt;ref name="At 36"&gt;At 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 15 covers freedom from [[discrimination]] which includes that of [[gender equality]]. However, Article 25 justifies the freedom of religion which safeguards the religious rights of Muslim communities, in turn [[Law of India|Muslim Personal Law]], which is discriminatory between Muslim men and woman.&lt;ref name="At 36"/&gt;  The continuance of discrimination within Muslim personal law contravenes that set out in India's constitution, notably articles 14 and 15.&lt;ref&gt;At 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal law and inequality ===

Even though there is formal recognition of rights within the constitution, Muslim women experience gender in-equalities in practice within the sphere of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;At 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal law enables the continuing practice of giving a lower status to Muslim women in India. Which raises the need for [[legal reform]].&lt;ref name="India 2000"&gt;Syed Mehartaj Bejum Human Rights in India: Issues and Perspectives (2000, A.P.H. Publishing Corporation, New Delhi) at 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is hard to achieve because often uniformity of family laws are often upheld by staunch supporters of religious traditions, who will ensure that all efforts to keep [[Sunni Islam|traditional Muslim]] practices within the conformity of Islamic ideals.&lt;ref name="At 190"/&gt;  The courts will also favor to not let constitutional rights intrude in personal law.&lt;ref&gt;Vrinda Narain Gender and Community: Muslim Women’s Rights in India (2001, University of Toronto Press Incorporated, Canada) 2001 at 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the High Court case ''Harvinder Kaur v. Harmander Singh Choudhary'', it was rejected that personal law was discriminatory towards [[Gender inequality in India]] and stated that the “…introduction of Constitutional law into the home is most inappropriate”.&lt;ref&gt;At 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially depriving all woman in India the fundamental rights within the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;At 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal law discrimination was on the other hand was positively recognized in the case of ''Amina'', here the court noted that Muslim personal law is discriminatory towards Muslim women, and as such is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;At 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic law]] does however provide for certain rights.&lt;ref name="India 2000"/&gt;  One example can be seen within a matrimonial deed, or ''Nikahnama''.&lt;ref name="At 190"/&gt;  A ''Nikahnama'' can cover certain rights which pertain to polygamy and the woman's right to enforce a divorce proceeding.&lt;ref name="At 190"/&gt;  This could even include shares in property rights.&lt;ref&gt;At 190&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslim law for financial support due to divorcement has been codified In the Muslim Women's (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Vrinda Narain Gender and Community: Muslim Women’s Rights in India (2001, University of Toronto Press Incorporated, Canada) 2001 at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;    Nevertheless, these rights remain minimal. For example, the divorced wife can only receive three months of financial support.&lt;ref name="At 28"&gt;At 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the husband of the divorced wife only has to pay child support for 3 months if that child is born within the three-month period, but if they had a child before that then the husband is not obligated to pay any support.&lt;ref name="At 28"/&gt;  Woman's rights in these matters are often not practiced due to Muslim women's lack of education toward their rights within the Islamic community.&lt;ref&gt;Syed Mehartaj Bejum Human Rights in India: Issues and Perspectives (2000, A.P.H. Publishing Corporation, New Delhi) at 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also Muslim woman in India are not protected when it comes to monogamous marriages, but Muslim men are, protected under the Indian Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;Vrinda Narain Gender and Community: Muslim Women’s Rights in India (2001, University of Toronto Press Incorporated, Canada) 2001 at 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Rights Commission [[Human rights commission|(HRC)]] under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|(ICPPR)]] highlighted religious based personal laws In India's report in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Syed Mehartaj Bejum Human Rights in India: Issues and Perspectives (2000, A.P.H. Publishing Corporation, New Delhi) at 191&lt;/ref&gt;  It was informed that the [[Human Rights]] framework towards [[multiculturalism]] should be a remedy when addressing clearly biased provisions and practices towards Muslim women in Islamic legal community.&lt;ref name="At 191"&gt;At 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muslim woman and Education ===

[[Muslim women]] are often discriminated against due to their lower achievements within the sphere of education, employment and their general economic position.&lt;ref name="At 191"/&gt;  This is because traditionally Muslim woman are discriminately excluded from participating within the public and private sector.&lt;ref name="At 191"/&gt;

{{Politics of Kyrgyzstan}}
'''Human rights in [[Kyrgyzstan]]''' improved after the ouster of [[President of Kyrgyzstan|President]] [[Askar Akayev]] in the 2005 [[Tulip Revolution]] and the installment of a more democratic government under [[Roza Otunbayeva]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The country now faces political uncertainty as it attempts to sustain a democratic system. [[Corruption in Kyrgyzstan|Corruption]] and instability continue to be noted, however.

Formerly a [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]], Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991. Remaining reasonably stable throughout most of the 1990s, the country's young democracy showed relative promise under the leadership of Akayev, but moved towards [[autocracy]] and [[authoritarianism]] by the early 2000s, achieving a 5.5 rating from Freedom House in 2000. 

In 2004, prior to the democratic revolution, Kyrgyzstan was rated by Freedom House as "Not Free," with a 6 in Political Rights and 5 in Civil Liberties (scale of 1-7; 1 is the highest). This indicated marked regression, from a 4.3 rating ten years earlier in 1994. Although the 1993 Constitution defines the Kyrgyz Republic as a democratic republic, President Askar Akayev continued to dominate the government. Serious irregularities reportedly marred 2003 a national constitutional referendum as well as presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000.

== History ==
On September 14, 2001 the Kyrgyz Ministry of Interior declared it had implemented "passport control regime" against "pro-Islamic" activists in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan. Following the reelection of President Askar Akayev in 2003, the government reportedly "intensified" harassment of political opposition members, independent [[news media]] groups, [[religious]] groups and [[ethnic minorities]], according to [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/september11/opportunismwatch.htm#Kyrgyzstan&lt;/ref&gt; In advance of elections in February 2005, the Akayev government reportedly increased political restrictions on Kyrgyz citizens, in order, according to some outside observers, to prevent a "democratic revolution" like the [[Orange Revolution|recent one in Ukraine]]. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/02/11/kyrgyz10167.htm] [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/02/11/kyrgyz10169.htm]

[[Human rights]] under Akayev's regime in 2004 reportedly remained poor; although there were improvements in several areas, problems remained. Citizens' right to change their government remained limited and democratic institutions remained fragile. Members of the security forces at times beat or otherwise mistreated persons, and prison conditions remained poor. Impunity remained a problem, although the Government took steps to address it during the year. There were cases of arbitrary arrest or detention. Executive branch domination of the judiciary as well as corruption limited citizens' right to due process. 

The Government occasionally restricted freedom of speech and of the press, and individuals and companies close to the Government used financial means to control numerous media outlets. The Government used bureaucratic means to harass and pressure some independent media as well as [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Although human rights groups were generally allowed to work freely, and a government Ombudsman's Office continued to work actively to advocate for individual rights, the Government continued to occasionally harass and pressure some groups. Violence against women and children was a problem. [[Child labor]] and discrimination against ethnic minorities were problems. [[Human trafficking|Trafficking]] in persons was a persistent problem.

In 2004 the government's human rights record showed improvement in some areas. Prison conditions remained poor but continued to improve during the year. Numerous [[MVD]] officials were dismissed or prosecuted for abuses or misconduct. Harassment of opposition groups and independent media, including honor and dignity lawsuits against newspapers, declined considerably, and the Government allowed several independent media outlets to begin operations. Although the Government occasionally restricted freedoms of assembly and association, in October, the Constitutional Court struck down provisions of the law on public assembly that were widely considered vague and too restrictive, while the number of demonstrations disrupted by police declined considerably. 

A new Electoral Code signed into law in January was a significant improvement over the previous code and was welcomed by domestic NGOs and opposition parties, although it still fell short of international standards. Citizens' right to choose their government showed some improvement through local elections held in October, which were widely seen as more transparent. The Government took steps to combat trafficking in persons, with prosecutions and convictions of traffickers up significantly from 2003. There has also been a long history of drug-trafficking in the country. This country has the death penalty for drug trafficking.

==Andijan incident==
In June 2005, Kyrgyz officials said that 29 Uzbek refugees who had fled to Kyrgyzstan in the wake of the [[Andijan massacre]] would be returned to Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062301852.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and human rights groups criticized this decision, stating the refugees faced possible torture or execution upon their return. However, on June 27, the 439 Uzbek refugees were airlifted to safety out of the country by the UN.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/update/2005/09/#uzbekistan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
A move to restrict [[freedom of assembly]] - the Law on the Right of Citizens to Hold Peaceful Assemblies 2002, adopted on June 13, 2008 by the government but yet to be signed by the President, was criticized by Human Rights Watch.  The law, if implemented, would go against two rulings by the [[Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan]], stating that the law is against the [[Constitution of Kyrgyzstan|constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/07/15/kyrgyz19360.htm Letter to the President of Kyrgyzstan on Restrictions of Peaceful Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a move that alarmed human rights groups, dozens of prominent Uzbek religious and community leaders were arrested by security forces following the [[Ethnic Violence in Southern Kyrgyzstan (2010)|2010 South Kyrgyzstan riots]], including journalist and human rights activist [[Azimzhan Askarov]].&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;{{cite news |title=Uzbeks Accused of Inciting Violence in Kyrgyzstan |author=Andrew E.

On May 18, 2011, the Kadamjay Regional Court sentenced two young men, Iskandar Kambarov (18 years old) and Jonibek Nosirov (22 years old) to seven years in prison on the charge of possessing two DVDs of an extremist Islamic organization. The two men are not Islamic but Jehovah’s Witnesses.  They have been held in police custody since their arrest on January 29, 2011.

{{Politics of New Zealand}}
'''Human rights in New Zealand''' are addressed in the various documents which make up the [[Constitution of New Zealand|constitution]]. Specifically, the two main laws which protect human rights are the [[New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993]] and the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="HRC about"&gt;{{cite web|title=What are human rights?|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/|publisher=The Human Rights Commission|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, New Zealand has also ratified numerous international [[United Nations]] treaties. The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that the government generally respected the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the [[Māori people|indigenous population]].&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eap/136003.htm|title=New Zealand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Universal suffrage for [[Māori people|Māori]] men over 21 was granted in 1867, and extended to European males in 1879.&lt;ref name="Māori and the Vote"&gt;{{cite web|title=Māori and the Vote|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/maori-vote.html|publisher=Elections.org.nz|accessdate=10 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208154827/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/maori-vote.html|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, New Zealand was the first self-governing nation to grant [[universal suffrage]];&lt;ref name="Byrnes, A, Connors, JF &amp; L Bik 1997 192"&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrnes, A, Connors, JF &amp; L Bik|title=Advancing the Human Rights of Women: Using International Human Rights Standards in Domestic Litigation|year=1997|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|isbn= 9780850925159|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, women were not eligible to stand for parliament until 1919.

A distinctive feature of New Zealand's electoral system is a form of special representation for Maori in parliament.  Initially considered a temporary solution on its creation in 1867, this separate system has survived debate as to its appropriateness and effectiveness.  Critics have described special representation as a form of apartheid.&lt;ref name="Māori and the Vote" /&gt;  In 1992, when the Royal Commission on the Electoral System recommended the abolishment of the separate system, strong representations from Maori organisations resulted in its survival.&lt;ref name="NZ History online"&gt;{{cite web|first1= |title=Change in the 20th century - Maori and the vote|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/twentieth-century|publisher=NZ History online|last1= Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights in New Zealand are addressed in the [[Constitution of New Zealand|constitution]]. In addition, New Zealand has also ratified numerous international treaties as part of the [[United Nations]]. The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that the government generally respected the rights of individuals, but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the [[Māori people|indigenous population]].&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"/&gt;

In May 2009, for the first time New Zealand prepared a [[Universal Periodic Review of New Zealand|national Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Human Rights Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=NZs National Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Report|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/human-rights/our-work/universal-periodic-review/|publisher=Human Rights Commission|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this peer review process many countries praised New Zealand's human rights record and identified that the perception of New Zealand as a comparatively fair and equal society is crucial to its international reputation.  Areas where the nation was directed to make improvements include disparities experienced by Maori as demonstrated by key social and economic indicators and the extent of family violence and violence against women and children.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Gilbert|title=NZ makes clear stand for human rights at UN|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/home/hrc/newsandissues/nzmakesclearstandforhumanrightsatun.php|publisher=Human Rights Commission|accessdate=11 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124201953/http://www.hrc.co.nz/home/hrc/newsandissues/nzmakesclearstandforhumanrightsatun.php|archivedate=24 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International treaties==
[[File:Helen Clark and John Key-3, UNDP.jpg|thumb|[[John Key]] and [[Helen Clark]] at the [[UNDP]] headquarters.]]
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
Having joined the United Nations in 1945, New Zealand has ratified seven of the nine core key human rights treaties, namely [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|ICERD]], [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]], [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]], [[CEDAW]], [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]], [[Convention Against Torture|CAT]] and [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|CRPD]].&lt;ref name="UNTC"&gt;, [http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Treaties.aspx?id=4&amp;subid=A&amp;lang=en UN Treaty Collection: New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 New Zealand was seeking a position on the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]].  The bid was withdrawn in March of that year to allow a clear path for the United States to win the seat, after [[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] reversed his country's previous position that the council had lost its credibility.  Then New Zealand [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Foreign Minister]] [[Murray McCully]] stated "We believe that US membership of the council will strengthen it and make it more effective... By any objective measure, membership of the council by the US is more likely to create positive changes more quickly than we could have hoped to achieve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=DPA|title=New Zealand drops Human Rights Council bid, steps aside for US|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/262420,new-zealand-drops-human-rights-council-bid-steps-aside-for-us.html|publisher=Top News|last= Sahil Nagpal|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal system==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
The legal system takes the framework of a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]].  In the absence of a [[Uncodified constitution|single constitution]], various legislative documents such as the [[Constitution Act 1986]], [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988]], [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] and the [[Human Rights Act 1993]] have been implemented to cover such areas.

Human rights in New Zealand have never been protected by any single constitutional document or legislation, and no single institution has been primarily responsible for enforcement. Because New Zealand's human rights obligations are not entrenched and are simply part of common law, Parliament can simply ignore them if it chooses. The [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] has identified this constitutional arrangement as an area in need of action to identify opportunities for giving greater effect to human rights protections.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Review 2010"&gt;{{citation|title=Human Rights in New Zealand 2010|publisher=Human Rights Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Section 7 reports ===
Section 7 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]] requires the Attorney-General to draw to the attention of Parliament the introduction of any Bill that is inconsistent with the Act. The Ministry of Justice, which prepares this advice for the Attorney-General, requires a minimum of two weeks to review the draft legislation. Here is a list of bills reported by the Attorney General as being [[Bills reported as inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]] 1990.

=== Different perspectives ===
The 2009 report by the U.S. Department of State noted that, "[t]he law provides for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence in practice".&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"/&gt; In recent years concerns have been expressed that New Zealand is not performing as well in regard to human rights as it used to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/270199/nz-slipping-in-human-rights-issues-report NZ slipping in human rights issues - report], Radio New Zealand, 2 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A study released in 2015, ''Fault Lines: Human rights in New Zealand'' said New Zealand's human rights legislation - the Bill of Rights Act and the Human Rights Act - "were problematic and didn't prevent the passing of other laws, which breach rights".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11426982 New Zealand's human rights performance slipping], New Zealand Herald, 2 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil liberties ==

===Freedom of speech===
The right to [[freedom of speech]] is not explicitly protected by [[common law]] in New Zealand but is encompassed in a wide range of doctrines aimed at protecting free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Butler and [[Petra Butler]] The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act: a commentary (LexisNexis NZ Ltd, Wellington, 2005) at 305&lt;/ref&gt; An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41654.htm|title=New Zealand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, freedom of expression is preserved in section 14 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (BORA) which states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive, and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This provision reflects the more detailed one in Article 19 of the ICCPR. The significance of this right and its importance to democracy has been emphasised by the New Zealand courts. It has been described as the primary right without which the [[rule of law]] cannot effectively operate.&lt;ref&gt;R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 at p125&lt;/ref&gt; The right is not only the cornerstone of democracy; it also guarantees the self-fulfilment of its members by advancing knowledge and revealing truth.&lt;ref&gt;A Bill of Rights for New Zealand: A White Paper (New Zealand Parliament House of Representatives) 1985. AJHR. 6 , p 79.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the right has been given a wide interpretation. The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] has said that section 14 is "as wide as human thought and imagination".&lt;ref&gt;Moonen v Film and Literature Board of Review [2000] 2 NZLR 9 para 15&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of expression embraces free speech, a free press, transmission and receipt of ideas and information, freedom of expression in art, and the [[right to silence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter08/expression01.html|title=NZ Human Rights - Human Rights Commission|website=www.hrc.co.nz|access-date=2011-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329054301/http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter08/expression01.html#|archive-date=2012-03-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to freedom of expression also extends to the right to seek access to official records. This is provided for in the [[Official Information Act 1982]].

====Limitations====

There are limitations on this right, as with all other rights contained in BORA.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be in society's interests to allow freedom of expression to become a licence irresponsibly to ignore or discount other rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Tipping J in Hosking v Runting [2005] 1 NZLR 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under article 19(3) ICCPR, freedom of expression can be limited in order to:
* respect the rights and reputations of others; and
* protect national security, public order, or public health and morals.
Jurisprudence under BORA closely follows these grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Butler and Petra Butler The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act: a commentary (LexisNexis NZ Ltd, Wellington, 2005) at 323&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of expression is restricted only so far as is necessary to protect a countervailing right or interest.&lt;ref&gt;Police v Geiringer [1990-1992] 1 NZBORR 331&lt;/ref&gt; The Court of Appeal has held that the restriction on free speech must be proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved; the restriction must be rationally connected to the objective; and the restriction must impair the right to freedom to the least possible amount.&lt;ref&gt;Moonen v Film and Literature Board of Review [2000] 2 NZLR 9&lt;/ref&gt; 
The right to freedom of expression may also be limited by societal values which are not in BORA, such as the [[privacy law|right to privacy]] and the right to reputation.

[[Hate speech]] is prohibited in New Zealand under the Human Rights Act 1993 under sections 61 and 131. These sections give effect to article 20 ICCPR. These sections and their predecessors have rarely been used.&lt;ref name="hrc.co.nz"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter08/expression02.html#hat |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123832/http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter08/expression02.html#hat#hat |archive-date=2012-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They require the consent of the [[Attorney-General]] to prosecute.  Incitement to racial disharmony has been a criminal offence since the enactment of the [[Race Relations Act 1971]]. Complaints about racial disharmony often concern statements made publicly about Maori-[[Pakeha]] relations and immigration, and comments made by politicians or other public figures regarding minority communities.&lt;ref name="hrc.co.nz"/&gt;

[[Blasphemy law in New Zealand|Blasphemous libel is a crime in New Zealand]] under the [[Crimes Act 1961]].

====Freedom of the media====

[[Freedom of the press|Freedom of the media]] is also recognised as an important democratic principle. New Zealand is ranked eighth on the [[Press Freedom Index]] 2010 and there tends to be strong legal, public and media comment where this right is infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/hrc_new/hrc/cms/files/documents/Human_Rights_Review_2010_Full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707184724/http://www.hrc.co.nz/hrc_new/hrc/cms/files/documents/Human_Rights_Review_2010_Full.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 68 of the [[Evidence Act 2006]] provides a [[qualified privilege|qualified form of privilege]] for journalists who wish to protect the identity of their sources. The Court of Appeal has also laid down guidelines for the police when searching media premises for law enforcement reasons, so that their sources remain protected.&lt;ref&gt;TVNZ Ltd v Attorney-General [1995] 2 NZLR 641&lt;/ref&gt;

The Courts may order that publication of information be withheld in whole or part, in the interests of justice. Often this is to protect the [[right to a fair trial]], to protect the interests of the parties, or to uphold public confidence in the integrity of the justice system. It is not uncommon for New Zealand Courts to [[gag order|suppress names]] and evidence in civil and criminal proceedings so as to protect the right to a fair trial.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Television New Zealand Ltd v Solicitor-General [1989] 1 NZLR 1 (CA) at 3&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The law of New Zealand must recognise that in cases where the commencement of criminal proceedings is highly likely the Court has inherent jurisdiction to prevent the risk of contempt of Court by granting an injunction. But the freedom of the press and other media is not to be interfered with lightly and it must be shown that there is a real likelihood of a publication of material that will seriously prejudice the fairness of the trial".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Broadcasting Act 1989]] is a statute limiting the media’s right to freedom of expression. Broadcasters have a responsibility to maintain programme standards that are consistent with: the observation of good taste and decency, the maintenance of law and order, the privacy of the individual, the principle of balance when controversial issues of public importance are discussed, and approved code of broadcasting practice applying to programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter08/expression04.html#med |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516124427/http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter08/expression04.html#med#med |archive-date=2012-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcasting Standards Authority is a [[Crown entity]] that hears complaints from the public where codes of practice have been breached. Print news media are self-regulated through the [[New Zealand Press Council|Press Council]].

===Right to a fair trial===
A [[fair trial]] in New Zealand has been defined as "a court hearing that is procedurally just to both parties";&lt;ref&gt;Peter Spiller Butterworths New Zealand Dictionary (7th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2011) at 113.&lt;/ref&gt; it is all encompassing for every citizen in New Zealand, and is pinnacle in the functionality of the justice system. The area this civil and criminal right has the most influence in is criminal procedures,&lt;ref&gt;Seen through the large focus in the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/DLM3359962.html Criminal Procedure Act 2011], and the [http://icj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/trial-observation-manual-Human-Rights-Rule-of-Law-series-2009-eng.pdf ICJ’s Trial Observation Manual of Criminal Proceedings (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;  however it still holds great influence in other realms of New Zealand law, such as administration law (due to the use of the Rule of Law). This essential right has been in practice from the early beginnings of New Zealand due to the continuation of English Law during its colonisation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to develop over the years with the international community.

====Magna Carta====

The [[Magna Carta]] (1215) is seen as one of the earlier instruments to clearly set out the rights to a fair trial to all free men. It is applicable to New Zealand law due to it being listed in the [[Imperial Laws Application Act 1988]], which allows a handful of English Statutes to be legally binding.

The important clause is Clause 39:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/treasures/magnacarta/translation/mc_trans.html|title=Treasures in full: Magna Carta|website=www.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was found to have paved the way for trial by jury, equality before the law, habeas corpus and a ban on arbitrary imprisonment; all rights that are within the shadow of the right to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.co.uk/law/government/constitutional_law/fundamental_rights/500299.html|title=Fair Trial from a UK perspective|publisher=|access-date=2014-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506080727/http://www.findlaw.co.uk/law/government/constitutional_law/fundamental_rights/500299.html#|archive-date=2014-05-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule of law====

The [[rule of law]], found in every democratic society including New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;Found through the use of it in legislation, such as the Supreme Court Act 2003, s3(2).&lt;/ref&gt; is essentially the authority the law has on every citizen, regardless of their status. It has been defined as a doctrine that holds the law above all citizens in an equal manner, and even government officials are accountable to the ordinary courts of law.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Spiller Butterworths New Zealand Dictionary (7th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2011) at 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of law is a source of the right to a fair trial, as the doctrine protects the process of the court and national equality when considering the application of the law.&lt;ref&gt;BNZ v Savril Contractors Ltd [2005] 2 NZLR 475 (CA).&lt;/ref&gt;

====International covenants recognised by New Zealand====

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] is the main international treaty which lays out the right to a fair trial. Article 14(1) says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New Zealand has also made a commitment to uphold the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and support the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and has put in place the Human Rights Commission (Te Kahui Tangata) to ensure this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/universal-declaration-of-human-rights|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights - New Zealand and the United Nations - NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=www.nzhistory.net.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the right to a fair trial, article 10 of the UDHR states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990=====
It is thought that New Zealand passed the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]] to fulfil its obligations to the International Convention of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), as a state party, section 25 of this Act essential replicates Article 14 of the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gullivan "Reliability, Hearsay and the Right to a Fair Trial in New Zealand" in P Roberts and J Hunter (ed) Criminal Evidence and Human Rights (Hart Publishing Ltd, Oxford, 2012) at 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Section 25 Minimum of Criminal Procedure
Everyone who is charged with an offence has, in relation to the determination of the charge, the following minimum rights:
(a)the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial court:
(b)the right to be tried without undue delay:
(c)the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law:
(d)the right not to be compelled to be a witness or to confess guilt:
(e)the right to be present at the trial and to present a defence:
(f)the right to examine the witnesses for the prosecution and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses for the defence under the same conditions as the prosecution:
(g)the right, if convicted of an offence in respect of which the penalty has been varied between the commission of the offence and sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser penalty:
(h)the right, if convicted of the offence, to appeal according to law to a higher court against the conviction or against the sentence or against both:
(i)the right, in the case of a child, to be dealt with in a manner that takes account of the child's age.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Criminal Procedure Act 2011=====
Although the Criminal Procedure Act 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0081/latest/DLM3359962.html|title=Criminal Procedure Act 2011 No 81 (as at 01 July 2018), Public Act Contents – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not initially set out the right to a fair trial, it can however be seen that the right to a fair trial is the key reason behind particular actions.

The following table lists some of the sections, where the right to a fair trial is essential for the courts to consider.

====Right to a fair trial and the media====
Aside from the limits of sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill of Rights, and New Zealand’s "unwritten" constitution, other rights may impede on the right to a fair trial where one right can overrule another. The best example is the relationship between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial. These two rights are always conflicting, due to the nature of the media.

In New Zealand, there is a focus on finding a balance between the contrasting rights; courts focus on a balance between one person’s right and another’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/uploads/Contempt.pdf|title=Crown Law Office "Contempt and the Media: Constitutional Safeguard or State Censorship" (1 January 1998)|publisher=|access-date=2014-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802065239/http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/uploads/Contempt.pdf#|archive-date=2014-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is nothing expressly stating a hierarchy of rights, the court does in fact have the ability to limit one right so as to uphold another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand there is full recognition of the importance of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Solicitor-General v Avon Ltd [1978] 1 NZLR 225, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been seen in numerous occasions, court have upheld the right to a fair trial over the freedom of speech through media.

It has been said that in the event of a conflict, if all other things are equal between the two rights, the right to fair trial should prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Solicitor-General v Wellington Newspaper Ltd [1995] 1 NZLR 45.&lt;/ref&gt; However it has been argued that greater tolerance should be given to freedom of speech when the issue involves something of "substantial public interest".&lt;ref&gt;J F Borrows in "Freedom of the Press under the NZBORA" in Joseph: Essays on the Constitution (1995) 286 at 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the freedom of the press and of speech is not a right to be lightly interfered with, and when interference happens it must be seen as a justified limitation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; but also, if publication was to occur regarding the case, serious prejudice would arise.&lt;ref&gt;Solicitor-General v TVNZ [1989] 1 NZLR (CA).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of religion===
Freedom of religion is addressed specifically in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and the government has generally respected this in practice.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"/&gt;

=== Political rights ===
New Zealand is a [[parliamentary democracy]], and as such acquires rights generally associated with such a system. Democratic rights include electoral rights, the right for citizens to take part (directly or indirectly) in government, and the right to equal access to the public service. There is an associated duty of responsible citizenship, or being willing to play one’s part in public affairs and to respect the rights and freedoms of others. These rights give the ability to participate in both public and political life when considered together.&lt;ref name="HRC report human rights today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter06/democratic01.html|title=Human Rights Commission of New Zealand 'Human Rights in New Zealand today'|publisher=|access-date=2011-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108080905/http://www.hrc.co.nz/report/chapters/chapter06/democratic01.html#|archive-date=2012-01-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitution====
Political and democratic rights are purported to be upheld by the ‘unwritten’ [[Constitution of New Zealand]]. One of the many sources that make up the constitution is the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. This legislation was the first aspect of the New Zealand constitution to specially refer to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) with the rights contained within. Together with the [[New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993]], these two statutes make up a basis for Human Rights protection in New Zealand. They were not incorporated directly into the legal system, however many of the rights within the ICCPR were replicated in the Bill of Rights Act 1990. These include electoral rights under section 12, and freedom of association under section 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM224792.html|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act Contents – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Act 1993 also concerns non-discrimination based on political opinion under section 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0082/latest/DLM304475.html|title=Human Rights Act 1993 No 82 (as at 28 September 2017), Public Act 21 Prohibited grounds of discrimination – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been concern expressed that due to the nature of the New Zealand constitution, and the lack of full integration into the legal system, rights under the ICCPR are not sufficiently protected.&lt;ref name="Civil and political rights in New Zealand"&gt;[http://www.elections.org.nz/maori/ntkm-democracy/rights-in-nz.html Elections New Zealand website 'Civil and political rights in New Zealand'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805162711/http://www.elections.org.nz/maori/ntkm-democracy/rights-in-nz.html |date=2011-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bill of Rights Act 1990 is not [[entrenched legislation]], and this means that it can effectively be overturned by a simple majority in Parliament.  A counter to this concern is that rights do exist in the New Zealand constitution regardless; however it is the finding of them that is the difficult part.

====Electoral rights====
Electoral rights include the right to vote in Members of Parliament, and the right to run for the House of Representatives. This is done by way of a [[secret ballot]], and there is [[universal suffrage]], with voting rights given to both men and women of the age 18 and over who are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents.&lt;ref name="Civil and political rights in New Zealand" /&gt; [[Freedom of association]] allows people to join with other individuals into groups that express, promote, pursue and defend common interests collectively. The Electoral Act 1993 is also important because it is one of the few ‘constitutional’ documents to contain entrenched provisions.&lt;ref name="Civil and political rights in New Zealand" /&gt;

These maintain the rights to voting and the size of the electorates which represent 'the people'. In the New Zealand context, entrenching provisions is one of the most effective ways to protect rights, as there is no possibility of total protection due to the doctrine of [[Parliamentary Sovereignty]]. However entrenching provisions would appear to indicate intent to protect rights. Section 6 of the Bill of Rights Act provides for judicial interpretation in favour of right-protecting interests, which allows judges to interpret around provisions in other legislation that may appear to impede human rights.&lt;ref name="Civil and political rights in New Zealand" /&gt;

This in itself had opposition, with arguments that allowing such a provision to exist undermines the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty and impinged on the political rights of citizens as it allowed un-elected and non-representative judges to interpret rights somewhat at their discretion.&lt;ref name="Civil and political rights in New Zealand" /&gt; The universality of rights under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] would then be threatened also under this critique, as those who could afford good lawyers would then be at a greater advantage. Whether this is true in practice has not been proven, however it was one of the biggest points of opposition to the Bill of Rights Act prior to its inception.&lt;ref name="Civil and political rights in New Zealand" /&gt;

====New Zealand context====
The ICCPR also contains statements on all peoples having a right to [[self-determination]]. Part of this right to self-determination is the right to determine political status freely. International human rights standards recognise that democratic and political rights require the protection of a range of other rights and freedoms, including the right to justice, freedom of expression, the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association contained in the ICCPR. They must also be enjoyed without discrimination. This is stated in the ICCPR (as well as the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]]) (CEDAW) and the [[Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD). Both CEDAW and CERD provide with specificity that the State should take steps to ensure the equal representation and participation of women, and of all ethnic and racial groups, in political processes and institutions (Article 7 of CEDAW and Article 5c of CERD).&lt;ref name="HRC report human rights today" /&gt;

New Zealand portrays a system by which these political rights are maintained. Equal possibility for representation exists for any citizen, regardless of gender or race. In this respect, the democratic rights standard under the ICCPR (and other UN conventions) is fulfilled with women and minority groups being able to vote, and be elected to Parliament. For example, New Zealand has female Members of Parliament, as well as those in the Maori, Pacific Islander, Asian, homosexual and Muslim minorities. Maori political rights are further protected by giving Maori people the option to be on the General or Maori electoral roll, and by having reserved seats in the House of Representatives. This formula in turn projects the number of Maori electorates, General electorates and thus party list seats under the [[Mixed member proportional representation]] electoral system.

Citizens are also given a further ability to participate in the system and exercise some democratic rights by way of ‘citizen initiated referenda’(or [[Initiative|citizen initiative]]).  However these are not binding on Parliament and as such do not necessarily have a large degree of influence. It does however provide for assistance on public opinion for policy makers, and results can be taken into consideration when formulating Bills at various stages.&lt;ref name="HRC report human rights today" /&gt; 

Political and democratic rights are also protected under the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], one of New Zealand's founding documents and a source of law under the unwritten constitution. Article 1 of the Treaty infers the right to govern in New Zealand being the basis for the [[Westminster system]] of government. The rights of Maori to govern their own affairs where necessary is inferred by Article 2, and the extent to which all New Zealanders are proportionately represented in the institutions of the State, and which New Zealanders participate in political processes such as voting is covered by Article 3.&lt;ref name="HRC report human rights today" /&gt;

====Framework for political rights protection====
Human rights and democracy are internationally recognised as interdependent and provide a framework for assessing the extent to which democratic rights are respected in law and practice.&lt;ref name="Beetham, D. 2002"&gt;Beetham, D. (2002). Democracy and human rights: Contrast and convergence. Seminar on the Interdependence between Democracy and Human Rights, Conference papers. Geneva: Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt; According to this framework, there are two key democratic principles. The principle of popular control is the right to a controlling influence over public decisions and decision-makers. The principle of political equality is the right to be treated with equal respect and as of equal worth in the context of such decisions.&lt;ref name="Beetham, D. 2002"/&gt;

Recognition of the above principles requires a framework for guaranteed citizens' rights, a system of representative and accountable political institutions subject to popular authorisation, and active channeling of popular opinion and engagement with government by the people.&lt;ref name="Beetham, D. 2002"/&gt; Under this model, New Zealand recognises the political rights of its citizens in both law and practice. It does so by way of the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]], which provides a framework within the legal and political system; the ability to communicate and participate in the political system, and processes such as [[judicial review]] and complaints to the [[Office of the Ombudsman]] hold government and governmental departments accountable where necessary in order to maintain political rights.

==Economic, social and cultural rights==

''See generally:'' [[Economic, social and cultural rights]]

On 28 December 1978 New Zealand ratified the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/international-covenant-on-economic-social-and-cultural-rights/international-covenant-on-economic-social-and-cultural-rights|title=Constitutional issues &amp; human rights - New Zealand Ministry of Justice|website=www.justice.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other international treaties which contain provisions concerning economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) have also been ratified by New Zealand, such as the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD), the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) and the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/Treaty.aspx?CountryID=124&amp;Lang=EN|title=Treaty bodies Treaties|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ESCR are not specifically protected by New Zealand's human rights focused statutes, the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] or the [[Human Rights Act 1993]].&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard "Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground" [2013] NZLJ 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 is predominantly concerned  with the protection of civil and political rights.&lt;ref name="Reclaiming Economic 1993"&gt;Paul Hunt "Reclaiming Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1993) 1 Waikato L Rev 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Including ESCR in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 was suggested by the parliamentary Justice and Law Reform Select Committee in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report of the Justice and Law Reform Committee on a White Paper on a Bill of Rights for New Zealand'' (1988) 1.8C, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and was rejected by the Government.&lt;ref name="Reclaiming Economic 1993"/&gt; 

Currently, ESCR are not considered justiciable in New Zealand because they affect policy and resource allocation considerations, matters for the New Zealand Government and Parliament to decide.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the New Zealand High Court decision of ''Lawson v Housing New Zealand'' [1997] 2 NZLR 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of various ESCR are protected by domestic legislation though.&lt;ref name="Including Economic 2012"&gt;Joss Opie "A Case for Including Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990" (2012) 43 VUWLR 471 at 482.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand has not ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name="justice.govt.nz"/&gt;

===The right to an adequate standard of living===

''See generally:'' [[Right to an adequate standard of living]]

The right to an adequate standard of living comprises other ESCR, such as the rights to food, water and housing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hosking "Freedom from Poverty: The Right to an Adequate Standard of Living" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 112 at 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food====
''See generally:'' [[Right to food]]

Though New Zealand does not face the levels of poverty exhibited in developing countries, it is generally recognised that [[Poverty threshold|relative poverty]] does exist in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hosking "Freedom from Poverty: The Right to an Adequate Standard of Living" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 112 at 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Relative poverty occurs when members of a society fall below the living standards which prevail in the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/poverty/|title=Poverty - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2013 260,000 dependent children, aged from 0 to 17 years, lived in relative poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzchildren.co.nz/document_downloads/2014%20Child%20Poverty%20Monitor%20Technical%20Report.pdf NZ Child &amp; Youth Epidemiology Service 'Child Poverty Monitor 2014 Technical Report'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603162058/http://www.nzchildren.co.nz/document_downloads/2014%20Child%20Poverty%20Monitor%20Technical%20Report.pdf# |date=2015-06-03 }} at 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The realisation of the right to food has been aided by New Zealand charities.  In the year 2013-2014, [[The Salvation Army]] provided 27,879 families with food parcels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/sites/default/files/uploads/20141219-The-Salvation-Army-Annual-Report-2013-14.pdf The Salvation Army New Zealand, Fiji &amp; Tonga Territory 'The Salvation Army Annual Report 2013-2014'] at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[KidsCan]] currently provides meals for 15,065 children per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidscan.org.nz/our-work/food-for-kids|title=Food for Kids - KidsCan|website=www.kidscan.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bill was introduced into the [[New Zealand Parliament]] in November 2012 to amend the Education Act 1989 to enable State-funded breakfast and lunch meals to be provided to students attending decile 1 and 2 schools, but it did not proceed beyond its first reading in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL11882_1/education-breakfast-and-lunch-programmes-in-schools-amendment|title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill - New Zealand Parliament|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water====
{{See|Water in New Zealand}}

Advocacy concerning the right to water in New Zealand is centred upon the privatisation of the supply of water to households and opposing a 'user pay' approach to water consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hosking "Freedom from Poverty: The Right to an Adequate Standard of Living" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 112 at 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local government in New Zealand|Local government]] organisations that provide water services to communities are required to maintain their capacity to meet obligations such as retaining ownership and control of water services in their district/region.&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act 2002, section 130.&lt;/ref&gt; A local government organisation is allowed to enter into contracts concerning any aspect of providing water services, but they will remain legally responsible to provide such services and develop policy on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Act 2002, section 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2015 the [[New Zealand Māori Council]] proposed the allocation of water rights be administered through a national water policy and an associated commission.&lt;ref name="radionz.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/264037/moves-to-reassure-public-over-water-rights|title=Moves to reassure public over water rights|date=20 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's co-chair, Sir [[Eddie Durie]], stated Māori have a 'senior right' to water in New Zealand, but their rights should not override what is good for the general public.&lt;ref name="radionz.co.nz"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]] stated in 2012 there was increasing concern in New Zealand over the quality of drinking water, the effects of the agricultural industries' consumption of water, [[Treaty of Waitangi]] considerations regarding rights to and ownership of water, and access to water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/files/5314/2398/4129/Human-Rights-and-Water-2012.pdf Human Rights Commission 'Human Rights and Water' 2012], at 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Housing====

''See generally:'' [[Right to housing]]

Discrimination in housing is contrary to the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]], the Human Rights Act 1993 and the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrc.co.nz/files/6414/2428/1599/HRC-Earthquake-Report-2013-final-for-web.pdf Human Rights Commission 'Monitoring Human Rights in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery' 2013], at 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Housing affordability in regards to both the rental market and the property market is a social issue in New Zealand which has made access to  housing difficult for even middle-class families&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hosking "Freedom from Poverty: The Right to an Adequate Standard of Living" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 112 at 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Lawson v Housing New Zealand'', the applicant challenged the increase in rent to market levels for [[state housing]] provided by [[Housing New Zealand]], (a [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprise]]), because it had adverse effects on the living standards of existing state housing tenants.&lt;ref&gt;''Lawson v Housing New Zealand'' [1997] 2 NZLR 474.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because the right to housing is not specifically incorporated into domestic legislation the Court rejected considering whether the Government had met its international obligations concerning this right, and said it was instead a matter on which international forums could judge the Government.&lt;ref&gt;''Lawson v Housing New Zealand'' [1997] 2 NZLR 474 at 498-499.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]] stated in Christchurch, due to the loss of housing in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|2010]] and [[2011 Canterbury earthquake]]s, there was a shortfall of 7,100 homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbh.govt.nz/UserFiles/File/Publications/Sector/pdf/christchurch-housing-report.pdf Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 'Housing pressures in Christchurch: A Summary of the Evidence/2013'], at 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Commission stated in December 2013 that there was a shortage of rental, temporary and emergency accommodation in Christchurch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrc.co.nz/files/6414/2428/1599/HRC-Earthquake-Report-2013-final-for-web.pdf Human Rights Commission 'Monitoring Human Rights in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery' 2013],  at 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Auckland Housing Accord is currently being implemented by the [[Auckland Council]] and central Government in order to hasten and increase the number of affordable houses built in Auckland, to combat the housing crisis affecting the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/en/ratesbuildingproperty/housingsupply/pages/aucklandhousingaccord.aspx|title=Housing supply and special housing areas|first=Auckland|last=Council|website=Auckland Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right to health===

''See generally:'' [[Right to health]]

There is no explicit right to health in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Kris Gledhill 2011"&gt;Sylvia Bell "The Right to Health" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 90 at 94.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a statutory framework which has been implemented over several decades which provides for the administration of health care and services.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Bell "The Right Health" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 90 at 94.&lt;/ref&gt; This framework includes the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001, the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 and the Heath Act 1956. The Accident Compensation Act 2001 also provides no-fault insurance cover for personal injuries, administered by the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Bell "The Right to Health" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 90 at 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 also protects the right to health through the right not to be subjected to medical or scientific experimentation, the right to refuse medical treatment and the right to freedom from discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, sections 10, 11 and 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A publicly funded health system exists in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Kris Gledhill 2011"/&gt; [[District health board|District Health Boards]] decide what health services are to be funded in their region, based on national objectives and the specific needs of their locality, but this process has been criticised by commentators who claim it is not open and objective.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Morgan (economist)|Gareth Morgan]], [[Geoff Simmons]] and John McCrystal ''Health Cheque: The Truth We Should All Know about New Zealand's Public Health System'' (Public Interest Publishing, Auckland, 2009) at 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The limited resources of the system were highlighted in ''Shortland v Northland Health Ltd'', where a decision by medical professionals to discontinue a patient's dialysis treatment for resource allocation reasons was upheld, even though continued treatment would have saved the patients life.&lt;ref&gt;''Shortland v Northland Health Ltd'' [1998] 1 NZLR 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer health outcomes for Māori and Pasifika people continue to persist.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Bell "The Right to Health" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 90 at 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right to education===
{{See|Education in New Zealand}}

The right to education is not expressly provided for in New Zealand domestic law, but the realisation of the right can be seen across various statutes, policies and administrative practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrc.co.nz/files/7014/2388/0544/Human_Rights_Review_2010_Full.pdf Human Rights Commission 'Human Rights in New Zealand 2010'], at 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Such statutes include the Education Act 1989, the Education Standards Act 2001 and the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975. From the ages of 5 years to 18 years, a person has the right to free primary and secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1989, section 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This right extends to people who have special educational needs.&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1989, section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Citizens and residents of New Zealand must be enrolled at a registered school from their 6th birthday until their 16th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1989, section 20(1).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 95.9% of new school entrants had participated in early childhood education in the six months prior to starting primary school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/nz-social-indicators/Home/Education/particip-ece.aspx Statistics New Zealand 'Participation in early childhood education'].&lt;/ref&gt; 78.6% of 18-year-olds in 2013 had the equivalent of an [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] Level 2 qualification or higher.&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/nz-social-indicators/Home/Education/18-year-olds-with-higher-qualif.aspx Statistics New Zealand '18-year-olds with higher qualifications'].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number of Māori and Pasifika students leaving school with a [[National Qualifications Framework]] qualification has increased from 2004 levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrc.co.nz/files/7014/2388/0544/Human_Rights_Review_2010_Full.pdf Human Rights Commission 'Human Rights in New Zealand 2010'], at 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of 18-year-old Māori and Pasifika people with an NCEA Level 2 equivalent qualification or higher was less than that of European or Asian students in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"/&gt; In 2008 the Secretary of the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]] acknowledged the link between economic and social factors and educational achievement, and that efforts to ensure that socio-economically disadvantaged children remained engaged in education needed to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/41663/State-of-Education-2008-Full-Report.pdf Ministry of Education 'State of Education in New Zealand 2008], at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right to work===

Elements of the right to work and the right to the enjoyment of just and favourable work conditions are protected by the Minimum Wage Act 1983, the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992, the [[Employment Relations Act 2000]] and the [[Holidays Act 2003]].&lt;ref name="Including Economic 2012"/&gt; New Zealand has ratified 60 of the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organization's]] Conventions, with 51 in force and 9 having been denounced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11200:0::NO::P11200_COUNTRY_ID:102775 International Labour Organization 'Ratifications for New Zealand'].&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination in regards to accessing employment is prohibited on the grounds of age (from 16 years), colour, [[Disability rights in New Zealand|disability]], employment status, ethnic belief, ethnic or national origin, family status, marital status, political opinion, race, religious belief, sex (including childbirth and pregnancy) and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act 1993, section 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Ministry of Health v Atkinson'', the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] held the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health's]] policy that family members who provide support services for their disabled children were ineligible to be paid for such work was discriminatory on the basis of family status.&lt;ref&gt;''Ministry of Health v Atkinson'' [2012] 3 NZLR 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was overturned by the Public Health and Disability Amendment Act 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard "Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground" [2013] NZLJ 289 at 291&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Commission states the country is making some progress in regards to the role of women in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/files/2314/2360/5171/web-census.pdf Human Rights Commission 'New Zealand Consensus of Women's Participation 2012'], at 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Women remain underrepresented in areas of public life such as law, governance and corporate sector leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Reilly "The Right to Work and Rights at Work" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 71 at 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The gender pay gap in 2014 was 9.9 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.govt.nz/our-work/economic-independence/income/gender-pay-gap Ministry for Women 'Gender pay gap'].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Employment Relations Act 2000 was amended to restrict workers' entitlements to paid breaks.&lt;ref&gt;Employment Relations Act 2000, section 69ZD.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right to social security===

''See also:'' [[Welfare in New Zealand]]

New Zealand has a history of providing various forms of social security.&lt;ref&gt;Māmari Stephens, "The Right to Social Security" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 127 at 130-134.&lt;/ref&gt; The system has been designed to assist people when they are, for example, ill, unemployed, injured and elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Māmari Stephens, "The Right to Social Security" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 127 at 140.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand's Ministry of Social Development]] both develops and implements social security policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msd.govt.nz/ Ministry of Social Development].&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Security Act 1964 provides for a three-tiered system of benefits: 
# Benefits to those in need such as the elderly, solo parents, the ill and the unemployed, 
# Supplementary assistance, which recognises that some people face unavoidable expenditure, for example, in the areas of childcare and accommodation, and 
# Financial assistance that provides a 'safety net', such as the Emergency Benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Māmari Stephens "The Right to Social Security" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 127 at 134.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those who have suffered an accidental personal injury may also be eligible for financial support under the Accident Compensation Act 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Māmari Stephens "The Right to Social Security" in Margaret Bedggood and Kris Gledhill (eds) ''Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand'' (Thomson Reuters, Wellington, 2011) 127 at 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Discrimination in the social security system has been alleged though. In ''Child Poverty Action Group v Attorney-General'', provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 prohibited families who received income benefits or accident compensation from being eligible for tax credits, but such discrimination was found to be justified under section 5 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.&lt;ref&gt;''Child Poverty Action Group Incorporated v Attorney-General'' [2013] NZCA 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Academics have stated that New Zealand takes a 'needs-based' approach to the administration of social security, as opposed to a 'rights-based' approach.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Geiringer and Matthew Palmer, "Human Rights and Social Policy in New Zealand" (2007) 30 ''Soc Pol J of NZ''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concluding observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 2012===

''See generally:'' [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]

The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) is a body consisting of 18 independent experts tasked with monitoring State parties' implementation of the ICESCR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cescr/pages/cescrindex.aspx United Nations Human Rights 'Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights'].&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand's efforts in implementing the ICESCR were last assessed and reported on by the CESCR in May 2012.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-legislation/international-obligations/ Human Rights Commission 'New Zealand's International Obligations'].&lt;/ref&gt; This was New Zealand's third report from the CESCR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Committee made several recommendations to New Zealand in order for the country to increase its protection of ESCR.&lt;ref name="docstore.ohchr.org"&gt;[http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW%2fLN41VeUtud3gjfWhwNd9f60k8%2f50phaLI1jkiOLGzZGOzXS1tW0Rjw8G6CdDpH6vkejgDpvXC%2bTjh97DWXtSc3RjSowNjFJgNfHV1L%2bYin Concluding observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the third periodic report of New Zealand 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; Such recommendations included incorporating ESCR into the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and enhancing the enjoyment of ESCR for Māori, Pasifika and people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="docstore.ohchr.org"/&gt; 

Other recommendations included the rights of Māori to land, water and other such resources being legislated for, altering legislation to effectively provide for equal pay, continuing to guarantee the right to safe and affordable water, strengthening action to discourage tobacco consumption (especially among Māori and Pasifika youth) and ensuring the right to housing for all is guaranteed by policies and legislation.&lt;ref name="docstore.ohchr.org"/&gt;

==Indigenous peoples==

[[File:Hikoi-foreshore.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]] over land title]]
There are concerns regarding inequality between Māori and other ethnic groups, in terms of the disproportionate numbers of Māori people in the penitentiary system and on [[welfare]] support.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"/&gt; The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination highlighted issues regarding the government handling of Māori land claims, suggesting that amendments should be made to the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"/&gt;

Māori population on average run greater risks of many negative economic and social outcomes. Over 50% of Māori live in areas in the three highest deprivation deciles, compared with 24% of the rest of the population.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Māori make up 14% of the population, they make up almost 50% of the prison population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corrections.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/285286/Over-representation-of-Maori-in-the-criminal-justice-system.pdf |title=Over-representation of Maori in the criminal justice system |date=September 2007 |page=4 |publisher=Department of Corrections |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215025302/http://corrections.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/285286/Over-representation-of-Maori-in-the-criminal-justice-system.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other issues include higher unemployment-rates than the general population in New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/lmr-maori-outcomes.asp Department of Labour, NZ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811193834/http://www.dol.govt.nz/publications/lmr/lmr-maori-outcomes.asp |date=2010-08-11 }}, ''Māori Labour Market Outlook''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also issues regarding health, including higher levels of alcohol and drug abuse, smoking and obesity. Less frequent use of healthcare services mean that late diagnosis and treatment intervention lead to higher levels of morbidity and mortality in many manageable conditions, such as [[cervical cancer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raeburn, J  |author2=Rootman I|title=People-centred Health Promotion|year=1998|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diabetes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/pagesmh/95?Open, ''Diabetes in New Zealand] - Models And Forecasts 1996 - 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; per head of population than [[Pākehā]] (non-Māori)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sellman JD, Huriwai TT, Ram RS, Deering DE.|title=Cultural linkage: treating Maori with alcohol and drug problems in dedicated Maori treatment programs|publisher=Department of Psychological Medicine, Christchurch School of Medicine, New Zealand.|pmid=9090803|volume=32|date=Mar 1997|pages=415–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Māori also have considerably lower life expectancies compared to non-Māori. In 2005-2007, at birth Māori male life expectancy was 70.4 years versus 79 years for non-Māori males (a difference of 8.6 years), while the life expectancy for Māori females was 75.1 years versus 83 years for non-Māori females (a difference of 7.9 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Report: 2010|url=http://www.socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/life-expectancy.html|publisher=Ministry of Social Development|accessdate=12 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929154729/http://www.socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/life-expectancy.html|archivedate=29 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have voiced concern for the area of 'linguistic human rights', due to the degree of prejudice against the use of Māori language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skutnabb-Kangas, T, Phillipson, R &amp; Rannut M|title=Linguistic Human Rights: Overcoming Linguistic Discrimination|year=1995|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=|pages=209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples announced that the New Zealand Government would now support the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy Watkins|title=NZ does U-turn on rights charter|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3599153/NZ-does-U-turn-on-rights-charter

==Refugees==
{{Main article|Refugee migration into New Zealand}}
New Zealand is a party to the 1951 UN [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and the 1967 protocol.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"/&gt; In 2009, the government proposed an immigration bill which had provisions for passenger screening. In addition, the bill would permit the withholding of reasons for the denial of entry, and would deny the applicant access to judicial review. Such developments caused concern that the bill could lead to the possibility for prolonged detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human rights in New Zealand: Report 2009|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/new-zealand/report-2009|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Rights Commission ==
{{main article|Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)}}
The primary watchdog for human rights in New Zealand is the Human Rights Commission. Its stated mission is to work "for a fair, safe and just society, where diversity is valued, human rights are respected, and everyone is able to live free from prejudice and unlawful discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Human Rights Commission|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/about/|publisher=Human Rights Commission|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body is a member of Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions and of the International Coordinating Committee of national human rights institutions.

In 2010 the Commission conducted a publicly available review of human rights in New Zealand in order to both identify the areas in which New Zealand does well, and where it could do better to combat persistent social problems. The 'report card' is an update of the Commissions' first report in 2004, and will lead its work for the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights in New Zealand 2010 |url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/human-rights/our-work/human-rights-new-zealand-2010/|publisher=Human Rights Commission|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report notes steady improvements in New Zealand's human rights record since 2004, but also "the fragility of some of the gains and areas where there has been deterioration."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Review 2010" /&gt; In the report, the Commission identifies thirty priority areas for action on human rights in New Zealand under a number of sections: general; civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights; and rights of specific groups.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Review 2010" /&gt;

==Limits on human rights in New Zealand==

===New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990===
In part one of the Bill of Rights, under general provisions, there are clear warnings that any of the rights found in the Act are not supreme law and can fall to Acts inconsistent with any of the rights mentioned.

Section 4 states that were there is inconsistencies between Acts, the Bill of Rights will bow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225500.html|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 4 Other enactments not affected – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 5 states that all rights and freedoms are subject to reasonable limits prescribed by law in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225501.html|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 5 Justified limitations – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that within the Act, there are still procedures in place to up hold all rights where possible. Section 6 of the Bill of Rights Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225502.html|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 6 Interpretation consistent with Bill of Rights to be preferred – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows the Court interpret all other enactment’s meanings to be consistent with all rights.&lt;ref&gt;An example of the court using this section is R v Rangi [1993] 1 NZLR 385.&lt;/ref&gt; This section could perhaps be seen as an immediate remedy to any possible basic or unintentional inconsistencies with can take away an individual’s rights.

Section 7 of the Bill of Rights Act is also important for upholding human rights, as it creates the mechanism where the [[Attorney-General]] is obligated to report an inconsistencies to the Bill of Rights to parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0109/latest/DLM225503.html|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 No 109 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 7 Attorney-General to report to Parliament where Bill appears to be inconsistent with Bill of Rights – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a paramount section as it keeps the legislator accountable to uphold New Zealanders’ individual rights, but it also mitigates any unintentional breaches on any rights.

===New Zealand's unwritten constitution===
New Zealand is seen as one of the few countries in the world which does not have a physical document which acts as the state’s constitution.&lt;ref&gt;PA Joseph Constitutional and Administrative Law in New Zealand (3rd ed, Brookers, Wellington, 2007), at 134.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand’s unwritten constitution can be seen as a collective of many different acts, including the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. There are no entrenched Acts or Bills in New Zealand law, therefore the highest power is given to parliament. This therefore means that, if parliament has a majority vote, any piece of legislation can be overturned regardless of how much emphasis the court puts on it.

There has been criticism, over the years, in regards to this "unwritten constitution" and much encouragement from the international community to change this. The 2009 [[Universal Periodic Review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/universal-periodic-review/upr-documents-relating-to-new-zealand-1%7CThe|title=Constitutional issues &amp; human rights - New Zealand Ministry of Justice|website=www.justice.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; on New Zealand, through the [[Human Rights Council]], is a good demonstration of this. In this review concerns were expressed that, due to constitution, not entrenched, there was no overarching protection for human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/universal-periodic-review/upr-documents-relating-to-new-zealand-1/first-report-2009/NZ_UPR_National_Report_2009.pdf|title=Constitutional issues &amp; human rights - New Zealand Ministry of Justice|website=www.justice.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the review multiple states&lt;ref&gt;Such as India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed their concerns over the lack of protection human rights had, due to the constitutional framework; all states were seen to highly recommend New Zealand taking steps towards constitutional entrenchment, and therefore protected human rights. Aside from these issues brought up, the international community collectively commended New Zealand's work in upholding human rights, such as the amount of ratifications completed and the work with the Maori peoples.

There has been small glimmers of movement towards an entrenched and written constitution in the past few years. The "Constitutional Conversation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourconstitution.org.nz/|title=The Constitution Conversation - He kaupapa nui te kaupapa ture|website=www.ourconstitution.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, a nationwide forum, was a select panel which considered what should be done, whilst also taking into consideration the views of the public. Nothing as of yet has come out of this. There is an opinion that it is not a question about "if" but of "when" the change will happen, as New Zealand is continually developing in its own individual identity.

'''Identity document forgery''' is the process by which [[identity document]]s issued by governing bodies are copied and/or modified by persons not authorized to create such documents or engage in such modifications, for the purpose of deceiving those who would view the documents about the identity or status of the bearer. The term also encompasses the activity of acquiring identity documents from governing bodies by falsifying the required supporting documentation in order to create the desired identity.

Identity documents differ from other credentials in that they are intended to be usable by only the person holding the card. Unlike other credentials, they may be used to restrict the activities of the holder as well as to expand them.

Documents that have been forged in this way include [[driver's license]]s (which historically have been forged or altered as an attempt to conceal the fact that persons desiring to consume [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] are under the [[legal drinking age]]); [[birth certificate]]s and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] cards (likely used in [[identity theft]] schemes or to [[defraud]] the government); and [[passport]]s (used to evade restrictions on entry into a particular country). At the beginning of 2010, there were 11 million stolen or lost passports listed in the global database of [[Interpol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/11-million-stolen-or-lost-passports-in-interpol-database/| title= 11 million stolen or lost passports in Interpol database|work=Havocscope Black Markets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such falsified documents can be used for identity theft, age deception, [[illegal immigration]], and [[organized crime]].

==Use scenarios, forgery techniques and security countermeasures==
[[File:CE795.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s fake service card with the name [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Hidell]].]]
A distinction needs to be made between the different uses of an identity document. In one cases, the fake ID may only have to pass a cursory inspection, such as flashing a plastic ID card for a security guard. At the other extreme, a document may have to resist scrutiny by a trained document examiner, who may be equipped with technical tools for verifying [[biometrics]] and reading hidden security features within the card. To make forgery more difficult, most modern IDs contain numerous security features that require specialised and expensive equipment to duplicate. School IDs are typically easier to fake, as they often do not have the same level of security measures as government-issued IDs.

Modern fake ID cards almost invariably carry a picture of the authorized user, a simple and effective form of biometric identification. However, forgery of simple photographic ID cards has become simple in recent years with the availability of low-cost high-resolution printers and scanners and photo-editing software. Simple fake ID cards are commonly made using an inkjet or laser printer to print a replica document which is then laminated to resemble a real ID card. Most designs are made using computer programs, re-creating scanned copies of a license.

More complex ID cards are now being created by printing on a material called [[Teslin (material)|Teslin]] or Artisyn, which are paper-like materials that are actually micro-porous plastic sheets. When butterfly pouches and [[Holography|holograms]] are applied, the card is then run through a heat laminator which creates a professional-looking ID card.

Numerous [[security printing]] techniques have been used to attempt to enhance the security of ID cards. For example, many modern documents include holograms, which are difficult to replicate without expensive equipment which is not generally available. Though accurate recreation of these holograms is extremely difficult, using a mixture of pigments and base can create a similar shiny multi-coloured look which may pass cursory inspection.

In addition, some documents include a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic strip]], which will also contain the same information, and may thus be checked against the machine-readable information on the [[barcode]]. Magnetic strips may also contain other secret identifying information. Although magnetic strips can also be faked, they provide another barrier to entry for the amateur forger. Other hidden security devices can also be added, including embedded secure cryptoprocessor chips which are designed to be very difficult to forge, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags: the two technologies may also be combined, in the case of contactless smart cards.

Another effective technique is the use of online verification of security information against a central database. In many cases, online verification can detect simple copying of a document by detecting attempted use in multiple places at the same time, or completely false IDs, as the information on the ID will be found to be invalid. A simple method of confirming that an ID is genuine is to print a serial number on it unique to the card and stored on a centralized database. If checked, it will quickly become clear that the ID is false; either the number on the ID is not registered for the holder, or no ID has the number at all. Online verification also has the advantage that it allows easy revocation of lost or stolen documents.

Many modern credentials now contain some kind of barcode. For example, many U.S. driving licences include a 2-dimensional code in [[PDF417]] format, which contains the same information as on the front of the license. Barcodes allow rapid checking of credentials for low-security applications, and may potentially contain extra information which can be used to verify other information on the card.

==Systemic attacks==

The combination of multiple high-security features, biometrics, and well-trained document inspectors with technical assistance can be very effective at preventing forged documents from being easily produced. Instead of acquiring the expensive specialized equipment needed to make fake documents, it may be more economical to produce a "genuine fake"; a legitimate document, but one which contains false information.

One way of doing this is to present the document issuing authority with false credentials, which they will then endorse by issuing a new document. In this way, false identities and credentials can be "bootstrapped" over a period of time.

Another simpler way of generating false credentials is to suborn one of the officials involved in the document-issuing process through bribery or intimidation. This may also be combined with the bootstrapping process mentioned above to mount complex attacks.

Corruption in the document-issuing process is hard to counter, since as the value of a credential increases, the economic incentives for corruption also increase. This is particularly true in the case of fake ID cards that combine many functions in one document, and for documents which are issued in large numbers, thus requiring many thousands of people to have authorizing powers, thus creating a longer chain of people who can possibly be exploited. Detection of a "genuine fake" document is also a difficult process; as such a fake is a legitimate document, it will pass any tests for forgery. To detect such fakes, it is necessary to perform a [[background check]] on the individual in question to confirm the legitimacy of the document's information.  Nowadays, drivers licenses and identification cards are verified by scanning the magnetic stripe on the back of the license or by using an ultraviolet light to view images printed by the government on the identification which are only visible under ultraviolet light.

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

Political topics include:

The''' International Day of Peace''', sometimes unofficially known as '''World Peace Day''', is a [[United Nations]]-sanctioned holiday observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to [[world peace]], and specifically the absence of [[war]] and [[violence]], such as might be occasioned by a temporary [[ceasefire]] in a [[combat]] zone for [[humanitarian aid]] access. The day was first celebrated in 1982, and is kept by many nations, political groups, military groups, and people. In 2013 the day was dedicated by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] to [[peace education]], the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/index.shtml | title=International Day of Peace Event Information | publisher=[[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] | accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To inaugurate the day, the United Nations [[Japanese Peace Bell|Peace Bell]] is rung at [[United Nations Headquarters|UN Headquarters]] (in [[New York City]]). The bell is cast from coins donated by children from all continents except [[Africa]], and was a gift from the [[United Nations Association]] of [[Japan]], as "a reminder of the human cost of war"; the inscription on its side reads, "Long live absolute world peace".&lt;ref name="titleSecretary-General's Message on the International Day of Peace 21 September 2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/events/peaceday/2002/sg210902.htm |title=Secretary-General's Message on the International Day of Peace 21 September 2002 |accessdate=6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1981&amp;nbsp;– UN General Assembly Resolution passed===
The [[United Nations General Assembly]] declared, in a resolution sponsored by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Costa Rica]],&lt;ref name="UN_ARES55282"/&gt; the International Day of Peace, to be devoted to commemorating and strengthening the ideals of peace.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES3667_page1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-36-67 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=36 |resolution_number=67 |highlight=rect_512,493_917,590 |page=1 |accessdate=23 August 2008|title=International Year of Peace and International Day of Peace|date=30 November 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The date initially chosen was the regular opening day of the annual sessions of the General Assembly, the third Tuesday of September.  (This was changed in 2001 to the current annual celebration on 21 September each year&amp;nbsp;— see 2001 below.)

===1982&amp;nbsp;– First observance===
'''Tuesday 21 September 1982''' was the first occurrence of the International Day of Peace.
The theme of the first International Day of Peace was the Right to peace of people.

===1983&amp;nbsp;– Culture of Peace initiative===
In the spirit of the original vision that brought forth the Charter of the United Nations, the UN Secretary General announces a Culture of Peace in the 21st century initiative to unite the strengths of organizations, projects and peoples in order to make Peace a practical reality for the children of this and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cultureofpeace.org/aboutcpi | title=About the Culture of Peace Initiative | publisher=CPI | accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996&amp;nbsp;– Seanad Éireann debate===
A proposal for expanding the International Day of Peace to include Reconciliation, in which a massive number of emblems (White Doves) would be distributed after a formal presentation at the United Nations, was put forward by Vincent Coyle, of [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], and was debated at [[Seanad Éireann]]. It was accepted that it would be impractical for one member state to ask for a particular slot at a general UN ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Seanad Éireann&amp;nbsp;— Volume 148 26 July 1996 {{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0148/S.0148.199607260010.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925104230/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0148/S.0148.199607260010.html |archivedate=25 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, events have been held at the United Nations in New York, with the support of Kofi Annan, in April.

===2001&amp;nbsp;– Date set at 21 September===
In 2001 the opening day of the General Assembly was scheduled for [[11 September]], and Secretary General Kofi Annan drafted a message recognising the observance of International Peace Day on 21 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2001/sgsm7945.html|title=Message from Secretary-General on International Day of Peace; 11 September 2001|author=|date=|website=www.unis.unvienna.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year the day was changed from the third Tuesday to specifically the twenty-first day of September, to take effect in 2002. A new resolution was passed by the General Assembly,&lt;ref name="UN_ARES55282"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-55-282 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=55 |resolution_number=282 |accessdate=23 August 2008|title=International Day of Peace|date=7 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the United Kingdom (giving credit to [[Peace One Day]]) and [[Costa Rica]] (the original sponsors of the day), to give the International Day of Peace a fixed calendar date, 21 September, and declare it also as a day of [[ceasefire|global ceasefire]] and [[non-violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-55-PV.111 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=55 |meeting=111 |page=2 |anchor=pg002-bk08-pa03 |date=7 September 2001 |speakername=[[Sir Jeremy Greenstock]] | speakernation=United Kingdom |accessdate=23 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004&amp;nbsp;– Taiwanese commemorative stamp controversy===
A diplomatic stir occurred when [[Lions Clubs International]] sponsored a competition for six posters to be used for International Day of Peace commemorative stamps issued by the UN Postal Administration.  A poster by 15-year-old [[Taiwanese People|Taiwanese]] school student Yang Chih-Yuan was announced as one of the winners, but the announcement was withdrawn. Taiwan media reports, Taiwan Lions Club and the government of Taiwan claimed the decision not to use the poster resulted from pressure from [[People's Republic of China|China]];&lt;ref name=TaipeiTimes&gt;Taipei Times [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/08/26/2003200241 ''Row erupts over local boy's stamp design'']&lt;/ref&gt; the rejection of the student's painting on political grounds did not reflect the ideals of the International Day of Peace.&lt;ref&gt;Taipei Times [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/08/24/2003199988 ''Chunghwa Post announces intent to use student art'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The UN issued a statement that, although in the short list of eight designs, "due to an internal misunderstanding and miscommunication, Mr. Yang's proof got publicized in error as one of the six stamps intended to be issued."&lt;ref name=TaipeiTimes /&gt;  The government of [[Republic of China|Taiwan (Republic of China)]] later issued a stamp containing the image.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the President, Republic of China [http://www.president.gov.tw/en/prog/news_release/print.php?id=1105497987 ''News Release: President Chen Receives the Painter of International Day of Peace Stamp Yang Chih-yuan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] called for the worldwide observance of a 22-hour [[cease-fire]] and day of [[nonviolence]] to mark the Day.&lt;ref name="titleInternational Day of Peace 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/events/peaceday/2005/ |title=International Day of Peace 2005 |accessdate=6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurdish Dialog Center''' is an independent organization founded by [[Rauf Hassan]] in [[Sulaymaniyah]] 1992 after the Kurdish revolution against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime and in time of the civil war among the Kurdish Politic parties in power.

This organization was motivating people in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] to use dialog, speech, writing and creative critiques instead of weapons and war. It had almost 50 members in its first year and continues to grow day after day.

Most of the members were teachers, writers, poets and artists .

'''Ladins Dolomites''' ({{lang-lld|Ladins Dolomites}}, LD) is a minor [[list of political parties in South Tyrol|political party]] representing the [[Ladin language|Ladin]] minority in [[South Tyrol]].

==History==
The party, whose original name was '''Ladins Political Movement''' ({{lang-lld|Moviment Politich Ladins}}, MPL), was founded in the early 1990s by [[Carlo Willeit]], who led it in the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regional election, 1993|1993 provincial election]] (2.0% of the vote and 1 seat, for Willeit himself) and in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regional election, 1998|1998 provincial election]] (3.6%, along with the [[Democratic Party of South Tyrol]], and 1 seat).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/mitarbeiterinnen/pallaver/pdf/pallaver_561-600.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524105530/http://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/mitarbeiterinnen/pallaver/pdf/pallaver_561-600.pdf |date=May 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the party failed to have any elects both in the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2003|2003]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2008|2008 elections]] (1.4 and 1.1%, respectively). In 2008 the party took its current name.

In the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol provincial elections, 2013|2013 provincial election]] LD ran within a three-party list, along with the [[Citizens' Union for South Tyrol]] and [[We South Tyroleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altoadige.gelocal.it/cronaca/2013/08/09/news/egger-si-presenta-alle-elezioni-con-poder-e-ladins-1.7556003 |title=Egger si presenta alle elezioni con Pöder e Ladins - Cronaca - Alto Adige |publisher=Altoadige.gelocal.it |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buergerunion.st/index.php/stellungnahmen/51-contentfrontpage17/1457-buendnis-buergerunion-ladins-dolomites-wir-suedtiroler-vorgestellt ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914002701/http://www.buergerunion.st/index.php/stellungnahmen/51-contentfrontpage17/1457-buendnis-buergerunion-ladins-dolomites-wir-suedtiroler-vorgestellt |date=September 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition won 2.1% of the vote and [[Andreas Pöder]], leader of the Citizens' Union, was its sole elect to the Provincial Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.siag.it/ |url=http://elezioni.provincia.bz.it/ |title=Referendum provinciale confermativo 2014 &amp;#124; Provincia autonoma di Bolzano – Alto Adige |publisher=Elezioni.provincia.bz.it |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ladin areas the coalition did worse than LD alone in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://elezioni.provincia.bz.it/dlistvt_li_d-1_vg.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marketable title''' ([[real estate]]) is a title that a [[court of equity]] considers to be so free from defect that it will legally force its acceptance by a buyer.  Marketable title does not assume that absolute absence of defect, but rather a title that a prudent, educated buyer in the reasonable course of business would accept.  For [[real estate]] practitioners, the most complete reference to title issues is found in the preprinted wording contained within an agreement/contract. If you cannot produce a clear title of [[deed]] to the property then the prospective buyer should expect to lose in a [[specific performance]] action. 

Merchantable title and marketable title are synonymous terms.

In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, there is an implied undertaking in the [[contract]] that the vendor (person selling the property) has a marketable title.  The contract typically provides that on failure of a vendor to deliver good and marketable title, the vendee (buyer) may rescind the contract and recover any deposit.


&lt;big&gt; '''Merger'''&lt;/big&gt;
{{see|Merger doctrine (property law)}}

If a deed is delivered and it has no [[warranty of title]], the buyer has no recourse because the deed supersedes the contract.  This means that the initial [[contract]] is no longer in effect.


&lt;big&gt; '''Closing Date'''&lt;/big&gt;

Sellers only have to tender good and marketable title on the date the conveyance is executed (date of closing).  So a seller may contract to sell property it does not currently possess.  Liability will be imposed on the seller for breach only if the seller does not have good and marketable title on the date of closing.


&lt;big&gt;'''Defects that make title unmarketable'''&lt;/big&gt;

# Outstanding mortgages/liens
# Restrictive covenants
# Outstanding future interests of others in the property, i.e. a "[[reverter]]".
# Encumbrances
# [[Easements]] on the property
# Variations in the names of grantors and grantees
# Variations in the [[chain of title]]
# Outstanding [[dower]] interests.
# [[Adverse possession]] claims
# [[Structural encroachment]]s
# Existing violations of an [[equitable servitude]] or [[covenant (law)|covenant]]
# Zoning restriction violations


&lt;big&gt;'''Actions that do not defeat marketability'''&lt;/big&gt;
# Zoning restrictions (so long as there are no current violations of the restrictions)
# Other land use regulations

'''Marriage Equality USA''' was an organization working for the legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] in the United States. The group worked by doing public education and outreach, media campaigns and holding visibility events.

In the months after the passing of Proposition 8, Marriage Equality USA sponsored a statewide poll to determine opinions on same sex marriage. Polling data was presented in over forty cities in a town hall forum dubbed the "Get Engaged Tour". At the events participants were presented the results of the statewide polling data, as well as an opportunity to discuss next steps in moving forward with an effort to bring about marriage equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/25/MNC118UVLJ.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joe | last=Garofoli | title=Same-sex marriage backers weigh ballot date | date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Munger|first=Kel|title=Find your power|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/find-your-power/content?oid=1178654|accessdate=26 May 2012|newspaper=News Review|date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4955">'''Mayors for Peace''' is an international organization of cities dedicated to the promotion of peace that was established in 1982 at the initiative of then [[Mayor of Hiroshima]] [[Takeshi Araki]], in response to the deaths of around 140,000 people due to the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|atomic bombing of the city]] on August 6, 1945. 

The current mayor of Hiroshima, [[Kazumi Matsui]], is the President of the organization today{{When?|date=October 2018}}.

Mayors for Peace was started in Japan, and since then Mayors throughout the World have signed on. When Mayors sign on, it means they support the commencement of negotiations towards the elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020.

In September 2015, Mayors for Peace counted around 6,800 member cities in 161 countries and territories around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/english/outlines/members.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|title=Members|publisher=http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/english/outlines/members.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Mayors for Peace 2020 Vision Campaign ==
The [[2020 Vision Campaign]] is the main vehicle for advancing the agenda of Mayors for Peace, a nuclear-weapon-free world by the year 2020. It was initiated on a provisional basis by the Executive Cities of Mayors for Peace at their meeting in Manchester, UK, in October 2003. It was launched under the name 'Emergency Campaign to Ban Nuclear Weapons' in November of that year at the 2nd Citizens Assembly for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons held in Nagasaki, Japan. In August 2005, the World Conference endorsed continuation of the Campaign under the title of the '2020 Vision Campaign'.

From May 2008 till May 2009, the main focus of the work of the 2020 Vision Campaign has been the signature drive for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100702161333/http://www.2020visioncampaign.org/filestorage/409/File/1/CitiesAppeal.pdf Cities Appeal] in support of the [[Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol]]. The Protocol embeds the objective of the 2020 Vision Campaign in a realistic framework. As a protocol to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT), it seeks to challenge national governments to follow through on the commitments they made in Article VI the Treaty.

By signing the Cities Appeal, Mayors and elected local officials around the world are given the chance to get behind the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol ahead of the formal and final presentation of the results of the international signature drive at the 2010 NPT Review Conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.

== Activities in the U.S. ==
In western Massachusetts, a campaign was spearheaded from grassroots organizers in eleven towns. After two years of hard working starting in the autumn of 2005 and continuing today, all eleven Western Mayors have signed on to the campaign.

This encouraged some legislative action, and the state Republicans brought forth a resolution for nuclear abolition by 2020 which passed in the Massachusetts House and Senate. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] was asked to bring the resolution to the federal level. However, after Kennedy died, there are no plans to see the resolution at a national level.

== 2011 Nobel Peace Prize nomination ==
Mayors for Peace were nominated for 2011 Nobel Peace Prize by 1976 Peace Prize laureate [[Mairead Maguire]]. Maguire, who nominated Mayors for Peace and [[Nihon Hidankyo]] jointly for the prize, said she believes that "both organizations have fulfilled the wish of Alfred Nobel to work for peace and disarmament and awarding the prize jointly to them would recognize the great sacrifice of especially the ''hibakusha'' and give support and encouragement to all working on one of the greatest challenges to humanity – to rid the world of all nuclear weapons and build peace amongst the human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire has nominated jointly Nihon Hidankyo (Japan Confederation of A and H Bomb Sufferers Organization) and Mayors for Peace, for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize|url=http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Press-Release-20ll-Nobel-Nomination.docx|work=nobelforpeace-summits.org|publisher=11th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''member of parliament''' ('''MP''') is the representative of the voters to a [[parliament]]. In many countries with [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. [[Member of Congress]] is an equivalent term in other jurisdictions.

Members of parliament tend to form [[parliamentary group]]s (also called ''parliamentary parties'') with members of the same [[political party]].

== Westminster system ==
{{Main|Westminster system}}
The Westminster system is a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[parliamentary system]] of [[government]] modelled after the [[politics of the United Kingdom]]. This term comes from the [[Palace of Westminster]], the seat of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

=== Australia ===

A member of parliament is a member of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the lower house of the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth (federal) parliament]]. Members may use "MP" after their names; "MHR" is no longer used. A member of the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], is known as a "Senator".

In the [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]], a Member of the [[Legislative Assembly]] (House of Assembly in South Australia) or "lower house," may also use the post-nominal "MP." Members of the Legislative Council (upper house) use the post-nominal "MLC."

=== Bahamas ===
The [[Parliament of The Bahamas]] is the bicameral national parliament of Commonwealth of The Bahamas. The parliament is formally made up by the Queen (represented by the Governor-General), an appointed Senate, and an elected House of Assembly. It currently sits at Nassau, the national capital.

The structure, functions, and procedures of the parliament are based on the Westminster system.

=== Bangladesh ===

Members of the [[Jatiya Sangsad]], or National Assembly, are elected every five years and are referred to in English as members of Parliament. The assembly has directly elected 300 seats, and further 50 reserved selected seats for women.

=== Canada ===

The [[Parliament of Canada]] consists of [[Monarchy of Canada|the monarch]], the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] (the upper chamber), and the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] (the lower chamber). Only members of the lower house are referred to as ''members of Parliament'' ({{lang-fr|[[Deputy (legislator)|député]]}}), while members of the upper house are called ''senators'' ({{lang-fr|link=no|sénateur}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/Education/OurCountryOurParliament/glossary-e.asp |title=ESL Home |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203063249/http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/Education/OurCountryOurParliament/glossary-e.asp |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 105 seats in the Senate and 338 in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/education/gloss-inter/index.asp?Language=E#03 Glossary of Parliamentary Terms for intermediate students] Parliament of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Parliament are elected, while senators are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] on behalf of the sovereign at the direction of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]]. Retirement is mandatory for senators upon reaching the age of 75 years.

Each province (and territory) has its own legislature, with each member usually known as a ''[[Member of the Legislative Assembly]]'' (MLA). In certain provinces, legislators carry other titles: [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]] (MPP) in [[Ontario]], [[Member of the National Assembly (Quebec)|Member of the National Assembly]] (MNA) in [[Quebec]] ({{lang-fr|député}}), and [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|Member of the House of Assembly]] (MHA) in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The provincial upper houses were eliminated through the 20th century.

A Member of Parliament is any member of the two houses of [[Indian Parliament]], i.e., [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]]. As of 2018, Lok Sabha has 545 seats, of which 543 members are elected popularly by single-member constituencies via [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] method in each of the 29 Indian states and 7 union territories, while the [[President of India]] may appoint 2 representatives of the [[Anglo-Indian]] community. As of 2018, Rajya Sabha can have 245 members, 233 of which are elected indirectly by the state legislatures using [[Single transferable vote|Single transferable vote]] method of proportional representation, and 12 are appointed by the President for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services (Art. 80 of the Constitution). Each state is allocated a fixed number of representatives in each chamber, in order of their respective population. As of 2018, state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] has the greatest number of representatives in both houses. The person which secures the support of more than half the seats in the Lok Sabha forms the [[Government of India|Government]]. To form the government, parties may form a coalition. The Lok Sabha is the lower house and the Rajya Sabha is the upper house of the bicameral Indian Parliament.

The term of a member of the Rajya Sabha is 6 years long, while the Lok Sabha members are elected for a term of 5 years, unless the house is dissolved sooner. Rajya Sabha is a permanent house, and is not subject to dissolution, and the members serve staggered terms - one-third of the membership retires every two years. Vacancies in both houses, whether because of death or resignation of a member, are filled with [[By-election|by-elections]] within six months of the vacancy - the newly elected member in which case serves only the rest of the pending term of the seat they are elected to. The number of seats in both houses is regulated by [[Constitution of India| Constitution]] and parliamentary statutes.

A ''member of Parliament'' was a member of the pre-1801 [[Irish House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. Irish members elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] were also called ''members of Parliament'' from 1801 to 1922. [[Northern Ireland]] continues to elect MPs to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Following the formation of the independent [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, members of the lower house of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament), [[Dáil Éireann]] (or "the Dáil") are termed ''Teachtaí Dála'' (''[[Teachta Dála]]'' singular) or TDs and are called a Deputy. The upper house is called [[Seanad Éireann]] and its members are called Senators.

The term "members of Parliament" only refers to members of the ''Dewan Rakyat''. In [[Malay language|Malay]], a member of Parliament is called ''Ahli Parlimen'', or less formally ''wakil rakyat'' (people's representative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Then |first=Stephen |title=Here comes a real wakil rakyat |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/10/11/sarawak/12153917 |accessdate=2 March 2013 |newspaper=The Star (Malaysia) |date=11 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Parliament are elected from population-based single-seat constituencies using [[first-past-the-post voting]]. The [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] must be a member of Parliament.

Members of Parliament are styled ''Yang Berhormat'' ("Honourable") with the initials ''Y.B.'' appended [[Pre-nominal letters|prenominally]]. A prince who is a member of Parliament is styled ''Yang Berhormat Mulia''. The Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and [[Malay styles and titles#Tun|Tuns]] who are members of Parliament are styled ''Yang Amat Berhormat'' ("Most Honourable"), abbreviated Y.A.B.

=== New Zealand ===

{{Main|New Zealand Parliament|New Zealand elections}}

The Parliament of New Zealand is made up of the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|monarch]] and the [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. A ''member of Parliament'' is a member of the House of Representatives, which has a minimum of 120 members, elected at a general election for a three-year term. There are 70 [[electoral district|electorate]] MPs, of which seven are elected only by [[Māori people|Māori]] who have chosen to be registered on a separate Māori electoral roll. The remaining members are elected by [[proportional representation]] from published [[party list]]s.

Before 1951, New Zealand had a bicameral (two-chamber) parliament. Members of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], abbreviated MLC, were appointed. Members of the lower house, the body that still exists, have always been elected. Since 1907, elected members have been referred to as 'Member of Parliament', abbreviated MP. From the 1860s until 1907 they were designated as Member of the House of Representatives, abbreviated MHR. Between the first general election, in [[New Zealand general election, 1853|1853]], and the 1860s, the designation was Member of the General Assembly, abbreviated MGA.&lt;ref name="Scholefield 1950"&gt;{{cite book |last= Scholefield |first= Guy |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1949 |authorlink=Guy Scholefield |edition=3rd |origyear= First ed. published 1913 |year= 1950 |publisher=Govt.

The United Kingdom elects members of two parliaments:

* the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], with 650 members elected by the [[first-past-the-post]] system to the (lower) [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], referred to as Members of Parliament, abbreviated to ''MP''
* the [[European Parliament]], with a maximum of 73 members out of a total of 751 members elected for a five-year term, called [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (''MEP'')

and four devolved legislatures:

* the [[Scottish Parliament]], with 129 members elected under the [[additional member system]] every five years, and called [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (''MSP'')

* the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with 90 members known as ''Members of the Legislative Assembly'' (''MLA''). (Between 1921 and 1973, Northern Ireland was governed by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], whose members were known as ''Members of Parliament''.)
* the [[Welsh Assembly|National Assembly for Wales]], with 60 elected members called ''Assembly Member'' (''AM'') in English, ''Aelod y Cynulliad'' (''AC'') in Welsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/languages.cfm |title=UK Parliament |accessdate=15 July 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029230135/http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080806121825/http%3A//www.parliament.uk/about/languages.cfm |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[London Assembly]], with 25 members elected under the additional member system every four years, called ''Members of the London Assembly'' (''AM'')

MPs are elected in [[United Kingdom general elections|general elections]] and by-elections to represent [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]], and may remain MPs until Parliament is dissolved, which occurs around five years after the last general election, as laid down in the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-term Parliaments Act]].

A candidate to become an MP must be a British or Irish or Commonwealth citizen, be at least 18 years of age (reduced from 21 in 2006), and not be a public official or officeholder, as set out in the schedule to the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060022.htm Electoral Administration Act 2006] Office of Public Sector Information&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, MPs have no right to [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resign]] their seats (though they may refuse to seek re-election). However a [[legal fiction]] allows voluntary resignation between elections; as MPs are forbidden from holding an "[[office of profit]] under the Crown", an MP wishing to resign will apply for the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds]] or the [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead|Stewardship of the Manor of Northstead]] which are, nominally, such paid offices and thus result in the MP vacating their seat. (Accepting a salaried Ministerial office does not amount to a paid office under the Crown for these purposes.)

The [[House of Lords]] is a legislative chamber that is part of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Although they are part of the parliament, its members are referred to as [[peerage|peers]], more formally as ''Lords of Parliament'', not MPs. [[Lords Temporal]] sit for life, [[Lords Spiritual]] while they occupy their ecclesiastical positions. [[Hereditary peers]] may no longer pass on a seat in the House of Lords to their heir automatically. The 92 who remain have been elected from among their own number, following the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] and are the only elected members of the Lords.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060103134602/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/HLLReformChronology.pdf House of Lords Reform] UK Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
A ''member of Parliament'' is a member of either of the two chambers of the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]], although the term ''Member of Parliament of the Czech Republic'' is commonly referred to Deputy of the Parliament of the Czech Republic ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Poslanec Parlamentu České republiky'') who is member of the lower house of the Parliament, [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]]. For the upper house, [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]], the term [[Senator]] is used.

=== Germany ===
''Member of Parliament'' refers to the elected members of the federal Bundestag Parliament at the [[Reichstag building]] in Berlin. In German a member is called ''{{lang|de|Mitglied des Bundestages}}'' (Member of the Federal [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]]) or officially ''{{lang|de|Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestages}}'' (Member of the German Federal Diet), abbreviated [[MdB]] and attached .&lt;ref name="MdB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mitglieder des Deutschen Bundestages (MdB) |url=http://www.bundestag.de/service/glossar/M/mitglieder.html |publisher=German [[Bundestag]] |accessdate=18 October 2010 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909112653/http://www.bundestag.de/service/glossar/M/mitglieder.html |archivedate=9 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficially the term ''Abgeordneter'' (literally: "delegate", i.e. of a certain electorate) is also common (abbreviated ''Abg.'', never follows the name but precedes it).

In accordance with article 38 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], which is the German constitution, "[m]embers of the German Bundestag shall be elected in general, direct, free, equal, and secret elections. They shall be representatives of the whole people, not bound by orders or instructions, and responsible only to their conscience." An important though not constitutionally required feature of German parliamentarianism is a slightly modified proportional representation.

The 16 federal [[States of Germany]] (''Länder'') are represented by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] at the former [[Prussian House of Lords]], whose members are representatives of the respective ''Länder's'' governments and not directly elected by the people.

=== Greece ===
The [[Hellenic Parliament]] (Βουλή των Ελλήνων), is the supreme democratic institution in Greece, that represents all citizens through an elected body of Members of Parliament. It is a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[legislature]] of 300 members, elected for a four-year term.

=== Italy ===
In the Republican Parliament the current term is ''[[:it:Deputato|Deputato]]'' (that is ''deputy'' as appointed to act on people's behalf) and so the Lower House takes the name of ''[[:it:Camera dei Deputati|Camera dei Deputati]]''. Similarly to other countries, the Upper House is called ''[[:it:Senato della Repubblica|Senato]]'' and its members are the ''Senatori''.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment no.390/2007 of the Constitutional Court makes clear that the third paragraph of Article 68 of the Constitution is intended to prevent that – listening to confidential discussions of a senator or a deputy – the Judiciary may become a source of constraints and pressures on the free development of an elected mandate : {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Intercettazioni "telefoniche" indirette: illegittima la distruzione immediata e la conseguente immunità dei terzi (non parlamentari) coinvolti|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2007| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89404936}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Italy there are 315 members of Senate and 630 members of the Camera dei Deputati. Both of them are elected by general elections every 5 years. The President of the Italian Republic can nominate for life 5 members of the Upper House. All former Presidents of the Republic are members of the Upper House for life. The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, both houses of today's national parliament, the [[National Diet]] ''(Kokkai)'', are directly elected, and although the two chambers differ in legislative and political authority, term length and age restriction of eligibility, the members of both houses are generally equal in personal status (financial compensation, immunity, etc.). There are currently 717 members of the National Diet (''Kokkai giin'', 国会議員): 475 [[House of Representatives (Japan)|Members of the House of Representatives]] (''Shūgiin giin'', 衆議院議員) and 242 [[House of Councillors (Japan)|Members of the House of Councillors]] (''Sangiin giin'', 参議院議員). The former are elected in [[Elections in Japan|general/by-/repeat elections of members of the House of Representatives]] ''(Shūgiin giin sō-/hoketsu-/sai-senkyo)'', the latter in [[Elections in Japan|regular/by-/repeat elections of members of the House of Councillors]] ''(Sangiin giin tsūjō-/hoketsu-/sai-senkyo)''. Under the postwar constitution, the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]] is elected by the National Diet and must be a member of the National Diet, as must the majority of other ministers; by practice, all prime ministers since 1947 have been members of the House of Representatives so far.

Under the constitution of the Empire of Japan, the [[Imperial Diet (Japan)|Imperial Diet]] (''Teikoku-gikai'') was a bicameral legislature of two houses generally equal in legislative authority, and while the members of both houses received the same financial compensation – between 1920 and 1947: 7500 [[Yen]] for the two presidents, ¥4500 for the two vice-presidents, ¥3000 for all other members of both houses except Imperial princes, dukes and marquesses –, their status was different by definition: the upper house consisted mainly of hereditary nobles and lifetime-appointed peers, the lower house of elected commoners. In the 1st Imperial Diet in 1890, there were initially 551 members of the Imperial Diet (''Teikoku-gikai giin'', 帝国議会議員, or in [[Kyūjitai|contemporaneous script]] 帝國議會議員): 251 [[House of Peers (Japan)|members of the House of Peers]] (''Kizokuin giin'', 貴族院議員) and 300 members of the House of Representatives ''(Shūgiin giin)''; of the House of Peers members, 10 were members of the Imperial family, 31 were hereditary members from the two upper [[Kazoku|nobility ranks]], 104 were members elected in mutual elections from the three lower nobility ranks, 61 were lifetime-appointed members (many of these from the bureaucracy) and 45 were members elected by the 15 top taxpayers in each of the 45 prefectures. But the number of noble and appointed members of the House of Peers was not fixed and varied gradually over time as members died or new peerages were granted; the number of elected top taxpayer seats, Imperial Academy seats (introduced in 1925), members appointed from the colonies Chōsen/Korea and Taiwan/Formosa (introduced in 1945), and the size of the House of Representatives was fixed by law, but was also changed several times over the decades. The last, 92nd Imperial Diet of 1946–47 had 839 members: 466 members of the House of Representatives and 373 members of the House of Peers.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Diet Library]], Reference ([http://www.ndl.go.jp/jp/diet/publication/refer/ レファレンス], an NDL monthly) 2005.5, Ōyama Hidehisa, [http://www.ndl.go.jp/jp/diet/publication/refer/200505_652/065202.pdf 帝国議会の運営と会議録をめぐって], pp.49–50, Table 2: Number of members of the House of Peeers and House of Representatives [by Imperial Diet and in the House of Peers, by membership category]&lt;/ref&gt; As the regulations establishing the [[Cabinet of Japan|cabinet]] ''(naikaku)'' and the cabinet's prime minister ''(naikaku sōri-daijin)'' were decreed before the Imperial constitution, the prime minister didn't have to be a member of the Imperial Diet, but after the establishment of the Imperial Diet in 1890, many prime ministers were appointed from the House of Peers, only very few were members of the House of Representatives ([[Takashi Hara]], [[Osachi Hamaguchi]], [[Tsuyoshi Inukai]]).

=== Lebanon ===
The [[Parliament of Lebanon]] is the Lebanese national legislature. It is elected to a four-year term by universal adult suffrage in multi-member constituencies, apportioned among Lebanon's diverse Christian and Muslim denominations. Its major functions are to elect the [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President of the Republic]], to approve the government (although appointed by the President, the Prime Minister, along with the Cabinet, must retain the confidence of a majority in the Parliament), and to approve laws and expenditure. The name of a deputy in Arabic is Naeb (نائب). The plural of Naeb is Nuwab (نواب).

=== Republic of Macedonia ===
{{Main|Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia}}
In the Republic of Macedonia there are 120 members of parliament ({{lang-mk|Sobranie}}) which are called 'Pratenici' (singular Pratenik).

=== Netherlands ===
The Parliament of the Netherlands is known as the ''Staten-Generaal'', [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]]. It is bicameral, divided in two ''Kamers'' (English: Chambers). The [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] is known in Dutch as the ''Eerste Kamer'' (First Chamber) and its members as ''senatoren'', Senators. The [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], known in Dutch as the ''Tweede Kamer'' (Second Chamber), is the most important one. The important debates take place here. Also, the Second Chamber can edit proposed laws with amendments and it can propose laws itself. The Senate does not have these capabilities. Its function is a more technical reviewing of laws. It can only pass a law or reject it. Both chambers are in [[The Hague]] which is the seat of parliament but not the official capital of the Netherlands, which is [[Amsterdam]].

The 150 members of the House of Representatives are elected by general elections every 4 years (or earlier if the government falls). The 75 members of the Senate are elected indirectly. The members of the 12 provincial Parliaments and the councils of the three Caribbean ''[[Caribbean Netherlands|special municipalities]]'' elect the senators. The value of a vote of a member of a provincial Parliament is weighted by the population of the province. Provincial Parliaments, the [[States-Provincial]], are elected by general elections every four years; a new Senate is elected three months after the provincial elections.

=== Norway ===
A member of Parliament is an elected member of the ''[[Storting]]et''. They are called ''stortingsrepresentanter'' (literal translation: ''Representatives of the Storting''). Since 2009, Norway has had a unicameral Parliament, which previously consisted of ''[[Odelstinget]]'' and ''[[Lagtinget]]'', Odelstinget with three-quarters, or 127, of the total 169 members, Lagtinget with the remainder. The dividing of the Parliament into chambers was only used when dealing with passing regular laws and in cases of prosecution by the national court (''riksrett''). In other matters, such as passing the national budget or changing the constitution (the latter requiring a majority of two-thirds), the chambers were united.

The members of the unicameral [[Parliament of Norway]] are chosen by popular vote for a parliamentary period of four years.

=== Philippines ===
{{further information|Batasang Pambansa}}
From 1978 to 1984, the Philippine Parliament was called the ''[[Batasang Pambansa]]'' (National Assembly), and its elected members were called ''Mambabatas Pambansa'' (National Assemblyman), often shortened to "MP".

=== Poland ===

=== Portugal ===
A member of Parliament is known as ''deputado'', a person who is appointed after democratic election to act on people's behalf. The parliament is called ''[[Assembleia da República]]''.

=== Spain ===
{{See also|List of members of the Congress of Deputies (Spain)}}

The word '''''parlamento''''' -of the same origin as Parliament in English- is used as a common name for all legislative assemblies, and hence '''''parlamentario''''' for the member of any of them, which can usually refer to members of:
* both chambers of the national legislature ([[Cortes Generales]]), the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]].
* the regional devolved legislatures of the [[Autonomous Communities]].
* the European Parliament.

Members of the Congress of Deputies are called ''diputados'' (deputies), impliying that they are elected to act in the name and on behalf of the people they represent. It is also usual to call members of the European Parliament ''eurodiputados''.

=== Sweden ===
{{See also|Riksdag|List of members of the Riksdag, 2014–18}}

''Members of Parliament'' refers to the elected [[List of members of the Swedish Riksdag|members]] of the [[Riksdag]]. In Swedish, an MP is usually referred to as a ''riksdagsledamot'' (''member of the Riksdag'') or a ''riksdagsman'' (''Gentleman of the Riksdag''). The former is in more common use today, especially in official contexts, due its status as a [[unisex]] word, while the latter was used more often historically and literally refers to a male MP exclusively.

The parliament is a unicameral assembly with 349 members who are chosen every four years in [[Elections in Sweden|general elections]]. To become an MP, a person must be entitled to vote (i.e. be a Swedish [[Citizenship|citizen]], be at least 18 years old and be or have been resident in Sweden) and must be nominated by a [[List of political parties in Sweden|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riksdagen.se/templates/R_Page____770.aspx |title=Members and parties |accessdate=6 January 2008|date=3 October 2006|publisher=[[Parliament of Sweden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPs are elected by proportionality in constituencies across the nation. To decide which candidate will be elected the [[Sainte-Laguë method|modified Sainte-Laguë method]] is used. This method usually but not always gives an accurate result in proportion to cast votes. In the [[Swedish parliamentary election, 2014|2014 general election]] the center-right coalition government got one less MP than the overall opposition, in despite of more votes in total.  To get a more proportional result 39 MPs are elected at compensation mandate (''Utjämningsmandat'') and those MPs therefore doesn't represent their own constituency.

The salaries of the MPs are decided by the [[Riksdag Pay Committee]] (''Riksdagens arvodesnämnd''), a [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agency]] under the Riksdag. Since 1 November 2007, the basic monthly pay of an MP is [[Swedish krona|SEK]]52,900 (ca. US$6,500). The pay of the [[Speaker of the parliament of Sweden|Speaker]] is SEK126,000 a month (ca.

The '''Ministry of National Defense''' ('''MND''', {{lang-ko|국방부}}) is a department within the government of [[South Korea]] (ROK) and responsible for the military branches of South Korea.

"Yongsan-dong 3 Ga, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, 140-701"&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry was established following the foundation of ROK in 1948, superseding the '''Department of Internal Security''' (DIS, {{lang|ko|국내경비부}}) in charge of Korean armed forces under the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|United States Army Military Government]] (USAMGIK) during the Allied occupation era.&lt;ref name="대한민국역사박물관"&gt;{{Citation |language=ko |title=대한민국 정부수립과 국가체제 구축 연구용역 : 용역 최종보고서 |chapter=&lt;제6주제-국방&gt; 대한민국 국군의 창설과 성장, 1945~1955: ‘創軍史’에서 ‘建軍史’로 |author=나종남 |publisher=[[National Museum of Korean Contemporary History]] |page=220 |date=2013 &lt;!--|isbn=978-89-98443-36-8 93060--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2002, the '''National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance''' (NCNR) is a network of individuals and organizations in the United States committed to ending the war in Iraq, using the nonviolent practices and disciplines of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] through nonviolent resistance.

According to its Website, the coalition failed to prevent the start of the Iraq War in March 2003, but it continues "to engage in nonviolent direct action to end the war and the occupation. The group was founded as the Iraq Pledge of Resistance, and in expanding its focus, became the National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance.

"As a group with lots of direct action experience, NCNR has consistently encouraged organizations and individuals to recognize the difference between civil disobedience and [[civil resistance]].  We see the difference as being important in the struggle for nonviolent, positive social change."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraqpledge.org National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of breaking unjust laws in order to bring attention to injustice, actions organized and initiated by NCNR focus on highlighting the illegal policies and practices of the government and elected and appointed decision makers. Typically NCNR participants go to court in order to continue to speak out against the unlawful conduct of government officials in pursuing aggressive wars.

Among the largest and most significant of NCNR's acts of civil resistance was the September 26, 2005 action at the White House sidewalk, with [[Cindy Sheehan]], following a major anti-war mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4284684.stm US anti-war mother held at rally], (Sept., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[United for Peace and Justice]] joined and promoted this action, it was mostly organized by NCNR.

Other NCNR nonviolent civil resistance actions have included acting with Christian Peace Witness - Iraq in September 2006,&lt;ref&gt;CNN, [http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/09/26/dc.protests/index.html], (Sept., 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and a campaign around funding for the Iraq war with [[Kathy Kelly]]'s Voices for Creative Nonviolence dubbed the Occupation Project in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Common Dreams, [http://www.commondreams.org/views07/0108-30.htm] (Jan., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

NCNR has a close-knit organizing committee, and typically one convener to help facilitate organizing calls and speak for the network. NCNR's first convener was [[Gordon Clark (activist)]].&lt;ref&gt;AlterNet, [http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/58426] (Aug., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Other peace activists associated with NCNR are [[Eve Tetaz]], [[Malachy Kilbride]] and [[Pete Perry]].

The '''National Democrats''' (ND) was a [[nationalism|nationalist]] party in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK). Former party Chairman [[Ian Anderson (British politician)|Ian Anderson]] died on 2 February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;''Searchlight'' magazine, issue 429, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the party was de-registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 10 March 2011.

==Formation==
The party evolved out of the [[Flag Group]] wing of the [[British National Front]] (NF), which gained control of the NF during the early 1990s. Party leader Ian Anderson sought to change the name of the NF to the National Democrats. 72% of the membership voted for the change in a postal ballot; by changing the name it was hoped to avoid the connotations associated with the NF name.&lt;ref&gt;John Rentoul, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/new-name-just-a-front-for-national-democrats-1591795.html "New name just a Front for 'National Democrats'"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 July 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the move was resisted by other NF members and so the National Democrats came into existence as a new party.

==History==
The party contested two parliamentary by-elections in 1996. In [[Hemsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemsworth]], Mike Cooper received 111 votes (0.5%) and, in [[South East Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Staffordshire]], Sharron Edwards received 358 votes (0.8%).&lt;ref name=by92&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/by1992.html Results of byelections in the 1992-97 Parliament], ''election.demon.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NDs never took part in regularly scheduled European elections, it did contest the [[Merseyside West (European Parliament constituency)|Merseyside West]] by-election in which [[Simon Darby]] stood but only gained 718 votes (1.2%).&lt;ref name=MW96&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/epe2.html European Parliament elections], ''election.demon.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], the party contested 21 seats and received a total of 10,829 votes, compared to 35,832 for its rivals in the [[British National Party]] (BNP), and 2,719 votes for the NF. The party's best result was in [[West Bromwich West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Bromwich West]], where Steven Edwards received 11.4% of the vote. However, this was not a normal constituency, since this was the constituency of then House Speaker [[Betty Boothroyd]], which major parties by convention do not contest. The party was severely damaged immediately before the 1997 election when it was revealed by ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that leading member Andy Carmichael was working for [[MI5]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chasepost.net/news-in-cannock/tm_objectid=16739344&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=75673-name_page.html "Former MI5 spy - I was a rent boy"], ''Cannock Chase Post'', 22 February 2006. (Archive retrieved 15 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Where the West Midlands had been a stronghold, it now began to fall apart, and in 1998, the local branch, which included leading ND activist Simon Darby, defected to the BNP, leaving only a small number of party loyalists behind. The party did not nominate candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]].

In the early 1990s, the National Front was left a legacy of almost one hundred thousand pounds by a party supporter. Following the 1995 name change to the National Democrats the legacy remained with the National Democrats under the control of Ian Anderson. The money was spent on the purchase of Britannia House - the building doubled as party HQ and the site of Anderson’s printing business.&lt;ref name="normal-ish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eddybutler.blogspot.com/2012/03/normal-ish-service-resumed.html?showComment=1331577765707#c3480085572827223302 |title=Normal-ish service resumed |publisher=Eddy Butler |date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Democrats attempted to give the impression of attracting a mass membership. It never did; most people who left the NF joined the BNP instead, resulting in the legacy being used for election work and costly deposits all of which were lost. The party printed a glossy monthly magazine called ''Vanguard'' that was edited by Blackburn-based Stephen Ebbs which lost money on every print and was subsidised by legacy cash.&lt;ref name="normal-ish"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natdems.org.uk/vanguard.htm |title=Vanguard Magazine |publisher= |date=14 December 2001 |accessdate=4 August 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011214024237/http://www.natdems.org.uk/vanguard.htm |archivedate=14 December 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of the former NF paper, ''The Flag'', continued, now in support of the new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natdems.org.uk/the_flag.htm |title=The Flag Newspaper |publisher= |date=5 February 2002 |accessdate=4 August 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020205053438/http://www.natdems.org.uk/the_flag.htm |archivedate=5 February 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-paedophile campaign==
In January 1998, Ian Anderson accompanied members of the anti-paedophile campaign People Power when they delivered a letter to Downing Street demanding tougher action against child abusers.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,354859,00.html |title=Anti-paedophile group is linked to National Front |work=The Guardian |date=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in attendance were other extreme right wingers, including Paul Ballard of the BNP and Bill Binding, exposed by [[Searchlight (magazine)|''Searchlight'']] as a leader of the British branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and a former BNP parliamentary candidate. A plan to hand out extreme right-wing literature was abandoned when [[Curtis Sliwa]], leader of the [[Guardian Angels]] vigilante group, turned up with members, some of whom were non-white. People Power’s literature was produced by Ian Anderson, from his printing business in [[Dagenham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophile-campaign-infiltrated-1150285.html |title=Paedophile campaign infiltrated |work=The Independent on Sunday |date=15 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the National Democrats set up a website called Paedophile Watch to "out" suspected child abusers with leaflets and demonstrations. The site also listed newspaper reports containing the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352588/Anti-paedophile-group-is-linked-to-National-Front.html |title=Anti-paedophile group is linked to National Front |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters from the ''News of the World'' sought information from Ian Anderson for their "name and shame" stunt.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

By 2000, the National Democrats had ceased to exist with only the ''Flag'' newspaper being published as an independent publication, without reference to the National Democrats or the Campaign for National Democracy.&lt;ref name="normal-ish"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-flag.co.uk/ |title=The Flag |publisher= |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705001451/http://www.the-flag.co.uk/ |archivedate=5 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the beginning of 2002, the party continued as a pressure group under the name '''Campaign for National Democracy''';&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020328180857/http://www.natdems.org.uk/ National Democrats website], 24 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080501130258/http://www.natdems.org.uk/ last known National Democrats website], May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The party officially ceased to exist after the death of its leader at the beginning of 2011.

{{Humanism}}
The '''Norwegian Humanist Association''' ({{lang-no|Human-Etisk Forbund}}, HEF) is one of the largest [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] associations in the world, with 84,300 members.&lt;ref name="Trus- og livssynssamfunn utanfor Den norske kyrkja, 1. januar 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/trosamf/|title= Trus- og livssynssamfunn utanfor Den norske kyrkja, 1. januar 2013|work=Statistics Norway|language=Norwegian Bokmål|accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those members constitute 1.7% of the national population of 5,038,100,&lt;ref name="Population"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/befolkning_en/|title=Population|work=Statistics Norway|accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the HEF by far the largest such association in the world in proportion to population.

Founded in 1956, the HEF is a member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU). The Norwegian Humanist Association is an organisation for people who base their ethics on human, not religious values. Most members are agnostics or atheists. HEF supports the following statement of the IHEU: 

:Humanism is a democratic, non-theistic and ethical life stance which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their lives and therefore reject supernatural views of reality.

Former HEF secretary general, [[Levi Fragell]], was president of the IHEU (1988–2003) and is Chair of IHEU’s Committee for Growth and Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/1230 |accessdate=December 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003183246/http://www.iheu.org/node/1230 |archivedate=October 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2007 [[Åse Kleveland]] became [[Chair (official)|chairman of the Board]] of the organization.

According to its bylaws, the organization works to ensure access to humanist ceremonies and spreading knowledge of humanism. The organization previously also worked for a [[separation of church and state]] (the [[Lutheranism|Evangelical-Lutheran]] [[Church of Norway]] was the [[state church]] of Norway until 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[[Finngeir Hiorth]] (1997): [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/finngeir_hiorth/norway.html Church and State in Norway]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Secular coming of age ceremony#Norway|civil confirmation]] organized by HEF has gained popularity among the Norwegian young during recent years. About 17 percent of Norwegian 15-year-olds are now taking part in HEF's civil confirmation.

On July 9, 2006 a prominent member of the Norwegian Humanist Association, Mr. Jens Brun-Pedersen, called for prime minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] to advocate the separation of church and state. He argued that the second article of the [[constitution of Norway]] which defines the "Evangelical-Lutheran Religion" as "the [[State religion|official religion]] of the State" and the 12th article of the constitution which requires half of the [[Minister (government)|ministers]] of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] to be members of the state church is [[Discrimination|discriminatory]], and that Norway can't criticise countries advocating [[sharia]] law when the constitution favours Lutheran members of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Visionary or missionary?'' - Jens Brun-Pedersen, [[Dagbladet]] July 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian Humanist Association hosted the 18th [[World Humanist Congress]] of the IHEU. The Congress was held at the Oslo Congress Center in Oslo, Norway, on the 12–14 August 2011. The theme was Humanism and Peace. HEF also hosted the 3rd in 1962 and the 9th in 1986.

Although raising public awareness of skepticism is not a primary goal of the Norwegian Humanist Association, an online campaign was organized in 2011 called Ingen liker å bli lurt (No one likes to be fooled) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Begynner du a fa nok? |url=http://ingenlikerablilurt.no |website=Ingen Lider A Bli Lurt |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to media debate of the issues.  The campaign was kicked off by three appearances in Norway by [[James Randi]], a Canadian-American retired stage magician and a scientific skeptic who has extensively challenged paranormal and pseudo scientific claims.

A [[youth wing]] of the HEF, Norwegian Humanist Youth (''Humanistisk Ungdom''), was founded in August 2007. The current President of the Board is Anders Garbom Backe (for the period 2013-2014).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
The '''open society''' was conceived in 1932 by French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;• Henri Bergson ([1932] 1937).  ''Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion'', [[wikisource:fr:Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion/Chapitre I|ch. I, pp. 1-103,]] &amp; [[wikisource:fr:Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion/Chapitre IV|ch. IV, pp.  287–343]]. Félix Alcan.&lt;br /&gt;• Translated as ([1935] 1977), ''[https://archive.org/stream/twosourcesofmora033499mbp#page/n1/mode/2up The Two Sources of Morality and Religion]''  Internet Archive (left or right arrow buttons select succeeding pages), pp. 18-27, 45-65, 229-34.&lt;!-- these excerpts distinguish between closed &amp; open societies. 6/20/2017 --&gt;, trs., R. A. Audra and C. Brereton, with assistance of W. H. Carter. Macmillan press, Notre Dame.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leszek Kołakowski]], ''Modernity on Endless Trial'' (1997), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was further developed during the Second World War by Austrian-born British philosopher [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', 2 vols. ([1945] 1966), 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A. N. Wilson]], ''Our Times'' (2008), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bergson describes a '''closed society''' as a closed system of law or religion.  It is static, like a [[closed mind]].&lt;ref name=mautner&gt;Thomas Mautner (2005), 2nd ed. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'' ["open society" entry], p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson suggests that if all traces of civilization were to disappear, the instincts of the closed society for including or excluding others would remain.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, '' The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'', pp. [https://archive.org/stream/twosourcesofmora033499mbp#page/n1/mode/2up 20-21.] 1935, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;   In contrast, an open society is dynamic and inclined to [[moral universalism]].&lt;ref name=mautner/&gt;

Popper saw the open society as part of a historical continuum reaching from the organic, [[tribe|tribal]], or [[Authoritarianism|closed society]], through the open society marked by a critical attitude to tradition, to the abstract or depersonalized society lacking all [[face-to-face interaction]] transactions.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'' (1945), v 1:1 and 174–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In open societies, the [[government]] is expected to be responsive and tolerant, and its political mechanisms [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]] and flexible.  It can be characterized as opposed to [[authoritarianism]].&lt;!-- This paragraph is borderline incoherent and deeply questionable. "An insider of Vienna thinkers?" What does the open society have to do with Game Theory? What does Game Theory have to do with Vienna? Why is Thorstein Veblen cited, even though he died before the concept of Open Society was developed? Finally, his name is misspelt. The whole paragraph should be deleted. --&gt;

==History==
Popper saw the classical Greeks as initiating the long slow transition from tribalism towards the open society, and as facing for the first time the strain imposed by the less personal group relations entailed thereby.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:175–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas tribalistic and [[collectivism|collectivist]] societies do not distinguish between natural laws and social customs, so that individuals are unlikely to challenge traditions they believe to have a sacred or magical basis, the beginnings of an open society are marked by a distinction between natural and man-made law, and an increase in personal responsibility and accountability for moral choices (not incompatible with religious belief).&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 5, part III.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper argued that the ideas of individuality, criticism, and [[humanitarianism]] cannot be suppressed once people have become aware of them, and therefore that it is impossible to return to the closed society,&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 10, part VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time recognized the continuing emotional pull of what he called “the lost group spirit of tribalism”, as manifested for example in the [[totalitarianism]]s of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

While the period since Popper's study has undoubtedly been marked by the spread of the open society, this may be attributed less to Popper's advocacy and more to the role of the economic advances of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; Growth-based industrial societies require literacy, anonymity and social mobility from their members&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nationalism'' (1997), pp. 25–9&lt;/ref&gt; — elements incompatible with much traditional-based behavior but demanding the ever-wider spread of the abstract social relations [[Georg Simmel]] saw as characterizing the metropolitan mental stance.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000), pp. 260–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Popper defined the open society as one "in which individuals are confronted with personal decisions" as opposed to a "magical or tribal or collectivist society."&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 10, part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

He considered that only democracy provides an institutional mechanism for reform and leadership change without the need for bloodshed, [[revolution]] or [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern advocates of the open society suggest that [[society]] would keep no secrets from itself in the public sense, as all are trusted with the knowledge of all. [[Freedom (political)|Political freedoms]] and [[human rights]] are claimed to be the foundation of an open society.{{by whom|date=December 2011}}

==Critical knowledge==
Popper's concept of the open society is [[epistemological]] rather than political.&lt;ref name="Soros-2006"&gt;Soros, George, "The Age of Fallibility," ''Public Affairs'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; When Popper wrote ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', he believed that the social sciences had failed to grasp the significance and the nature of [[fascism]] and [[communism]] because these sciences were based on what he saw to be faulty epistemology.&lt;ref name="Popper-vol2-23-24"&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume Two'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapters 23 and 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Totalitarianism]] forced knowledge to become political which made critical thinking impossible and led to the destruction of knowledge in totalitarian countries.&lt;ref name="Popper-vol2-23-24"/&gt;

Popper's theory that knowledge is provisional and fallible implies that society must be open to alternative points of view. An open society is associated with [[cultural pluralism|cultural]] and [[religious pluralism]]; it is always open to improvement because knowledge is never completed but always ongoing: “if we wish to remain human, then there is only one way, the way into the open society... into the unknown, the uncertain and insecure”.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''closed society''', claims to certain knowledge and ultimate truth lead to the attempted imposition of one version of reality.  Such a society is closed to freedom of thought.  In contrast, in an open society each citizen needs to engage in critical thinking, which requires freedom of thought and expression and the cultural and legal institutions that can  facilitate this.&lt;ref name="Soros-2006"/&gt;

==Further characteristics==
[[Humanitarianism]], [[egalitarianism|equality]] and [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]] are ideally fundamental characteristics of an open society. This was recognized by [[Pericles]], a statesman of the [[Athenian democracy]], in his laudatory funeral oration: "advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life."&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pericles.htm Book II: Pericles' Funeral Oration].&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably however it was the tension between a traditional society and the new, more open space of the emerging ''polis'' which most fully marked classical Athens,&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ''et al.'', ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and Popper was very aware of the continuing emotional appeal of what he called "holism...longing for the lost unity of tribal life"&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:80&lt;/ref&gt; into the modern world.

== Caveats ==
Investor and philanthropist [[George Soros]], a self-described follower of Karl Popper,&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George, ''Soros on Soros'' (John Wiley and Sons, 1995), page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that sophisticated use of powerful techniques of subtle deception borrowed from modern advertising and cognitive science by conservative political operatives such as [[Frank Luntz]] and [[Karl Rove]] casts doubt on Popper's view of open society.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"&gt;Soros, George, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/soros36 "From Karl Popper to Karl Rove - and Back"], ''Project Syndicate'' (November 8, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the electorate's perception of reality can easily be manipulated, democratic political discourse does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt;  Soros argues that in addition to the need for separation of powers, free speech, and free elections, an explicit commitment to the pursuit of truth is imperative.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt; "Politicians will respect, rather than manipulate, reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliberate deception."&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt;

Popper however, did not identify the open society either with democracy or with capitalism or a ''laissez-faire'' economy, but rather with a critical frame of mind on the part of the individual, in the face of communal [[group think]] of whatever kind.&lt;ref&gt;I. C. Jarvie ''et al.'' eds., ''Popper's Open Society after fifty years'' (1999), pp. 43–6&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect in Popper's thinking is the notion that the truth can be lost. Critical attitude does not mean that the truth is found.

The '''Party of Democratic Socialism''' ('''PDS''') is a political party in West Bengal in India. The PDS was founded in February 2001 by former [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)) leaders [[Saifuddin Choudhury]] and [[Samir Putatundu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/oct/03saif.htm |title=Saifuddin Choudhury off CPI-M rolls |date=3 October 2000 |accessdate=19 March 2009|author=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDS was in opposition to the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] government in [[West Bengal]].

==History==
The PDS was founded by Saifuddin Chaudhury on 21 February 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20010309/ina09015.html |title=Former CPM rebel claims threat to life |author=SABYASACHI BANDOPADHYAY |date=9 March 2001 |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samir Putatunda, who had been expelled from CPI(M), joined the new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews |url=http://pd.cpim.org/2001/march11/march11_bengal2.htm |title=Putatunda Expelled From Party |date=11 March 2001 |accessdate=19 March 2009|publisher=People's Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliances==
Initially there was speculation that the PDS would joint with the [[All India Trinamool Congress]], or else that it would be a constituent of an anti-CPI(M) ''[[mahajot]]'' (broad front), but the link between Trinamool and the Hindu rightist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) hindered such a development.

The PDS has formed relations with other pro-Congress leftist outfits, such as the [[Communist Marxist Party]] in Kerala and the [[United Communist Party of India]]. PDS participates in the [[Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists]].[http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/09/stories/2005020906330400.htm]

==Elections==
Ahead of the [[West Bengal]] state assembly elections in 2001, the PDS had launched their own front. The PDS put up 98 candidates, who together got 219,082 votes (0.6% of the votes in the state). None of their candidates were elected.
Ahead of the [[Lok Sabha]] elections in 2004, the PDS had joined hands with Congress, and put up two candidates supported by Congress.

==Organisation==
The flag of the PDS is a red flag with a red star in a white circle. 
The president of the PDS is Saifuddin Chaudhury, the general secretary is [[Samir Putatundu]] (formerly the CPI(M) South 24 Paraganas district secretary), and the treasurer is [[Subir Chaudhury]].

The women's organization of the PDS is called ''Paschim Banga Nari Sanghati Samiti'' (West Bengal Women's United Association). The president of PBNSS is Kishwar Jahan.
The PDS publishes ''Natun Path'' (New Way).

The term '''People's Parliaments''' or '''People's Assemblies''' ({{lang-lv|Tautas Saeima}}, {{lang-lt|Liaudies Seimas}}) was used in 1940 for puppet legislatures put together after [[show election]]s in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] to legitimize the [[Occupation of the Baltic States|occupation by the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World encyclopedia of parliaments and legislatures |last=International Political Science Association.

==Occupation==
{{main|Occupation of the Baltic states}}
On June 15 and 16, 1940, Soviet Union presented ultimatums to all three [[Baltic states]], which were then invaded by the [[Red Army]]. After the invasion previous governments were replaced by pro-Communist "[[People's Government (disambiguation)|People's Government]]s". The new government then dismissed existing parliaments ([[Riigikogu]] in Estonia, [[Seimas]] in Lithuania) and announced new elections to the "People's Parliaments" to be held on July 14 and July 15, 1940 (originally, the election in Lithuania was to be held only on July 14, but due to low [[voter turnout|turnout]] was also extended to July 15).&lt;ref name=var&gt;{{cite book| first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |author2=Judith B.

==Elections==
{{see also|Estonian parliamentary election, 1940|Latvian parliamentary election, 1940|Lithuanian parliamentary election, 1940}}
Only candidates proposed by legally functioning institutions could run in each election. By that time all non-communist parties and organizations were outlawed.&lt;ref name=mis/&gt; The local Communist parties emerged from underground with 1,500 members in Lithuania, 500 in Latvia, and 133 in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The history of the Baltic States |last=O'Connor |first=Kevin |year=2003 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-32355-0 |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore only the Working People's Leagues proposed candidates, exactly one per each available seat. There were a number of non-communists on its slate. Efforts to present alternative candidates were blocked.&lt;ref name=mis/&gt; Repressions and terror were employed against election critics and political activists. For example, in Lithuania some 2,000 activists were arrested on June 11.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; People were coerced to vote – those who voted had their passports stamped&lt;ref name=mis/&gt; while anyone who did not vote was dubbed an "[[enemy of the people]]" and could expect future persecutions for "failing their political duties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Time | title=RUSSIA: Justice in The Baltic | date=1940-08-19 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764407,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballots had only one option – the name chosen by the Communists. According to the [[election fraud|rigged results]], Communist candidates received over 90% of the vote. The Soviet envoy in [[London]] released election results even before the voting booths closed.&lt;ref name=var/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mangulis |first=Visvaldis |title=Latvia in the Wars of the 20th century |url=http://www.historia.lv/publikacijas/gramat/mangulis/magulis_saturs.htm |year=1983 |publisher=Princeton Junction: Cognition Books |isbn=0-912881-00-3 |chapter=VIII.

==Parliament sessions and aftermath==
All three parliaments convened on July 21, 1940. On their first sessions all three parliaments unanimously adopted resolutions to convert their states to [[Soviet Socialist Republic]]s (SSR): the [[Estonian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], and [[Lithuanian SSR]]. Another decree resolved to petition the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] to accept these newly established SSRs into the Soviet Union. The parliaments also elected their representatives to go to Moscow and personally present their case in front of the Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; Other acts adopted in these early sessions concerned [[nationalization]] of virtually all larger enterprises, real estate, and land, and other [[Sovietization]] policies.&lt;ref name=mis/&gt; The laws were adopted with virtually no discussion and unanimously.

On August 1, the Baltic delegates arrived to Moscow and petitioned the Supreme Soviet. After apparent deliberation, the Lithuanian request was granted on August 3, the Latvian request on August 5, and the Estonian request on August 6.&lt;ref name=mis/&gt; As a result the People's Parliaments renamed themselves Supreme Soviets of the respective SSRs. Thus the process of legitimizing the occupation was complete.&lt;ref name=var/&gt; Even after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russia officially maintains that all three Baltic states voluntarily joined the Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cold Peace |last=Bugajski |first=Janusz |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-275-98362-5 |page=109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOeeyIT6B4wC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Puerto Rico Health Reform''' {{mdash}}{{lang-es|Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico}}, and locally referred to simply as ''La Reforma'' (The Reform) {{mdash}} is a government-run program which provides medical and healthcare services to indigent and [[impoverished]] citizens of [[Puerto Rico]] by means of contracting private [[health insurance]] companies, as opposed to the traditional system of government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration and, as of December 31, 2005, provides healthcare coverage to over 1.5 million Puerto Ricans,&lt;ref name="Form_10K"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1171662/000095014406002885/g00487e10vk.htm Triple-S Management Corporation Annual Report (Form 10-K)] for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2005, pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, accessed on November 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; equal to 37.5% of the island population.

Please note:  The information in this description is so out-dated as to be useless and prejudicial for any insight into Puerto Rico's current provision of medical care to the citizens.  Perhaps there is no one ready to update this history.  

==History==

Puerto Rico's indigent population has relied exclusively on the [[Government of Puerto Rico|local government]] for their healthcare needs since the start of the island's [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth status]]. The government maintained several hospitals, emergency centers, and [[free clinic]]s, including the Rio Piedras Medical Center (''Centro Médico'' in Spanish) which is considered the largest hospital on the island and one of the largest in the Caribbean. However, this system presented substantial costs to the government while generating increasing criticism from the public and media citing a sluggish bureaucracy and poor services from unprofessional government workers. 

In 1994, then [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] [[Pedro Rosselló]] proposed and implemented the privatization of the public health system under the name "Health Reform". The privatization plan included selling the government-owned hospitals and medical centers to local and United States investors and then implementing a universal free and/or low-cost health insurance plan for poor and needy citizens. The only exception to the Reform was that mental health benefits and services were to be provided by behavioral healthcare and mental healthcare companies, and not by insurance carriers.

The privatization plan required the service population to be divided into geographical areas with each area assigned to a sole insurance carrier by means of a services contract awarded through competitive bidding and proposals. The designation and assignment of geographical areas were finalized in 2001. Subsequent to 1994, all government hospitals and medical centers were sold to private companies and investors, including local medical groups and companies composed of doctors. The only exception to the privatization plan was that the Rio Piedras Medical Center would be (and still is) run by the commonwealth government.

The privatization plan has met subsequent criticisms from different industry and public sectors, who argue that the plan was marred with [[government corruption]]. Several politicians, private investors, and government employees have been accused and/or convicted of perpetrating bribery and extortion schemes during the selling and acquisition of government medical centers. One of the most famous convictions was that of prominent [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] legislator [[Edison Misla Aldarondo]].

==Current status==
The three largest insurance companies operating in Puerto Rico are currently the only ones participating in the Reform. These are [[Triple-S, Inc.]] with 40.4% of the Reform beneficiaries, [[Medical Card Systems]] (MCS) with 33.5%, and [[Humana]] with 26.1%.&lt;ref name="Form_10K"/&gt;

The Reform has faced criticism because of the increasing costs associated with the system. Under the administration of Gov. [[Sila Calderón]], the government tried to cut back on services and eliminated many participants from the program in an effort to curtail expenditures. However, the program still requires a substantial amount of funds to cover its $1.4 billion annual expenditures (2005).&lt;ref name="PR_FS"&gt;[http://hacienda.gobierno.pr Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 2005 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report] for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2005; pg. 38; Combining Statement of Activities: Major Component Units; Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration (line item)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 alone, only $400 million was generated from participant deductibles and charges for services to cover program expenses, while the remaining $1 billion in expenses was covered by a subsidy provided by the state government.&lt;ref name="PR_FS"/&gt;

These criticisms and fallbacks have led the government to implement more stringent controls over the operations of the Reform as well as to diversify the way it provides services to beneficiaries. A pilot project began in 2003 whereby the government contracted the services of one area directly to a medical healthcare provider instead of contracting an insurance company, and the government has stated that this and other programs may be implemented and expanded in the future in order to reduce costs.&lt;ref name="Form_10K"/&gt; However, some politicians, including former Gov. Pedro Rosselló, are campaigning to create a [[universal health care]] system by expanding the reform program to all citizens that lack a private insurance plan.

'''E. R. Nele''' (born 15 March 1932) is a German sculptor famous for [[goldsmith]]ing and large scale metal sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;A concise history of modern sculpture.
Sir Herbert Edward Read. Praeger, 1964. Page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Nele was born in [[Berlin]], the daughter of Marie-Louise (1908–1989) and [[Arnold Bode]] (1900–1977). She started her career in 1950 as a student of the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] in London. She participated in ''[[Documenta]] II'', organised by her father in 1959. She joined the [[Situationist International]], but was excluded in February 1962.

She learned to handle all sorts of metal and to weld steel for her artwork. After her return to Berlin she worked with the artist Hans Uhlmann during her time at the "Berliner Akademie" and later on at the "Studio Lacourière" in Paris. Since the late 1960s, Nele has lived and worked in [[Frankfurt]]. Since the early 1990s she has been teaching at the Universities of Frankfurt and Giessen.

Her best-known sculpture is named ''Die Rampe'', a [[Holocaust]] memorial dated from 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJpUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Die+Rampe+sculpture&amp;dq=Die+Rampe+sculpture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PeaGTPGOK4WglAeS_sGUDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg |title=Contemporary Artists: A-K |author=St. Sara Pendergast, Tom Pendergast|publisher= St. James Press |year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her latest metal sculpture at large scale is now located at the Dalbergplatz in Frankfurt-Höchst and named ''Windsbraut''.

E. R. Nele was awarded with the [[Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft|Goetheplakette]] from the hands of the city's governing mayor [[Petra Roth]] on 12 September 2008 in the historic "Limpurgsaal". The Goetheplakette is awarded annually since 1947. Other awarded persons have been to date Horst-Eberhard Richter, Albert Speer, Thomas Bayrle and others.

The '''Scottish Labour Party''' (SLP) was a socialist party in Scotland that was active 1976–1981. It formed as a breakaway from the UK [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. It won three council seats in 1977 but lost its MPs at the 1979 election and was dissolved two years later.

==History==
The party formed on 18 January 1976 as a breakaway from the UK [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], by members disaffected with the then Labour Government's failure to secure a devolved [[Scottish Assembly]], as well as with its social and economic agenda. The formation of the SLP was led by [[Jim Sillars]], then MP for [[South Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Ayrshire]], [[John Robertson (Paisley MP)|John Robertson]], then MP for [[Paisley (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley]] and [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]], the UK Labour Party's senior Scottish researcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c5JAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BaUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3766%2C2899772 |title=Rebels queue to join Sillars’s rebels |first=William |last= Clark |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=19 January 1976 |page=1 |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The split came just before the resignation of [[Harold Wilson]] as prime minister and party leader and the election of [[James Callaghan]] as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge79.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979 the Scottish Labour Party had lost its seats in the House of Commons, and in 1981 it was formally disbanded.

Almost immediately the SLP became the focus for [[entryism]] from the [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG), and at the party's first congress in October 1976 the IMG was expelled, along with a number of branches whose members were not associated with the IMG.  According to Henry Drucker's account, the IMG's role was rather limited; Sillars used this as an excuse for purging anyone he did not see entirely eye-to-eye with or represented a significant threat to his leadership.

The expellees formed a rival Scottish Labour Party (Democratic Wing), and this in turn later renamed itself the Scottish Socialist League (SSL). Gradually, those members of the SSL who had not been associated with the IMG drifted out, and the SSL was reabsorbed into the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Reunified Fourth International|Fourth International]].

The SLP had little electoral success, winning only three council seats at the [[Scottish District local elections, 1977|1977 local elections]]. It polled only 583 votes in the [[Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978|Garscadden by-election in 1978]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], the SLP fought three seats, including Sillars' attempt at being re-elected (Robertson chose to step down). Sillars came close to retaining his seat in South Ayrshire, but this was clearly a personal vote built up over the years he had already served as an MP, as the other two candidates polled poorly indeed.

This failure prompted the SLP to disband; and members either fell out of active politics, re-joined the Labour Party, or chose to join the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), which both Sillars and Neil did, with both rising to high office in the SNP.

The SLP adventure is generally looked upon as an ambitious failure, but Sillars has himself put this down to a lack of planning before the decision to launch the party. Unlike the SLP, the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) meticulously planned their breakaway from the Labour Party, and were much more successful. Sillars has claimed that the SLP did at least provide a forerunner to the SNP's later dialogue with the left.

The SLP had a number of members who would later go on to achieve a name for themselves as a mainstream Labour politician, including [[John McAllion]] who became MP and then MSP for [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]], [[Maria Fyfe]] one time MP for [[Glasgow Maryhill (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill]], [[Colin Boyd, Baron Boyd of Duncansby|Colin Boyd]], later [[Lord Advocate]], Sheriff Shiona Waldron, and [[Charlie Gordon]], later MSP for [[Glasgow Cathcart (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]]. These individuals chose to join (or in some cases re-join) the Labour Party rather than follow Sillars into the SNP.

{{italic title}}
'''''Sweden: The Middle Way''''' is a book by [[Marquis Childs]], an American [[journalist]], chronicling his research on the reform policies of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] based on his visits to the country as a reporter.  First published in 1936, the book became an international bestseller, attracting wide attention to Childs' account of the Swedish economic and social system.  Although later discredited to some degree as overly sweeping in its generalities, undercritical, and for other inaccuracies, the book is still considered influential in the way Sweden is viewed around the world.

In his early 30's at the time of the book's publication, Childs went on to win the 1969 [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Distinguished Commentary, the first person to win that award.

==The Book==
Childs' argument in the book was that Sweden had adopted an effective compromise between the two political extremes of the day: the United States and Russia ([USSR]).&lt;ref&gt;Arter, David (1999). ''Scandinavian Politics Today''.  Manchester University, Pg. 145-46. {{ISBN|0-7190-5133-9}}. ("When in spring 1936 the young American journalist Marquis Childs published a short volume on the reform policies of the Swedish Social Democratic Party entitled Sweden: The Middle Way it became a surprising best-seller.  It was penned at the time of the Great Depression, when over 20 million Americans were out of work and faith in the capitalist system had been severely shaken.  In sharp contrast, in the totalitarian systems of fascist Germany and communist Russia, Hitler and Stalin claimed that everybody had a job.  It was against this backdrop of capitalism in crisis, on the one hand, and the pretensions of the illiberal regimes of right and left, on the other, that Sweden's Third way appeared to offer salvation by demonstrating that it was possible to create a society in which full employment, social security and equality could be combined with democracy and respect for individual rights.  Following Childs's analysis, Sweden became not just another state but a model for other states, its solidary 'people's home' respected as a shining example of [[consensus politics]] and the product of an historic compromise between capital and labour.  Sweden became the epitome of an egalitarian culture and pragmatic style of politics that many yearned to emulate."&lt;/ref&gt;   Bridging the gap between the "concentration of economic power in the hands of a few men" in the United States and "the trials and hardships in Russia," Sweden seemed to have been able to address its social problems while retaining economic viability, primarily through its combination of a strong cooperative movement and active government involvement in managing the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlsson, Per T. ''Sweden: Still The Middle Way?''.  A talk presented at Columbia University on September 28, 2006.  http://www.columbia.edu/cu/swedish/events/fall06/PTOChilds92806Web.doc Retrieved on 3/22/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Reaction==
The most prominent reaction to the book came from President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], who in June 1936 had dispatched a commission to Europe to study the prevalent use of cooperatives there.  In a press conference, Roosevelt told reporters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I became a good deal interested in the cooperative development in countries abroad, especially Sweden.  A very interesting book came out a couple of months ago — ''The Middle Way''. I was tremendously interested in what they had done in Scandinavia along those lines.  In Sweden, for example, you have a royal family and a Socialist Government and a capitalist system, all working happily side by side.  Of course, to be sure, it is a smaller country than ours; but they have conducted some very interesting and, so far, very successful experiments.  They have these cooperative movements existing happily and successfully alongside of private industry and distributions of various kinds, both of them making money.  I thought it was at least worthy of study from our point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, C. Vann. (1997).  ''The Comparative Approach to American History''.  Oxford, Pg. 302. {{ISBN|0-19-511260-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Already a best-seller before Roosevelt got interested in the book, the president's comments  fortified its stature as one of the best-known American non-fiction books of the second half of the 1930s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5286">The '''Thirty Years' Peace''' was a treaty, signed between the [[ancient Greek]] city-states [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]], in the year 446/445 BCE.  The treaty brought an end to the conflict commonly known as the [[First Peloponnesian War]], which had been raging since c. 460 BCE.

==Overview==
The purpose of the treaty was to prevent another outbreak of war. Ultimately, the peace treaty failed in achieving its goal, with the outbreak of the Second [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BCE.

Athens was forced to give up all of her possessions in the Peloponnese which included the Megarian ports of [[Nisaea]] and [[Pegae]] with [[Troezen]] and [[Achaea]] in [[Argolis (ancient region)|Argolis]]; however, the Spartans agreed to allow the Athenians to keep [[Naupactus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, Nigel. “The Inter-War Years 480-431 BC”;The Peloponnesian War: Athens, Sparta and the Struggle for Greece. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2006. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  This also ruled out armed conflict between Sparta and Athens if at least one of the two wanted arbitration.  Neutral poleis could join either side (i.e. Sparta or Athens) and this implies that there was a formalized list of allies for each side.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Donald. “The Great Rivilary”; The Peloponnesian War. New York: Viking,    2003. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Athens and Sparta would keep all other territories pending arbitration.  It also recognized both Leagues as legitimate, a boost for Athens and its newly formed empire in the Aegean.

The Thirty Years' Peace, however, only lasted 15 years. It ended when the Spartans had declared war on the Athenians. During the peace the Athenians took steps in undermining the truce. Athens participated in the dispute over [[Epidamnus]] and [[Corcyra]] in 435 BC, which angered the Corinthians, who were allies of Sparta. Athens put into effect trade sanctions against the Spartan ally [[Megara]] due to its participation in the Corinthian/Corcyran dispute. In the year 432, Athens attacked [[Potidaea]], which was a listed ally but a Corinthian colony. These disputes prompted the Spartans to declare that the Athenians had violated the treaty, thus declaring war.  At this point the Thirty Years' Peace was void and the second Peloponnesian War (commonly known as the [[Peloponnesian War]]) began.

==The Samian Rebellion==
{{main|Samian War}}
[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|right|300px|thumb|The Delian League in 431 BC]]
The Thirty Years' Peace was first tested in 440 BC, when Athens's powerful ally [[Samos]] [[Samian War|rebelled]] from its alliance with Athens. The rebels quickly secured the support of a Persian [[satrap]], and Athens found itself facing the prospect of revolts throughout the empire. If the Spartans intervened at that moment they would be able to crush the Athenians, who were in a vulnerable situation, however when the Spartans called a convention to discuss whether or not they should go to war the congress decided not to go to war. The Corinthians were notable for opposing the war with the Athenians.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Donald. “Enter Athens”; The Peloponnesian War. New York: Viking, 2003. p. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Corcyra]] and Corinth==
[[File:Trireme.jpg|thumb| Ancient Greek triremes that composed the navy of Athens, Corcyra and Corinth.]]

The war between [[Corcyra]] and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] caused trouble in the peace and was one of the immediate causes of the end of the Thirty years peace and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The quarrel was over the small distant land, [[Epidamnus]]. Corcyra went to Athens to ask for help. Their argument was that there were three fleets worthy of mention in Greece: the Athenian fleet, the Corcyraean fleet, and the Corinthian fleet; if the Corinthians were to get control of the Corcyraean fleet first, Athens would see two of them become one, and it will have to fight against the Corcyraean and the Peloponnesian fleets at once. If Athens accepted the Corcyraean request to join forces, they would be able to fight the Peloponnesian with the help of the Corcyraean fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides., and Steven Lattimore. The Peloponnesian War. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Corinthian counter-argument was: Although it says in the treaty that any unenrolled cities may join whichever side it likes, the clause is not meant for those who join one side with the intention of hurting the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides., and Steven Lattimore. The Peloponnesian War. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenian decision was to enter into an alliance that was defensive only (epimachia) instead of a full offensive and defensive commitment that was usual in a Greek alliance (symmachia) a proposal was made to. This was the first such relationship we hear of in Greek history.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Donald. “Enter Athens”; The Peloponnesian War. New York: Viking, 2003. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
This decision led to war with Corinthians.

The [[Battle of Sybota]] was one of the battles that spurred out of the conflict. The Athenians were forced to fight the Corinthians and that further hurt the peace.

[[Image:Omo pirim logo.png|thumb|left|200px|The party logo]]
'''United Macedonian Organisation: Ilinden–Pirin''' (Обединена македонска организация: Илинден–Пирин) is a [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] [[organisation]] in [[Bulgaria]], whose self-declared aims are protection of the [[human rights]], [[language]] and [[nationality]] of the Macedonian minority in the country. In Bulgaria itself the organization is regarded as a foreign government-funded separatist organization.

In 1999, the organisation was registered as a [[political party]] and took part in the municipal elections the same year. The party polled approximately 3,000 votes in the party's core region, [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (Pirin Macedonia), in line with the number of self-declared ethnic [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] in the region according to the latest Bulgarian census (3,100 in 2001). The party received, however, almost no votes in the rest of the country.

On February 29, 2000, by decision of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court, UMO Ilinden–Pirin was expelled from the Bulgarian [[political system]], as a [[separatism|separatist]] party. On November 25, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], condemned [[Bulgaria]] because of violations of the OMO Ilinden–Pirin's freedom of organising [[meeting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tharwaproject.com/node/3038 European Court Condemns Ban on Bulgarian Party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095539/http://www.tharwaproject.com/node/3038 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that Bulgaria had violated Act 11 from the [[European Convention of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bghelsinki.org/press/2005/10_20e.htm Two ECHR judgments find Bulgaria violated freedom of assembly and association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828013126/http://www.bghelsinki.org/press/2005/10_20e.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2006, the party held a new founding meeting and provoked some controversy in the Bulgarian media. The meeting was held in the southwestern town of [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Gotse Delchev]] despite an [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Bulgarian National Movement|IMRO-BNM]] protest demonstration. IMRO-BNM deputy [[Boris Yachev]] accused the Macedonian government of sponsoring the party with [[Euro|€]]75,000 and called for the recall of the Macedonian ambassador [[Abdurahman Aliti]]. The party's leader, [[Stojko Stojkov (politician)|Stojko Stojkov]], called the party Bulgarian and not ethnically based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus-news.net/?id=f4888 Interview with Miroslav Murdjov and Stojko Stojkov]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30 Sofia's City Court confirmed the decision to deny registration; the arguments advanced by the court were, among others, that the necessary quorum of 530 signatures had not been reached and that there were many irregularities among those presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makfax.com.mk/look/agencija/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=2&amp;NrArticle=41956&amp;NrIssue=181&amp;NrSection=20 Bulgarian Court denies registration of UMO Ilinden–Pirin again]&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:2003sandanski1.jpg|thumb|right|270px|UMO: Ilinden–Pirin commemmoration in Honour of Macedonian Hero Jane Sandanski, [[Sandanski]], April 20, 2003]] --&gt;

UMO Ilinden–Pirin has been accepted as a full member of the [[European Free Alliance]] in April 2007.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">The '''vocational panels''' are one of three methods by which members are elected to [[Seanad Éireann]], the upper house of the [[Oireachtas]] ([[parliament]]) of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The composition of Seanad Éireann is defined in outline by Article 18 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], which provides for 11 [[Nominated members of Seanad Éireann|appointees of the Taoiseach]], 6 senators elected by the universities, and 43 senators elected by 5 vocational panels.

The composition of each panel and procedures for the election are laid down by the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1947.

==Panels==
Section 52 of the 1947 Act defines the numbers of senators to be elected from each of the panels.  The Act also provides for the division of each panel into two sub-panels: the nominating bodies sub-panel and the Oireachtas sub-panel; and for the election of Members from the panels and sub-panels as follows:

==Nomination procedures==
Candidates must be Irish citizens over the age of 21. Candidates can be nominated by two methods: by Oireachtas members or by nominating bodies. Nominating bodies are organisations that are connected to the particular vocation, for example, the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]] can nominate in the Labour panel, and the [[Royal Irish Academy]] can nominate in the Cultural and Education panel.

As the electorate is restricted to elected councillors, [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s and senators, the political parties have a great influence in the nomination procedures. The main political parties are aware of how many seats they will win after the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] election and will endorse candidates that they deem to have a chance of election to the Dáil in the next general election. The nominating bodies tend to nominate party members. Even where non-party candidates get on the ballot paper, it is very rare that these candidates are successful.

==Voting==
The electoral college for the vocational panels are [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|city and county councillors]], members of the new Dáil and members of the outgoing Seanad. The electorate consists of approximately 1,000 voters.

Voting is conducted by proportional representation by the [[single transferable vote]]. However, each ballot is given the value of 1,000 to aid the transfer of fractions of votes. 

There is a guaranteed minimum number of members that can be elected from each sub-panel. This was designed to allow nominating bodies a greater influence in the election of Senators. However, in practice, the political parties also dominate the nominating bodies sub-panel nominations and the electorate.

In a by-election to the vocational panels, the nomination procedure is the same. However, as there is only one seat available, there can be no minimum number elected from sub-panels. The electorate for a by-election for a vocational panel seat are members of the Dáil and Seanad so the Government party or parties win the seat unless there is a cross-party arrangement.
