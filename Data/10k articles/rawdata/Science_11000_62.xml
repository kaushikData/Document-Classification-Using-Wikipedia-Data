'''Agricultural engineering''' is the [[engineering]] discipline that studies [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and processing. Agricultural engineering combines the disciplines of [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[chemical engineering|chemical]] engineering principles with a knowledge of agricultural principles according to technological principles. A key goal of this discipline is to improve the efficacy and sustainability of agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asabe.org/|title=ASABE|website=www.asabe.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leading organizations in this industry is the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineering]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== ASABE standards ==
The ASABE provides safety and regulatory standards for the agricultural industry. These [http://www.asabe.org/standards/asabe-international-standards-activities.aspx#tabBody2177 standards] and regulations are developed on an international scale and include topics on fertilizers, soil conditions, fisheries, biofuels, biogass, feed machinery, tractors, and machinery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specialties==
Agricultural engineers may engage in any of the following areas: 
* design of [[agricultural machinery]], equipment, and agricultural [[structures]]
* [[internal combustion engines]] as applied to agricultural machinery
* agricultural resource management (including [[land use]] and [[water use]])
* water management, conservation, and storage for crop [[irrigation]] and [[livestock]] production
* [[surveying]] and land profiling
* [[climatology]] and [[atmospheric science]]
* [[soil]] management and conservation, including [[erosion]] and erosion control
* [[seed]]ing, [[tillage]], [[harvesting]], and [[Process (engineering)|processing]] of [[crop]]s
* [[livestock]] production, including [[poultry]], [[aquaculture|fish]], and [[dairy]] animals
* [[waste management]], including animal waste, agricultural residues, and fertilizer runoff
* [[food engineering]] and the processing of agricultural products
* basic principles of [[circuit analysis]], as applied to electrical motors
* physical and chemical properties of materials used in, or produced by, agricultural production
* [[bioresource engineering]], which uses machines on the molecular level to help the environment.
* [[Design of experiments]] related to crop and animal production

== History ==
The first curriculum in agricultural engineering was established at [[Iowa State University]] by Professor J. B. Davidson in 1903. The American Society of Agricultural Engineers, now known as the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]], was founded in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;

== Agricultural engineers ==

Agricultural engineers may perform tasks such as planning, supervising and managing the building of dairy effluent schemes, [[irrigation]], [[drainage]], [[flood]] water control systems, performing [[environmental impact assessment]]s, [[agricultural]] [[Product (business)|product]] [[Process (engineering)|processing]] and interpret research results and implement relevant practices. A large percentage of agricultural engineers work in academia or for government agencies such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] or state [[agricultural extension]] services.  Some are consultants, employed by private engineering firms, while others work in industry, for manufacturers of agricultural machinery, equipment, processing technology, and structures for housing livestock and storing crops. Agricultural engineers work in production, sales, [[management]], [[research]] and development, or [[applied science]].

In the United Kingdom the term Agricultural Engineer is often also used to describe a person that repairs or modifies agricultural equipment.

==Academic programs in agricultural and bio-systems engineering==
Below is a listing of known academic programs that offer bachelor's degrees (B.S. or B.S.E. or B.E / B.Tech) in what [[ABET]] terms "[[Agricultural Engineering]]", "[[Biological systems engineering|Biosystems Engineering]]", "[[Biological Engineering]]", or similarly named programs. ABET accredits college and university programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.

'''Al-Haddar''' is an [[impact crater]] on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], first discovered by the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft. It is named after Al-Haddar, one of the barber's six brothers in "[[The Hunchback's Tale]]" from ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

Al-Haddar is located at 50.5° North [[Latitude]], 200.6° West [[Longitude]] and is approximately 14 kilometers across.&lt;ref name=gpn/&gt;  It is the northernmost and smallest crater of a prominent crater triplet on Enceladus' anti-Saturnian hemisphere&lt;ref name="Se-4"/&gt; (there is no evidence that the impacts are related or were formed from break-up of a single body, like [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]]).  ''[[Voyager 2]]'' observations of Al-Haddar revealed a bowl-shaped, simple crater, compared to its larger, more complex southern neighbors, [[Shahrazad (crater)|Shahrazad]] and [[Dunyazad (crater)|Dunyazad]] craters.  The crater was mostly in shadow during the  [[Cassini-Huygens Mission|''Cassini'' Spacecraft's]] close flyby on March 9, 2005, but numerous tectonic fractures were observed along its northern rim.

'''Behavioural sciences''' explore the cognitive processes within [[organism]]s and the behavioural interactions between organisms in the natural world. It involves the systematic analysis and investigation of [[human]] and [[animal]] behavior through the study of the past, controlled and [[naturalistic observation]] of the present, and disciplined scientific [[experimentation]] and [[Conceptual model|modeling]]. It attempts to accomplish legitimate, objective conclusions through rigorous formulations and observation.&lt;ref name= "Klemke"&gt;Klemke, E. D., Hollinger, R., and Kline, A. D., (1980), Introduction to the book in 'Introductory Readings in the Philosophy of Science': Buffalo, New York, Prometheus Books p 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of behavioral sciences include [[psychology]], [[psychobiology]], [[anthropology]], and [[cognitive science]]. Generally, behavior science deals primarily with human action and often seeks to generalize about human behavior as it relates to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behavioral+science|title=Definition of BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Categories==
Behavioural sciences includes two broad categories: neural — ''Information sciences'' and social — ''Relational sciences''.

Information processing sciences deals with [[information processing]] of stimuli from the social environment by cognitive entities in order to engage in decision making, social judgment and social perception for individual functioning and survival of organism in a social environment. These include [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[psychobiology]], [[biological neural network|neural networks]], [[social cognition]], [[social psychology]], [[semantic networks]], [[ethology]], and [[social neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/behavioral-sciences.html|title=What are behavioral sciences? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Relational sciences deals with relationships, interaction, communication networks, associations and relational strategies or dynamics between organisms or cognitive entities in a social system. These include fields like [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological social psychology]], [[social networks]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[agent-based model]] and  [[microsimulation]].

==Applications==
Insights from several pure disciplines across behavioural sciences are explored by various applied disciplines and practiced in the context of everyday life and business. These applied disciplines of behavioural science include: [[organizational behavior]], [[operations research]], [[consumer behaviour]] and [[media psychology]].

== Differentiation from social sciences ==
The term ''behavioural sciences'' is often confused with the term ''[[social sciences]]''.{{Who|date=September 2018}}  Though these two broad areas are interrelated and study systematic processes of behaviour, they differ on their level of scientific analysis of various dimensions of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behavioral+science%3E|title=Definition of BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural sciences abstract empirical data to investigate the decision processes and communication strategies within and between organisms in a social system. This involves fields like psychology, [[social neuroscience]] ethology, and cognitive science. In contrast, social sciences provide a perceptive framework to study the processes of a social system through impacts of social organization on structural adjustment of the individual and of groups. They typically include fields like [[sociology]], [[economics]],  [[public health]], [[anthropology]], [[demography]] and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="Klemke" /&gt;

Many subfields of these disciplines cross the boundaries between behavioral and social sciences. For example, [[political psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]] use behavioural approaches, despite the predominant focus on systemic and institutional factors in the broader fields of political science and economics.

The '''Technical Research Centre for Dependency Care and Autonomous Living''' (CETpD) is an applied research and technology transfer centre created for the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia|Universitat Politèncica de Catalunya]] and the ''Fundació Hospital Comarcal Sant Antoni Abat'' on behalf of the ''Consorci de Servei a les Persones'' de Vilanova i la Geltrú, with the aim of covering the demand for research and development in the field of [[Gerontechnology]], [[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]], Assistive [[Robotics]] and [[usability|User Experience Technologies]].

The CETpD carried out important applied research work and innovation on socially relevant developments, especially on technologies and systems designed to enhance independent living of elderly and disabled people.

== Areas ==

=== Ambient Intelligence ===
[[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]] (AmI) implies an environment of distributed computing systems, unobstrusive and often invisible, with user friendly interfaces capable of learning and adapting to the particular needs of the users.
CETpD AmI projects are included in the [[assistive technology|assistance]] field mainly for housing and health application. We are looking for technological solutions that have the potential to include everyone, that are affordable and build trust and confidence directed to improve the quality of life of any person specially elders and disabled.

=== Assistive Robotics ===
The priority lines of work are three:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To develop new architectures of control and forms of signal processing which the robots allow to capture knowledge and being cognitive through the [[human-machine interaction]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To research in the more suitable forms of [[interaction]], so they are motivating and satisfying for the [[user (computing)|user]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To develop in an effective way [[robotic]] systems that are capable of supplying with personalised individual [[assistive technology|assistance]] to people with dependence (permanent, rehabilitation or convalescence). Therefore, the research implies areas like HRI, control and systems of [[machine learning|computational learning]] in complex, changing and uncertain environments, integrating processes of [[perception]], representation and [[interaction]] with people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Usability ===
The purpose of the user experience field, [[usability]], is to provide relevant information about users expectations, capabilities and preferences, in order to ensure that products and services would meet end users -and other stakeholders- functional and affective needs. All the CETpD projects incorporates user's experience feedback in the process of contextual product and services development.

=== Balance, Gaits and Falls ===
Gait alterations, balance alterations and falls are major causes of [[disability]] in the elderly population. Such pathologies seriously impair elders' quality of life; furthermore, their consequences have high economic and social impact. Therefore, clinical and epedimiological studies on these pathologies are conducted at the CETpD in order to gain insight into their causes and to find novel therapeutics.

=== Gerontechnology ===
A major objective in geriatrics is to maintain elderly persons' independence to carry out their daily life activities and to interact with their environment. In this regard, [[technology]] may be an essential tool to facilitate elderly persons' [[autonomy]]. At the CETpD, they develop [[technology]] aimed to their environment, as well as remote diagnosis devices designed for early detection of health alterations in frail persons or persons living alone.

== Education ==
Porco was born in New York City. She graduated in 1970 from [[Cardinal Spellman High School (New York City)|Cardinal Spellman High School]] in [[the Bronx]], in New York City. She earned a BS degree from the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in 1974. She received her Ph.D in 1983 from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2491/1/June_10%2C_1983.pdf |title=Caltech Commencement Program |date=1983-06-10 |publisher=Caltech Campus Publications |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supervised by dynamicist [[Peter Goldreich]], she wrote her doctoral dissertation focused on Voyager discoveries in the rings of Saturn.

== Career ==

=== Voyager ===
In the fall of 1983, Dr. Porco joined the faculty of the Department of Planetary Sciences at the [[University of Arizona]]; the same year she was made a member of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] Imaging Team. In the latter capacity, she was an active participant in the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' encounters with [[Uranus]] in 1986 and [[Neptune]] in 1989, leading the Rings Working Group within the Voyager Imaging Team during the Neptune encounter.

As a young Voyager scientist, she was the first person to describe the behavior of the eccentric ringlets and the "spokes" discovered by Voyager within the rings of Saturn; to elucidate the mechanism by which the outer Uranian rings were being shepherded by the Voyager-discovered moons [[Cordelia (moon)|Cordelia]] and [[Ophelia (moon)|Ophelia]]; and to provide an explanation for the shepherding of the rings arcs of Neptune by the moon [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]], also discovered by Voyager. She was a co-originator of the idea to take a 'portrait of the planets' with the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft, and participated in the planning, design, and execution of those images in 1990, including the famous ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' image of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |isbn=978-0-345-37659-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Cassini–Huygens'' ===
In November 1990, Porco was selected as the leader of the Imaging Team for the [[Cassini–Huygens mission|''Cassini-Huygens'' mission]], an international mission that successfully placed a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn and deployed the atmospheric ''Huygens'' probe to Saturn's largest satellite, Titan.&lt;ref name=CassiniTeam /&gt; She is also the Director of the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPS), which was the center of uplink and downlink operations for the ''Cassini'' imaging science experiment and the place where ''Cassini'' images are processed for release to the public.&lt;ref name=CICLOPSTEAM /&gt; CICLOPS is part of the [[Space Science Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]].

In the course of the ongoing mission, Porco and her team have discovered seven moons of Saturn: [[Methone (moon)|Methone]] and [[Pallene (moon)|Pallene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2013, ''Cassini'' data confirmed a 1993 prediction by Porco and Mark Marley that acoustic oscillations within the body of Saturn are responsible for creating particular features in the rings of Saturn.&lt;ref name=Hedman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marley /&gt; This confirmation, the first to demonstrate that planetary rings can act like a seismograph in recording oscillatory motions within the host planet, should provide new constraints on the interior structure of Saturn.

Her team was also responsible for the first sighting of plumes erupting from [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], Saturn's sixth largest moon. They first suggested, and provided detailed scientific arguments, that these jets might be geysers erupting from reservoirs of near-surface liquid water under the south pole of the small moon.&lt;ref name="Porco Helfenstein et al. 2006" /&gt;

=== ''New Horizons'' ===
Porco was a member of the imaging team for the ''[[New Horizons]]'' mission to [[Pluto]] and the [[Kuiper Belt]] through 2014. The probe made its Pluto flyby in 2015.

=== Public speaking ===
Porco speaks frequently on the ''Cassini'' mission and planetary exploration in general, and has appeared at renowned conferences such as PopTech 2005&lt;ref name=PopTech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poptech.org/people/carolyn_porco |title=Carolyn Porco |work=PopTech: People |publisher=PopTech |location=Brooklyn, New York, United States |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626100235/http://poptech.org/people/carolyn_porco# |archivedate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-02-23 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TED (conference)|TED]] (2007, 2009).&lt;ref name=TED07 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TED09 /&gt; She attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival|Beyond Belief]] symposium on November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival#tab3 |title=Beyond Belief 2006: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival |publisher=Thesciencenetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21belief.html A Free-for-All on Science and Religion], ''The New York Times'', November 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Porco's 2007 TED talk, "The Human Journey," detailed two major areas of discovery made by the ''Cassini'' mission: the exploration of the Saturnian moons Titan and Enceladus. In her introductory remarks, Porco explained:

{{Quote|So the journey back to Saturn is really part of, and is also a metaphor for, a much larger human voyage.}}

In describing the environment of Titan, with its molecular [[nitrogen]] atmosphere suffused with organic compounds, Porco invited her audience to imagine the scene on the moon's surface:

{{Quote|Stop and think for a minute. Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like. It's dark: high noon on Titan is as dark as deep Earth twilight on the Earth. It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty, it might be raining, and you are standing on the shores of [[Lake Michigan]] brimming with [[paint thinner]].

That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with ''Cassini''. And I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though not the same in detail, is every bit as fascinating as that story is, and for us, for ''Cassini'' people, it has been like a [[Jules Verne]] adventure come true.}}

After describing various features discovered on Titan by ''Cassini'', and presenting the historic first photograph of Titan's surface by the ''Huygens'' lander, Porco went on to describe Enceladus and the jets of "fine icy particles" which erupt from the moon's southern pole:

{{Quote|...we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may, they may, be erupting from pockets of liquid water near, under the surface of Enceladus. So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat. In other words we have possibly stumbled upon the [[holy grail]] of modern-day planetary exploration, or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms. And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our Solar system, whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere, would have enormous cultural and scientific implications. Because if we could demonstrate that [[Abiogenesis|genesis]] had occurred – not once but twice, independently, in our Solar system – then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout our Universe in its 13.7&amp;nbsp;billion year history.}}

Porco's 2009 TED Talk was "Could a Saturn moon harbor life?".&lt;ref name=TED09 /&gt;

She was a speaker at the 2016 [[Reason Rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reasonrally.org/speakers/|title=Speakers|author=|date=September 4, 2015|work=[[Reason Rally]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314221134/http://reasonrally.org/speakers/|archivedate=March 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television and film ===
Porco has been a regular [[CNN]] guest analyst and consultant on astronomy, has made many radio and television appearances explaining science to the lay audience, including appearances on the MacNeil/Lehrer ''Newshour'', [[CBS]]'s ''60 Minutes'', Peter Jennings's ''The Century'', and TV documentaries on planetary exploration such as ''The Planets'' on the [[Discovery Channel]] and the [[BBC]], ''A Traveler's Guide to the Planets'' on the [[National Geographic Channel]], ''Horizon'' on the BBC, and a Nova Cassini special on [[PBS]]. For the 2003 [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] special on the Voyager mission entitled ''Cosmic Journey: The Voyager Interstellar Mission and Message'', Porco appeared onscreen and also served as the show's science advisor and animation director.

Porco served as an adviser for the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), which was based on a novel by the well-known astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]. The actress [[Jodie Foster]] portrayed the heroine in the movie, and Sagan reportedly suggested that she use Porco as a real-life model to guide her performance.&lt;ref name=Overbye&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/science/space/22prof.html|title=An Odyssey From the Bronx to Saturn's Rings | work=The New York Times | first=Dennis | last=Overbye | date=September 22, 2009 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porco was also an adviser on the film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009). The scene in which the ''Enterprise'' comes out of warp drive into the atmosphere of Titan, and rises submarine-style out of the haze, with Saturn and the rings in the background, was Porco's suggestion.&lt;ref name=Pascale&gt;{{cite web|last=Pascale|first=Anthony|title=Exclusive Interview With Carolyn Porco – Star Trek's New Science Advisor|url=http://trekmovie.com/2008/02/11/interview-with-star-treks-new-science-advisor/|work=TrekMovie.com|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaspy.ca/article.php?id=857 |title=Cinema Boffin Interview: Carolyn Porco Talks 'Star Trek XI' |author=[[Kevin Grazier]] |date=2008-04-27 |publisher=Cinema Boffin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006055623/http://www.cinemaspy.ca/article.php?id=857 |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical interests ==
[[File:Cassini team Abbey road.jpg|thumb|300px|Porco (at right) re-enacting the famous Beatles photograph at [[Abbey Road (street)|Abbey Road]] with the other members of the Cassini Imaging Team.]]
Porco is fascinated by the 1960s and [[The Beatles]] and has, at times, incorporated references to The Beatles and their music into her presentations, writings, and press releases. The first color image released by ''Cassini'' to the public was an image of Jupiter, taken during ''Cassini''{{’}}s approach to the giant planet and released on October 9, 2000 to honor [[John Lennon]]’s 60th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=110 |title=Jupiter &amp; Europa in True Color |publisher=Ciclops.org |date=2000-10-09 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she produced and directed a brief 8-minute movie of 64 of Cassini’s most spectacular images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=24 |title=Sixty-Four Scenes from Saturn … The Movie |publisher=Ciclops.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; put to the music of the Beatles, in honor of [[Paul McCartney]]’s 64th birthday. And in 2007, she produced a poster showing 64 scenes from Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=2879 |title=Sixty-Four Scenes from Saturn … The Poster |publisher=Ciclops.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=2914 |title=Sixty-Four Scenes from Saturn … The Images |publisher=Ciclops.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chiromyiformes''' is an order of [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] primates that includes the extant [[aye-aye]] from Madagascar.

==Classification==
[[File:Aye-Aye Daubentonia madagascariensis in Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Skeleton]]
The [[aye-aye]] is sometimes classified as a member of [[Lemuriformes]], but others treat Chiromyiformes as a separate infraorder, based on the their very reduced dental formula.&lt;ref name=Birx2010&gt;Birx, James, 2010. ''21st Century Anthropology.'' SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnell et al. (2018) reclassified the putative bat ''Propotto'' as a close relative of the aye-aye, as well as assigning the problematic strepsirrhine primate ''Plesiopithecus'' to Chiromyiformes.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg F. Gunnell; Doug M. Boyer; Anthony R. Friscia; Steven Heritage; Fredrick Kyalo Manthi; Ellen R. Miller; Hesham M. Sallam; Nancy B. Simmons; Nancy J. Stevens; Erik R. Seiffert (2018). "Fossil lemurs from Egypt and Kenya suggest an African origin for Madagascar's aye-aye". Nature Communications. 9: Article number 3193. doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05648-w.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The molecular clock puts the divergence of Chiromyiformes and Lemuriformes at 50-49 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Birx2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Springer MS, Meredith RW, Gatesy J, Emerling CA, Park J, Rabosky DL, et al.

[[File:Histone Alignment.png|thumb|400px|A multiple [[sequence alignment]] of five mammalian [[histone H1]] proteins &lt;br /&gt;
Sequences are the [[Amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and side chain properties|amino acids]] for residues 120-180 of the proteins. Residues that are conserved across all sequences are highlighted in grey. Below each site (i.e., position) of the protein sequence alignment is a key denoting conserved sites (*), sites with [[conservative replacement]]s (:), sites with semi-conservative replacements (.), and sites with [[segregating site|non-conservative replacements]] ( ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/help/faq.html#23|website=Clustal |title= Clustal FAQ #Symbols|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[evolutionary biology]], '''conserved sequences''' are identical or similar [[Sequence (biology)|sequences]] in [[nucleic acid]]s ([[DNA sequence|DNA]] and [[RNA]]) or [[peptide sequence|proteins]] across species ([[homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologous sequences]]), or within a [[genome]] ([[homology (biology)#Paralogy|paralogous sequences]]), or between donor and receptor taxa ([[Sequence homology#Xenology|xenologous sequences]]). Conservation indicates that a sequence has been maintained by [[natural selection]].

A highly conserved sequence is one that has remained relatively unchanged far back up the [[phylogenetic tree]], and hence far back in [[geological time]]. Examples of highly conserved sequences include the [[Ribosomal RNA|RNA components]] of [[ribosome]]s present in all [[domain (biology)|domain]]s of life, the [[homeobox]] sequences widespread amongst [[Eukaryotes]], and the [[tmRNA]] in [[Bacteria]]. The study of sequence conservation overlaps with the fields of [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[phylogenetics]], [[bioinformatics]] and [[mathematics]].

While initial phylogenies closely matched the [[fossil record]], observations that some genes appeared to evolve at different rates led to the development of theories of [[molecular evolution]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Margaret Oakley Dayhoff|Margaret Dayhoff's]] 1966 comparison of [[ferrodoxin]] sequences showed that [[natural selection]] would act to conserve and optimise protein sequences essential to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eck |first1=R.

==Mechanisms==

{{See also| Natural selection|Neutral theory of molecular evolution}}

Over many generations, nucleic acid sequences in the [[genome]] of an [[Lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineage]] can gradually change over time due to random mutations and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=M|title=Evolutionary Rate at the Molecular Level|journal=Nature|date=17 February 1968|volume=217|issue=5129|pages=624–626|doi=10.1038/217624a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=J. L.|last2=Jukes|first2=T. H.|title=Non-Darwinian Evolution|journal=Science|date=16 May 1969|volume=164|issue=3881|pages=788–798|doi=10.1126/science.164.3881.788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequences may also recombine or be deleted due to [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s. Conserved sequences are sequences which persist in the genome despite such forces, and have slower rates of mutation than the background mutation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=M|last2=Ohta|first2=T|title=On Some Principles Governing Molecular Evolution|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|date=1974|volume=71|issue=7|pages=2848–2852|doi=10.1073/pnas.71.7.2848| pmc=388569 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC388569/pdf/pnas00060-0262.pdf|pmid=4527913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation can occur in [[Coding region|coding]] and [[Noncoding DNA|non-coding]] nucleic acid sequences. Highly conserved DNA sequences are thought to have functional value, although the role for many highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences is poorly understood. The extent to which a sequence is conserved can be affected by varying [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]], its [[Robustness (evolution)|robustness]] to mutation, [[Population genetics|population size]] and [[genetic drift]]. Many functional sequences are also [[Modularity (biology)|modular]], containing regions which may be subject to independent [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]], such as [[Protein domain#Domains as evolutionary modules|protein domains]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Coding sequence===
In coding sequences, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequence may be conserved to different extents, as the degeneracy of the [[genetic code]] means that [[Synonymous substitution|synonymous mutations]] in a coding sequence do not affect the amino acid sequence of its protein product.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Amino acid sequences can be conserved to maintain the [[Protein structure|structure]] or function of a protein or domain. Conserved proteins undergo fewer [[amino acid replacement]]s, or are more likely to [[conservative mutation|substitute amino acids with similar biochemical properties]]. Within a sequence, amino acids that are important for [[protein folding|folding]], structural stability, or that form a [[binding site]] may be more highly conserved.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The nucleic acid sequence of a protein coding gene may also be conserved by other selective pressures. The [[codon usage bias]] in some organisms may restrict the types of synonymous mutations in a sequence. Nucleic acid sequences that cause [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structure]] in the mRNA of a coding gene may be selected against, as some structures may negatively affect translation, or conserved where the mRNA also acts as a functional non-coding RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chamary|first1=JV|last2=Hurst|first2=Laurence D|title=Evidence for selection on synonymous mutations affecting stability of mRNA secondary structure in mammals|journal=Genome Biology|date=2005|volume=6|issue=9|pages=R75|doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-9-r75|pmid=16168082|pmc=1242210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wadler|first1=C. S.|last2=Vanderpool|first2=C. K.|title=A dual function for a bacterial small RNA: SgrS performs base pairing-dependent regulation and encodes a functional polypeptide|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=27 November 2007|volume=104|issue=51|pages=20454–20459|doi=10.1073/pnas.0708102104|pmid=18042713|pmc=2154452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-coding===
{{See also |Conserved non-coding sequence}}

Non-coding sequences important for [[gene regulation]], such as the binding or recognition sites of [[Ribosome-binding site|ribosomes]] and [[transcription factor]]s, may be conserved within a genome. For example, the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] of a conserved gene or [[operon]] may also be conserved. As with proteins, nucleic acids that are important for the structure and function of [[non-coding RNA]] (ncRNA) can also be conserved. However, sequence conservation in ncRNAs is generally poor compared to protein-coding sequences, and [[base pairs]] that contribute to structure or function are often conserved instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnsson |first1=Per |last2=Lipovich |first2=Leonard |last3=Grandér |first3=Dan |last4=Morris |first4=Kevin V. |title=Evolutionary conservation of long non-coding RNAs; sequence, structure, function |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects |date=March 2014 |volume=1840 |issue=3 |pages=1063–1071 |doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.10.035|pmid=24184936 |pmc=3909678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freyhult |first1=E.

==Identification==
{{See also|Sequence alignment}}
Conserved sequences are typically identified by [[bioinformatics]] approaches based on [[sequence alignment]]. Advances in [[DNA sequencing#High-throughput methods|high-throughput DNA sequencing]] and [[protein mass spectrometry]] has substantially increased the availability of protein sequences and whole genomes for comparison since the early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Homology search===

Conserved sequences may be identified by [[Homology (biology)|homology]] search, using tools such as [[BLAST]], [[HMMER]] and Infernal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nawrocki |first1=E. P. |last2=Eddy |first2=S. R. |title=Infernal 1.1: 100-fold faster RNA homology searches |journal=Bioinformatics |date=4 September 2013 |volume=29 |issue=22 |pages=2933–2935 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt509|pmid=24008419 |pmc=3810854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homology search tools may take an individual nucleic acid or protein sequence as input, or use statistical models generated from [[multiple sequence alignment]]s of known related sequences. Statistical models such as [[Hidden Markov model|profile-HMMs]], and RNA covariance models which also incorporate structural information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddy |first1=SR|last2=Durbin |first2=R |title=RNA sequence analysis using covariance models. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=11 June 1994|volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=2079–88 |pmid=8029015 |doi=10.1093/nar/22.11.2079 |pmc=308124}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be helpful when searching for more distantly related sequences. Input sequences are then aligned against a database of sequences from related individuals or other species. The resulting alignments are then scored based on the number of matching amino acids or bases, and the number of gaps or deletions generated by the alignment. Acceptable conservative substitutions may be identified using substitution matrices such as [[Point accepted mutation|PAM]] and [[BLOSUM]]. Highly scoring alignments are assumed to be from homologous sequences. The conservation of a sequence may then be inferred by detection of highly similar homologs over a broad phylogenetic range.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Multiple sequence alignment===
[[File:LexA gram positive bacteria sequence logo.png|400px|thumb|right|A sequence logo for the LexA-binding motif of [[gram-positive]] bacteria. As the [[adenosine]] at position 5 is highly conserved, it appears larger than other characters.&lt;ref name="Weblogo"/&gt;]]

Multiple sequence alignments can be used to visualise conserved sequences. The [[clustal|CLUSTAL]] format includes a plain-text key to annotate conserved columns of the alignment, denoting conserved sequence (*), conservative mutations (:), semi-conservative mutations (.), and non-conservative mutations ( )&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/help/faq.html#23 |website=Clustal |title=Clustal FAQ #Symbols |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence logos can also show conserved sequence by representing the proportions of characters at each point in the alignment by height.&lt;ref name="Weblogo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Weblogo |url=http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/ |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genome alignment=== 
[[File:ECR_browser_showing_conserved_OTX2_gene_in_vertebrates.png|thumb|500px|right|This image from the ECR browser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecrbrowser.dcode.org |title=ECR Browser |website=ECR Browser |accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the result of aligning different vertebrate genomes to the human genome at the conserved [[Orthodenticle homeobox 2|OTX2]] gene. Top: Gene annotations of [[exon]]s and [[intron]]s of the OTX2 gene. For each genome, sequence similarity (%) compared to the human genome is plotted. Tracks show the [[zebrafish]], [[dog]], [[chicken]], [[Xenopus tropicalis|western clawed frog]], [[opossum]], [[mouse]], [[rhesus macaque]] and [[chimpanzee]] genomes. The peaks show regions of high sequence similarity across all genomes, showing that this sequence is highly conserved.]]

Whole genome alignments (WGAs) may also be used to identify highly conserved regions across species. Currently the accuracy and [[scalability]] of WGA tools remains limited due to the computational complexity of dealing with rearrangements, repeat regions and the large size of many eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earl |first1=Dent |last2=Nguyen |first2=Ngan |last3=Hickey |first3=Glenn |last4=Harris |first4=Robert S. |last5=Fitzgerald |first5=Stephen |last6=Beal |first6=Kathryn |last7=Seledtsov |first7=Igor |last8=Molodtsov |first8=Vladimir |last9=Raney |first9=Brian J. |last10=Clawson |first10=Hiram |last11=Kim |first11=Jaebum |last12=Kemena |first12=Carsten |last13=Chang |first13=Jia-Ming |last14=Erb |first14=Ionas |last15=Poliakov |first15=Alexander |last16=Hou |first16=Minmei |last17=Herrero |first17=Javier |last18=Kent |first18=William James |last19=Solovyev |first19=Victor |last20=Darling |first20=Aaron E. |last21=Ma |first21=Jian |last22=Notredame |first22=Cedric |last23=Brudno |first23=Michael |last24=Dubchak |first24=Inna |last25=Haussler |first25=David |last26=Paten |first26=Benedict |title=Alignathon: a competitive assessment of whole-genome alignment methods |journal=Genome Research |date=December 2014 |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=2077–2089 |doi=10.1101/gr.174920.114|pmid=25273068 |pmc=4248324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, WGAs of 30 or more closely related bacteria (prokaryotes) are now increasingly feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rouli |first1=L. |last2=Merhej |first2=V. |last3=Fournier |first3=P.-E. |last4=Raoult |first4=D. |title=The bacterial pangenome as a new tool for analysing pathogenic bacteria |journal=New Microbes and New Infections |date=September 2015 |volume=7 |pages=72–85 |doi=10.1016/j.nmni.2015.06.005|pmid=26442149 |pmc=4552756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Méric |first1=Guillaume |last2=Yahara |first2=Koji |last3=Mageiros |first3=Leonardos |last4=Pascoe |first4=Ben |last5=Maiden |first5=Martin C.

===Scoring systems===

Other approaches use measurements of conservation based on [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] that attempt to identify sequences which mutate differently to an expected background (neutral) mutation rate.

The GERP (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling) framework scores conservation of genetic sequences across species. This approach estimates the rate of neutral mutation in a set of species from a multiple sequence alignment, and then identifies regions of the sequence that exhibit fewer mutations than expected. These regions are then assigned scores based on the difference between the observed mutation rate and expected background mutation rate. A high GERP score then indicates a highly conserved sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=G. M. |title=Distribution and intensity of constraint in mammalian genomic sequence |journal=Genome Research |date=17 June 2005 |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=901–913 |doi=10.1101/gr.3577405|pmid=15965027 |pmc=1172034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mendel.stanford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/gerp/|title=Sidow Lab - GERP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches such as PhyloP and PhyloHMM incorporate [[Phylogenetic comparative methods|statistical phylogenetics]] methods to compare [[probability distribution]]s of substitution rates, which allows the detection of both conservation and accelerated mutation. First, a background probability distribution is generated of the number of substitutions expected to occur for a column in a multiple sequence alignment, based on a [[phylogenetic tree]]. The estimated evolutionary relationships between the species of interest are used to calculate the significance of any substitutions (i.e. a substitution between two closely related species may be less likely to occur than distantly related ones, and therefore more significant). To detect conservation, a probability distribution is calculated for a subset of the multiple sequence alignment, and compared to the background distribution using a statistical test such as a [[likelihood-ratio test]] or [[score test]]. [[P-value]]s generated from comparing the two distributions are then used to identify conserved regions. PhyloHMM uses [[hidden markov model]]s to generate probability distributions. The PhyloP software package compares probability distributions using a [[likelihood-ratio test]] or [[score test]], as well as using a GERP-like scoring system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollard |first1=K.

===Universally conserved genes===
The most highly conserved genes are those that can be found in all organisms. These consist mainly of the [[ncRNA]]s and proteins required for [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which are assumed to have been conserved from the [[last universal common ancestor]] of all life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Isenbarger |first1=Thomas A. |last2=Carr |first2=Christopher E. |last3=Johnson |first3=Sarah Stewart |last4=Finney |first4=Michael |last5=Church |first5=George M. |last6=Gilbert |first6=Walter |last7=Zuber |first7=Maria T. |last8=Ruvkun |first8=Gary |title=The Most Conserved Genome Segments for Life Detection on Earth and Other Planets |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |date=14 October 2008 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=517–533 |doi=10.1007/s11084-008-9148-z|pmid=18853276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genes or gene families that have been found to be universally conserved include [[GTP-binding elongation factor family, EF-Tu/EF-1A subfamily|GTP-binding elongation factors]], [[METAP2|Methionine aminopeptidase 2]], [[Serine hydroxymethyltransferase]], and [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ATP transporters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=J.

===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===

Sets of conserved sequences are often used for generating [[phylogenetic tree]]s, as it can be assumed that organisms with similar sequences are closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gadagkar|first1=Sudhindra R.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Michael S.|last3=Kumar|first3=Sudhir|title=Inferring species phylogenies from multiple genes: Concatenated sequence tree versus consensus gene tree|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution|date=15 January 2005|volume=304B|issue=1|pages=64–74|doi=10.1002/jez.b.21026|pmid=15593277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of sequences may vary depending on the taxonomic scope of the study.

===Medical research===

As highly conserved sequences often have important biological functions, they can be useful a starting point for identifying the cause of [[genetic disease]]s. Many [[Inborn error of metabolism|congenital metabolic disorders]] and [[Lysosomal storage disease]]s are the result of changes to individual conserved genes, resulting in missing or faulty enzymes that are the underlying cause of the symptoms of the disease.

'''Direct Benefit Transfer''' or '''DBT''' is an attempt to change the mechanism of transferring subsidies launched by [[Government of India]] on 1 January 2013. This program aims to transfer subsidies directly to the people through their bank accounts. It is hoped that crediting subsidies into bank accounts will reduce leakages, delays, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbtmis.planningcommission.nic.in/dbtentry/homepage.aspx|title=DBT(DIRECT BENEFIT TRANSFER)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Rejaul Karim Laskar|Laskar]]|first1=R. K.|title=Direct cash transfer: A game changer move|url=http://old.thefinancialworld.com/epaper/fwepaper_new.aspx|accessdate=30 January 2018|agency=The Financial World|date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The primary aim of this Direct Benefit Transfer program is to bring transparency and terminate pilferage from distribution of funds sponsored by Central Government of India. In DBT, benefit or subsidy will be directly transferred to citizens living below poverty line.  [[Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System]] (CPSMS), being implemented by the Office of Controller General of Accounts, will act as the common platform for routing DBT. CPSMS can be used for the preparation of beneficiary list, digitally signing the same and processing of payments in the bank accounts of the beneficiary using the Aadhaar Payment Bridge of NPCI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpsms.nic.in/Users/LoginDetails/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fdefault.aspx Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System [CPSMS&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All relevant orders related with the DBT are available on the CPSMS website.

==History==
The program was launched in selected cities of India on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref name="The New Indian Express Direct Benefit Transfer to be launched today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct Benefit Transfer to be launctoday|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/article1402701.ece|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15"&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15|url=http://business-standard.com/india/news/govt-to-review-benefits-transfer-projectjan-15/498105/|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 20 districts, covering scholarships and social security pensions initially.

Former Union [[Ministry of Rural Development (India)|Minister for Rural Development]] of India [[Jairam Ramesh]] and former [[Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh]] [[N. Kiran Kumar Reddy]] inaugurated the scheme at Gollaprolu in East Godavari district on 6 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Direct Benefit Transfer scheme finally gets going"&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct Benefit Transfer scheme finally gets going|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/direct-benefit-transfer-scheme-finally-gets-going/article4281371.ece|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|location=Chennai, India|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has decided to review the progress on regular basis.&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15" /&gt;

The first review was scheduled to be undertaken on 15 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15" /&gt; According to [[P. Chidambaram]], former Union Minister of Finance of India, the scheme will be rolled out across 11 more districts by 1 February and 12 more districts by 1 March 2013.&lt;ref name="Govt to review benefits transfer project on Jan 15" /&gt;

In April 2013 the government decided to extend the DBT scheme in 78 more districts of the country from July 1, 2013. The decision was taken by then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh after a review meeting.&lt;ref name="DBT scheme to be extended in 78 new districts from July 1, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=DBT scheme to be extended in 78 new districts from July 1, 2013|url=http://www.myaadhaarcard.in/direct-cash-transfer/dbt-scheme-to-be-extended-in-78-new-districts-from-july-1-2013/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 78 new districts will include 6 districts each from Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, 3 each from Bihar and Tamil Nadu, 2 from West Bengal and 4 each from Odisha and Gujarat.

In a review by the Prime Minister's Office on 5 August 2013, the minutes reported that two schemes dominated transfers through CPSMS - 83% of all transfers were for the [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] and scholarships. Lack of computerized records for schemes to be linked to DBT was hindering rollout. The minutes show that out of 39.76 lakh beneficiaries who ought to have been covered under various schemes, only 56% had bank accounts, 25.3% had both bank accounts and aadhaar numbers, but only 9.62% have bank accounts seeded with aadhaar numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://finmin.nic.in/dbt/record_dbt0508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs part of DBT==
* National Child Labour Project
* Student Scholarship
* LPG subsidy
On June 1, 2013, the minister of Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas, M [[Veerappa Moily]] formally launched the scheme direct benefit transfer for LPG (DBTL) Scheme in 20 high [[Aadhaar]] coverage districts. The subsidy on LPG cylinders will be credited directly to consumers' Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. All Aadhaar-linked domestic LPG consumers will get an advance in their bank account as soon as they book the first subsidized cylinder before delivery. On receiving the first subsidized cylinder subsidy for next will again get credited in their bank account, which can then be available for the purchase of the next cylinder at market rate until the cap of 12 cylinders per year is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-01/news/39675093_1_lpg-cylinders-aadhaar-number-domestic-lpg-consumers | work=The Times Of India | title=Moily launches Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme for LPG in Karnataka | date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified Version of DBTL Scheme : (November 2014)
Government of India Introduced Modified Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG (DBTL) scheme in 54 districts in 11 states including all in Kerala starting November 15, 2014 whereby LPG consumers who have not yet availed the benefit will be able to get cash subsidy amount transferred into their accounts to buy Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders at market price.&lt;ref name="Pahal DBTL-nov-27-14"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pahaldbtlscheme.com/what-is-pahal-dbtl-scheme/ | title=Pahal 'DBTL' Scheme | publisher=www.pahaldbtlscheme.com/ | date=23 December 2014 | accessdate=23 December 2014 | author=pavan1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

74 Schemes of 17 ministries of central government were under DBT by 31 May 2016. As on Dec 2017,DBT has been implemented in 400 schemes from 46 ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Aadhaar law will ensure Direct Benefit Transfer reaches genuine beneficiaries: FM Jaitley |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-aadhaar-law-will-ensure-direct-benefit-transfer-reaches-genuine-beneficiaries-fm-jaitley-2234747 |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |date=15 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''double terminated crystal''' is a [[crystal]] with two naturally [[facet]]ed ends. Technically, they have a termination on both ends. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crystalgenn.com/metaphysical-quartz-crystal-description-double-terminated/|title=Metaphysical Quartz Crystal Description:DOUBLE TERMINATED {{!}}|website=www.crystalgenn.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rarer form of crystal as it forms free-floating in pockets of [[clay]], rather than on one side of a stone. They are sought after by collectors and are often made into [[pendant]]s. 

According to ''Gems &amp; Gemology'', "the topmost grade of amethyst consists of double-terminated single crystals." &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Andrew and Hsu Tao. "Moroccan Amethyst: Mining and Marketing."

[[George Heilmeier]] proposed the '''dynamic scattering effect''' which causes a strong scattering of light when the electric field applied to a special [[liquid crystal]] mixture exceeds a threshold value.

A DSM cell requires the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;
* a liquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy (aligns the LC long axis perpendicular to the electric field),
* [[homeotropic alignment]] of the LC (i.e. perpendicular to the substrate planes),
* doping of the LC with a substance that increases the conductivity of the LC to allow a current to flow.

With no voltage applied the LC-cell with the homeotropically aligned LC is clear and transparent. With increasing voltage and current, the electric field is trying to align the long molecular axis of the LC perpendicular to the field while the ion transport through the layer has the tendency to align the LC perpendicular to the substrate plates. As a result, a striped repetitive pattern is generated in the cell, of which the building blocks are named "Williams domains". Upon further increase of the voltage this regular pattern is replaced by a turbulent state which is strongly scattering light. This effect belongs to the class of electro-hydrodynamic effects in LCs. Electro-optic displays can be realized with that effect in the transmissive and reflective mode of operation. The driving voltages required for light scattering are in the range of several ten volts and the non-trivial current is depending on the area of the activated segments. The DMS effect was thus not suited for battery powered electronic devices.

'''East Midlands Councils''' is a consultative forum for local government in the [[East Midlands]] region of [[England]]. It is a regional grouping of the [[Local Government Association]] and the [[Regional employers organisations|regional employers organisation]].

It was established in April 2010 as a consequence of the dissolution of the former [[East Midlands Regional Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emra.gov.uk/files/pr-new-leadership-group-meets10-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; East Midlands Councils consists of 98 Members; 92 Local Authority Members, two Fire and Rescue Authority Members, two Police Authority Members and two representatives of Parish and Town Councils. Councillor [[Martin Hill (councillor)|Martin Hill]] is the chair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emcouncils.gov.uk/East-Midlands-Councils&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive Board==

The Executive Board is the executive arm of East Midlands Councils and functions as the  [[Local Authority Leaders' Board]] for the region. It was established to jointly produce the Single Regional Strategy for the East Midlands, with the [[East Midlands Development Agency]]. In May 2010 East Midlands Councils announced that it is winding down regional strategy functions by the end of June that year in line with planning changes required by the new [[UK Government]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emcouncils.gov.uk/Press-releases/Government-Announcement&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board has 17 members with nine representatives from the county councils and unitary authorities in the region and a further five representatives form district councils, one from each county.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emcouncils.gov.uk/Executive-Board-Membership&lt;/ref&gt; The county and unitary authority members will be considered permanent members while the district members will serve one year terms, but are eligible for re-nomination. When fully established, the board will meet four times per year with provision to hold special meetings as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emra.gov.uk/files/emlalb-item3-060309.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5486">The '''effective number of parties''' is a concept introduced by Laakso and Taagepera (1979) which provides for an adjusted number of [[political parties]] in a country's [[party system]].  The idea behind this measure is to count parties and, at the same time, to [[Weight function|weight]] the count by their relative strength. The relative strength refers to their vote share ("effective number of electoral parties") or seat share in the parliament ("effective number of parliamentary parties"). This measure is especially useful when comparing [[electoral system]]s across countries, as is done in the field of [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, Arend (1999): Patterns of Democracy. New Haven/London: Yale UP&lt;/ref&gt; The number of parties equals the effective number of parties only when all parties have equal strength. In any other case, the effective number of parties is lower than the actual number of parties. The effective number of parties is a frequent operationalization &lt;!-- what does this word mean? --&gt; for the fragmentation of a party system.

There are two major alternatives to the  effective number of parties-measure.&lt;ref name="Lijphart1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Arend Lijphart]] |title=Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-seven Democracies, 1945-1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hsz3ML3hgUUC&amp;pg=PA69 |date=1 January 1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-827347-9 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; John K.

Dunleavy and F. Boucek (2003): 'Constructing the Number of Parties.' Party Politics 9(3): 291-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulae==
According to [[Markku Laakso|Laakso]] and [[Rein Taagepera|Taagepera]] (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Laakso, M.; R. Taagepera (1979): Effective Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to West Europe. ''Comparative Political Studies'' 12:3-27.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''effective number of parties'' is computed by the following formula:
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
Where n is the number of parties with at least one vote/seat and &lt;math&gt; p_i^2 &lt;/math&gt; the square of each party’s proportion of all votes or seats. The proportions need to be ''normalised'' such that, for example, 50 per cent is 0.5 and 1 per cent is 0.01. This is also the formula for the [[Simpson index|inverse Simpson index]], or the true diversity of order 2.

An alternative formula proposed by Golosov (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Golosov, Grigorii V. (2010): The Effective Number of Parties: A New Approach. ''Party Politics'' 16:171-192.&lt;/ref&gt; is
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{p_i+p_1^2-p_i^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
which is equivalent - if we only consider parties with at least one vote/seat - to
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1+(p_1^2/p_i)-p_i} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here, n is the number of parties, &lt;math&gt; p_i^2 &lt;/math&gt; the square of each party’s proportion of all votes or seats, and &lt;math&gt; p_1^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the square of the largest party’s proportion of all votes or seats.

==Values==
The following table illustrates the difference between the values produced by the two formulas for eight hypothetical vote or seat constellations:

'''Engineer in Training''', or '''EIT''', is a professional designation from the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES) used in the United States to designate a person certified by the state as having completed two requirements:
* Completed a minimum of three years of post-secondary school at an [[ABET, Inc.|ABET]]-accredited engineering program, or related science curriculum approved by the Board – Many states allow for  the substitution of several years of engineering experience in place of the engineering degree requirement.
* Passed the NCEES six-hour&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/|title=NCEES FE exam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination]]

Once an individual has passed the exam the state board awards that person an Engineer-in-Training (EIT) or an Engineer Intern (EI) designation. EIT and EI are equivalent variations in nomenclature that vary from state to state. Receiving an EIT designation is one step along the path toward [[Professional Engineer]] (PE) licensure.

==Clarification of the term==
"Engineer Intern"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201063039/http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; term could be possibly misleading term as it may imply that the engineer is still in college and is working merely in an intern position.

An Engineer-in-Training does engineering work, such as design, under the supervision and direction of a Professional Engineer, who are exclusively able to perform certain tasks, such as stamp and seal designs and offer services to the public.&lt;ref name="NCEES Licensure"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Licensure |url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |work=NCEES.org |accessdate=2013-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, an ''E.I.T.'' designation means that the person has completed the educational requirement of their P.Eng but has yet to accrue enough work experience (or has yet to apply for a P.Eng). An EIT can perform engineering work under the supervision of a professional engineer. With the exception of New Brunswick, PEO (Ontario) and OIQ (Quebec), EITs are allowed to use the title "Engineer" as long as they also include the EIT designation in either their name or their title. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineerscanada.ca/frequently-asked-questions-for-engineers-in-training-and-members-in-training |title=Frequently Asked Questions for Engineers-in-Training and Members-in-Training |accessdate=2015-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712153507/http://www.engineerscanada.ca/frequently-asked-questions-for-engineers-in-training-and-members-in-training |archivedate=2015-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the designation==
In the United Kingdom and the United States of America, having an EIT designation shows an understanding of fundamental engineering principles, as EITs have passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam. Canadian engineering has no equivalent to the FE exam for an EIT level.

==EIT designation as a part of PE licensure==
Each state's statutes delineate the requirements for the experience and education needed to become a PE once EIT or EI certification has been earned. The requirements vary depending on the State and the licensing board, but for most engineers the process typically includes the following steps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncees.org/engineering/engineering-licensure/|title=NCEES engineering licensure|work=NCEES|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
# Graduate from an [[ABET]]-accredited four-year university engineering program.
# Pass the 6-Hour Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination to receive an Engineer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201063039/http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intern (EI) enrollment or Engineer-in-Training (EIT) certification. The FE exam was an 8-hour exam prior to 2014. Some states such as Kansas and New York use the designation of IE (Intern Engineer), but is essentially the same as EI or EIT. Some states such as Iowa have no EIT or EI designation or certification available through their engineering boards. One just states s(he) passed the FE. An EI/EIT is not a requirement to take the PE exam; passing the FE is a requirement.
# Accumulate a set amount of engineering experience, typically under the direction of a PE. In most states the requirement is four years, but in others the requirement is lower.
# Pass the 8-hour [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam]] to receive a PE designation&lt;ref name="NCEES Licensure" /&gt;
In California, passing two additional exams is required to gain PE licensure. A seismic exam and a surveying exam, are in addition to the FE and PE exams for civil engineers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">[[Image:EJC Esper 1742-1810.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Eugen Johann Christoph Esper.]]
'''Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper''' (2 June 1742 &amp;ndash; 27 July 1810) was a [[Germany|German]] [[entomologist]]. Born in [[Wunsiedel]] in Bavaria, he was professor of zoology at [[Erlangen]] university.

==Life and work==

Eugen and his brother Friedrich were introduced to [[natural history]] at an early age by their father Friedrich Lorenz Esper, an amateur [[botanist]]. Encouraged to abandon his [[theology]] course by his professor of botany [[Casimir Christoph Schmidel]] (1718–1792) Eugen Esper, instead, took instruction in natural history.

He obtained his doctorate of philosophy at the university of Erlangen in 1781 with a thesis entitled ''De varietatibus specierum in naturale productis''. The following year, he started to teach at the university initially as extraordinary professor, a poorly paid position, then in 1797 as the professor of [[philosophy]]. He directed the department of natural history in Erlangen from 1805. Thanks to him the university collections of [[mineral]]s, [[bird]]s, [[plant]]s, [[animal shell|shells]] and [[insect]]s grew very rapidly.

During his leisure hours Esper devoted himself to the study of nature and the preparation of manuscripts relating to natural history. He was the author of a series of booklets entitled ''Die Schmetterlinge in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen'' which were published between 1776 and 1807. These were richly illustrated; minerals, birds, plants, shells and insects being presented on 438 hand-coloured plates. A second work was published in 1829-1830 with  [[Toussaint de Charpentier]] (1779–1847). This is an important work on the butterflies of Germany, following the [[Linnean System]]. Esper was also the very first person to research [[palaeopathology]].

The review of entomology, ''Esperiana, Buchreihe zur Entomologie'', created in 1990, commemorates his name and  work.

Esper's collection is in the [[Zoologische Staatssammlung München]] [http://www.zsm.mwn.de/lep/e/teilsammlg.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13847">In [[computer science]], '''extended Backus-Naur form''' ('''EBNF''') is a family of [[metasyntax]] notations, any of which can be used to express a [[context-free grammar]].  EBNF is used to make a formal description of a [[formal language]] which can be a computer [[programming language]]. They are extensions of the basic [[Backus–Naur form]] (BNF) metasyntax notation.

The earliest EBNF was originally developed by [[Niklaus Wirth]] incorporating some of the concepts (with a different syntax and notation) from [[Wirth syntax notation]]. However, many variants of EBNF are in use. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has adopted an EBNF standard ([http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/s026153_ISO_IEC_14977_1996(E).zip ISO/IEC 14977]). This article uses EBNF as specified by the ISO for examples applying to all EBNFs. Other EBNF variants use somewhat different syntactic conventions.

== Basics ==
EBNF is a [[code]] that expresses the grammar of a formal language.  An EBNF consists of [[terminal symbol]]s and non-terminal production rules which are the restrictions governing how terminal symbols can be combined into a legal sequence.  Examples of terminal symbols include [[alphanumerics|alphanumeric characters]], [[punctuation|punctuation marks]], and [[whitespace character]]s.

The EBNF defines [[Production (computer science)|production rules]] where sequences of symbols are respectively assigned to a [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|nonterminal]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
digit excluding zero = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
digit                = "0" | digit excluding zero ;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This production rule defines the nonterminal ''digit'' which is on the left side of the assignment. The vertical bar represents an alternative and the terminal symbols are enclosed with quotation marks followed by a semicolon as terminating character. Hence a ''digit'' is a ''0'' or a ''digit excluding zero'' that can be ''1'' or ''2'' or ''3'' and so forth until ''9''.

A production rule can also include a sequence of terminals or nonterminals, each separated by a comma:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
twelve                          = "1", "2" ;
two hundred one                 = "2", "0", "1" ;
three hundred twelve            = "3", twelve ;
twelve thousand two hundred one = twelve, two hundred one ;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Expressions that may be omitted or repeated can be represented through curly braces { ... }:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
natural number = digit excluding zero, { digit } ;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In this case, the strings ''1'', ''2'', ...,''10'',...,''12345'',... are correct expressions. To represent this, everything that is set within the curly braces may be repeated arbitrarily often, including not at all.

An option can be represented through squared brackets [ ... ]. That is, everything that is set within the square brackets may be present just once, or not at all:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
integer = "0" | [ "-" ], natural number ;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Therefore, an [[integer]] is a zero (''0'') or a [[natural number]] that may be preceded by an optional [[Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|minus sign]].

EBNF also provides, among other things, the syntax to describe repetitions (of a specified number of times), to exclude some part of a production, and to insert comments in an EBNF grammar.

=== Table of symbols ===

=== Examples ===
Even EBNF can be described using EBNF. Consider the sketched grammar below:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
       | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
       | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
       | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b"
       | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
       | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p"
       | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w"
       | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
symbol = "[" | "]" | "{" | "}" | "(" | ")" | "&lt;" | "&gt;"
       | "'" | '"' | "=" | "|" | "." | "," | ";" ;
character = letter | digit | symbol | "_" ;
 
identifier = letter , { letter | digit | "_" } ;
terminal = "'" , character , { character } , "'" 
         | '"' , character , { character } , '"' ;
 
lhs = identifier ;
rhs = identifier
     | terminal
     | "[" , rhs , "]"
     | "{" , rhs , "}"
     | "(" , rhs , ")"
     | rhs , "|" , rhs
     | rhs , "," , rhs ;

rule = lhs , "=" , rhs , ";" ;
grammar = { rule } ;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like programming language that allows only assignments can be defined in EBNF as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
 (* a simple program syntax in EBNF − Wikipedia *)
 program = 'PROGRAM', white space, identifier, white space, 
            'BEGIN', white space, 
            { assignment, ";", white space }, 
            'END.' ;
 identifier = alphabetic character, { alphabetic character | digit } ;
 number = [ "-" ], digit, { digit } ;
 string = '"' , { all characters - '"' }, '"' ;
 assignment = identifier , ":=" , ( number | identifier | string ) ;
 alphabetic character = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G"
                      | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N"
                      | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U"
                      | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" ;
 digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
 white space = ? white space characters ? ;
 all characters = ? all visible characters ? ;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A syntactically correct program then would be:
&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
 PROGRAM DEMO1
 BEGIN
   A:=3;
   B:=45;
   H:=-100023;
   C:=A;
   D123:=B34A;
   BABOON:=GIRAFFE;
   TEXT:="Hello world!";

The language can easily be extended with [[control flow]]s, arithmetical expressions, and Input/Output instructions. Then a small, usable programming language would be developed.

== Advantages over BNF ==
Any [[grammar]] defined in EBNF can also be represented in BNF, though representations in the latter are generally lengthier. E.g., options and repetitions cannot be directly expressed in BNF and require the use of an intermediate rule or alternative production defined to be either nothing or the optional production for option, or either the repeated production of itself, recursively, for repetition. The same constructs can still be used in EBNF.

The BNF uses the symbols (&amp;lt;, &amp;gt;, |, ::=) for itself, but does not include quotes around terminal strings. This prevents these characters from being used in the languages, and requires a special symbol for the empty string. In EBNF, [[Terminal symbol|terminals]] are strictly enclosed within quotation marks ("..." or '...'). The angle brackets ("&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;") for [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|nonterminals]] can be omitted.

BNF syntax can only represent a rule in one line, whereas in EBNF a terminating character, the semicolon, marks the end of a rule.

Furthermore, EBNF includes mechanisms for enhancements, defining the number of repetitions, excluding alternatives, comments, etc.

== Conventions ==
1. The following conventions are used:
*Each meta-identifier of Extended BNF is written as one or more words joined together by [[hyphen]]s.
*A meta-identifier ending with ''-symbol'' is the name of a terminal symbol of Extended BNF.
2. The normal character representing each operator of Extended BNF and its implied precedence is (highest precedence at the top):
 * repetition-symbol
 - except-symbol
 , concatenate-symbol
 | definition-separator-symbol
 = defining-symbol
 ; terminator-symbol
 . terminator-symbol
3. The normal precedence is overridden by the following bracket pairs:
 '  first-quote-symbol            first-quote-symbol  '
 "  second-quote-symbol          second-quote-symbol  "
 (* start-comment-symbol          end-comment-symbol *)
 (  start-group-symbol              end-group-symbol  )
 [  start-option-symbol            end-option-symbol  ]
 {  start-repeat-symbol            end-repeat-symbol  }
 ?  special-sequence-symbol  special-sequence-symbol  ?

The first-quote-symbol is the [[apostrophe]] as defined by ISO/IEC 646:1991, that is to say Unicode U+0027 ('); the font used in ISO/IEC 14977:1996(E) renders it very much like the acute, Unicode U+00B4 (´), so confusion sometimes arises.  However, the ISO Extended BNF standard invokes ISO/IEC 646:1991, "ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange", as a normative reference and makes no mention of any other character sets, so formally, there is no confusion with Unicode characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range.

As examples, the following syntax rules illustrate the facilities for expressing repetition:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
aa = "A";
bb = 3 * aa, "B";
cc = 3 * [aa], "C";
dd = {aa}, "D";
ee = aa, {aa}, "E";
ff = 3 * aa, 3 * [aa], "F";
gg = {3 * aa}, "G";
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Terminal strings defined by these rules are as follows:
 aa: A
 bb: AAAB
 cc: C AC AAC AAAC
 dd: D AD AAD AAAD AAAAD etc.
 ee: AE AAE AAAE AAAAE AAAAAE etc.
 ff: AAAF AAAAF AAAAAF AAAAAAF
 gg: G AAAG AAAAAAG etc.

== Extensibility ==
According to the ISO 14977 standard EBNF is meant to be extensible, and two facilities are mentioned. The first is part of EBNF grammar, the special sequence, which is arbitrary text enclosed with question marks.  The interpretation of the text inside a special sequence is beyond the scope of the EBNF standard.  For example, the space character could be defined by the following rule:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
 space = ? US-ASCII character 32 ?;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The second facility for extension is using the fact that parentheses cannot in EBNF be placed next to identifiers (they must be concatenated with them). The following is valid EBNF:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
 something = foo, ( bar );
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following is ''not'' valid EBNF:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
 something = foo ( bar );
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Therefore, an extension of EBNF could use that notation. For example, in a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] grammar, function application could be defined by the following rule:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ebnf"&gt;
 function application = list( symbol, { expression } );
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7575">In [[optics]], '''group velocity dispersion''' (GVD) is a characteristic of a [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive medium]], used most often to determine how the medium will affect the duration of an optical pulse traveling through it. Formally, GVD is defined as the derivative of the inverse of [[group velocity]] of light in a material with respect to [[angular frequency]],&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega} \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega)} \right)_{\omega=\omega_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; are angular frequencies, and the group velocity &lt;math&gt;v_g(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;v_g(\omega) \equiv \partial \omega / \partial k&lt;/math&gt;. The units of group velocity dispersion are [time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[distance], often expressed in fs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/mm.

Equivalently, group velocity dispersion can be defined in terms of the medium-dependent wave vector &lt;math&gt;k(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \left( \frac{\partial^2 k}{\partial \omega^2}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0},&lt;/math&gt;
or in terms of the [[refractive index]] &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial \omega}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0} + \frac{\omega_0}{c}\left( \frac{\partial^2 n}{\partial \omega^2}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

Group velocity dispersion is most commonly used to estimate the amount of [[chirp]] that will be imposed on a pulse of light after passing through a material of interest. The relevant expression is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{chirp} = (\textrm{material} \,\, \textrm{thickness}) \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \, \times \, (\textrm{bandwidth}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation===

A simple illustration of how GVD can be used to determine pulse chirp can be seen by looking at the effect of a [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform-limited]]  pulse of duration &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; passing through a planar medium of thickness ''d''. Before passing through the medium, the phase offsets of all frequencies are aligned in time, and the pulse can be described as a function of time according to the expression
:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t^2}{4 \sigma^2}}e^{-i \omega_0 t},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently, as a function of frequency according to the expression
:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega) = Be^{-\frac{(w-w_0)^2}{4 (1/2\sigma)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
(the parameters ''A'' and ''B'' are normalization constants).
Passing through the medium results in a frequency-dependent phase accumulation &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi(\omega) = k(\omega) d&lt;/math&gt; , such that the post-medium pulse can be described by 
:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega) = Be^{-\frac{(w-w_0)^2}{4 (1/2\sigma)^2}}e^{i k(\omega) d}.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, the refractive index &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore the wave vector &lt;math&gt;k(\omega) = n(\omega)\omega/c&lt;/math&gt;, can be an arbitrary function of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, making it difficult to analytically perform the inverse Fourier transform back into the time domain. However, if the bandwidth of the pulse is narrow relative to the curvature of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then good approximations of the impact of the refractive index can be obtained by replacing &lt;math&gt;k(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; with its [[Taylor Series|Taylor expansion]] centered about &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n(\omega)\omega}{c} = \underbrace{\frac{n(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c}}_{k(\omega_0)} \quad+\quad \underbrace{\left[ \frac{n(\omega_0)+n'(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c}\right]}_{k'(\omega_0)}(\omega-\omega_0) \quad+\quad\frac{1}{2}\underbrace{\left[ \frac{2 n'(\omega_0) + n''(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c} \right]}_{\textrm{GVD}} (\omega-\omega_0)^2 \quad+\quad ...&lt;/math&gt;

Truncating this expression and inserting it into the post-medium frequency-domain expression results in a post-medium time-domain expression of 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{post}(t) = A_{post}\exp\left[-\frac{(t - k'(\omega_0) d)^2}{4 (\sigma^2-i \, \textrm{GVD} \, d/2)}\right] e^{i[k(\omega_0) d - \omega_0 t]}&lt;/math&gt;.
On balance, the pulse will have lengthened to an intensity [[standard deviation]] value of
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{post} = \sqrt{ \sigma^2 + \left[ d \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \, \times \, \left(\frac{1}{2\sigma}\right)\right]^2  }&lt;/math&gt;
thus validating the initial expression. Note that for a [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform-limited]] pulse σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2, which makes it appropriate to identify 1/(2σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) as the bandwidth.

===Alternate derivation===

An alternate derivation of the relationship between pulse chirp and GVD, which more immediately illustrates the reason why GVD can be defined by the derivative of inverse group velocity, can be outlined as follows. Consider two transform-limited pulses of carrier frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;, which are initially overlapping in time. After passing through the medium, these two pulses will exhibit a time delay between their respective pulse-envelope centers, given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_2)} - \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
The expression can be approximated as a [[Taylor Series|Taylor expansion]], giving 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega}\left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega')}\right)_{\omega' = \omega_1}(\omega_2-\omega_1) - \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_1) \, \times \, (\omega_2-\omega_1).&lt;/math&gt;
From here it is possible to imagine scaling this expression up two pulses to infinitely many. The frequency difference &lt;math&gt;\omega_2-\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by the bandwidth, and the time delay &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; evolves into the induced chirp.

==Group delay dispersion==

A closely related yet independent quantity is the '''group delay dispersion''' ('''GDD'''), defined such that group velocity dispersion is the group delay dispersion per unit length. GDD is commonly used as a parameter in characterizing layered mirrors, where the group velocity dispersion is not particularly-well defined, yet the chirp induced after bouncing off the mirror can be well-characterized. The units of group delay dispersion are [time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, often expressed in fs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The group delay dispersion (GDD) of an optical element is the derivative of the [[group delay]] with respect to [[angular frequency]], and also the second derivative of the optical phase. &lt;math&gt;D_2(\omega) = -\frac{\partial T_g}{d \omega} = \frac{d^2 \phi}{d\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a measure of the [[chromatic dispersion]] of the element. GDD is related to the total dispersion parameter &lt;math&gt;D_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math display="block"&gt; D_2(\omega) = -\frac{2\pi c}{\lambda^2}D_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Géza Horváth''' (23 November 1847, [[Čečejovce|Csécs]] –  8 September 1937, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] doctor and [[entomologist]] internationally recognized for his work on bugs ([[Hemiptera]]).&lt;ref name="NDSU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/ndsu/rider/Pentatomoidea/Biographical/biographical_H.htm#Horvath |work=Pentatomoidea Home page |title=Biographical &amp; Type Information - H#Horváth |first=David A. |last=Rider |accessdate= 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed extensively to the study of Hungarian [[scale insect]] fauna. He published over 350 papers in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kosztarab, 2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sel.barc.usda.gov/Coccoidea/scale2000.htm |title=Hungarian Coccidology |author=Kosztarab, Michael |date=March 2000 |work=The Scale, Volume XXIV |publisher=Systematic Entomology Lab, USDA |accessdate=22 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009064246/http://www.sel.barc.usda.gov/Coccoidea/scale2000.htm |archivedate=9 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made director of the newly established National Phylloxera Research Station in [[Budapest]] in 1880, where he did research on [[aphid]]s, [[Phylloxera]] and [[psyllid]]s. He continued as director after it was renamed The State Entomological Station and broadened its focus to other kinds of noxious insects.

In 1896 he returned to the [[Hungarian Natural History Museum|Hungarian National Museum]], where he was director of its Zoology Department until he retired. He remained active in entomology after retirement, and was president of the 10th International Zoological Conference when Budapest hosted it in 1927 (his 80th year).&lt;ref name="Howard1930"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=L.O.  |date=29 November 1930 |title= A History of Applied Entomology (Somewhat Anecdotal) |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume= 84 |number=3065 |pages=274–275 |format= |issn=0096-8749 |oclc=1376204 |accessdate=23 July 2011 |url=https://archive.org/stream/smithsonianmisce841931smit#page/274/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5300">'''''Health and Ageing''''' is a research programme set up by the [[Geneva Association, The|Geneva Association]], also known as the International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.
The Geneva Association Research Programme on Health and Ageing seeks to bring together facts, figures and analyses linked to issues in [[health]]. The key is to test new and promising ideas, linking them to related studies and initiatives in the health sector and trying to find solutions for the future financing of healthcare.

Major concerns are generally directed at the rising health costs resulting from technological advances and the changing demographic structure where the population over 60 largely exceeds other sectors. Importance is placed on two major issues:

* The change in demographic structures leading to the perceived "ageing society"
* The technological advances, which are perceived as resulting in increasing health costs

It is important to view these issues from the proper perspective. We are not ageing as a society but benefiting from an extended period of good health, which is largely a consequence of technological advances. It is not the increased spending on health that should be the concern but what it is spent on. It is crucial that spending is targeted and appropriately controlled with respect to the intended aim. '''Demographic changes''' and '''technological progress''' are driving changes in the governments' finances; the proportion of people in work compared with those already retired will decrease, leading to shrinking the tax base. The difficulties of financing the care of an increasing number of [[old age|elderly people]] for increasingly long periods combined with an ever-shrinking tax base are very great. Faced with the growing health expenditure, changes have affected entire [[health care systems|healthcare systems]]. The main trend in most developed countries is a creeping [[decentralization]] combined with a change in funding emphasis from public to a mix of public and private.

As the life cycle is getting longer, people have the opportunity to be productive for a longer period of time than ever before, which will therefore extend the period of wealth accumulation. This can allow funds or premiums to build up over a long period in order to cover the cost of care in the later stages of life. A good balance of the two complementarity systems public and private appears to be the best way to cope with the increase in health cost. To what extent could such mechanisms be managed in conjunction with building up pension or retirement funds? Would this imply that for some markets, in respect to certain products and circumstances we could adopt a common and coordinated approach to life and [[health insurance]]?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevaassociation.org/health_and_ageing.htm|title=Health and Ageing Research Programme Page|publisher=The Geneva Association|accessdate=2007-06-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070611173158/http://www.genevaassociation.org/health_and_ageing.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on 2011-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[sloth]]s, [[macropodid]]s, some [[monkey]]s, and one bird, the [[hoatzin]].&lt;ref name = "Grajal1989"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1126/science.245.4923.1236|last= Grajal|first= A.|first2=S.

==Cecum==
Hindgut fermenters generally have a cecum and large intestine that are much larger and more complex than those of a foregut or [[midgut]] fermenter.&lt;ref name=Waikato/&gt; Research on small cecum fermenters such as [[flying squirrel]]s, rabbits and lemurs has revealed these mammals to have a GI tract about 10-13 times the length of their body.&lt;ref name="Megagenomic Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lu|first=Hsiao-Pei |author2=Yu-bin Wang |author3=Shiao-Wei Huang |author4=Chung-Yen Lin |author5=Martin Wu |author6=Chih-hao Hsieh |author7=Hon-Tsen Yu|title=Metagenomic analysis reveals a functional signature for biomass degradation by cecal microbiota in the leaf-eating flying squirrel (Petaurista alborufus lena)|journal=BMC Genomics|date=10 September 2012|volume=13|series=1|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-13-466|pmc=3527328|pmid=22963241|pages=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to the high intake of [[fiber]] and other hard to digest compounds that are characteristic to the diet of monogastric herbivores. Unlike in foregut fermenters, the cecum is located after the [[stomach]] and small intestine in monogastric animals, which limits the amount of further digestion or absorption that can occur after the food is fermented.&lt;ref name="Comparative Digestion"&gt;{{cite web|last=James|title=Comparative Digestion|url=http://vetsci.co.uk/2010/05/14/comparative-digestion/|publisher=VetSci|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Large intestine==
In smaller hindgut fermenters of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Lagomorpha]] (rabbits, hares, and [[pika]]s), [[cecotrope]]s formed in the cecum are passed through the large intestine and subsequently reingested to allow another opportunity to absorb nutrients. Cecotropes are surrounded by a layer of mucus which protects them from stomach acid but which does not inhibit nutrient absorption in the small intestine.&lt;ref name="Comparative Digestion" /&gt; [[Coprophagy]] is also practiced by some rodents, such as the [[capybara]], [[guinea pig]] and related species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hirakawa, Hirofumi | title = Coprophagy in Leporids and Other Mammalian Herbivores | journal = Mammal Review | year = 2001 | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–80 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the marsupial [[common ringtail possum]].&lt;ref name="Chilcott1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilcott|first1=M. J.|last2=Hume|first2=I. D.|title=Coprophagy and selective retention of fluid digesta: their role in the nutrition of the common ringtail possum, ''Pseudocheirus peregrinus''.|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=33|issue=1|date=1985|pages=1–15|doi=10.1071/ZO9850001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is also beneficial in allowing for restoration of the microflora population, or [[gut flora]]. These microbes are found in the digestive organs of living creatures and can act as protective agents that strengthen the [[immune system]]. Hindgut fermenters do have the ability to expel their microflora, which is useful during the acts of [[hibernation]], [[estivation]] and [[torpor]].

==Efficiency==
While foregut fermentation is generally considered more efficient, and monogastric animals cannot digest cellulose as efficiently as ruminants,&lt;ref name=Waikato/&gt; hindgut fermentation allows animals to consume small amounts of low-quality forage all day long and thus survive in conditions where ruminants might not be able to obtain nutrition adequate for their needs. Hindgut fermenters are able to extract more nutrition out of small quantities of feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Budiansky |first=Stephen |title=The Nature of Horses |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=266YZUrbG00C&amp;printsec=frontcover| publisher=Free Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-684-82768-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The large hind-gut fermenters are bulk feeders: they ingest large quantities of low-nutrient food, which they process more rapidly than would be possible for a similarly sized foregut fermenter. The main food in that category is grass, and grassland grazers move over long distances to take advantage of the growth phases of grass in different regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jan | last=van der Made | first2=René | last2=Grube | contribution=The rhinoceroses from Neumark-Nord and their nutrition | editor-first=Harald | editor-last=Meller | title=Elefantenreich – Eine Fossilwelt in Europa | publisher=Halle/Saale | year=2010 | pages=382–394; see p. 387 | language=German, English | url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/ref_files/1295058899.pdf}}&lt;!--cite obtained from WP article Elasmotherium--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speed==
The ability to process food more rapidly than foregut fermenters gives hindgut fermenters an advantage at very large body size, as they are able to accommodate significantly larger food intakes. The largest extant and prehistoric [[megaherbivore]]s, elephants and [[indricothere]]s (a type of rhino), respectively, have been hindgut fermenters.&lt;ref name = "Clauss"&gt;{{cite journal

==Types==
Hindgut fermenters are subdivided into two groups based on the relative size of various digestive organs in relationship to the rest of the system: [[Colon (anatomy)|colonic]] fermenters tend to be larger species such as horses, and cecal fermenters are smaller animals such as rabbits and rodents.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Kerrin [https://web.archive.org/web/20140428070003/http://www.lafebervet.com/small-mammal-medicine/nutrition/adaptations-in-herbivore-nutrition Adaptations in Herbivore Nutrition], July 30, 2010. Lafebervet.com. Retrieved on 2017-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of the terminology, colonic fermenters such as horses make extensive use of the cecum to break down cellulose.&lt;ref name="Rutgers"&gt;{{citation

==Insects==
In addition to mammals, several insects are also hindgut fermenters, the best studied of which are the termites, which are characterised by an enlarged "paunch" of the hindgut that also houses the bulk of the gut microbiota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brune | first1 = A. | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = C. | year = 2015 | title = The Gut Microbiota of Termites: Digesting the Diversity in the Light of Ecology and Evolution | volume = 69 | pages = 145–166 |doi = 10.1146/annurev-micro-092412-155715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digestion of wood particles in lower termites is accomplished inside the phagosomes of gut flagellates, but in the flagellate-free higher termites, this appears to be accomplished by fibre-associated bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikaelyan | first1 = A. | last2 = Strassert | first2 = J. | last3 = Tokuda | first3 = G. | last4 =  Brune | first4 = A.| year = 2014 | title = The fibre-associated cellulolytic bacterial community in the hindgut of wood-feeding higher termites (Nasutitermes spp.) | url = | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 9| pages = 2711–2722 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12425 | pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Michael Shellenberger|Breakthrough Institute]], ITIF has called for increased public funding for [[sustainable energy|clean energy]] innovation, arguing that the United States is falling behind countries like [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Robert D. |authorlink1=Robert D.

Commenting on the study, former Dean of [[Wisconsin School of Business]] [[Michael Knetter]] agreed with the productivity figures, though expressed caution given that some of ITIF's contributors are in the technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Vanden Plas |title=Study affirms information technology-productivity link |publisher=WTN News |url=http://wistechnology.com/article.php?id=3795 |date= March 22, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ITIF's report ''Steal These Policies: Strategies for Reducing Digital Piracy'' provided the foundation for the controversial PROTECT IP and Stop Online Piracy Acts in the U.S. Congress, which the think tank acknowledged were at odds with the positions of many of its contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lochhead |first=Carolyn |title=Debate over Internet Piracy Legislation Heats Up |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=January 17, 2012 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/16/MN4B1MQ3PV.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the think tank published a widely cited report which found that the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]'s [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] electronic data surveillance program could cost the U.S. economy between $21.5 and $35 billion in lost [[cloud computing]] business over three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Andrea |title=NSA snooping could cost U.S. tech companies $35 billion over three years |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 7, 2013 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/07/nsa-snooping-could-cost-u-s-tech-companies-35-billion-over-three-years/ |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenbush |first=Steve |title=Cloud Industry Could Lose Billions on NSA Disclosures |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 6, 2013 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/08/06/the-morning-download-cloud-industry-could-lose-billions-on-nsa-disclosures/ |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yaron |first=Oded |title=Study: NSA leaks could cost U.S. $22-35 billion |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=August 8, 2013 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/.premium-1.540571 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leiden Classical''' was a [[distributed computing]] project run by the Theoretical Chemistry Department of the Leiden Institute of Chemistry at [[Leiden University]].  Leiden Classical is part of the [[BOINC]] system, and enables scientists or science students to submit their own test simulations of various molecules and atoms in a [[classical mechanics]] environment. ClassicalDynamics is a program (and with it a library) completely written in C++. The library is covered by the [[GNU LGPL|LGPL]] license and the main program is covered by the [[GNU GPL|GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://boinc.gorlaeus.net/download/DownLoads/Classical.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The project shut down on June 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://boinc.gorlaeus.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joining the project==
Participation was possible via the [[BOINC]] manager.  Using this software one was once able to create an account in the project.  Then someone can make a model of a dynamic system and simulation participating run. There are several models possible, to interactions between molecules or planets.

==User Submitted Calculations==
To create a personal calculation, your model must have 6 defined variables:
#Colors of your molecules
#Box in which the model is run
#Number of particles in the simulation
#Interaction between the particles
##[[Gravity]]
##[[Coulomb]] force
##[[Lennard–Jones potential|Lennard-Jones interaction]]
##[[Morse potential|Morse interaction]]
##[[Rydberg state|Rydberg interaction]]
##Harmonic spirit
##Harmonic bending
##Recurrent torsion interactions
#Distance conditions
#Confirmation parameter(s)

&lt;!-- Do not add a link to any individual project here under any circumstances. --&gt;

&lt;!--
PLEASE FOLLOW THESE RULES WHEN ADDING AN ENTRY:
  - Only projects that have achieved notability must be added. As per Wikipedia guideline (found at [[WP:MOSLIST]]), if an item is not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article of its own, it should not be added to a list. It's as simple as that.
  - Each entry must state the item name and a small one-line (but no larger) description.
  - The item name must be the project name if one is available, with only a secondary reference to the company name if any.
  - The item description should mention just how the project is a notable AI project.
  - Items must be added in alphabetical order within the appropriate section.
  - Items with external links have been removed in the past, and so external links probably shouldn't be added. If you do, you risk the project getting removed from the list altogether.

Syntax:
* [[Item name]], item description. [Mandatory_RefLink1] [Optional_Ref2]
* Item name, item description. [Mandatory_RefLink1] [Optional_Ref2]

'''Markarian 231''' ('''UGC 8058''') is a Type-1 [[Seyfert galaxy]] that was discovered in 1969 as part of a search of galaxies with strong [[ultraviolet]] radiation. It contains the nearest known [[quasar]], and in 2015 it was shown that the powerful [[active galactic nucleus]] present in the center of the galaxy may in fact be a supermassive [[binary black hole]]. It is located about 581 million [[light years]] away from [[Earth]].

==Characteristics==
The [[galaxy]] is now undergoing an energetic [[starburst galaxy|starburst]]. A nuclear ring of active star formation has been found in the center with a rate of formation greater than 100 [[solar masses]] per year. It is one of the most ultraluminous [[infrared]] galaxies with power derived from an accreting [[black hole]] in the center, and the closest known [[quasar]]. A 2015 study has found that the central black hole, estimated to be 150 million times the mass of our Sun, has a black hole companion weighing in at 4 million solar masses, and the duo completes an orbit  around each other every 1.2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HubbleSite - NewsCenter - Hubble Finds That the Nearest Quasar Is Powered by a Double Black Hole (08/27/2015) - The Full Story|url = http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2015/31/full/|website = hubblesite.org|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, that model has been definitively shown to be unfeasible.&lt;ref&gt;http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/4/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26323">'''Mechanical explanations of gravitation''' (or '''kinetic theories of gravitation''') are attempts to explain the action of [[gravity]] by aid of basic [[classical mechanics|mechanical]] processes, such as [[pressure]] forces caused by [[Impulse (physics)|pushes]], without the use of any [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]]. These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the [[aether theories|aether]]. However, such models are no longer regarded as viable theories within the mainstream scientific community and [[general relativity]] is now the standard model to describe gravitation without the use of actions at a distance. Modern "[[quantum gravity]]" hypotheses also attempt to describe gravity by more fundamental processes such as particle fields, but they are not based on classical mechanics.

== Screening ==
{{main|Le Sage's theory of gravitation}}

This theory is probably&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1876), Peck (1903), secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt; the best-known mechanical explanation, and was developed for the first time by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] in 1690, and re-invented, among others, by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (1748), [[Lord Kelvin]] (1872), and [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1900), and criticized by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1875), and [[Henri Poincaré]] (1908).

The theory posits that the [[force]] of gravity is the result of tiny [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s or [[wave]]s moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the [[universe]]. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed [[pressure]] but no net directional force. With a second object B present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, so-to-speak—that is, from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise, B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are "shadowing" each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces.

This shadow obeys the inverse square law, because the imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the "shadow" of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter.

''Criticism'': This theory was declined primarily for [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] reasons because a shadow only appears in this model if the particles or waves are at least partly absorbed, which should lead to an enormous heating of the bodies. Also drag, ''i.e.'' the resistance of the particle streams in the direction of motion, is a great problem too. This problem can be solved by assuming superluminal speeds, but this solution largely increases the thermal problems and contradicts [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré (1908), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell (1875, Atom), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vortex ==
[[Image:Descartes Aetherwirbel.jpg|thumb|250px|Aether vortices around celestial bodies]]
Because of his philosophical beliefs, [[René Descartes]] proposed in 1644 that no empty [[space]] can exist and that space must consequently be filled with [[matter]]. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with [[vortex|vortices]]. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to [[centrifugal force]], matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater [[inertia]]—so due to the pressure of the condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed into the center of the vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Descartes, R.  | author-link =René Descartes| date= 1824–1826 | title=Les principes de la philosophie (1644)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/document?O=N094260 | editor=Cousin, V. | journal= Oeuvres de Descartes | volume =3  | place = Paris | publisher=F.-G.

&lt;ref name=zehe&gt;Zehe (1980), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the basic premises of Descartes, [[Christiaan Huygens]] between 1669 and 1690 designed a much more exact vortex model. This model was the first theory of gravitation which was worked out mathematically. He assumed that the aether particles are moving in every direction, but were thrown back at the outer borders of the vortex and this causes (as in the case of Descartes) a greater concentration of fine matter at the outer borders. So also in his model the fine matter presses the rough matter into the center of the vortex. Huygens also found out that the centrifugal force is equal to the force, which acts in the direction of the center of the vortex ([[centripetal force]]). He also posited that bodies must consist mostly of empty space so that the aether can penetrate the bodies easily, which is necessary for mass proportionality. He further concluded that the aether moves much faster than the falling bodies. At this time, Newton developed his theory of gravitation which is based on attraction, and although Huygens agreed with the mathematical formalism, he said the model was insufficient due to the lack of a mechanical explanation of the force law. Newton's discovery that gravity obeys the [[inverse square law]] surprised Huygens and he tried to take this into account by assuming that the speed of the aether is smaller in greater distance.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Huygens, C.  | author-link =Christiaan Huygens| date= 1944 | title=Discours de la Cause de la Pesanteur (1690)  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77870g/f451.table |editors=Société Hollaise des Sciences | journal=Oeuvres complètes de Christiaan Huygens | volume =21  | place = Den Haag | pages =443–488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lunteren&gt;Van Lunteren (2002), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Newton objected to the theory because [[drag (physics)|drag]] must lead to noticeable deviations of the orbits which were not observed.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{Citation  | author=Newton, I.  | author-link =Isaac Newton | date= 1846 | title=Newton's Principia : the mathematical principles of natural philosophy (1687) | url=https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich | publisher=Daniel Adee| place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was that [[moon]]s often move in different directions, against the direction of the vortex motion. Also, Huygens' explanation of the inverse square law is [[Begging the question|circular]], because this means that the aether obeys  [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]]. But a theory of gravitation has to explain those laws and must not presuppose them.&lt;ref name=zehe /&gt;&lt;ref name=newton /&gt;

== Streams ==
In a 1675 letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]], and later to [[Robert Boyle]], Newton wrote the following: [Gravity is the result of] “a condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” He also asserted that such a process was consistent with all his other work and Kepler's Laws of Motion.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, letters quoted in detail in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science by Edwin Arthur Burtt, Double day Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Newtons' idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as [[Bernoulli's principle]] published in Daniel Bernoulli's book ''Hydrodynamica'' in 1738.

However, although he later proposed a second explanation (see section below), Newton's comments to that question remained ambiguous. In the third letter to Bentley in 1692 he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00258 Newton, 1692, 4th letter to Bentley&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation in the sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Newton is also well known for the phrase [[Hypotheses non fingo]], written in 1713:&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And according to the testimony of some of his friends, such as [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] or [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]], Newton thought that gravitation is based directly on divine influence.&lt;ref name=lunteren /&gt;

Similar to Newton, but mathematically in greater detail, [[Bernhard Riemann]] assumed in 1853 that the gravitational aether is an [[Incompressible flow|incompressible fluid]] and normal matter represents sinks in this aether. So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally to the masses within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into the direction of the central mass. Riemann speculated that the absorbed aether is transferred into another world or dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Riemann, B. | author-link =Bernhard Riemann| date= 1876 | title=Neue mathematische Prinzipien der Naturphilosophie | editor=Dedekind, R. |editor2=Weber, W. | journal= Bernhard Riemanns Werke und gesammelter Nachlass | place = Leipzig | pages =528–538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to solve the energy problem was made by [[Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky]] in 1888. Based on his aether stream model, which was similar to that of Riemann, he argued that the absorbed aether might be converted into new matter, leading to a mass increase of the celestial bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Yarkovsky, I. O.| author-link =Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky  | title = Hypothese cinetique de la Gravitation universelle et connexion avec la formation des elements chimiques | place= Moscow | date =1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': As in the case of Le Sage's theory, the disappearance of energy without explanation violates the [[energy conservation law]]. Also some drag must arise, and no process which leads to a creation of matter is known.

== Static pressure ==

Newton updated the second edition of ''Optics'' (1717) with another mechanical-ether theory of gravity. Unlike his first explanation (1675 - see Streams), he proposed a stationary aether which gets thinner and thinner nearby the celestial bodies. On the analogy of the [[lift (force)|lift]], a force arises, which pushes all bodies to the central mass. He minimized drag by stating an extremely low density of the gravitational aether.

Like Newton, [[Leonhard Euler]] presupposed in 1760 that the gravitational aether loses density in accordance with the inverse square law. Similarly to others, Euler also assumed that to maintain mass proportionality, matter consists mostly of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Euler, L.  | author-link =Leonhard Euler| date= 1776 | title=Briefe an eine deutsche Prinzessin, Nr. 50, 30. August 1760  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaMAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA173,M1 | pages=173–176 | place=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Both Newton and Euler gave no reason why the density of that static aether should change. Furthermore, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] pointed out that in this "hydrostatic" model "''the state of stress... which we must suppose to exist in the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than that which the strongest steel could support''".&lt;ref name=maxwell&gt;Maxwell (1875, Attraction), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waves ==

[[Robert Hooke]] speculated in 1671 that gravitation is the result of all bodies emitting waves in all directions through the aether. Other bodies, which interact with these waves, move in the direction of the source of the waves. Hooke saw an analogy to the fact that small objects on a disturbed surface of water move to the center of the disturbance.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;Taylor (1876), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theory was worked out mathematically by [[James Challis]] from 1859 to 1876. He calculated that the case of attraction occurs if the wavelength is large in comparison with the distance between the gravitating bodies. If the wavelength is small, the bodies repel each other. By a combination of these effects, he also tried to explain all other forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Challis, J. | author-link =James Challis| date= 1869 | title=Notes of the Principles of Pure and Applied Calculation  | url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprinciple00chalrich | place = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'': Maxwell objected that this theory requires a steady production of waves, which must be accompanied by an infinite consumption of energy.&lt;ref name="maxwell 2"&gt;Maxwell (1875), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;
Challis himself admitted, that he hadn't reached a definite result due to the complexity of the processes.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

== Pulsation ==

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1871) and [[Carl Anton Bjerknes]] (1871) assumed that all bodies pulsate in the aether. This was in analogy to the fact that, if the pulsation of two spheres in a fluid is in phase, they will attract each other; and if the pulsation of two spheres is ''not'' in phase, they will repel each other. This mechanism was also used for explaining the nature of [[electric charge]]s. Among others, this hypothesis has also been examined by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] and [[Woldemar Voigt]].&lt;ref name=zenneck&gt;Zenneck (1903), Secondary sources&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism'' : To explain universal gravitation, one is forced to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase—which appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be incompressible to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances.&lt;ref name=zenneck /&gt; And Maxwell argued that this process must be accompanied by a permanent new production and destruction of aether.&lt;ref name=maxwell /&gt;

== Other historical speculations ==

In 1690, [[Pierre Varignon]] assumed that all bodies are exposed to pushes by aether particles from all directions, and that there is some sort of limitation at a certain distance from the Earth's surface which cannot be passed by the particles. He assumed that if a body is closer to the Earth than to the limitation boundary, then the body would experience a greater push from above than from below, causing it to fall toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Varignon, P. | author-link =Pierre Varignon| date= 1690 | title=Nouvelles conjectures sur la Pesanteur  | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74179x | place = Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1748, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] assumed that the effect of the aether is proportional to the complete surface of the elementary components of which matter consists (similar to Huygens and Fatio before him). He also assumed an enormous penetrability of the bodies. However, no clear description was given by him as to how exactly the aether interacts with matter so that the law of gravitation arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Lomonosow, M. | author-link =Mikhail Lomonosov| date= 1970 | title=On the Relation of the Amount of Material and Weight (1758)  | url=https://archive.org/details/mikhailvasilevic017733mbp | editor= Henry M. Leicester | journal= Mikhail Vasil'evich Lomonosov on the Corpuscular Theory | place = Cambridge | publisher=Harvard University Press | pages =224–233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, [[John Herapath]] tried to apply his co-developed model of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases on gravitation. He assumed that the aether is heated by the bodies and loses density so that other bodies are pushed to these regions of lower density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Herapath, J. | author-link =John Herapath| date= 1821 | title=On the Causes, Laws and Phenomena of Heat, Gases, Gravitation  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCsAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA273 | journal= [[Annals of Philosophy]]  | volume =9  | place = Paris | pages =273–293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was shown by Taylor that the decreased density due to [[thermal expansion]] is compensated for by the increased speed of the heated particles; therefore, no attraction arises.&lt;ref name=taylor /&gt;

==Recent theorizing==
These mechanical explanations for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although such ideas continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the twentieth century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited. However, some researchers outside the scientific mainstream still try to work out some consequences of those theories.

'''''Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present''''' is a 2007 book by [[Harriet A. Washington]]. It is a history of [[Human experimentation in the United States|medical experimentation]] on [[African American]]s.  From the era of slavery to the present day, this book presents the first full account of black America's mistreatment as unwitting subjects of medical experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&amp;dq=Medical+Apartheid:+The+Dark+History+of+Medical+Experimentation+on+Black+Americans+from+Colonial+Times+to+the+Present&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jr_q9LR7yo&amp;sig=onSS7mu312-KnBgh3I-L3rfZnZw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qsWwTI3xAZHEvQPIs63CBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBA  Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present] Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alondra Nelson. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010500180.html Unequal Treatment: How African Americans have often been the unwitting victims of medical experiments] ''The Washington Post'', January 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Medical Apartheid'' traces the convoluted history of medical experimentation on Black Americans in the United States since the middle of the eighteenth century. Harriet Washington argues that "diverse forms of [[racial discrimination]] have shaped both the relationship between white physicians and black patients and the attitude of the latter towards modern medicine in general".&lt;ref name=sochist&gt;[http://shm.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/620.extract Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present] ''Social History of  Medicine'' (2007) 20 (3): 620-621.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The book is divided into three parts: the first is about the cultural memory of medical experimentation; the second examines recent cases of medical abuse and research; while the last addresses the complex relationship between racism and medicine. Some topics discussed are well-known, such as the ‘[[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]]’ (1932–72), in which African Americans suffering from the disease were prevented from receiving the necessary medication by the US Public Health Service so that the evolution of the disease could be observed, but other episodes are less well known to the general public.&lt;ref name=sochist/&gt; The book also mentions cases of [[Medical Experimentation in Africa]] and their links to African-American cases.

==Awards==
''Medical Apartheid'' won the 2007 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Nonfiction. Harriet Washington has been a fellow in ethics at the [[Harvard Medical School]], a fellow at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], and a senior research scholar at the [[National Center for Bioethics]] at [[Tuskegee University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powells.com/biblio/9780767915472 Medical Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">The '''Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards''' (usually referred to as NRSA) are a family of [[Grant (money)|grants]] provided by the United States [[National Institutes of Health]] for training researchers in the [[behavioral sciences]] and [[health sciences]]. They are a highly selective and very prestigious source of funding for [[doctoral]] and [[postdoctoral]] trainees. The grants are awarded based on lengthy proposals submitted by applicants in which original experimental plans are described. The proposals are evaluated and given an impact score reflecting scientific merit by a study section at the [[Center for Scientific Review]] at the NIH. Only applications with very good impact scores are funded, based on budget cutoffs determined by each individual institute. US citizenship or permanent residency is required. The [[NIH]] awarded $77,000,000 in individual grants and over $600,000,000 in institutional training grants in [[fiscal year]] 2005 [http://grants.nih.gov/training/outcomes.htm].

NRSA awards are mostly given to students working on a [[Ph.D]] or an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] or other medical degree, or to individuals who have just earned one of these degrees and are beginning their careers. The NRSA program also provides institutions with [[training grants]] that can be used to fund one or more students. NRSA grants are notable for their flexibility: postdoctoral researchers can propose to work at any university, and the only requirement is that they commit to at least one year of research in their field following their first year of funding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33278">'''Normality''' is a [[behavior]] that can be normal for an individual (intrapersonal normality) when it is consistent with the most common behaviour for that person. Normal is also used to describe individual behaviour that conforms to the most common behaviour in society (known as [[conformity]]). Definitions of normality vary by person, time, place, and situation – it changes along with changing societal standards and [[Norm (social)|norms]]. Normal behavior is often only recognized in contrast to [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]].  In its simplest form, normality is seen as good while abnormality is seen as bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven James|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|location=New York|isbn=9780313399312|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=otwxtVaj_O0C&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=Normality+does+not+equal+mental+health:+The+need+to+look+elsewhere+for+standards+of+good+psychological+health.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone being seen as normal or not normal can have social ramifications, such as being [[Inclusion (value and practice)|included]], excluded or [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] by larger society.

== Definitions ==
Normality has been functionally and differentially defined by a vast number of disciplines, so there is not one single definition.

===Statistics===
In general, 'normal' refers to a lack of significant deviation from the average.  The word normal is used in a more narrow sense in mathematics, where a [[normal distribution]] describes a population whose characteristics centers around the average or the norm.  When looking at a specific behaviour, such as the frequency of lying, a researcher may use a Gaussian bell curve to plot all reactions, and a normal reaction would be within one standard deviation, or the most average 68.3%.  However, this mathematical model only holds for one particular trait at a time, since, for example,  the probability of a single individual being within one standard deviation for 36 independent variables would be one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Modis|first=Theodore|title=The normal, the natural, and the harmonic|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|date=March 2007|volume=74|issue=3|pages=391–398|url=http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2006.07.003|access-date=2012-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085907/http://growth-dynamics.com/articles/Normal.htm|archive-date=2012-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In statistics, normal is often arbitrarily considered anything that falls within about 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, or the most average 95% (see [[1.96]]). The probability of an individual being within 1.96 standard deviations for 269 independent variables is approximately one in a million.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^269 is approximately 0.000001&lt;/ref&gt;  For only 59 independent variables, the probability is just under 5%.&lt;ref&gt;Figured mathematically 0.95^59 is approximately 0.048&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this definition of normal, it is abnormal to be normal for 59 independent variables.{{clarify|what is the relevance of this?  For instance, is this bounding what it means to be socially normal to 59 traits, or is it simply saying nothing can be technically "normal" when 60 variables are in play?--the latter statement seems much more concise than what is currently stated in the article.|date=August 2018}}

===Durkheim===
The French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] indicated in his ''Rules of the Sociological Method'' that it was necessary for the sociological method to offer parameters to distinguish normality from pathology or abnormality.  He suggested that behaviors or "social facts" which are present in the majority of cases are normal, and exceptions to that behavior indicate pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Émile|title=Rules of Sociological Method|year=1982|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-02-907940-9|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Durkheim's model of normality further explained that the most frequent or general behaviors, and thus the most normal behaviors, will persist through transition periods in society. Crime, for instance, exists under every society through every time period, and so should be considered normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Robert Alun|title=mile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works|year=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=60–81|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/rules.html#pgfId=2822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a two-fold version of normality; behaviors considered normal on a societal level may still be considered pathological on an individual level. On the individual level, people who violate social norms, such as  [[criminals]], will invite a punishment from others in the society.

===Influence of social norms===
Individuals' behaviours are guided by what they perceive to be society's expectations and their peers' norms. People measure the appropriateness of their actions by how far away they are from those [[norm (social)|social norms]]. However, what is perceived as the norm may or may not actually be the most common behaviour. In some cases of [[pluralistic ignorance]], most people falsely believe the social norm is one thing, but in fact very few people hold that view.

When people are made more aware of a social norm, particularly a [[descriptive norm]] (a norm describing what is done), their behaviour changes to become closer to that norm.  The power of these norms can be harnessed by [[Social norms approach|social norms marketing]], where the social norm is advertised to people in an attempt to stop extreme behaviour, such as binge drinking.  However, people at the other extreme (very little alcohol consumption) are equally likely to change their behaviour to become closer to the norm, in this case by increasing alcohol consumption.  Instead of using descriptive norms, more effective social norms marketing may use  [[injunctive norms]].  Instead of describing what behaviour is most commonly done, an injunctive norm is what is approved or disapproved of by society.  When individuals become aware of the injunctive norm, only the extremes will change their behaviour (by decreasing alcohol consumption) without the boomerang effect of under-indulgers increasing their drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=P. Wesley|author2=Jessica M. Nola |author3=Robert B. Cialdini |author4=Noah J. Goldstein |author5=Vladas Griskevicius |title=The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms|journal=Psychological Science|date=May 2007|volume=18 | issue = 5|pages=429–434|url=https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/118375.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01917.x |pmid=17576283|hdl=10211.3/199684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social norms that guide people are not always normal for everyone.  Behaviours that are abnormal for most people may be considered normal for a subgroup or [[subculture]].  For example, normal college student behaviour may be to party and drink alcohol, but for a subculture of religious students, normal behaviour may be to go to church and pursue religion related activities.  Subcultures may actively reject "normal" behaviour, instead replacing society norms with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magolda|first=Peter|author2=Kelsey Ebben |title=Students Serving Christ: Understanding the Role of Student Subcultures on a College Campus|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=January 2008|volume=32|issue=2|pages=138–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===
A disharmony exists between a virtual identity of the self and a real social identity, whether it be in the form of a trait or attribute. If a person does not have this disharmony, then he or she is described as normal. A virtual identity can take many definitions, but in this case a virtual identity is the identity that persons mentally create that conforms to societal standards and norms, it may not represent how they actually are, but it represents what they believe is the typical "normal" person. A real social identity is the identity that persons actually have in their society or is perceived, by themselves or others, to have. If these two identities have differences between each other, there is said to be disharmony.  Individuals may monitor and adapt their behaviour in terms of others' expected perceptions of the individual, which is described by the social psychology theory of [[self-presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=PRESENTATION OF SELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE|year=1959|publisher=DOUBLEDAY &amp; COMPANY INC|location=NY|url=http://www.clockwatching.net/~jimmy/eng101/articles/goffman_intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, normality exists based on societal norms, and whether someone is normal is entirely up to how he or she views him- or herself in contrast to how society views him or her. While trying to define and quantify normality is a good start, all definitions confront the problem of whether we are even describing an idea that even exists since there are so many different ways of viewing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skopalová|first=Jitka|title=Social eviations, Labelling, and Normality|journal=Human Affairs|year=2010|volume=20|issue=4|pages=327–337|doi=10.2478/v10023-010-0034-8|url=http://versita.metapress.com/content/a17053485p84802w/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==
Many difficulties arise in measuring normal behaviors – biologists come across parallel issues when defining normality.  One complication which arises regards whether 'normality' is used correctly in everyday language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wachbroit|first=Robert|title=Normality as a Biological Concept|year=1994|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=61|issue=4|pages=579–591 |doi=10.1086/289823}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People say "This heart is abnormal" if only a portion of it is not working correctly, yet it may be inaccurate to include the entirety of the heart under the abnormal description.  There can be a difference between the normality of the structure and function of a body part.  Similarly, a behavioural pattern may not conform to social norms, but still be effective and non-problematic for that individual.  Where there is a dichotomy between appearance and function of a behaviour, it may be difficult to measure its normality.  This is applicable when trying to diagnose a pathology and is addressed in the DSM.

== Social Norms ==
What is viewed as normal can change dependent on both timeframe and environment. Normality can be viewed as "an endless process of man's self-creation and his reshaping of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Syristová|first=Eva|title=A Contribution to Phenomenology of the Human Normality in the Modern Time|year=2010| publisher=Dordrecht: Springer Science + Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this idea, it is possible to surmise that normality is not an all-encompassing term, but simply a relative term based around a current trend in time. With statistics, this is likened to the thought that if the data gathered provides a mean and standard deviation, over time these data that predict "normalness" start to predict or dictate it less and less since the social idea of normality is dynamic. This is shown in studies done on behavior in psychology and sociology where behavior in mating rituals or religious rituals can change within a century in humans, showing that the "normal" way that these rituals are performed shift and a new procedure becomes the normal one.

As another example, understandings of what is normal sexual behaviour varies greatly across time and place.  In many countries, perceptions on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] are largely becoming more liberal, especially views on the normality of masturbation and homosexuality.  Social understanding on normal sexual behaviour also varies greatly country by country – countries can be divided into categories of how they approach sexual normality, as conservative, homosexual-permissive, or liberal.  The United States, Ireland, and Poland have more conservative social understanding of sexuality among university students, while Scandinavian students consider a wider variety of sexual acts as normal.  Although some attempts have been made to define sexual acts as normal, abnormal, or indeterminate, these definitions are time-sensitive.  [[Gayle Rubin]]'s 1980s model of sexual 'normality' was comprehensive at the time but has since become outdated as society has liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Todd G.|author2=Travis A. Ryan |author3=Lisa Fox |author4=Daragh T. McDermott |author5=Melanie A. Morrison |title=Canadian university students' perceptions of the practices that constitute "normal" sexuality for men and women|journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|year=2008|volume=17 | issue = 4|pages=161–171|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_4_17/ai_n31903471/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since normality shifts in time and environment, the mean and standard deviation are only useful for describing normality from the environment from which they are collected.

{{anchor|interpersonal}}

==Intrapersonal==
Most definitions of normality consider interpersonal normality, the comparison between many different individual's behaviours to distinguish normality from abnormality.  Intrapersonal normality looks at what is normal behaviour for one particular person (consistency within a person) and would be expected to vary person-to-person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hur|first=Taekyun |author2=Neal J. Roese |author3=Jae-Eun Namkoong|title=Regrets in the East and West: Role of intrapersonal versus interpersonal norms|journal=Asian Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2009|volume=12|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.1111/j.1467-839X.2009.01275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mathematical model of normality could still be used for intrapersonal normality, by taking a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of many different occurrences of behaviour from one person over time.  Also like interpersonal normality, intrapersonal normality may change over time, due to changes in the individual as they age and due to changes in society (since society's view of normality influences individual peoples' behaviour).

It is most comfortable for people to engage in behaviour which conforms to their own personal habitual norms.  When things go wrong, people are more likely to attribute the negative outcome on any abnormal behaviour leading up to the mishap.  After a car crash, people may say "if only I didn't leave work early", blaming the crash on their actions which were not normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catellani|first=Patrizia|author2=Augusta I. Albertici |author3=Patrizia Milesi |title=Counterfactual thinking and stereotypes: The nonconformity effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=34|issue=4|pages=421–436|doi=10.1002/ejsp.206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[counterfactual thinking]] particularly associates abnormal behaviour with negative outcomes.

== Medicine ==
In [[medicine]], behavioral normality pertains to a patient's mental condition aligning with that of a model, [[health]]y patient.  A person without any [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] is considered a normal patient, whereas a person with a mental disability or illness is viewed as abnormal. These normals and abnormals in the context of mental health subsequently create negative stigmatic perceptions towards individuals with mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Mental Illness|url = https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|website = Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation (Formerly NARSAD)|accessdate = 2015-12-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135329/https://bbrfoundation.org/mental-illness-1|archive-date = 2015-12-22|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation stated that "an estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older – about 1 in 4 adults – suffer from one or more of (several) disorders in a given year".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the population of American individuals living with mental illness is not as small of a minority as commonly perceived, it is considered abnormal nonetheless, therefore the subject of discrimination and abuse such as violent therapies, punishments, or labeling for life by the normal, healthy majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top 10 Forms of Psychiatric Institution Abuse {{!}} CCHR International|url = http://www.cchrint.org/2014/11/13/top-10-forms-of-psychiatric-institution-abuse/|accessdate = 2015-12-10|date = 2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC reported that "cluster[s] of negative attitudes and beliefs motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses".  In continuum, the resources available to those who suffer from such illness are limited, and government support is constantly being cut from programs that help individuals living with mental illness live more comfortable, accommodative, happier lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Neglect of Mental Illness Exacts a Huge Toll, Human and Economic|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-neglect-of-mental-illness/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuronal and synaptic ==
Hebbian associative learning and memory maintenance depends on synaptic normalization mechanisms to prevent [[synaptic runaway]].&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbib|first=M. A.|title=The handbook of brain theory and neural networks|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where synaptic runaway describes overcrowding of [[dendrite|dendritic]] associations, which reduce sensory or behavioural acuteness proportional to the level of synaptic runaway. Synaptic/neuronal normalization refers to synaptic competition, where the prosper of one synapse may weakening the efficacy of other nearby surrounding synapses with redundant neurotransmission.

Animal dendritic density greatly increases throughout waking hours despite intrinsic normalization mechanisms as described as above. The growth rate of synaptic density is not sustained in a cumulative fashion. Without a pruning state, the signal to noise ratio of CNS mechanism would not be able to operate with maximum effectiveness, and learning would be detrimental to animal survival. Neuronal and synaptic normalization mechanisms must operate so positive association feedback loops to not become rampant while constantly processing new environmental information.&lt;ref name="Arbib"/&gt;

Some researchers speculate that the slow oscillation (nREM) cycles of animal sleep constitute an essential 're-normalization' phase. The re-normalization occurs from cortical large amplitude brain rhythm, in the low delta range (0.5–2&amp;nbsp;Hz), synaptically downscaling the associations from the wakeful learning state.&lt;ref name="Tononi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tononi|first=Giulio|title=Giulio Tononi: 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science Symposium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbyITI13zg|work=In search of sleep function|publisher=Allan Institute for Brain Science|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the strongest associations survive the pruning from this phase. This allows retention of salient information coding from the previous day, but also allows more cortical space and energy distribution to continue effective learning subsequently after a slow-wave oscillation episode of sleep.&lt;ref name="Tononi"/&gt;

Also, organisms tend to have a normal biological developmental pathway as a central nervous system ages and/or learns. Deviations for a species' normal development frequently will result in behaviour dysfunction, or death, of that organism.

==Effects of labeling==
When people do not conform to the normal standard, they are often labelled as sick, disabled, abnormal, or unusual, which can lead to marginalization or [[social stigma|stigmatization]].  Most people want to be normal and strive to be perceived as such, so that they can relate to society at large.  Without having things in common with the general population, people may feel isolated among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridgens|first=Ruth|title=Disability and Being 'Normal': A Response to McLaughlin and Goodley: Response|journal=Sociology|date=5 August 2009|volume=43|pages=753–761|doi=10.1177/0038038509105419|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/43/4/753|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abnormal person feels like they have less in common with the normal population, and others have difficulty relating to things that they have not experienced themselves.  Additionally, abnormality may make others uncomfortable, further separating the abnormally labelled individual.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Since being normal is generally considered an ideal, there is often pressure from external sources to [[conformity|conform]] to normality, as well as pressure from people's intrinsic desire to feel included.  For example, families and the medical community will try to help [[disability|disabled]] people live a normal life.  However, the pressure to appear normal, while actually having some deviation, creates a conflict – sometimes someone will appear normal, while actually experiencing the world differently or struggling.  When abnormality makes society feel uncomfortable, it is the exceptional person themselves who will laugh it off to relieve social tension.  A disabled person is given normal freedoms, but may not be able to show negative emotions. Lastly, society's rejection of deviance and the pressure to normalize may cause shame in some individuals.  Abnormalities may not be included in an individual's sense of [[identity (social science)|identity]], especially if they are unwelcome abnormalities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When an individual's abnormality is labelled as a [[pathology]], it is possible for that person to take on both elements of the [[sick role]] or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses.  Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Clinical ==
Applying normality clinically depends on the field and situation a practitioner is in. In the broadest sense, clinical normality is the idea of uniformity of physical and psychological functioning across individuals. Normality, and abnormality, can be characterized statistically.
Related to the previous definition, statistically normality is usually defined it in terms of a normal distribution curve, with the so-called 'normal zone' commonly accounting for 95.45%  percent of all the data. The remaining 4.55% will lie split outside of two standard deviations from the mean. Thus any variable case that lies outside of two deviations from the mean would be considered abnormal. However, the critical value of such statistical judgments may be subjectively altered to a less conservative estimate. It is in fact normal for a population to have a proportion of abnormals. The presence of abnormals is important because it is necessary to define what 'normal' is, as normality is a relative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thibaut|first=John W.|title=The concept of normality in clinical psychology|journal=Psychological Review|year=1943|volume=50|issue=3|pages=4–7|doi=10.1037/h0062556}}&lt;/ref&gt; So at a group, or macro level, of analysis; abnormalities are normal given a demographic survey, but at an individual level abnormal individuals are seen as being deviant in someway that needs to be corrected.
Statistical normality is important in determining demographic pathologies. When a variable rate, such as virus spread within a human population, exceeds its normal infection rate then preventative or emergency measures can be introduced. 
It is often impractical to apply statistical normality to diagnose individuals. Symptom normality is the current, and assumed most effective, way to assess patient pathology. Psychiatric normality, in a broad sense, states that psychopathology are disorders that are deviations from normality.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM ===
Normality, as a relative concept, is intrinsically involved with contextual elements. As a result, clinical disorder classification has particular challenges in discretely diagnosing 'normal' constitutions from  true disorders. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is the psychiatric profession's official classification manual of mental disorders since its first published version DSM-I in by the APA,{{clarify|date=February 2015}} 1952. As the DSM evolved into its current version, DSM-5 in late 2013, there have been numerous conflicts in proposed classification between [[mental illness]] and normal mentality. Dr. Allen Frances, who chaired the task force for content in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR even wrote a scathing indictment of the pressures incumbent on the definition of "normal" relative to psychological constructs and mental illness in his book, ''Saving Normal''.

Most of this difficulty stems from the DSM's ambiguity of natural contextual stressor reactions versus individual dysfunction. There are some key progressions along the DSM history that have attempted to integrate some aspects of normality into proper diagnosis classification. As a diagnostic manual for classification of abnormalities, all DSMs have been biased towards classifying symptoms as disorders by emphasizing symptomatic singularity. The result is an encompassing misdiagnosis of  possible normal [[symptom]]s, appropriate as contextually derived.&lt;ref name="Allan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Allan V.|title=Transforming Normality into Pathology: The DSM and the Outcomes of Stressful Social Arrangements|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behaviour|year=2007|volume=48|issue=3|pages=211–222|doi=10.1177/002214650704800301|pmid=17982864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-II ===

The second edition of the DSM, DSM-II, could not be effectively applied because of its vague descriptive nature. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamic]] etiology was a strong theme in classifying mental illnesses. The applied definitions became idiosyncratic, stressing individual unconscious roots. This made applying the DSM unreliable across [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]].&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; No distinction between abnormal to normal was established.

Evidence of the classification ambiguity were punctated by the [[Rosenhan experiment]] of 1972. This experiment demonstrated that the methodology of psychiatric diagnosis could not effectively distinguish normal from disordered mentalities. DSM-II labelled 'excessive' behavioral and emotional response as an index of abnormal mental wellness to diagnose some particular disorders.&lt;ref name="DSMII"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, Second edition|year=1968|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Excessiveness' of a reaction implied alternative normal behaviour which would have to include a situational factor in evaluation. As an example; a year of intense grief from the death of a spouse may be a normal appropriate response. To have intense [[grief]] for twenty years would be indicative of a mental disorder. As well, to grieve intensely over the loss of a sock would also not be considered normal responsiveness and indicate a mental disorder. The consideration of proportionality to stimuli was a perceived strength in psychiatric diagnosis for the DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

Another characteristic of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified [[homosexuality]] as a mental disorder. Thus, homosexuality was psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. Homosexuality was later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent was to have a label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Homosexuality: Proposed Change in DSM-11|journal=The American Psychiatric Association|year=1973|volume=6th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner homosexuality would not be viewed as an atypical illness.&lt;ref name="change"/&gt; Only if it was distressing would homosexuality be classified as a mental illness.&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt; However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any homosexuality was normal either.  This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSMII"/&gt;

=== DSM-III ===

DSM-III was a best attempt to credit psychiatry as a scientific discipline, from the opprobrium resulting from DSM-II.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven|title=Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in the psychodynamic etiologies of DSM-II spilled over into a reduction symptom etiology altogether. Thus, DSM-III was a specific set of definitions for mental illnesses, and entities more suited to diagnostic psychiatry, but which annexed response proportionality as a classification factor. The product was that  all symptoms, whether normal proportional response or inappropriate pathological tendencies, could both be treated as potential signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt;

=== DSM-IV ===

[[DSM-IV#DSM-IV .281994.29|DSM-IV]] explicitly distinguishes mental disorders and non-disordered conditions. A non-disordered condition results from, and is perpetuated by, social stressors.  Included in DSM-IV's classification is that  a mental disorder  "must not be merely an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must currently be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual" (American Psychiatric Association 2000:xxxi)
This had supposedly injected normality consideration back into the DSM, from its removal from DSM-II. However, it has been speculated that DSM-IV still does not escape the problems DSM-III faced, where psychiatric diagnoses still include symptoms of expectable responses to stressful circumstances to be signs of disorders, along with symptoms that are individual dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt; The example set by DSM-III, for principally symptom-based disorder classification, has been integrated as the norm of mental diagnostic practice.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

=== DSM-5 ===
The DSM-5 was released in the second half of 2013.  It has significant differences from DSM IV-TR, including the removal of the multi-axial classifications and reconfiguring the [[Asperger's]]/[[autistic spectrum]] classifications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Criticisms of diagnostics ===
Since the advent of DSM-III, the subsequent editions of the DSM have all included a heavy symptom based pathology diagnosis system. Although there have been some attempts to incorporate environmental factors into mental and behavioural diagnostics, many practitioners and scientists believe that the most recent DSM's are misused. The symptom bias makes diagnosing quick and easier allowing for practitioners to increase their clientele because symptoms can be easier to classify and deal with than dealing with life or event histories which have evoked what may be a temporary and normal mental state in reaction to a patients environmental circumstances. 
The easy-to-use manual not only has increased the perceived need for more mental health care, stimulating funding for mental health care facilities, but also has had a global impact on marketing strategies. Many pharmaceutical commercial ads list symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or anxiety. However, such symptoms are not necessarily abnormal, and are appropriate responses to such occurrences as the loss of a loved one. The targets of such ads in such cases do not need medication, and can naturally overcome their grief, but with such an advertising strategy pharmaceutical companies can greatly expand their marketing.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;

'''''Our Plundered Planet''''' is a book published in 1948 that was written by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr|Fairfield Osborn]] about environmental destruction by humankind. With a focus on [[soil]], the book is a critique of humankind's poor [[stewardship]] of Earth. It typifies the earliest apocalyptic environmental literature, in which human beings are seen as destroyers of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''Our Plundered Planet'', along with [[William Vogt]]’s ''[[Road to Survival]]'', also published in 1948, launched a [[Malthusian]] revival in the post War era, and would inspire [[Paul R.

==Influences==
In writing this book, Osborn was influenced by Guy I. Burch and [[Elmer Pendell]]’s overpopulation tract ''Population Roads to Peace or War'' (1945) and [[Paul Sears]]’ analysis of dust bowls in ''Deserts on the March'' (1935). He had also been influenced by various "[[New Deal]]" initiatives in the public planning of land use and restoration, such as the creation of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and various policies to address the “[[dust bowl]]s” of the time. Osborn, as well as his famous father, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], was also heavily influenced by the [[eugenics]] movement prior to the war.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots" /&gt;

The '''Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey''' ('''PCAS''') was an [[astronomical survey]], initiated by American astronomers [[Eleanor Helin]] and [[Eugene Shoemaker]] at the U.S [[Palomar Observatory]], California, in 1973.&lt;ref name="Leverington-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gehrels-1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes-Svarney-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy-2002" /&gt; The program is responsible for the discovery of 95 [[near-Earth Object]]s including 17 [[comet]]s,&lt;ref name="Helin-1997" /&gt; while the [[Minor Planet Center]] directly credits PCAS with the discovery of 20 numbered [[minor planet]]s during 1993–1994.&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt; PCAS ran for nearly 25 years until June 1995. It had an international extension, [[International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey|INAS]], and was the immediate predecessor of the outstandingly successful [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking|NEAT program]].&lt;ref name="Helin-1997" /&gt;

== Notable discoveries ==

The first NEO discovered by PACS was [[(5496) 1973 NA]], an [[Apollo asteroid]] with an exceptional [[orbital inclination]] of 68[[degree (angle)|°]], the [[List of highly inclined minor planets|most highly inclined minor planet]] known until 1999. In 1976, Elenor Helin discovered [[2062 Aten]],&lt;ref name="MPC-Aten" /&gt; the first of a new class of asteroids called the [[Aten asteroid]]s with small orbits that are never far from Earth's orbit. As a result, these objects have a particularly high probability of [[Impact event|colliding with the Earth]]. In 1979, Helin discovered an Apollo-type asteroid, that they later identified with the comet [[4015 Wilson–Harrington]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Wilson-Harrington" /&gt; It was the first confirmation that a comet can evolve into an asteroid after it has degassed.&lt;ref name="Helin-1997" /&gt;

'''Paul M. A. Willis''' is a [[Palaeontology|palaeontologist]], [[Science communication|science communicator]] and former Director of the [[Royal Institution of Australia]] (RiAus).

== Career ==
Willis studied [[zoology]] and [[geology]] at [[University of Sydney]] and went on to complete a PhD in [[palaeontology]] at the [[University of New South Wales]] .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/profiles/content/s2109471.htm|title=Dr Paul Willis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ABC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a resident palaeontologist on ten [[Antarctic]] expeditions and has written or co-authored eight books on [[dinosaur]]s, rocks and [[fossil]]s.

While Willis found his first fossil when he was six, the earliest part of his collection was a small echinoid collected by his parents on their honeymoon &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaengagementservices.com.au/single-post/2017/12/19/The-most-valuable-present}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Willis completed a BSc at Sydney University in zoology and geology before conducting a PhD at the University of New South Wales. His Doctoral thesis was on The Phylogenetic Systematics of Australasian Crocodilians. Willis's doctoral studies resulted in the erection of several new taxa including the subfamily [[Mekosuchinae]], and the genera [[Baru]], [[Kambara]], [[Australosuchus]], [[Trilophosuchus]] and [[Harpacoshampsa]]. He conducted extensive field work, mostly in North Queensland, as well as completing a period as a paleontological Preparator at The [[Australian Museum]]. During this time Willis prepared an opalised skeleton dubbed by him as Eric the Plesiosaur and later named [[Umoonasaurus]].

In 1997, Willis commenced a traineeship with the ABC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During his career in public broadcasting, Willis went on to report and present stories for ''[[Quantum (TV series)|Quantum]]'' and ''Catalyst'' on [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] and the series ''[[Monster Bug Wars]]'' on [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]]. Willis produced over 350 stories for ''Catalyst'' during a ten-year stint with the program. He left his employment at the ABC to take up directorship of the Royal Institution of Australia in 2011 which ended in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/3313575.htm|title=Catalyst: Farewell Dr Paul Willis - ABC TV Science|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked for ABC radio, creating ''The Correx Files'' for [[Triple J]], presenting numerous regular science talkback segments on various radio stations across the country and contributing to ''The Science Show'', ''Earthbeat'' and ''The Health Report.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

Willis is now freelancing science communications through his company [https://www.mediaengagementservices.com.au Media Engagement Services] as well as conducting some paleontological studies as an Adjunct Associate Professor at Flinders University.

== Honours ==
In 2000 Willis was a joint recipient of the [[Eureka Prizes|Eureka Prize]] for Science Communication and was voted Australian Skeptic of the Year in 2002 for working to counter [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://riaus.org.au/people/paul-willis-director/|title=Paul Willis - Director - RiAusRiAus  {{!}} Bringing science to people and people to science|website=riaus.org.au|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |editor=Barry Williams| date= Summer 2002 |title=Skeptic of the Year |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/magazine/The%20Skeptic%20Volume%2022%20(2002)%20No%204.pdf |journal= The Skeptic |publisher= Australian Skeptics Inc.  |volume=22 |issue=4 |page=12 |doi= |ISSN=0726-9897| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Keith Ellis''' (born November 17, 1949) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[theoretical physicist]], at the [[University of Durham]] and a leading authority on perturbative [[Quantum Chromodynamics|quantum chromodynamics]] and collider phenomenology.

==Education==
He graduated from the [[University of Oxford]] (MA  1971, D. Phil 1974). He has held positions at [[Imperial College]], [[MIT]], [[Caltech]], [[CERN]] and the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]].

==Career and research==
He went to Fermilab in 1984. He was Head of the Theoretical Physics Department at [[Fermilab]] from 1993 to 2004. In 2015 he moved to the [[University of Durham]] in the UK, where he is a professor of Physics and Director of the [https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/ Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology].

Ellis' work is of importance to the study of elementary particles at colliders, such as the Fermilab Tevatron, and the CERN [[Large Hadron Collider]].
Ellis has contributed in a substantial way to the interpretation
of experiments performed at high energy.
Together with Douglas Ross and Tony Terrano he performed the 
first calculation of jet structure in e+e- annihilation	which
allowed	precise determination of the strong coupling.

SPEDAS ('''S'''pace '''P'''hysics '''E'''nvironment '''D'''ata '''A'''nalysis '''S'''oftware) is an open-source data analysis tool intended for [[Space physics|Space Physics]] users. It was developed using [[Interactive Data Language]] (IDL).

== Overview ==

SPEDAS is free software that can download and manipulate data from scientific space missions. It contains both a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and a command line mode for advanced users. It offers various tools for performing calculations and transformations of the data and for visualizing the results. Software modules can be developed for SPEDAS, extending its capabilities. It also includes a tool for downloading data from NASA servers using [http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/about.html CDAWeb].

SPEDAS evolved from software developed for the [[THEMIS]] mission, which was called TDAS (THEMIS Data Analysis Software). In turn, TDAS used IDL code developed previously for earlier missions going back to the 1990s.

SPEDAS was developed by scientists and programmers of the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s  [[Space Sciences Laboratory]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [http://www.igpp.ucla.edu IGPP] and other contributors.

== Deployment ==

Three different types of SPEDAS deployment are available:

* '''Source code'''. The full IDL code for SPEDAS is available as a zip file download. To use this, users must install and license IDL from [[Exelis Inc.|Exelis]].
* '''Save file'''. IDL save files can run in a free but restricted version of IDL, called IDL Virtual Machine (VM). Users have to download IDL VM from Exelis, install it and register with Exelis before they can use the SPEDAS save file.
* '''Executable file'''. This distribution contains executable files for Windows, Linux and Mac OS. In this case, users do not have to separately install and download anything else.

== Plugins ==

One of the main goals of SPEDAS is to accommodate the needs of different NASA missions. Towards this goal, its architecture is modular. Users can develop plugins for loading data, for configuration and for specialized calculations or operations on the data.

Version 1.00 of SPEDAS includes plugins for loading data from the following missions or data sets: 
* [[THEMIS]]
* [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES]]
* [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]]
* [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]]
* IUGONET
* [[Exploration of Energization and Radiation in Geospace|ERG]]
* OMNI 
* Geomagnetic/Solar indices

Plugins for specialized calculations are: 
* Generation of GOES overview plots
* Generation of THEMIS overview plots
* THEMIS particle distribution slices

The '''Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden''', also known as the '''Botanic Gardens of the Komarov Botanical Institute''' or the '''Komarov Botanical Garden''', is the oldest [[botanical garden]] in [[Russia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It consists of outdoor and indoor collections situated on [[Aptekarsky Island]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and belongs to the [[Komarov Botanical Institute]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. It is 18.9 [[hectare|ha]] in area, and is bordered by Aptekarsky Prospekt (main entrance), Prof. Popov Street (second entrance), as well as the embankments of the [[Karpovka]] and [[Bolshaya Neva]] rivers.

==Overview==
The garden was founded by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] in 1714 as a [[herb garden]] in order to grow [[Herbalism|medicinal plants]] and re-established as a botanical institution under the name Imperial Botanical Garden in 1823. [[Ivan Lepyokhin]] was in charge of the botanical garden from 1774 until 1802. Beginning in 1855, [[Eduard August von Regel]] was associated with the garden, first as Scientific Director and then as Director General (1875-1892). Regel had a particular fascination with the genus ''[[Allium]]'', overseeing collections of these plants in the [[Russian Far East]] and writing about them in two monographs. More than 60 of the alliums he identified bear his name, e.g., ''A. giganteum'' Regel and ''A. rosenbahianum'' Regel.&lt;ref name=Block2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Block, E.|title=Garlic and Other Alliums: The Lore and the Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AB89RHV9ucC&amp;printsec=frontcover|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2010|isbn=0-85404-190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many alliums can be viewed in the Northern Yard of the garden. In 1897, ''Konstantin George Alexander Winkler''(14 June 1848 - 3 February 1900), became head botanist at the Garden. He then reorganized the herbaria and greenhouse collections.&lt;ref&gt;Walther Killy (editor){{Google books|1NVRfl4gCw0C| Dictionary of German Biography Thibaut - Zycha, Volume 10|page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900, [[Boris Fedtschenko]] became head botanist and he organised investigations of various Russian regions including Siberia, Caucusus, Middle Asia and  Asiatic Russia. All published in various volumes and books.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite web|title=Fedtschenko, Boris Alexjewitsch (Alexeevich) (1872-1947) |date= |url=http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000331113 | publisher= plants.jstor.org | accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; David G. Frodin {{Google book|aMjXCF4rmDUC| Guide to Standard Floras of the World: An Annotated, Geographically Arranged |page=658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the garden became subordinate to the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]] and, in 1931, was merged with the Botanical Museum into the [[Komarov Botanical Institute|Botanical Institute]].

===Greenhouses===
The garden has 25 greenhouses constructed in 1823-1824. They are numbered from 1 to 28 (No. 5 and No. 25 don't exist; No. 10 and No. 11 are shared). Some of them are open to the public (guided visits only), including the large collections of [[azalea]]s and other [[Ericaceae]] (No. 6), [[fern]]s (No. 15), [[cacti]] and other [[succulent]]s (No. 16), various tropical plants (No. 18), the 23.5 m high Big Palm Greenhouse with an important collection of [[orchids]] (No. 26) and the greenhouse with a pond containing ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' (no. 28). The night blossom of cactus ''[[Selenicereus grandiflorus]]'', cultivated there since 1857, is a celebrated event announced in mass media and open to the public in the 16th greenhouse in June-July. The indoor collections suffered significant losses during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] in 1941-1944; out of 6367 species only 861 survived.

The chain of greenhouses encircles the Southern Yard and the Northern Yard, the latter featuring an extensive outdoor collection of [[Iridaceae]] and [[Ornamental bulbous plant|bulbous]] plants, including many species of ''Allium''. The building of the botanical museum faces the Northern Yard in place of the non-existent greenhouse No. 5.

===Park===
The outer park includes a small rock garden (constructed in the end of the 19th century)  located in front of the Big Palm Greenhouse, and a 0.16 km² arboretum, organized partly as an [[English garden]] and partly as a [[formal garden]]. The park, unlike the greenhouses, is closed for visitors from October 1 to May 8. It is elevated only 1.5-3 m above sea-level and has thus regularly suffered from [[floods in Saint Petersburg|catastrophic floods]] characteristic of Saint Petersburg. The herbarium edifice built in 1913 stands in front of the main entrance.

'''Science Theatre''' is an [[undergraduate student]]-run [[science outreach]] organization at [[Michigan State University]]'s [[East Lansing]] campus.  Science Theatre visits schools and events throughout [[Michigan]] performing interactive science demonstrations for [[K-12]] students on-stage or up-close.  Science Theatre performers are undergraduate and [[graduate student]] volunteers and all performances are made free of charge.

The group's performances consist of arrangements from its catalog of more than seventy demonstrations in biology, chemistry, and physics.  Additionally, Science Theatre performs comprehensive shows in [[Astronomy]], [[Environmental science]], [[Pressure]], the [[Periodic Table]], [[Quantum Mechanics]], and [[FRIB]]-related science.

Science Theatre was founded in April 1991 under a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] and received the 1993 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.  Science Theatre is a four-time winner of the Outreach Award from the Michigan State University Department of Physics and Astronomy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="919">A '''star clock''' (or '''[[nocturnal (instrument)|nocturnal]]''') is a method of using the [[star]]s to determine the [[time]]. This is accomplished by measuring the [[Big Dipper]]'s position in the sky based on a standard clock, and then employing simple addition and subtraction. This method requires no tools; others use an [[astrolabe]] and a [[planisphere]].

A clock's regulator can be adjusted so that it keeps the Mean Sidereal Time rate.  When it is then set to an observer's Local Mean Sidereal Time then a star will transit the meridian (passing directly north or south) at the sidereal time of the star's [[Right Ascension]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1366">'''Substantivism''' is a position, first proposed by [[Karl Polanyi]] in his work ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944), which argues that the term '[[economics]]' has two meanings.  The formal meaning, used by today's [[neoclassical economists]], refers to economics as the logic of rational action and decision-making, as rational choice between the alternative uses of limited (scarce) means, as 'economising,' 'maximizing,' or 'optimizing.'&lt;ref name="KPGT"&gt;Polanyi, Karl.  (1944) ''The Great Transformation: the Political and Economic Origins of Our Time'', Farrar and Rinehart, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, substantive meaning presupposes neither rational decision-making nor conditions of [[scarcity]]. It refers to how humans make a living interacting within their social and natural environments. A society's livelihood strategy is seen as an adaptation to its environment and material conditions, a process which may or may not involve utility maximisation. The substantive meaning of 'economics' is seen in the broader sense of 'provisioning.'  Economics is the way society meets material needs.&lt;ref name="KPGT"/&gt;

'''The GrEEK Campus''' is Cairo's first technology and innovation park, offering state-of-the-art office spaces in [[Downtown Cairo|Downtown]] Cairo, [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cairo’s GrEEK Campus Underscores Egypt’s Tech Revolution|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2014/02/18/cairos-greek-campus-underscores-egypts-tech-revolution/|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside The GrEEk Campus|url=http://womenonwalls.org/greek-campus/|publisher=[[Women on Walls]]|accessdate=25 June 2016|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, The GrEEK Campus was formed by former president Dr. [[Thomas A. Bartlett]] of the [[American University in Cairo]] (AUC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The day we bought the Greek campus Thomas Bartlett, AUC President 1963-69|publisher=[[American University in Cairo]]|url=http://www1.aucegypt.edu/aucmemories/articles/Tom%20Bartlette%20buying%20the%20Greek%20campus%20modified.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AUC began its relocation to another larger campus on the outskirts of Cairo - and in the outcome of the events of June 2013 – as the campus was left virtually abandoned since Tahrir 2011, Ahmed El Alfi decided to take over The Greek Campus and bring it back to life - more than it ever has been.

The concept and vision for The GrEEK Campus wasn’t just about offering traditional commercial work spaces and offices to businesses. It was more about building a community/an ecosystem from the ground up into a campus for techpreneurs, enthusiasts and creative individuals to meet, exchange and showcase their ideas and work together towards new technology and innovation that would ultimately benefit Egypt and the world.

== Foundation ==
The GrEEK CAMPUS was a part of [[American University in Cairo|American University]] for 50 years. In 2013, former president of AUC [[Lisa Anderson]] signed an agreement with Tahrir Alley Technology Park, a Cairo-based company, who leased the property to run a Technology Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AUC’s Greek campus to be transformed Into Egypt’s first technology park|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/11/17/aucs-greek-campus-to-be-transformed-into-egypts-first-technology-park/|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=[[Daily News Egypt]]|date=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and vision were crafted by Ahmed El Alfi and the technology park was officially launched in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CNBC.com|first1=Elizabeth MacBride, special to|title=The reason Uber is investing in this hot market|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/07/the-man-helping-to-create-a-tech-ecosystem-in-egypt.html|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=[[CNBC]]|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/BusinessAndPolitics/Getting-Us-to-the-GrEEK?M=True|title=Getting Us to the GrEEK|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2016-05-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915024247/http://www.cairoscene.com/BusinessAndPolitics/Getting-Us-to-the-GrEEK?M=True|archivedate=2016-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/15/tahrir-square-tech-park_n_4280590.html|title=Cairo's New Neighbor Is A Mini Silicon Valley|date=2013-11-15|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The School of Biological Sciences first opened in 1965 at the University of California, Irvine and was one of the first schools founded when the University campus opened. The school's founding Dean, Edward A. Steinhaus,&lt;ref&gt;http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb629006wb&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00041&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&lt;/ref&gt; had four founding department chairs and started out with 17 [[professor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio.uci.edu/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2014, the School was officially renamed after UCI professor and donor [[Francisco J. Ayala]] by then-Chancellor [[Michael V. Drake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.uci.edu/press-releases/uc-irvines-school-of-biological-sciences-renamed-in-honor-of-francisco-j-ayala/&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala had previously pledged to donate $10 million to the School of Biological Sciences in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-uci-gift-20111018,0,2845450.story?track=rss|title=UC Irvine professor donating $10 million to school - latimes.com|date=2011-10-18|access-date=2018-05-08|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018162336/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-uci-gift-20111018,0,2845450.story?track=rss|archivedate=2011-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school reverted to its previous name in June 2018, after a university investigation confirmed that Ayala had [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] at least four women colleagues and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://news.uci.edu/2018/06/28/uci-proposes-new-name-for-school-of-biological-sciences-science-library-after-internal-investigation-substantiates-sexual-harassment-claims-against-signature-donor/|title=UCI proposes new name for School of Biological Sciences, science library after internal investigation substantiates sexual harassment claims against signature donor|work=UCI News|date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Visualization Toolkit''' ('''VTK''') is an [[open-source software|open-source]], freely available software system for [[3D computer graphics]], [[image processing]] and [[Scientific visualization|visualization]]. VTK consists of a [[C++]] class library and several interpreted interface layers including [[Tcl/Tk]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. [[Kitware]], whose team created and continues to extend the toolkit, offers professional support and consulting services for VTK. VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including: [[Scalar (computing)|scalar]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]], [[tensor]], texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as: implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and [[Delaunay triangulation]]. VTK has an extensive [[information visualization]] framework, has a suite of 3D interaction widgets, supports parallel processing, and integrates with various databases and GUI toolkits such as [[Qt toolkit|Qt]] and [[Tk toolkit|Tk]]. VTK is cross-platform and runs on Linux, Windows, Mac and Unix platforms. At its core VTK is implemented as a C++ toolkit, requiring users to build applications by combining various objects into an application. The system also supports automated wrapping of the C++ core into Python, Java and Tcl, so that VTK applications may also be written using these interpreted programming languages.

VTK is used worldwide in commercial applications, research and development,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and is the basis of many advanced visualization applications such as: [[Molekel]], [[ParaView]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paraview.org/|title=Home page of ParaView}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[VisIt]], [[VisTrails]], [[MOOSE (software)|MOOSE]], [[3DSlicer]], [[MayaVi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/|title=MayaVi Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[OsiriX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osirix-viewer.com/AboutOsiriX.html|title=OsiriX- About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VTK is an open-source toolkit licensed under the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]].

==History==
VTK was initially created in 1993 as companion software to the book ''"The Visualization Toolkit: An Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics"'' published by Prentice-Hall. The book and software were written by three researchers (Will Schroeder, Ken Martin and Bill Lorensen) on their own time and with permission from GE (thus the ownership of the software resided with, and continues to reside with, the authors). After the core of VTK was written, users and developers around the world began to improve and apply the system to real-world problems. In particular, GE Medical Systems and other GE businesses graciously contributed to the system. Some researchers, such as Penny Rheinghans began to teach with the book. Other early supporters included Jim Ahrens at Los Alamos National Labs, and unnamed, but generous oil and gas supporters. In recent years, [[Sandia National Labs]] have been strong supporters and co-developers with particular focus on adding information visualization to VTK.

To support what was becoming a large, active and worldwide VTK community Ken and Will, along with Lisa Avila, Charles Law and Bill Hoffman left GE Research to found [[Kitware|Kitware Inc.]] in 1998. Since that time, hundreds of additional developers have created what is now the premier visualization system in the world today.

With the founding of [[Kitware]], the VTK community grew rapidly, and toolkit usage expanded into academic, research and commercial applications. For example, VTK forms the core of the [[3DSlicer]] biomedical computing application, and numerous research papers at IEEE Visualization and other conferences based on VTK have appeared. VTK has been used on a large 1024-processor computer at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to process nearly a [[Petabyte]] of data. In 2005, [[ParaView]] (based on VTK) was used for [[real-time rendering]] of a [[ZSU-23-4]] Russian Anti-Aircraft vehicle being hit by a planar wave, with 2.5 billion cell calculation, in the [[United States Army Research Laboratory]]. VTK also forms the basis of several collaborations between Kitware and national organizations such as Sandia, Los Alamos, and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore National Labs]], who are using VTK as the foundation for their large data visualization needs.

VTK is also one of the key computing tools for the recently established [[National Alliance for Medical Image Computing]], NA-MIC ({{URL|http://www.na-mic.org/}}), part of [[NIH]]'s roadmap initiative for future computing tools.

Recently work on VTK includes a significant expansion of the toolkit to support the ingestion, processing and display of [[informatics]] data. This work is supported by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] under the 'Titan' project and represents one of the first concentrated efforts to unify scientific visualization with informatics functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Titan|title=Sandia Titan webpage|access-date=2008-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213165439/http://www.sandia.gov/Titan/|archive-date=2009-02-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
