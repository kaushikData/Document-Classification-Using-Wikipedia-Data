      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13032">The '''age of onset''' is the [[senescence|age]] at which an individual acquires, develops, or first experiences a condition or symptoms of a [[disease]] or disorder. For instance, the general age of onset for the [[spinal column|spinal]] disease [[scoliosis]] is "10-15 years old,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoliosis.org/info.php&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that most people develop [[scoliosis]] when they are of an age between ten and fifteen years. 

Diseases are often categorized by their ages of onset as [[Congenital disorder|congenital]], [[Infant|infantile]], [[Child|juvenile]], or [[adult]]. Missed or delayed diagnosis often occurs if a disease that is typically diagnosed in juveniles (such as asthma) is present in adults, and vice versa (such as arthritis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Susan|last2=Locock|first2=Louise|last3=Farre|first3=Albert|last4=Ryan|first4=Sara|last5=Salisbury|first5=Helen|last6=McDonagh|first6=Janet E.|date=2018-02-09|title=Untimely illness: When diagnosis does not match age-related expectations|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hex.12669|journal=Health Expectations|volume=21|issue=4|pages=730–740|doi=10.1111/hex.12669|issn=1369-6513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the disease, ages of onset may impact features such as phenotype, as is the case in Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagano|first=Gennaro|last2=Ferrara|first2=Nicola|last3=Brooks|first3=David J.|last4=Pavese|first4=Nicola|date=2016-02-10|title=Age at onset and Parkinson disease phenotype|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002461|journal=Neurology|volume=86|issue=15|pages=1400–1407|doi=10.1212/wnl.0000000000002461|issn=0028-3878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sipilä|first=Jussi O.

The '''rate-of-living''' theory of aging states that senescence occurs because individuals accumulate damage to cells and tissues during cell division.

There are two subsets to the '''evolutionary''' theory of aging: [[antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]] and the [[mutation accumulation]] hypothesis.

The a[[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|ntagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]] was tested by monitoring the ''age-1'' gene in [[C. elegans]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=David W.|last2=McColl|first2=Gawain|last3=Jenkins|first3=Nicole L.|last4=Harris|first4=Jennifer|last5=Lithgow|first5=Gordon J.|date=May 2000|title=Evolution of lifespan in C. elegans|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35012693|journal=Nature|volume=405|issue=6784|pages=296–297|doi=10.1038/35012693|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''age-1'' gene plays a role in senescence; nematodes with mutations in this gene live up to 80% longer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Mutants in the ''age-1'' gene for allele ''hx546'' seem to be otherwise normal until placed under stressful conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Then, the carriers of the mutant gene appear to be at disadvantage—they do not lay eggs while being starved.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This evidence supports antagonistic pleiotropy as a theory of aging, and therefore as an onset cause in some cases.

The mutation accumulation hypothesis was tested by demonstrating how quickly deleterious mutations can accumulate in [[Musca domestica]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=David H|last2=Bryant|first2=Edwin H|date=2000|title=The evolution of senescence under curtailed life span in laboratory populations of Musca domestica (the housefly)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00737.x|journal=Heredity|volume=85|issue=2|pages=115–121|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00737.x|issn=0018-067X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed and Bryant demonstrated this by limiting the lifespan of the flies to a few days, which made late-life mutations invisible to selection since they occurred after reproduction.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The lifespan of the flies was monitored by allowing them to carry out their complete lifespan every few generations, which was reported to decline substantially.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mutation accumulation is supported as a theory of aging, and therefore an onset cause in cases of diseases resulting from mutation accumulation.

== Criminology ==
'''Age of onset''' (or '''onset age''') is a term that is also used in [[criminology]] in reference to the age at which a crime is first offended.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bacon|first=Sarah|last2=Paternoster|first2=Raymond|last3=Brame|first3=Robert|date=2008-08-20|title=Understanding the Relationship Between Onset Age and Subsequent Offending During Adolescence|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10964-008-9322-7|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=38|issue=3|pages=301–311|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9322-7|issn=0047-2891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, age of onset may be linked to subsequent offenses.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{wiktionary|Age of onset}}

The '''Kora''' (Cora) language, '''''Aka-Kora''''', is an extinct [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] language, of the Northern group. It was spoken on the northeast and north central coasts of [[North Andaman]] and on Smith Island.

It has been extinct since November 2009 when its last speaker, Boro, died.&lt;ref name=Boro&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Andamanese tribes, languages die |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article100977.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The native name for the language was '''''Aka-Kora''''', also spelled '''''Aka-Khora''''' or '''''Aka-Cora''''' ('''''Aka-''''' being a prefix for "tongue"); and this name is often used for the tribe itself.  They were divided between shore-dwellers (''aryoto'') and forest-dwellers (''eremtaga'') subtribes.&lt;ref name="weber8"/&gt;

==History==
By the time of the first permanent British settlement at Port Blair (1858), the estimates size of the Kora tribe was about 500 individuals, out of perhaps 3500 Great Andamanese.&lt;ref name="weber7"&gt;George Weber (~2009), ''[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter7/text7.htm Numbers]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531230544/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter7/text7.htm |date=May 31, 2012 }}''. Chapter 7 in ''[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/text-group-BodyChapters.htm The Andamanese] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805204050/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/app-a/a-portman.htm |date=2012-08-05 }}''. Accessed on 2012-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
However the tribe was discovered only much later, in the work leading to the 1901 census.&lt;ref name="weber7"/&gt; Like other [[Andamanese people]]s, the Kora were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, [[alcohol]], colonial warfare and loss of territory.

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are [[agglutinative]] languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system.&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a distinctive [[noun class]] system based largely on body parts, in which every [[noun]] and [[adjective]] may take a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;  An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of ''yop'', "pliable, soft", in Aka-Bea:&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt; 
*A [[cushion]] or [[sponge]] is ''ot-yop'' "round-soft", from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A [[Walking stick|cane]] is ''ôto-yop'', "pliable", from a prefix for long things.
*A [[wikt:stick|stick]] or [[pencil]] is ''aka-yop'', "pointed", from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen [[tree]] is ''ar-yop'', "rotten", from the prefix for [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upright things.
Similarly, ''beri-nga'' "good" yields:
*''un-bēri-ŋa'' "clever" (hand-good).
*''ig-bēri-ŋa'' "sharp-sighted" (eye-good).
*''aka-bēri-ŋa'' "good at languages" (tongue-good.)
*''ot-bēri-ŋa'' "virtuous" (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

{| class=wikitable
! !!Bea !!Balawa? !!Bajigyâs? !!Juwoi !!Kol
|-
!head/heart
| ot- ||ôt- ||ote- ||ôto- ||ôto-
|-
!hand/foot 
|ong- ||ong- ||ong- ||ôn- ||ôn-
|-
!mouth/tongue 
|âkà- ||aka- ||o- ||ókô- ||o-
|-
!torso (shoulder to shins) 
|ab- ||ab- ||ab- ||a- ||o-
|-
!eye/face/arm/breast 
|i-, ig- ||id- ||ir- ||re- ||er-
|-
!back/leg/butt 
|ar- ||ar- ||ar- ||ra- ||a-
|-
!waist 
|ôto-
|}

Body parts are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], requiring a [[possessive adjective]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
{| class=wikitable
| I, my
| ''d-''
| we, our
| ''m-''
|-
| thou, thy
| ''ŋ-''
| you, your
| ''ŋ-''
|-
| he, his, she, her, it, its
| ''a''
| they, their
| ''l-''
|}

'This' and 'that' are distinguished as ''k-'' and ''t-''.

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s &amp;mdash; [[1 (number)|one]] and [[2 (number)|two]] &amp;mdash; and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;

'''Antônio Peregrino Maciel Monteiro''', '''2nd Baron of [[Itamaracá]]''' (April 30, 1804 – January 5, 1868) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, orator, diplomat, politician, physicianm and journalist. He is the patron of the 27th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]], patron of the 7th chair of the [[Academia Pernambucana de Letras|Pernambucan Academy of Letters]], and of the 23rd chair of the [[Academia Nacional de Medicina|National Academy of Medicine]].

==Life==
Monteiro was born in [[Recife]], [[Pernambuco]], to Manuel Francisco Maciel Monteiro (who was the brother of the previous Baron of Itamaracá, [[Tomás Antônio Maciel Monteiro]]) and Manuela Lins de Melo. After making preparatory studies in [[Olinda]], he went to France in 1823, where he graduated in Medicine, Science and [[Literature|Letters]] at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1829, he returns to Recife, where he becomes a doctor for a short time — he would abandon his medical career to become a politician.

He was a provincial deputy in 1833 and a general deputy from 1834 to 1844, and again from 1850 to 1853. He was also the minister of Foreign Affairs from 1837 to 1839, and the headmaster of the Faculdade de Direito de Olinda from 1839 to 1844. As a journalist, he worked for journals ''O Lidador'', ''A Carranca'' and ''A União''. In 1853, following his diplomatic career, he went to [[Lisbon]], where his diplomatic acting would give him the title of second [[Baron]] of Itamaracá, in a post that would last until his death, in 1868. His remains were brought to Pernambuco in 1870, and, in 1872, he was buried at a mausoleum built for him, in the ''[[bairro]]'' of Santo Amaro, in Recife.

==Works==
Monteiro's poems were published posthumously, in 1905, under the name ''Poesias'' (''Poetry'').

WWE would reintroduce the design for the unbranded [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] in 2002, incorporating their logo.]]
The '''Big Gold Belt''' is a historic [[professional wrestling]] [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] that has represented multiple [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world championships]] throughout its history.

Originally designed in 1985 by [[silversmith]] Charles Crumrine and commissioned by [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] for [[List of NWA World Heavyweight Champions|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Ric Flair]], the championship belt has three large gold plates with a distinctive name plate onto which the champion's name was etched. While not the first wrestling championship belt to incorporate a name plate, it popularized the concept. The original championship belt design was known for being unbranded as it only read "World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion" and bore no initials or [[trademark]] of its owning [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].

In 2003, [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) added its logo to the design for [[copyright]] purposes. Following the championship belt's introduction in WWE, the distinctive name plate feature of the Big Gold Belt was swiftly incorporated into the belt designs of other WWE [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]].

== History ==
=== NWA World Heavyweight Championship ===
The Big Gold Belt was first introduced in 1986 to replace the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] belt that had been used since 1973, historically known as the "domed globe". [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] of [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) commissioned Charles Crumrine, a silversmith in [[Reno, Nevada]] that specialized in rodeo-style belt buckles, to produce it. The championship belt debuted on February 14, 1986 at a [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] card called "Battle of the Belts II", where NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Ric Flair]] defended the title against [[Barry Windham]].&lt;ref name="Big Gold history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/10-greatest-championship-belts|title=WWE's "Ace of Belts" Dave Millican's 10 favorite championship titles |website=WWE.com|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, JCP was purchased by [[media mogul]] and TBS founder Ted Turner. He established it as [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) under partnership with the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) and continued promoting the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair.

=== WCW World Heavyweight Championship ===
In January 1991, WCW officially recognized Ric Flair as their [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] in conjunction with the NWA's recognition. During this time, the Big Gold Belt represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship as well as the newly established [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. An exception to this arose in the spring of 1991. On March 21, 1991, [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] defeated Flair at the [[WCW/New Japan Supershow]]. Following this match, the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion. However, WCW did not recognize this title change. While Flair would defeat Fujinami at [[SuperBrawl I]] on May 19, 1991 to reunify the NWA and WCW world titles, during Fujinami's approximately two-month reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Flair retained possession of the championship belt and it only represented the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. 

==== "Real" World Heavyweight Championship ====
In July 1991, Flair and WCW parted ways while Flair was still champion. The Big Gold Belt left with Flair due to a dispute with WCW Vice President [[Jim Herd]] in which Herd refused to return Flair's [[United States dollar|$]]25,000 deposit, a deposit per regulations that was required of reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champions and was to be returned after the conclusion of their reigns. WCW was forced to strip Flair of their recognition of world champion and introduced a new title belt design to continue to represent the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The NWA followed suit and also stripped Flair of their recognition of world champion. 

Flair soon signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) and exhibited the Big Gold Belt there, proclaiming himself "The Real World Heavyweight Champion".&lt;ref name = "Big Gold history"/&gt; Flair stated on the 2008 DVD release of ''Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection'' that the $25,000 he initially deposited with additional interest totalling $38,000 was never paid back to him, and as a result, Flair kept the Big Gold Belt until a settlement was finally reached with WCW. With its return to WCW, the Big Gold Belt represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once again, while the new WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt design that had been commissioned after Flair's departure also continued to be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwinsider.com/article/48769/this-day-in-history-ric-flair-leaves-wcw-and-takes-the-big-gold-belt-with-him-.html?p=1 Flair takes Big gold to WWF - PW Insider.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WCW International World Heavyweight Championship ===
In September 1993, WCW formally seceded from the NWA and with that the promotional rights to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship were returned to the NWA. With the Big Gold Belt remaining property of WCW, Ric Flair who won NWA World Heavyweight Championship in July was recognized by WCW as holding the [[WCW International World Heavyweight Championship]], the world championship of a supposed subsidiary of WCW called "WCW International".&lt;ref name="Big Gold history"/&gt; The WCW International World Heavyweight Championship was represented by the Big Gold Belt until June 1994, when it was [[Championship unification|unified]] with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The Big Gold Belt became the WCW World Heavyweight Championship again. The Big Gold Belt remained the top title in WCW until the end of the promotion in 2001.

=== WCW bought by the WWF ===
In March 2001, after the long and bitter rivalry of the [[Monday Night Wars]], World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. bought out WCW. The Big Gold Belt became property of the WWF and continued to represent the abbreviated WCW Championship within the promotion during the period of the [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|WCW/ECW]] "[[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion]]". After the conclusion of Invasion at the [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] in November 2001, the WCW Championship being held by [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] became known simply as the World Championship for the month that followed as the WCW name was phased out. The title was unified with the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/3044541104 WCW World Champion - Chris Jericho] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215113326/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/3044541104 |date=2008-02-15 }} at WWE.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Jericho]] became the final recognized titleholder and the subsequent [[Undisputed championship|undisputed champion]] in the WWF and professional wrestling.&lt;ref name="W-T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwf/wwf-h.html|title=WWWF/WWF/WWE World Heavyweight Title|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com|accessdate=2007-03-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313210959/http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwf/wwf-h.html#020902|archivedate=13 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/08312007/articles/worldtitleturnsfive|title=World Heavyweight Championship turns five years old|last=Clayton|first=Corey|date=2007-09-06|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]| accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Undisputed WWF Championship ===
[[file:Milan Chris Jericho 2.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Chris Jericho]] held the Big Gold Belt six times in WWE over the course of a decade under three different incarnations, with two [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Championship]] reigns during [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]], one reign with the [[Undisputed WWF Championship]], and three reigns as [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]]]]
Following the unification of the World Championship (formerly WCW Championship) and WWF Championship in December 2001, the Big Gold Belt and the WWF Championship belt were collectively used to represent the Undisputed WWF Championship (those who held the championship belts after Jericho are credited as having held only the WWF Championship). After Jericho was defeated by [[Triple H]] at [[WrestleMania X8]], the two title belts were replaced by a single Undisputed WWF Championship belt (later WWE), which was first exhibited by Triple H on April 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/classics/era-of-unification/page-5 Unified titles - WWE.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Heavyweight Championship ===
[[File:Randy Orton at WM30.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Randy Orton]], a four-time [[World Heavyweight Champion (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]], seen here holding the most recent version of Big Gold Belt as a component of the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship]]]]
By 2002, the WWF had been divided in what became known as the [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] and the promotion along with its parent company were renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The roster was divided into two franchises or "WWE brands", split between [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]. The WWE Undisputed Champion appeared on both shows and defended against challengers from both brands. After [[SummerSlam (2002)|SummerSlam]] in August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion [[Brock Lesnar]] announced that he had signed an exclusive contract with SmackDown!, ignoring the claim to the title's number-one contendership by Raw's [[Triple H]].  [[List of WWE Raw on-air personalities#Authority figures|Raw General Manager]] [[Eric Bischoff]] said that the WWE Undisputed Championship was thus very much disputed, and he awarded the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], in the form of the Big Gold Belt, to Triple H. A WWE logo was added to the title belt, for copyright purposes, in March 2003.

On December 15, 2013 at the [[TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs (2013)|TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs]] pay-per-view, the title was unified with the WWE Championship when WWE Champion [[Randy Orton]] defeated World Heavyweight Champion [[John Cena]], and was officially retired.

=== WWE World Heavyweight Championship ===
On December 15, 2013, the Big Gold Belt was used in conjunction with the existing WWE Championship belt to represent the unified championship known as the [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] (the name has since reverted to the WWE Championship). However, much like how Chris Jericho carried both physical title belts as Undisputed WWF Champion, the title history for the World Heavyweight Championship was retired as this lineage follows that of WWE's original world title. Along with the custom side plates of the WWE Championship belt, the name plate on the Big Gold Belt still bore the current champion's name. On the August 18, 2014 episode of ''Raw'', a newly designed single championship belt was presented to then champion Brock Lesnar, while the Big Gold Belt was once again completely retired in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/classics/the-esteemed-history-of-wwe-champions-photos Unified titles - WWE.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Gold history"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="884">'''Busy override''' is a function of the [[private branch exchange]] that allows the [[calling party]] to override the [[busy signal]] on the [[called party]] in order to break into the ongoing conversation.  Before breaking in most PBX announce the incoming call by a distinctive [[sound]] [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] or [[Musical tone|tone]], but in most cases this can be disabled by software.  The '''Busy override''' function was originally intended to allow the called party to receive a high priority, implying that the call is very important, and should be handled first.

The same feature is often provided for toll (long distance) operators.

A '''chainplate''' is a metal plate used to fasten a [[shroud (sailing)|shroud]] or [[stays (nautical)|stay]] to the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] of a [[sailboat]].  One end of the chainplate is normally fastened to a [[turnbuckle]] which is connected to the shroud or stay, whereas the remainder of the chainplate normally has multiple holes that are bolted to the hull.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigrite.com/Hardware/Chainplates_&amp;_Stemheads/Chainplates&amp;Stemheads.htm Rig-Rite Inc's description of chainplates]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424172511/http://www.rigrite.com/Hardware/Chainplates_%26_Stemheads/Chainplates%26Stemheads.htm |date=April 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This distributes the load across the hull, making it possible for a somewhat lighter hull to support the load of the shrouds and stays.

In [[letterpress printing]] and [[typesetting]], a '''composing stick''' is a tool used to assemble pieces of [[Movable type|metal type]] into words and lines, which are then transferred to a ''[[galley proof|galley]]'' before being locked into a ''forme'' and printed. &lt;!--according to the compositor at [[Robert Smail's Printing Works]], right handed only. The stick may be held in either the left hand or the right hand, depending on the operator's preference.--&gt; Many composing sticks have one adjustable end, allowing the length of the lines and consequent width of the page or column to be set, with ''spaces'' and ''quadrats'' of different sizes being used to make up the exact width. Early composing sticks often had a fixed ''measure'', as did many used in setting type for newspapers, which were fixed to the width of a standard column, when newspapers were still composed by hand.

The [[wikt:compositor|compositor]] takes the pieces of type from the ''boxes'' (compartments) of the [[type case]] and places them in the composing stick, working from left to right and placing the letters upside-down with the ''nick'' to the top.

Early composing sticks were made of wood, but later iron, brass, steel, aluminium, pewter and other metals were used. Wooden composing sticks continued to be made in large sizes into the nineteenth century, for setting [[wood letter]] and other large sizes of type for display. In the industrial age, composing sticks were manufactured by many companies, but notably in America by the H.&amp;nbsp;B. Rouse company, which made composing sticks that were adjustable to the half [[Pica (typography)|pica]], as well as a stick containing a micrometer that was infinitely adjustable. Some sticks were marked in [[Agate (typography)|agates]] as well, to aid in newspaper and advertisement composition.

'''Comprehensive planning''' is a process that determines community goals and aspirations in terms of community development. The result is called a comprehensive plan and both expresses and regulates public policies on transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. Comprehensive plans typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The term comprehensive planning is most often used by [[urban planners]] in the United States.

In Canada, comprehensive planning is generally known as strategic planning or visioning. It is usually accompanied by public consultation. When cities and municipalities engage in comprehensive planning the resulting document is known as an [[Official Community Plan]] or OCP for short. (In Alberta, the resultant document is referred to as a Municipal Development Plan.

== History ==
During the earliest times of American history, cities had little power given to them by State governments to control land use. After the [[American Revolution]], the focus on property rights turned to self-rule and personal freedom, as this was a time of very strong personal property rights. Local governments had simple powers which included maintaining law and order and providing basic services. Cities had little power, if any at all, to direct development in the city.

Cities began to focus on the provision of basic services during the 1840s at a time known as the [[Sanitary Reform Movement]]. During this time it became clear that there was a strong relationship between disease and the availability of a quality sewer system. Part of the movement included the development of sanitary survey planning to help bring sewer systems to infected parts of cities. From this planning also developed a new consciousness of townsite location. People began to understand the environmental and social impacts of building cities and developed ways in which to further lower the spread of deadly diseases. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] was a firm believer in the relationship between the physical environment and sanitation, which helped lead to the development of grand parks and open spaces in communities to bring not only recreation, but sanitation as well. The Sanitary Reform Movement is seen by many as the first attempt at comprehensive planning, however it failed to be completely comprehensive because it focused on only one aspect of the city and did not consider the city as a whole.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities began to urbanize at very high rates. Cities became very dense and full of disease. As a response to the overpopulation and chaotic conditions, planning became a major focus of many large American cities. The [[City Beautiful movement]] was one of the many responses to the decaying city. The movement began in Chicago in 1890 with the [[World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] and lasted until about the 1920s. The focus on the movement was the design and architectural characteristics of the city. Leaders of the movement wanted to push the vision of the ideal city, and demonstrate to the world what cities could look like if they were created to be works of art. The White City was created for the exposition which embodied the visions of the movement with neoclassical designed buildings set against landscaped streets. Visitors to the exhibition began to realize that cities could be much more than dirty, overcrowded places. The movement spread across the United States and influenced many major American cities.

In 1898, [[Ebenezer Howard]] published his book entitled "Tomorrow, a Peaceful Path to Reform," in which he developed the idea of a [[garden city movement|Garden City]]. This city was a planned development which included different land uses and community services. The communities were to be surrounded by a [[green belt]] and included many open spaces and parks within the city. These cities were designed to be completely self-sufficient and focused on decreasing the negative impacts traditional cities had on people's lives. Although these cities were considered to be utopian ideas, two cities were eventually built in this vision, [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]], England. The vision of Ebenezer Howard greatly impacted the idea of city planning in the United States for decades and helped in the development of the idea that cities must be planning comprehensively for growth.

After the turn of the twentieth century, American cities began to see the need for local development and growth plans. Influential in this planning was [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]] who re-created the city plan for [[Washington, D.C.]] created by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] in 1791. The original plan called for grid iron laid streets crossed by diagonal boulevards, squares, plazas, parks, monuments, and sculptures. However, over time this plan was largely ignored and the city had developed against L'Enfant's vision. Burnham was instrumental in recreating the city plan and helping to return the city to its once intended form. In 1903, Burnham helped create the city growth plan for the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and in 1906 he created the city plan for [[San Francisco, California]]. Although these were all city development plans, it was not until 1909 when Burnham created the city plan for Chicago that his plans were comprehensive. [[Burnham Plan|The plan of Chicago]] is known today as the first comprehensive plan and it began a movement of comprehensive planning that emphasized planning as a way to not only make cities more beautiful, but to function better as well.

== Comprehensive planning process ==
Comprehensive Planning typically follows a planning process that consists of eight different steps. By following this process, planners are able to determine a wide range of interconnecting issues that affect an urban area. Each step can be seen as interdependent and many times planners will revise the order to best fit their needs.

===Identifying issues===
The planner must first address the issue they are investigating. "To be relevant, the planning process must identify and address not only contemporary issues of concern to residents, workers, property owners, and business people, but also the emerging issues that will be important in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Larz. (1995) ''Guidelines for Preparing Urban Plans'' Chicago: APA Planners Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, planners determine community issues by involving various community leaders, community organizations, and ordinary citizens.

===Stating goals===
Once issues have been identified by a community, goals can then be established. Goals are community visions. They establish priorities for communities and help community leaders make future decisions which will affect the city. Stating goals is not always an easy process and it requires the active participation of all people in the community.

===Collecting data===
Data is needed in the planning process in order to evaluate current city conditions as well as to predict future conditions. Data is most easily collected from the [[United States Census Bureau]], however many communities actively collect their own data. The most typical data collected for a comprehensive plan include data about the environment, traffic conditions, economic conditions, social conditions (such as population and income), public services and utilities, and land use conditions (such as housing and zoning). Once this data is collected it is analyzed and studied. Outcomes of the data collection process include population projections, economic condition forecasts, and future housing needs.

===Preparing the plan===
The plan is prepared using the information gathered during the data collection and goal setting stages. A typical comprehensive plan begins by giving a brief background of the current and future conditions found in the data collection step. Following the background information are the community goals and the plans that will be used in order to implement those goals into the community. Plans may also contain separate sections for important issues such as transportation or housing which follow the same standard format.
&lt;ref&gt;↔&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating implementation plans===
During this stage of the process different programs are thought of in order to implement the goals of the plan. These plans focus on issues such as cost and effectiveness. It is possible that a variety of plans will result from this process in order to realize one goal. These different plans are known as alternatives.

===Evaluating alternatives===
Each alternative should be evaluated by community leaders to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective way to realize the community's goals. During this stage each alternative should be weighed given its potential positive and negative effects, impacts on the community, and impacts on the city government. One alternative should be chosen that best meets the needs and desires of the community and community leaders for meeting the community goals.

===Adopting a plan===
The community needs to adopt the plan as an official statement of policy in order for it to take effect. This is usually done by the City Council and through public hearings. The [[City Council]] may choose not to adopt the plan, which would require planners to refine the work they did during previous steps. Once the plan is accepted by city officials it is then a legal statement of community policy in regards to future development.

===Implementing and monitoring the plan===
Using the implementation plans defined in the earlier stages, the city will carry out the goals in the comprehensive plan. City planning staff monitor the outcomes of the plan and may propose future changes if the results are not desired.

A comprehensive plan is not a permanent document. It can be changed and rewritten over time. For many fast growing communities, it is necessary to revise or update the comprehensive plan every five to ten years. In order for the comprehensive plan to be relevant to the community it must remain current.

== Legal basis ==
The basis for comprehensive planning comes from the government's duty and right to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.  The power for local governments to plan generally comes from state planning enabling legislation; however, local governments in most states are not required by law to engage in comprehensive planning. State statutes usually provide the legal framework necessary for those communities choosing to participate while allowing others to disengage themselves with the process. The legal provision for comprehensive planning comes from what is called the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act]] which was written by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] in the 1920s. This act was never passed by the [[United States Congress]] but was rather a law written for state legislatures to willingly adopt. Many states did choose to adopt the act which provided local governments with the framework to engage in land use planning. Because the act never gave a clear definition for comprehensive planning, the Department of Commerce wrote another act, the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1928, which defined more precisely what a comprehensive plan is and how it should be used.

In states that do not require local governments to plan comprehensively, state governments usually provide many incentives to encourage the process at the local level. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for example, the state government gives many incentives to local governments to establish comprehensive plans to guide development. Today, almost every county in Georgia has established a plan voluntarily.

However, a comprehensive plan is not usually legally binding.  A community's ordinances must be amended in order to legally implement the provisions required to execute the comprehensive plan.

'''Cross-language information retrieval''' ('''CLIR''') is a subfield of [[information retrieval]] dealing with retrieving information written in a language different from the language of the user's query.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Jianqiang, and Douglas W. Oard. "Matching meaning for cross-language information retrieval." ''Information Processing &amp; Management''48.4 (2012): 631-53.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term "cross-language information retrieval" has many synonyms, of which the following are perhaps the most frequent: cross-lingual information retrieval, translingual information retrieval, multilingual information retrieval. The term "multilingual information retrieval" refers more generally both to technology for retrieval of multilingual collections, and to technology which has been moved to handle material in one language to another. Cross-language information retrieval refers more specifically to the use case where users formulate their information need in one language and the system retrieves relevant documents in another. To do so, most CLIR systems use various translation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  CLIR techniques can be classified into different categories based on different translation resources:&lt;ref&gt;Thai, Perishan."An Introduction to Cross-Language Information Retrieval Approaches". Web. Web.simmons.edu&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Dictionary-based CLIR techniques
* Parallel corpora based CLIR techniques
* Comparable corpora based CLIR techniques
* Machine translator based CLIR techniques

CLIR systems have improved so much that the most accurate multi-lingual and cross-lingual [[adhoc information retrieval]] systems today are nearly as effective as monolingual systems.&lt;ref&gt;Oard, Douglas. "Multilingual Information Access." ''Understanding Information Retrieval Systems''(2011): 373-80. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Other related information access tasks, such as [[media monitoring]], [[information filtering]] and routing, [[sentiment analysis]], and [[information extraction]] require more sophisticated models and typically more processing and analysis of the information items of interest. Much of that processing needs to be aware of the specifics of the target languages it is deployed in.

Mostly, the various mechanisms of [[Linguistic typology|variation in human language]] pose coverage challenges for information retrieval systems: texts in a collection may treat a topic of interest but use terms or expressions which do not match the expression of information need given by the user. This can be true even in a mono-lingual case, but this is especially true in cross-lingual information retrieval, where users may know the target language only to some extent. The benefits of CLIR technology for users with poor to moderate competence in the target language has been found to be greater than for those who are fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Airio|first1=Eija|title=Who benefits from CLIR in web retrieval?|journal=Journal of Documentation|date=2008|volume=64|issue=5|pages=760– 778}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific technologies in place for CLIR services include [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological analysis]] to handle [[inflection]], decompounding or compound splitting to handle [[Compound (linguistics)|compound terms]], and translations mechanisms to translate a query from one language to another. 

The first workshop on CLIR was held in Zürich during the SIGIR-96 conference.&lt;ref&gt;The proceedings of this workshop can be found in the book ''Cross-Language Information Retrieval'' (Grefenstette, ed; Kluwer, 1998) {{ISBN|0-7923-8122-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops have been held yearly since 2000 at the meetings of the [[Cross Language Evaluation Forum]] (CLEF). Researchers also convene at the annual [[Text Retrieval Conference]] (TREC) to discuss their findings regarding different systems and methods of information retrieval, and the conference has served as a point of reference for the CLIR subfield.&lt;ref&gt;Olvera-Lobo, María-Dolores. "Cross-Language Information Retrieval on the Web." ''Handbook of Research on Social Dimensions of Semantic Technologies and Web Services''(n.d.): 704-19. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Search]] had a cross-language search feature that was removed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-drops-translated-foreign-pages-search-option-due-to-lack-of-use-160157|title=Google Drops "Translated Foreign Pages" Search Option Due To Lack Of Use|date=20 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curtis Australia''' is an Australian-based and operated jewellery and pen manufacturer that makes handmade writing instruments and diamond jewellery.
[[File:Colours of Australia Fountain Pen.jpg|thumb|right|Colours of Australia Pen]]

==History==
Curtis Australia’s history dates to the 1890s. Almost a hundred years ago, jewellery / [[Jewellery|jewelry]] became the focus over leather goods made by early family settlers. Continuing now, Curtis Australia still use traditional techniques such as [[lost wax casting]] and hand gemstone setting.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Australia - Heritage of Craftsmanship. [http://www.curtisaustralia.com/our-heritage-since-the-1890s.html] 2015. Retrieved 4 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
The company now produces a broader range of items, including fine jewellery / [[Jewellery|jewelry]] and luxury writing instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fpgeeks.com/?s=Curtis+Australia|title=Susan Wirth|website=fpgeeks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing instruments produced by the brand usually contain elements of precious metal or gemstone(s) to reflect Curtis origins as jewellers. Pen models are often solid sterling silver, such as the Adventurer Series or a combination of materials such as evident in the Dream Writer range. 
Founder Glenn Curtis is a Fellow of the Gold &amp; Silversmiths Guild of Australia and has been making jewellery in Australia for 40 years.[http://www.gsga.org.au]

In late 2014, Curtis were chosen to contribute to the Robb Report Magazine's Ultimate Gift Guide, a collection of extreme luxury products and concepts aimed at the very wealthy. The Curtis pen designs included concepts called 'Artistry' - a gem set and gold pen drawing inspiration from decorative art history, and 'Racing the Wind' a design featuring a diamond set eagle and stallion. Both concepts are intended to prompt design commissions from the magazines subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curtisaustralia.com/robb-report-story.html/?s=Curtis+Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Curtis started to create solid gold watches, using designs created and made in house, fitted with Swiss made movements.

'''Family ownership'''

Curtis Australia was founded in 2002 by Glenn Curtis. Curtis is a third generation jeweller and a Fellow and former Secretary of the Gold &amp; Silversmiths Guild of Australia [http://www.gsga.org.au/ (link)]. He has been a jeweller for 45 years, owning retail stores and designing and manufacturing jewellery before developing the Curtis brand.

The company now designs and makes 'Curtis Australia' branded product, a move away from more generic forms of jewellery.

'''Notable innovations'''

Curtis pens feature an internally developed spring clip. This has allowed sterling silver, a material normally not strong enough for pen clips, to be deployed across their pen ranges.

Most high end resin and silver pens are engineered using repetition tooling or machinery, leading to similar styles and design. Curtis pens are often sculptured with modelled surfaces in relief (source) and hand finished. This approach as led to recognition in industry publications.

'''Illustrative pens'''

Some Curtis pen models are decorated with imagery related to certain historical events. Examples of these include the 'Wildlife Warrior' pen, the 'Great Race' pen, the 'Race to the Pole' pen and the 'America 400' pen.

The 'Wildlife Warrior' Pen was created as a philanthropic project to raise funds for the charity of the same name. [https://wildlifewarriors.org.au/ (link)]. The 'Race to the Pole' Pen commemorates the centenary of the race to the North Pole [[Robert Peary|(link)]]

Curtis' 'Great Race Pen' marks the anniversary of 'the world's first auto race' [[1908 New York to Paris Race|(link)]] while the 'America 400' has illustrative elements relating to the European settlement of North America. Pens in this series are heavily sculptured in solid sterling silver.

'''Watches'''

Curtis watches utilise different manufacturing techniques. Most conventional watch cases are subtractively produced, i.e. engineered from solid blocks of materials, leading to designs that often reflect manufacturing technique. Curtis watch case designs have been influenced by their background as precious metal jewellers and pen makers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">In [[telecommunication]]s, the '''dropped-call rate''' (DCR) is the fraction of the telephone calls which, due to technical reasons, were cut off before the speaking parties had finished their conversational tone and before one of them had hung up (dropped calls). This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arokiamary|first1=V.Jeyasri|title=Cellular and Mobile Communications|date=2009|isbn=9788184315851|page=7-14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OnDGbzMRcbwC&amp;pg=SA7-PA14&amp;lpg=SA7-PA14&amp;dq=dropped+call+rate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FEPmvJOYMG&amp;sig=aqpHX2-1tnJhX3VcqlXSMVfYsEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjaj4H2u-PWAhWBZCYKHRsMAOgQ6AEIZzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=dropped%20call%20rate&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A call attempt invokes a call setup procedure, which, if successful, results in a connected call. A connected call may be terminated (disconnected) due to a technical reason before the parties making the call would wish to do so (in ordinary phone calls this would mean before either of the parties has hung up). Such calls are classified as dropped calls. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as dropped, at what stage of the call setup procedure a call is counted as connected, etc. In modern telecommunication systems, such as [[cellular network]]s, the call setup procedure may be very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the dropped-call rate is calculated.
The dropped-call rate in conventional ([[Landline|land-line]]) networks is extremely low and is significantly less than 0.01%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the dropped-call rate is higher and may range for commercial networks between 0.1% and a few percent. The main reasons for dropped calls in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), [[Electromagnetic interference|radio interference]] between different subscribers, imperfections in the functioning of the network (such as failed handover or cell-resellection attempts), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc.
The dropped-call rate is one of the key performance indicators (KPI) used by the network operators to assess the performance of their networks. It is assumed to have direct influence on the customer satisfaction with the service provided by the network and its operator. The dropped-call rate is usually included, together with other technical parameters of the network, in a key performance indicator known as call retainability.
The operators of telecommunication networks aim at reducing the call dropped rate as much as practical and affordable. In mobile networks this is achieved by improving radio coverage, expanding the capacity of the network and optimising the performance of its elements, all of which may require considerable effort and significant investments on the part of the network operator.

== Indian dropped call compensation case ==
The [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]] (TRAI) has announced a compensation of Re.1 for every call up to a maximum of three calls everyday effect from January 1, 2016.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2017}}

This decision was challenged by telecoms, which lost their case in the Delhi High Court.
* Telecoms had argued that the order that penalized them was “populist” and unfair because connectivity is affected by factors beyond their control. They also argued that they’ve spent on installing two lakh telecom towers over the last 15 months.
* TRAI, on the other hand, had said that telecoms are earning huge amounts of revenue and can and should expand their investment in infrastructure.
The court termed the TRAI notification as “flawed, unconstitutional, arbitrary and unreasonable”. The court was also of the view that a transparent procedure was not followed while evolving it.
* The court said the regulation which fastens strict liability on the telecom companies for no fault of theirs is arbitrary and violative of [[Article 14 of the Constitution of India|Article 14 of the Constitution]].
* The court also observed that quality of Service Regulations allowed service providers a 2% allowance of call drops on the basis of averaging call drops per month and therefore, the companies cannot be penalised when they were complaint with this norm.
* Also, the court said, there is no legal basis or explanation in the 2015 Regulations as to why the compensation has been limited to only three call drops.

[[Image:Elbow Bump1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"The Elbow Bump" greeting]]
The '''elbow bump''' is  an informal greeting where two people touch elbows. Interest in this greeting was renewed during the [[avian flu]] scare of 2006 and the [[2009 swine flu outbreak]], and the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola outbreak of 2014]] when health officials supported its use to reduce the spread of germs.&lt;ref name="bump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mexico"&gt;Andrew Gumbel, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/30/swine-flu-mexico-border "Swine flu forces border crossers to swap handshakes for elbow bumps"] ''The Guardian'', Manchester, England, April 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement==
An early popularization of the elbow bump began outside the [[Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and National Historical Park|Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement]] in 1969 with the lifting of the quarantine policy, which forced [[leprosy]] patients to live in an isolated peninsula on [[Molokai]]. Many of the settlement's residents were devout Christians; when they began attending church services outside of the settlement, the members of the church congregation were fearful of making physical contact with them. Priests, too, were wary of such contact with the former Kalaupapa Settlement residents, but as a sign of good faith they would touch elbows. This greeting became popular among churchgoers of [[Hawaii]] in the early 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Because leprosy is transmitted primarily through mucus, there is some evidence that the elbow bump constrained infections.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Urban youth==
The elbow bump as a greeting is also attributed to be a derivative of the more well known [[fist bump]], beginning in the 1980s. The earliest written record of the elbow bump by David Grimes&lt;ref&gt;David Grimes, "Goodbye, comrade; yo, dude" ''The Globe and Mail'', September 20, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2011}} supports this hypothesis. More recently, [[Shaquille O'Neal]] demonstrated the derivative nature of the elbow bump in relation to the fist bump in 2004, when he dismissed Kobe Bryant's greeting with a half-hearted elbow bump.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Elmore, [http://www.wordspy.com/words/elbowbump.asp "After big buildup, ABC delivers winning show,"] ''The Palm Beach Post'', December 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity due to hygienic qualities==

=== 2006 Avian flu outbreak ===
A recent advocate of the fist bump is the [[World Health Organization]]. In 2006, due to fears of a possible avian flu pandemic, the WHO proposed using the elbow bump as a means of "keeping other people's cooties at arms length."&lt;ref name="bump"&gt;Donald G. McNeil Jr., [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/12/news/pandemic.php "Elbows to the ready if outbreak emerges: Bird flu would rule out handshakes"] ''International Herald Tribune: The Global Edition of the New York Times'', February 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Michael Bell has been a principal advocate for using the elbow bump, noting that it can also help constrain the spread of diseases such as Ebola, by modeling social behavior that limits physical contact.&lt;ref name="bump" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. McNeil Jr., [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/weekinreview/12mcne.html "Greetings Kill: Primer for a Pandemic"], ''The New York Times'', February 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 Swine flu outbreak ===
The elbow bump got renewed interest when the 2009 swine flu outbreak in Mexico began growing into a worldwide pandemic. By 2009 the elbow bump had grown so large in popularity that people in Mexico had taken it upon themselves to utilize the elbow bump to reduce the spread of disease.&lt;ref name="mexico" /&gt; As in 2006, the elbow bump was supported by a number of health officials,&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso A. Castillo, [http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/050309/nat_435891683.shtml "Swine flu virus puts handshakes on hiatus"] ''Lubbock Online'', May 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Dr. [[Sanjay Gupta]], CNN's chief medical correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Wong, [http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/05/01/swine.flu.etiquette/ "Flu virus sparks 'social distancing' trend"], ''CNN Health'', May 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012/2013 Seasonal influenza epidemic ===

[[File:Barack Obama bumps elbows with women in the street.jpg|thumb|[[Barack Obama]] bumping elbows with two General Services Administration workers in 2012]]

The Manhattan Soccer Club endorsed the elbow bump as the safe alternative to the hygienically promiscuous traditions of vigorous hand-to-hand contact. This contact has been characterized, in the less dangerous formats, as handshakes and high-fives, but could also extend to orgies of perspiration and mucus slathered hands rubbing violently in the post-game "hand slap" line-up. The potential for mass contamination via these practices is obvious.

:At this point the MSC Board and the coaching staff would recommend that players not shake/touch hands with opponents after the games. The safest thing to do is to touch elbows. The coach or manager can explain this to the other team prior to the game.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Smith, [https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/highschool-prep-rally/york-youth-soccer-club-bans-high-fives-handshakes-201533800.html "New York youth soccer club bans high fives and handshakes amid growing flu scare"], ''Yahoo! Sports'', Jan 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fall 2014 Ebola outbreak ===

In October 2014 an outbreak of the [[Ebola disease]] caused people to revive the Elbow bump interest in the greeting during the 2014 Ebola scare.

==In culture==
By 2009, the elbow bump was endorsed by university officials&lt;ref&gt;Dean Robert Dolan of  University of Michigan Ross School of Business and Vice Provost Earl "Gip" Seaver&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="university"&gt;Judi S. Cohen, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-talk-shake-05-may05,0,4007139.story "Swine flu fears: Handshakes noticeably absent from many college graduations: Some colleges suggest elbow bumps, air high-fives"], ''Chicago Tribune'', May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Nobel laureate [[Peter Agre]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] joined the [[World Health Organization]] in endorsing the elbow bump.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} However, some of these endorsements were meant as much to elicit good humor as for purposes of good hygiene.&lt;ref name="university" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Noyes, [http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2009/05/friday-funny-antiswine-flu-han.php "Friday Funny: Anti-Swine Flu Handshake"], ''National Journal'', May 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "elbow bump" was considered for ''Word of the Year'' in 2009 by the New Oxford American Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Bogo, [http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/science_news/4204006.html 'Carbon Neutral' edges 'Elbow Bump' for Word of the Year], ''Popular Mechanics'', December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At the open-air service of the [[Greenbelt festival]] of 2009, worshipers were encouraged to greet each other with the 'elbow bump of peace' instead of the more usual '[[holy kiss]]' during the Christian rite of peace, because of concerns over swine flu.&lt;ref&gt;Rev Simon Taylor [http://simontsays.blogspot.com/2009/09/greenbelt-2009.html "Greenbelt 2009 report"], ''Simon says...'', 1 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fali''' is an unclassified [[Benue-Congo language]] of [[Nigeria]], spoken in the town of Baissa in [[Taraba State]].  The language is unwritten, and there are few to no speakers remaining.

==Genetic affiliation==
Baissa Fali belongs to the [[Benue&amp;ndash;Congo languages|Benue&amp;ndash;Congo]] sub-family of the [[Niger&amp;ndash;Congo languages]]. Its position within this family remains a matter of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Kay (1989) 'Benue–Congo Overview', pp. 248–274 in Bendor-Samuel, John &amp; Rhonda L. Hartell (eds.)

The '''Gafat language''' is an extinct [[South Ethiopian Semitic languages|South Ethiopian Semitic language]] that was once spoken along [[Abbay River]] (Blue Nile) in [[Ethiopia]], and later speakers pushed south of Gojjam in modern day Eastern Wellega Oromoia region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lipinski |first1=Edward |title=Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar |publisher=Peeters Publishers |page=89 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IiXVqyEkPKcC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=gafat+blue+nile&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY_IaMnvLdAhXIfbwKHfVzCkMQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gafat%20blue%20nile&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=gafat+blue+nile&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY_IaMnvLdAhXIfbwKHfVzCkMQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gafat%20blue%20nile&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gafat was related to [[Harari language|Harari]] and [[Gurage languages|Gurage]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pankhurst|first1=Richard|title=The Ethiopian Borderlands|publisher=The Red Sea Press|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=gafat+adare&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis5YGE2dbQAhUF3YMKHa9jCq0Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gafat%20adare&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The records of this language are extremely sparse. There is a translation of the [[Song of Songs]] written in the 17th or 18th Century held at the [[Bodleian Library]]. 

[[Charles Tilstone Beke|Charles Beke]] collected a word list in the early 1840s with difficulty from the few who knew the language, having found that "the rising generation seem to be altogether ignorant of it; and those grown-up persons who profess to speak it are anything but familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Charles T. Beke, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1798047 "Abyssinia: Being a Continuation of Routes in That Country", ''Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London''], 14 (1844), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent accounts of this language are the reports of [[Wolf Leslau]], who visited the region in 1947 and after considerable work was able to find a total of four people who could still speak the language. [[Edward Ullendorff]], in his brief exposition on Gafat, concludes that as of the time of his writing, "one may ... expect that it has now virtually breathed its last."&lt;ref&gt;Ullendorff, Edward. ''The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, Second Edition'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goguryeo language''' was a [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic language]] spoken in the ancient kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (37 {{sc|bce}} – 668 {{sc|ce}}), one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Global Prehistory of Human Migration|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden|isbn=9781118970591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vovin|first1=Alexander|title=From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean|journal=Korean Linguistics|date=2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=222-240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Moon|last2=Ramsey|first2=S.

It is unknown except for a small number of words, which mostly suggest that it was similar but not identical to the language of [[Silla language|Silla]]. Striking similarities between later [[Baekje language|Baekje]] and Goguryeo can also be found, which is consistent with the legends that describe Baekje being founded by the sons of Goguryeo's founder. The Goguryeo names for government posts are mostly similar to those of [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, the historical books of Korea's Goryeo period, it is described that the Silla of the late Three Kingdoms is related to the language of Goguryeo and Baekje.

Chinese records suggest that the languages of Goguryeo, [[Buyeo language|Buyeo]], [[Okjeo|Eastern Okjeo]], [[Dongye]], [[Baekje language|Baekje]] and [[Silla language|Silla]] were similar, while the Tungusic languages of [[Mohe people|Mohe]] and [[Yilou]] differed significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Fan Ye, ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', volume 85; the ''[[:zh:s:後漢書/卷85|Dongyi Liezhuan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wei Shou, ''[[Book of Wei]]'', volume 100; the ''Liezhuan'' 88, [[:zh:s:魏書/卷100|the Wuji]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Dashi, ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'', volume 94; the ''Liezhuan'' 82, [[:zh:s:北史/卷094|the Wuji]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experts today, including Ki-moon Lee, S. Robert Ramsey, Alexander Vovin, John Whitman and Marshall Unger, believe that Goguryeo language was a member of the Koreanic language family that either spread from southern Manchuria and the Korean peninsula at earlier times or expanded from Goguryeo during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period to Baekje and Silla by Goguryeo migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vovin|first1=Alexander|title=From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean|journal=Korean Linguistics|date=2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=222-240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Moon|last2=Ramsey|first2=S.

[[Image:G grill 1869.jpg|right|250px|thumb|"G" grill on a stamp of the 1869 issue]]

A '''grill''' on a [[postage stamp]] is an embossed pattern of small indentations intended to discourage [[postage stamp reuse]]. They were supposed to work by allowing the ink of the [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellation]] to be absorbed more readily by the fibres of the [[postage stamp paper|stamp paper]], making it harder to wash off the cancellation.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Russell and Watson, James; ''Philatelic Terms Illustrated'', Stanley Gibbons Publications, London (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==
The best-known (indeed only major) examples of grilling are the [[United States]] issues of the late 1860s and early 1870s, when grilling was standard for all US stamps. "Grilling" therefore remains a specialist interest only for American philatalists. While many types of grilled stamps are common, certain of the grill patterns were little-used, and define some of the great rarities of philately. In particular, the 1-cent stamp with the "Z" grill is generally cited as the rarest of all US stamps (only two copies are known), and is commonly known simply as the [[Z Grill]]. A recently discovered grill issue, the 30-cent "I" grill stamp, may be even rarer, for only one example has thus far been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siegelauctions.com/2011/1014/1014.pdf|title=Newly Discovered I Grill Rarities (pp. 80-81)|publisher=siegelauctions.com|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of grilling was first suggested by [[Charles F. Steel]], a supervisor at the [[National Bank Note Company]], with correspondence on the subject dating from 1865.  The purpose of grilling stamps was to break the paper fiber of the stamp.  This would cause the ink cancellation mark to soak into the paper fiber making them more difficult to wash and reuse as postage.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The first type of grill to be tried, termed by philatelists the "A" grill, was applied to the entire stamp. Stamps so treated were distributed to post offices for testing in August 1867, and apparently satisfactory, as National received a contract stipulating use of grilling for all stamps. However, the actual practice of grilling on a large scale had not been completely worked out, and the process significantly weakened sheets, resulting in tearing during perforation and general production handling. National soon switched to the use of a small rectangular pattern of indentations, and subsequent grills were all of this form.&lt;ref name="Brookman Volume II"&gt;Lester G. Brookman, ''The United States Postage Stamps of the Nineteenth Century, Volume II, 1861–1882'' (David G. Phillips Publishing Company, North Miami, 1989), a: pp. 67ff.; b: pp.128-131&lt;/ref&gt;

National's contract did not specify the type of grill pattern, and the details changed as they experimented with equipment. Many of the details have been lost to history; in 1910s, philatelist [[William L. Stevenson]] introduced a system of distinguishing types of grills, and identifying them by letter. Later research clarified some of the details of chronology.

No G, H, I or J grills are found on the 1861-68 issue, for this series went out of production before they were introduced. The 1869 issue used only the G grill, while the 1870 issue used H and I grills. Fears of reuse had abated by the early 1870s, and grilling seems to have been quietly dropped from the production process. Some stamps of the [[Continental Bank Note Company]] (who took over production from National) are known to have been impressed with the "J" grill as late as 1875.

[[Image:Stamp US 1867 3c F grill.jpg|right|thumb|The F grill on this 1867 stamp is visible as a grid pattern in the ink of the cancellation.]]

Grills:
* A Grill - overall (first experimental grill)
* C Grill - points up, 16-17 x 18-21 points (second experimental)
* Z Grill - points down, points with horizontal ridges, 13-14 x 17-18 points
* D Grill - points down, vertical ridges, 15 x 17-18 points
* E Grill - points down, vertical or "X" ridges, 14 x 15-17 points
* F Grill - points down, vertical or "X" ridges, 11-12 x 15-17 points
* B Grill - points up, "X" ridges, 22 x 18 points
* G Grill - points down, vertical ridges, 12 x 11-11.5 points
* H Grill - points down, vertical ridges, 11-13 x 14-16 points
* I Grill - points down, vertical ridges, 10-11 x 10-13 points
* J Grill - points down, vertical ridges, 9-10 x 12 points&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1847us.com/Grills.htm |title=Grills on U.S. Stamps |publisher=1847us.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The least-widely used of these patterns (all associated with the 1861-68 issue) were the "B" and "C" Grills (both found on only the three-cent denomination), the "D" Grill (found only on the two-cent and three-cent denomination) and the "A" Grill (found only on the three-cent, five-cent and thirty-cent denominations).  The rarest grilled U. S. stamps are:

* thirty-cent I Grill (1 surviving copy—see note below)
* one-cent Z Grill (2 surviving copies)
* fifteen-cent Z Grill (2 surviving copies)
* twelve-cent I Grill (2 surviving copies—see note below)
* ninety-cent I Grill (3 surviving copies—see note below)
* three-cent B Grill (4 surviving copies)
* five-cent A Grill (4 surviving copies)
* ten-cent Z Grill (6 surviving copies)
* thirty-cent A Grill (8 surviving copies)

Note: Given that intensive studies of the I Grill began only recently, additional copies of the I Grill issues listed here may well be discovered in the future.

Because certain grill patterns were only belatedly recognized as features of separate collectible stamp issues, not every U. S. grilled stamp was assigned its own individual numeral in the standard Scott catalogue.  Issues that share numerals are as follows:
&lt;br /&gt;
3-cent D grill, 85; the six Z grill issues, 85A-85F.
&lt;br /&gt;
H grill issues, 134-144; I grill issues, 134A-141A; 143A-144A.
&lt;br /&gt;
Scott moreover lists stamps bearing the experimental J grill as minor variants (denoted by small letters) of non-grilled issues: 156e, 157c, 158e, 159b, 160a, 161c, 162a, 163a, 165c, 179c. &lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Snee |first=Charles (editor) |title=Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers 2013 |publisher=Scott Publishing Co |year=2012 |location= |pages=28, 38-39, 42-43 |OCLC=781677423 |isbn=0894874756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The B grill ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Four stamps featuring the "B grill" pattern are known to exist, all used. All of them are of the three-cent denomination, and are numbered as Scott #82. All four stamps came from a letter sent to Prussia. The stamps were originally given a [[Mason, Texas]] cancel. Once they went to Germany (on or about March 3, 1869), they were given a German transit-date stamp.&lt;ref name="Brookman Volume II"/&gt; The cover was discovered in 1969 and raised controversy in the philatelic market because certain issues of the much more common "C grill" had been partially erased. This occurred during the grill roller's changing to use C grills instead of the all-over A grill. No additional "B grill" stamps have been discovered since, and one of the stamps from the cover was sold in 1993 for $85,000. Another B grill was sold again as part of the 1998 Zoellner sale (which featured the 1c Z grill) but sold for about $155,000. In 2008, the stamp was sold again, this time for over one million dollars.

== In Peru ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Although the National Banknote Company ceased to issue U. S. Stamps after being supplanted by Continental in 1873, it soon began to produce stamps for Peru, on a contract that stipulated the use of the grilling process.  Grills of three different types appear on regular issue stamps of Peru produced between 1874 and 1884.  One of these Peru grills displays the horizontal ridges that characterize the American Z grill, but the Peruvian version is smaller in size, measuring 9 x 14&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1847us.com/Grills.htm|title=Grills on U. S. Stamps|publisher=1847us.com|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other two grills measure, respectively, 11 x 15½ mm. and 10 x 12&amp;nbsp;mm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5381">The '''Grizzly Bear''' is an early 20th-century dance style. It started in San Francisco, along with the [[Bunny Hug]] and [[Texas Tommy (dance)|Texas Tommy]] and was also done on the [[Staten Island]] ferry boats in the 1900s. It has been said that dancers [[John Jarrott]] and [[Louise Gruenning]] introduced this dance as well as the [[Turkey trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]] at [[Ray Jones Café]] in Chicago, Illinois around 1909. The Grizzly Bear was first introduced to Broadway audiences in the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] of 1910 by [[Fanny Brice]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q8qwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22grizzly+bear%22+%22fanny+brice%22&amp;dq=%22grizzly+bear%22+%22fanny+brice%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WPOtTM7tGcP48AaL57DvBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBTgK Popular music, 1900-1919: an annotated guide to American popular songs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance was rough and clumsy. During the dance, the dancers would yell out: "It's a Bear!" The genuine Grizzly Bear step was in correct imitation of the movements of a dancing bear, moving or dancing to the side. A very heavy step to the side with a decided bending of the upper part of the body from one side to the other, a decidedly ungraceful and undignified movement when performed as a dance.

It was reported that one of the reasons former President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[United States presidential inaugural balls|inaugural ball]] was cancelled was because of his "disapproval of such modern dances as the turkey trot, the grizzly bear and the bunny hug".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wilson, Fearing Guests Would Dance Grizzly Bear and Bunny Hug, Calls Off Inaugural Ball |author=Special to The Free Press |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=January 21, 1913 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749625932.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+21%2C+1913&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;desc=Wilson%2C+Fearing+Guests+Would+Dance+Grizzly+Bear+and+Bunny+Hug%2C+Calls+Off+Inaugural+Ball&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long before this, in 1912, New York placed the dance under a "social ban", along with other "huggly-wiggly dances", like the [[Turkey trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]] and the [[Boston Dip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grizzly-Bear Dance |author= |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]] |date=March 30, 1912 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19120330.2.96 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also condemned in numerous cities across the US during the same time period, with many considering it to be a "degenerate dance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Grizzly Bear" And "Turkey Trot" Are Doomed As Degenerate Dances, But The "Boston" Will Live, Says Terpsichorean Expert|first= |last= |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press]] |date=January 11, 1912 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nywbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7EgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4005,2416078&amp;dq=grizzly-bear-dance&amp;hl=en |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a large portion of society accepted the dance, along with other similar dances. The Grizzly Bear dance was featured "on Broadway, in vaudeville, and at cabaret performances". In fact, it is believed that the first introduction to the "general public" of the dance came about in the original "Broadway production of ''Over the River''" in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The wicked waltz and other scandalous dances: outrage at couple dancing in the 19th and early 20th centuries |last=Knowles |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn= |page=67 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAzP__xv7CkC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22Grizzly+Bear%22+%22dance%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2vmtTKWALcGB8gbW6sDbBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Grizzly%20Bear&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Boulder-based contemporary dance artist [[Christopher Reetz]] revitalized interest in the "Grizzly Bear". In a February 2015 interview, Reetz described his interpretation of the dance: "First, you're riding a bear. Then, you are the bear".

==In popular culture==
*In the 1912 song hit ''That Shakespearian Rag'' by [[Dave Stamper]] and [[Gene Buck]], the dance is referenced in the refrain.
*In episode 2, season 1, of the British television period drama [[Downton Abbey]], the footman Thomas Barrow teaches the kitchen maid Daisy how to dance the grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Script Line: Transcribed Film and TV Scripts - Downton Abbey: Episode 1x02 | url = http://scriptline.livejournal.com/56158.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 5 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*One of the early Tin Pan Alley hits of the classic composer Irving Berlin was called "The Grizzley Bear." The song explains the origins of the dance and even describes how the dancers danced to this ragtime ditty.
*In episode 2, in miniseries Indian Summers on PBS, the Grizzle Bear Dance is performed by some of the British expatriate population during an evening soiree.
*Folk-rock group The Youngbloods released their song "Grizzly Bear" in 1966, which mentions a woman dancing the Grizzly Bear, possibly in San Francisco.
* Folk singer Bill Morrissey's song, "Grizzly Bear", employs the phrase "... to dance the Grizzly Bear."

'''Habu''' (Habun) is a language spoken in central [[East Timor]].

The classification of Habu is unclear. Structurally, it is [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]]. However, its vocabulary is largely Papuan, similar to that of [[Makasae language|Makasae]].

The '''Hebrew Wikipedia''' ({{lang-he|{{#property:P1448}}}}, {{IPA-he|wikiˈpedja ha(ʔ)entsikloˈpedja haχofˈʃit|IPA}}) is the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]]. This edition was started on 11 May 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-May/000116.html|title=Wikipedia-l new language wikis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains more than {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|he}} round -3}}}} [[encyclopedia article|articles]] as of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

==About==

===Timeline history===
* '''July 8, 2003''': The Hebrew edition of Wikipedia was launched.

* '''July 22, 2004''': The first meeting of Hebrew Wikipedians took place in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].
* '''September 10, 2004''': The 10,000th article was written.
* '''September 20, 2004''': The [[:he:דגל קזחסטן|Hebrew version]] of the [[Flag of Kazakhstan]] article became the one millionth article created in all Wikipedias.
* '''December 24, 2006''': The 50,000th article was written.
* '''January 10, 2010''': The 100,000th article was written.
* '''August 29, 2013''': The 150,000th article was written.
* '''December 28, 2016''': The 200,000th article was written.

===Features===
The Hebrew Wikipedia has several topics on which organized article writing projects were held, among them Wikitort - an academic project to write original articles about [[tort law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:פרויקט WIKITORT]]&lt;/ref&gt; PhysiWiki - a project to write and improve articles about [[Physics]] with the cooperation of [[Weizmann Institute of Science]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:מיזמי ויקיפדיה/פיזיוויקי]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ongoing academic projects.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עבודות ויקידמיות]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major area of work is [[Jewish history]] and the [[History of Israel]]. Such articles often include original photos taken by the writers. In 2006 the Elef Millim project&lt;ref&gt;[[:meta:Elef Millim project]]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|Thousand Words project}}) was created; its purpose is to enrich Wikipedia with free images. As a part of this project, groups of Israeli Wikipedians meet for field trips in various places in [[Israel]] in order to take pictures and bring members of the Hebrew Wikipedia community together.

[[Hebrew spelling]] is a matter of debate. The standards published by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] are not meticulously followed in common usage, so the Hebrew Wikipedia community decides on problematic cases of spelling by discussions or polls for the sake of consistency within the project. When technically possible, spelling decisions are periodically enforced using automatic replacement by a [[Internet bot|bot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:בוט/בוט החלפות]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other information===
Over the years, Hebrew Wikipedia has become one of the most popular sources of information for [[Israelis]]. In a 2012 [[qualitative research]], 51 Israeli teachers of different grades were asked about their use habits of Wikipedia, and most of them responded that they don't use it as the main source for teaching, and instead search for other reliable websites on Google. Hebrew Wikipedia's requirements for [[Wikipedia:Notability|notability]] standards are relatively very strict.

Hebrew Wikipedia also conducts yearly competitions, sometimes with the assistance of the [[Wikimedia foundation]].

Hebrew Wikipedia users have turned the website into a more socially connected place. Sometimes, users meet up for a [[picnic]], or edit alongside their family members. Currently, 76% of the editors are men, and 23% are women.

===2010 Knesset meeting===
On the occasion of the 100,000 articles milestone, the Science and Technology Committee of the [[Knesset]] (Israeli parliament) invited Wikipedia contributors and users to the 2 February 2010 morning meeting, to join in a debate about Wikipedia and other [[open-source software|open-source]] resources. Some Wikipedia contributors at the meeting criticized "the lack of government cooperation with their efforts to compile a free online Hebrew-language encyclopedia," as well as sharing complaints from Wikipedia editors abroad that since the [[Israel Defense Forces]] does not release photos for [[copyleft|free redistribution]] on the Internet, the sole source of available pictures for entries such as the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] and the [[2006 Lebanon War]] are the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| first = | last =| authorlink =| author =Rebecca Anna Stoil| coauthors =| title =Is Wikipedia good for the Jews?| url = http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=167613| format =| work =| publisher = [[Jerusalem Post]]| location =| id =| pages =| page =| date = 2010-02-02| accessdate =| archiveurl =| archivedate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with other language editions===
In July 2006, Hebrew Wikipedia had one of the highest amounts of bytes per article, and the highest of all editions on Wikipedia with over 20,000 articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesArticlesBytesPerArticle.htm Wikimedia Statistics Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the English Wikipedia requires a general consensus for deleting articles (hence deletion discussion is not considered to be a voting process), the Hebrew Wikipedia has adopted a policy of deletion upon a 55% majority, with no minimum number of votes.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:מדיניות המחיקה|Hebrew Wikipedia deletion policy page]]&lt;/ref&gt; In these votes, only registered users with one month seniority and at least 100 edits in the article, image, category or template namespaces in the past 90 days can vote.

====Strict inclusion criteria====
Adding on the aforementioned, comparing to English Wikipedia, Hebrew Wikipedia is much more conservative, regarding what types of content may be in it&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:מה ויקיפדיה איננה]]&lt;/ref&gt; - even when complying with all the basic guidelines for good encyclopedic writing.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:מדריך לכתיבת ערכים]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion criteria are detailed under the "principles and guidelines" page.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples:
* Articles on porn movies will be deleted unless they became cultural symbols.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים ליצירת ערכים/פורנוגרפיה]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Articles on porn stars will be deleted unless they have other notable aspects in their lives. 
* A book has to meet one of these four criteria: published by a known publisher, sold 10,000 copies, won a prize, or received good reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים ליצירת ערכים/ספרים]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Writers have to write at least two books to be notable as writers.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים ליצירת ערכי אישים]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Singers and bands have to release an album before they get an article.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים ליצירת ערכי אישים]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Articles on student films will be deleted unless they won first prize in a film festival or were screened in mainstream cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:עקרונות וקווים מנחים ליצירת ערכים/סרטי סטודנטים]]&lt;/ref&gt;

List articles are rare in general in Hebrew Wikipedia. In particular, lists of TV series episodes are not accepted, even as part of the articles on the series.

Other fairly controversial topics are articles of small schools and other minor educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:ויקיפדיה:גבולות/מוסדות]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">The '''Heliastic oath''' ({{lang-grc|ἡλιαστικὸς ὅρκος}}; ''heliastikos horkos'')  was an [[oath]] sworn by jurors in the [[ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] [[law court (ancient Athens)|law court]]s.

In [[Demosthenes]]' speech ''Against Timocrates'', the oath was quoted, and using quotations from other speeches, we can reconstruct the oath's main lines. The oath was sworn in the names of [[Zeus]], [[Apollo]], and [[Demeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/socrates/greekcrimpro.html | title=Criminal Procedure in Ancient Greece | accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the oath, the juror said a curse against himself if he should break his oath. Voting in the court was secret though, so a juror could not be accused of breaking the oath. However, the juror could experience [[divine punishment]] for breaking the oath.

==Oath==
"I will cast my vote in consonance with the laws and with the decrees passed by the Assembly and by the Council, but, if there is no law, in consonance with my sense of what is most just, without favour or enmity. I will vote only on the matters raised in the charge, and I will listen impartially to accusers and defenders alike." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes | publisher=Bristol Classical Press | author=Hansen, Mogens | year=1998 | isbn=9781853995859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German philologist Max Fränkel (1846 - 1903) reconstructed the entire oath as follows: 
"I will vote according to the laws and the votes of the Demos of Athenians and the Council of the Five Hundred, and concerning matters about which there are no laws by the most just understanding, and for the sake of neither favour nor enmity. And I will vote concerning the very matters about which the prosecution is, and I will listen to both the accusers and defendants, both of them equally. I swear these things by Zeus, Apollo, and Demeter, and may I have many good things if I swear well, but destruction for me and my family if I forswear." &lt;ref&gt;Fränkel, Max (1877) ''Die attischen Geschworenengerichte. Ein Beitrag zum attischen Staatsrecht'', Berlin.  Quoted in  Mirhady, David C., "The Dikasts' Oath and the Question of Fact." Translated by Mirhady, David C.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Charles Hilary Jenkinson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|LLD|FSA|FRHistS}} (1 November 1882 – 5 March 1961)&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Johnson and Brodie 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[archivist]] and [[Archival science|archival theorist]], regarded as the figure most responsible for bringing continental European concepts of archival theory to the English-speaking world. 

== Personal life ==
Born in [[Streatham]], London, Jenkinson was the son of William Wilberforce Jenkinson, a land agent, and Alice Leigh Bedale.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He was educated at [[Dulwich College]] and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], graduating with first class honours in Classics in 1904.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 2008|title=Jenkinson, Sir (Charles) Hilary|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34177?rskey=RgKgdn&amp;result=1|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-34177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[First World War]], he joined the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], and served in France and [[Belgium]] from 1916 to 1918.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

Jenkinson married Alice Violet Rickards in 1910. She died in 1960. Jenkinson died a year later on 5 March 1961 at St. Thomas Hospital, London.  They had no children.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

==Career==
In 1906, he joined the staff of the [[Public Record Office]] and worked on the arrangement and classification of the records of the medieval [[Exchequer]]. In 1912, he was put in charge of the search room, which he then reorganized according to criticisms alleged in the first report of the Royal Commission on Public Records.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After his military service, Jenkinson worked at the [[War Office]] until 1920.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Returning to the Public Record Office, he reorganized the repairing department and later the repository, to which he moved in 1929. He was appointed secretary and principal assistant keeper in 1938.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

During 1944 and 1945, he paid several extended visits to Italy, Germany, and Malta as War Office Adviser on Archives, attached to the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Subcommission]], playing an important role in archives protection in those countries from the worst of the depredations of war.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1957, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradsher"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://text-message.blogs.archives.gov/2014/01/23/sir-hilary-jenkinson-of-the-public-record-office-an-archivist-monuments-man/ | title=Sir Hilary Jenkinson of the Public Record Office: An Archivist Monuments Man | date=23 January 2014 | accessdate=23 January 2014 | author=Bradsher, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Jenkinson, along with H. E. Bell, advocated the protection and preservation of a country's archives, even during times of war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cox |first=Douglas |title=National Archives and International Conflicts: The Society of American Archivists and War |journal=The American Archivist |year=2011 |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=451–81 |jstor=23079046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the "sanctity of evidence" may be preserved in the records.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkinson|first=Hilary|date=1944|title=British Archives and The War|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.7.1.k6t126j728mh8405|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.17723/aarc.7.1.k6t126j728mh8405|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947 until his retirement in 1954, Jenkinson served as the deputy keeper (chief executive officer) of the repository at the Public Record Office.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;  During this tenure, Jenkinson was instrumental in acquiring more facilities in [[Ashridge|Ashridge, Hertfordshire]] as further records storage, and facilities in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes, Middlesex]] to serve as temporary housing for records in the process of being transferred to the Public Record Office.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

Jenkinson lectured on [[palaeography]], [[diplomatics|diplomatic]], and [[archives]] in Cambridge, [[King's College London]] and [[University College London]]. He wrote a number of books on palaeography and diplomatic, and his ''Manual of Archive Administration'' (1922; revised edition 1937) became a highly influential work on [[Archival science|archival practice]] in Britain and Ireland.

Jenkinson served as Honorary Secretary of the [[Surrey Archaeological Society]]. He took a leading part in establishing its daughter organization, the [[Surrey Record Society]], in 1912; and thereafter, as secretary and general editor until 1950, in establishing its principles of editing and records publication.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1957, pp. xv–xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a founder, Joint Honorary Secretary (1932–47) and Vice-President (1954–61) of the [[British Records Association]]; President of the [[Jewish Historical Society of England]] (1953–55); and President of the [[Society of Archivists]] (1955–61). He also played an important role in the setting up of the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts#National Register of Archives|National Register of Archives]] in 1945.  Jenkinson served as the British representative for the UNESCO International Council on Archives, later becoming a vice-president of the Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Archival theory==
Jenkinson's ''Manual of Archive Administration'' was first published in 1922, and republished in a second edition (revised and expanded, but not significantly altered in its principles) in 1937. It was reissued with a new introduction by Roger Ellis in 1965. The book is described by John Ridener as "one of the most widely recognized treatises on the theory of archives and archival work" for introducing continental archival concepts to Britain (and the English-speaking world), along with his own original interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Ridener 2009, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jenkinson rejected the practice of accepting singular documents into an archive, as well as the acceptance of private papers, which he considered to be a flaw of the French and Belgian philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brubaker|first=Robert|date=1966|title=Archival Principles and the Curator of Manuscripts|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.29.4.8538576776w21r71|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=29|issue=4|pages=505–514|doi=10.17723/aarc.29.4.8538576776w21r71|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Margaret Procter argues that despite Jenkinson's "iconic" status, his work also rested to a considerable degree on an existing British theoretical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Margaret |last=Procter |title=Life before Jenkinson: the development of British archival theory and thought at the turn of the twentieth century |journal=Archives |volume=33 |year=2008 |pages=140–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Key elements in Jenkinson's archival theory included the following:&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Ridener 2009, pp. 41–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the archival record
*[[Archival science#The principle of provenance|The principle of provenance]]
*''[[Respect des fonds|Le respect pour les fonds]]'' and the significance of the inter-relatedness of records&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohmann|first=Paige|date=2016|title=On Impartiality and Interrelatedness: Reactions to Jenkinsonian Appraisal in the Twentieth Century|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/0360-9081.79.1.14|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=79|issue=1|pages=14–25|doi=10.17723/0360-9081.79.1.14|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Organic nature of archival records in creation, preservation, and relationship with other records&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cappon|first=Lester|date=1956|title=Historical Manuscripts as Archives: Some Definitions and Their Application|url=http://www.americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.19.2.4402r63w3t257gv8|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=19|issue=2|pages=101–110|doi=10.17723/aarc.19.2.4402r63w3t257gv8|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Necessity of continual custody and control of archival records in order to retain significance&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*The archivist as impartial custodian: Jenkinson believed that [[archival appraisal]] (including the weeding-out and destruction of unimportant records) was ''not'' the responsibility of archivists, but of record creators, to be undertaken before the records were transferred to the archive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Jenkinson also reinforced the idea that the archivist is not an analyst of content, but a conservator of any relevant evidence for those who do wish to consult the records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Oliver|date=1961|title=Sir Hilary Jenkinson, 1882-1961|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.24.3.e521g515xp0n60u1|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=24|issue=3|pages=345–347|doi=10.17723/aarc.24.3.e521g515xp0n60u1|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkinson saw "the good Archivist" as "perhaps the most selfless devotee of Truth the modern world produces".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; "His Creed, the Sanctity of Evidence; his Task, the Conservation of every Scrap of Evidence attaching to the Documents committed to his charge; his Aim, to provide, without prejudice or afterthought, for all who wish to know the Means of Knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, Hilary, "The English archivist: a new profession", in Ellis and Walne 1980, pp. 236–59 (258–9).&lt;/ref&gt;  He further reaffirmed this position by designating the archivist as being a "profession of faith," a serious professional that is uncompromising in their duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cline|first=Scott|date=2009|title="To the Limit of Our Integrity": Reflections on Archival Being|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.72.2.g0321510717r6j14|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=72|issue=2|pages=331–343|doi=10.17723/aarc.72.2.g0321510717r6j14|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Disputes with T. R. Schellenberg ==
Jenkinson had a number of theoretical differences of opinion with [[T. R. Schellenberg]], his American counterpart, particularly over the question of the archivist's role in appraisal and selection.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tschan 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  John Ridener ascribes their differences in outlook to the fact that, in contrast to Schellenberg's concern with [[Records management|modern records management]], Jenkinson's theory was founded on "medieval record structures", and was unsuited to dealing with the increased bulk of modern records.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ridener 2009, pp. 56, 65–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  To Schellenberg, it was a matter of quality in the archives.  Having an undisturbed and impartial bulk in appraisal and accession does not, in his philosophy, serve the main purpose of the modern archives: making available useful material to patrons.  Some records have higher evidentiary value, while others fall short on worth, making the former more desirable for preservation.  Schellenberg desired a forward-thinking practicality in the approach to archival appraisal that took into consideration the needs of future patrons (in stark contrast to Jenkinson's conservative approach), while maintaining Jenkinson's notions of record relatedness, evidentiary value, and "truth" in archival holdings.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohmann|first=Paige|date=2016|title=On Impartiality and Interrelatedness: Reactions to Jenkinsonian Appraisal in the Twentieth Century|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/0360-9081.79.1.14|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=79|issue=1|pages=14–25|doi=10.17723/0360-9081.79.1.14|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter, Schellenberg dismissed Jenkinson as "an old fossil".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tschan 2002, pp. 176–7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==
In his professional career at the Public Record Office, and in particular as Deputy Keeper from 1947 to 1954, he was often seen as an autocratic and inflexible conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Cantwell 1991, pp. 452–79, 502.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Shepherd comments that "it was only after his retirement that the PRO could finally develop a professional archival approach to its work,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Archives and Archivists in 20th Century England |first=Elizabeth |last=Shepherd |place=Farnham |publisher=Ashgate |year=2009 |ISBN=9780754647850 |pages=81–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as Jenkinson did not like individual interpretations or differing viewpoints of his philosophy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Jenkinson's core beliefs in the objectivity of archives and the archivist as neutral custodian have undergone considerable criticism and revision in recent years. Writing in 1997, [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] commented: "At its most extreme, Jenkinson's approach would allow the archival legacy to be perverted by administrative whim or state ideology, as in the former [[Soviet Union]], where provenance was undermined by the establishment of one state [[fonds]] and archival records attained value solely by the degree to which they reflected the 'official' view of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Terry |last=Cook |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |title=What is past is prologue: a history of archival ideas since 1898, and the future paradigm shift |journal=Archivaria |volume=43 |year=1997 |pages=17–63 (24) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Jenkinson was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1943 and knighted in 1949.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; As well as being a member of the Society of Archivists of Great Britain, Jenkinson was also an honorary member of the Society of American Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Oliver|date=1961|title=Sir Hilary Jenkinson, 1882-1961|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/pdf/10.17723/aarc.24.3.e521g515xp0n60u1|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=24|issue=3|pages=345–347|doi=10.17723/aarc.24.3.e521g515xp0n60u1|issn=0360-9081|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jenkinson was further bestowed an honorary fellowship at [[University College London|University College, London]], as well as an honorary [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] of Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Writing in 1980, Roger Ellis and Peter Walne commented that "[n]o one man had more influence on the establishment of the profession of archivist in Great Britain than Sir Hilary Jenkinson".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis and Walne 1980, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Eastwood]] in 2003 called Jenkinson "one of the most influential archivists in the English-speaking world".&lt;ref&gt;Eastwood 2003, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkinson influenced the [[University of London]]'s decision to establish an archives diploma program, and would later present its first lecture.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Such a program provided advancement towards Jenkinson's desire for the scientific archival profession to advance beyond his Public Records Office, and to train a new generation of archivists in his English method.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  After his death, Oliver W. Holmes wrote in the ''[[American Archivist]]'' that Jenkinson's work had become a reference source for all inexperienced staff.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the Department of Information Studies at [[University College London]] has hosted an annual Jenkinson Lecture named in honour of Sir Hilary. The series was established to mark the sixtieth anniversary of archival education at UCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/icarus/culture/JenkinsonLecture |title=Jenkinson Lectures |publisher=ICARUS – International Centre for Archives and Records Management Research, UCL |accessdate=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Historical Dictionary Project''' of the Hebrew Language (HDP) (Hebrew: מִפְעַל הַמִּלּוֹן הַהִיסְטוֹרִי) is a long-term research undertaking of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. According to the Academy's website, "The overarching goal of the HDP is to present the history and development of the Hebrew lexicon, from the earliest occurrences of words down through their most recent documentation."&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary Project, Academy of the Hebrew Language. [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/English/HistoricalDictionaryProject/Pages/default.aspx] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to encompass the entire Hebrew lexicon throughout its history; that is, to present every Hebrew word in its morphological, semantical, and contextual development from its first appearance in written texts to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Hebrew Language Historical Dictionary Project, Indiana University.

== Origins ==

As early as 1937, the president of Va'ad HaLashon ("The Language Committee", which later became the Academy of the Hebrew Language), Prof. [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai]],&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library.  [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0020_0_20116.html] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the establishment of "a large endeavor which prepares an academic dictionary of our language, in all of the periods and evolutions that it has endured from the moment it is documented, until today." A formal decision to undertake the HDP was taken in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Academy of the Hebrew Language, Volume One, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=z_vuT9PQD8fV4QTo0rjbDQ&amp;id=uSc_AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22%D7%96%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%94+%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F+%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%25 Page 45] (Hebrew). Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation ==

The HDP is based on Hebrew texts up until 1100 CE, and large selections of Hebrew literature from the period thereafter until the founding of the [[State of Israel]]. As much scholarly attention had already been given to the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Pseudepigrapha]], it was decided to begin with texts from the post-biblical period. The database thus reflects more than 2000 years of Hebrew writing. Such a project requires a large textual database, and the HDP was one of the first in the world to develop and use a computerized concordance. In 2005, some fifty years after commencement, it was decided there was enough material to begin the writing of entries.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary Project, Academy of the Hebrew Language. [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/English/HistoricalDictionaryProject/Pages/default.aspx] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources ==

The Academy initially debated as to whether it should create a series of dictionaries according to periods or literary genres, or whether it should work towards a single integrated work. In 1959 it was decided that there would be one central dictionary containing all periods, i.e., ancient, medieval and modern Hebrew literature.&lt;ref&gt;Academy of the Hebrew Language, types of literature [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/English/HistoricalDictionaryProject/Types%20of%20Literature/Pages/default.aspx] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Material was first gathered from ancient literature written between 200 BCE and 1100 CE, and later, [[Hebrew_literature#Modern_Hebrew_literature|modern literature]] from 1750 onwards. Sources include material discovered at the [[Cairo Genizah]]. Material from [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] sources is also included, and material from [[Samaritan]] sources may be added in the future. Compilation of the list of documentary sources for the dictionary was completed in 1963 with the publication of ''Sefer ha-Meqorot [Source Book]'' for sources "from the canonization of the Bible until the conclusion of the [[Geonic]] period."&lt;ref&gt;Kernerman Dictionaries [http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn12-3-7.html] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Source Book'' serves as the foundation for all work on the dictionary.

== Database ==

Work on the HDP is based on the best available manuscripts of the texts, which are entered into the database and then analyzed. In those cases where there are several extant manuscripts, the clearest and most complete manuscript is selected for incorporation into the dictionary. 

In 1982 the Academy published a sample entry for the dictionary based on the triliteral root ערב. The 88-page entry was published in the Academy’s journal "Leshonenu" ("Our Language").&lt;ref&gt;Leshonenu [https://books.google.com/books?ei=cQPvT_O1Hon44QThoeD6DQ&amp;id=HgRctbcx3BAC&amp;dq=%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A0%D7%95+%D7%9E%D7%95+%28%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%9E%22%D7%91%29%2C+%D7%97%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA+4-3&amp;q=%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91#search_anchor 41] (Hebrew). Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the database of Hebrew texts from the post-biblical period down through the 11th century, and the database of modern texts from 1750 onwards, were united into a single database. This database serves as an archive of not only individual words, but also complete texts that have been carefully copied from their source. In addition to enabling grammatical analyses and concordance searches, the archives also contain unique corpora, such as Hebrew poetry from the 11th century. The database is accessible to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Database [http://hebrew-treasures.huji.ac.il/] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The database draws upon some 4,300 Hebrew sources, from the classic [[Rabbinic literature]] period (2nd century BCE) through the [[Geonic period]] (11th century CE) to 1947. Literary strata and genres represented include the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], inscriptions, [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], Geonic literature, [[prayer]] and [[piyyut]], Karaite literature, science, deeds, colophons, amulets, and the like. Essentially a concordance, the online resource accesses all the words in the database and enables retrieval of citations according to roots, lemmata, and declined forms or combinations, as well as of specific texts by title, author, date, or literary genre.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Net Online [http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=153256] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; It is updated as new research becomes available and as more old texts are discovered.

As of 7 June 2010, the twenty-million word database contained 4,056 Hebrew roots. Of its 54,807 entries, 14,592 are nouns, adjectives and adverbs, and 13,979 are verbs. The balance consists of personal names, numbers, prepositions and similar lexical items. The size of the database on that date was about 40 gigabytes.&lt;ref&gt;Akadem [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hadash/Documents/%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9D%20-%20%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA/akad41.pdf 41] Retrieved 2012-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete lexical archive will contain at least 25 million quotations.&lt;ref&gt;Literary and Linguistic Computing, Oxford Journals.

[[File:Portrait of Joseph Harris, 'Gomer' (4670840).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Joseph Harris, 'Gomer' c.1860]]
'''Joseph Harris''' (1773 – 10 August 1825) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Baptist]] minister, author, and journal editor. A [[Welsh language]] poet, he took the Biblical name of '''[[Gomer (Bible)|Gomer]]''' as his [[bardic name]]. On 1 January 1814 he launched the first Welsh-language weekly ''[[Seren Gomer]]'' ("Star of Gomer") in [[Swansea]].

Gomer was born on a farm in [[Wolf's Castle]], [[Pembrokeshire]], where a plaque was unveiled in his memory, making the 200th anniversary of the launch of ''Seren Gomer''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-26993436 BBC News, "Plaque unveiled for 200th anniversary of Seren Gomer". 12 April 2014]. Accessed 23 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Gomer himself became a preacher during the religious revival of 1795. He married Martha Symons, and took on{{clarify|date=September 2014}} Back Street chapel.  One of his best-known works, ''Cofiant Ieuan Ddu'', was a biography of his son, [[John Ryland Harris]], who worked as a typesetter for his father's printing press and died at the age of twenty.

The name of the [[Gomer Press]] was almost certainly chosen because of its founder J.D. Lewis' high regard for Joseph Harris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gomerprinting.co.uk/history/] History of Gomer Press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kadugli''', also '''Katcha-Kadugli-Miri''' or '''Central Kadu''', is a [[Kadu languages|Kadu language]] or [[dialect cluster]] spoken in [[Kordofan]]. Stevenson treats the varieties as dialects of one language, and they share a single ISO code, though Schadeberg (1989) treats them as separate languages. 

There are five commonly cited varieties. Three of them are rather divergent, on the verge of being distinct languages:
*Katcha ''(Tolubi, Dholubi)''
*Kadugli proper ''(Dakalla, Talla, Dhalla, Toma Ma Dalla, Kudugli, Morta)''
*Miri
However, they share a single orthography and use the same literacy materials (''Ethnologue''). 

Of the two other commonly cited varieties, ''Damba'' is somewhat closer to Kadugli, while ''Tumma'' appears to be a (sub)dialect of Katcha.

In [[phonetics]], '''length''' or '''quantity''' is a [[distinctive feature|feature]] of sounds that have distinctively extended duration compared with other sounds. There are [[vowel length|long vowels]] as well as [[Consonant length|long consonants]] (the latter are often called ''geminates'').

Many languages do not have distinctive length. Among the languages that have distinctive length, there are only a few that have both distinctive vowel length and distinctive consonant length. It is more common that there is only one or that they depend on each other.

The languages that distinguish between different lengths have usually long and short sounds. According to some linguists, [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami languages]] have three phonemic (meaning-distinguishing) lengths for consonants and vowels. Some [[Low German]]/[[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]] varieties in the vicinity of [[Hamburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Stellmacher, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Moselle Franconian]]&lt;ref&gt;Page 116 in Elmar Ternes: ''{{lang|de|Einführung in die Phonologie.}}'' {{lang|de|Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft}}, Darmstadt, 1987, {{ISBN|3-534-09576-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ripuarian Franconian]] varieties do, too.

Strictly speaking, a pair of a long sound and a short sound should be identical except for their length. In certain languages, however, there are pairs of [[phoneme]]s that are traditionally considered to be long-short pairs even though they differ not only in length, but also in quality, for instance [[English language|English]] "long e" which is {{IPA|/iː/}} (as in ''f'''ee'''t'' {{IPA|/fiːt/}}) vs. "short i" which is {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (as in ''f'''i'''t'' {{IPA|/fɪt/}}) or [[German language|German]] "long e" which is {{IPA|/eː/}} (as in ''B'''ee'''t'' {{IPA|/beːt/}} 'garden bed') vs. "short e" which is {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (as in ''B'''e'''tt'' {{IPA|/bɛt/}} 'sleeping bed'). Also, tonal contour may reinforce the length, as in Estonian, where the over-long length is concomitant with a tonal variation resembling tonal stress marking.

In transcription in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], long vowels or consonants are notated with the length sign ([[Unicode]] U+02D0 MODIFIER LETTER TRIANGULAR COLON) after the letter. Diacritics may occur over either the base letter, the length sign, or both. For example, in some non-rhotic varieties of English the /t/ of the word ''party'' may be nearly elided, with just some breathy-voice remaining, in which case it may be transcribed {{IPA|[ˈpɑː̤ɪ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Heselwood (2013) ''Phonetic transcription in theory and practice'' p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When both length and tone are moraic, a tone diacritic may appear twice, as in {{IPA|[sáː̀]}} (falling tone on a long vowel). A morpheme may be reduced to length plus nasalization, in which case a word might be transcribed {{IPA|[saː̃]}}. If the length is morphemic, the morphemes would be {{IPA|/ː̀/}} and {{IPA|/ː̃/}}.

In this non-linear [[phonology]], the feature of length is often not a feature of a specific sound segment, but rather of the whole syllable.

The '''Liburnian language''' is an extinct language which was spoken by the ancient [[Liburnians]], who occupied [[Liburnia]] in classical times. Classification of the Liburnian language is not clearly established; it is reckoned as an [[Indo-European language]] with a significant proportion of the [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] elements from the wider area of the ancient [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

==Classification==
No writings in Liburnian are known. The only Liburnian linguistic remains are Liburnian toponyms and some family and personal names in Liburnia, in Latinized form from the 1st century AD. Smaller differences found in the archaeological material of narrower regions in Liburnia are in a certain measure reflected also in these scarce linguistic remains. This has caused much speculation about the language.

Features shared by Liburnian and other  languages have been noted in Liburnian language remains, names and toponyms, dating from between the [[Iron Age]] and the beginning of [[Common Era]]. These are insufficient for a precise linguistic classification, other than a general indication that they have an Indo-European basis, but also incorporate significant elements from Pre-Indo-European languages. This also appears to be the case in their social relations, and such phenomena are likely related to their separate cultural development, physical isolation and mixed ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;D. Rendić-Miočević, ''Onomastičke studije s područja Liburna,'' Zbornik Instituta za historijske nauke u Zadru 1, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Suić, ''Zapadne granice Ilira u svijetlu historijskih izvora,'' Simpozijum, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Š. Batović, ''Liburnska kultura,'' Matica Hrvatska i Arheološki muzej Zadar, Zadar, 2005, UDK: 904 (398 Liburnija), {{ISBN|953-6419-50-5}}, pages 65, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Following studies of the onomastics of the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Roman province of Dalmatia]], [[Géza Alföldy]] has suggested that the Liburni and [[Histri]] belonged to the [[Venetic language]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Géza Alföldy, ''Die Namensgebung der Urbevölkerung in der römischen Provinz Dalmatien.'' Beiträge zur Namenforschung 15, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Alföldy, ''Die Personennamen im römischen Dalmatien,'' Heidelberg, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some Liburnian [[anthroponyms]] show strong Venetic affinities, a few similar names and common roots, such as ''Vols-'', ''Volt-'', and ''Host-'' (&lt; [[PIE]] ''*ghos-ti-'', "stranger, guest, host"). Liburnian and Venetic names sometimes also share suffixes in common, such as ''-icus'' and ''-ocus''.

Jürgen Untermann, who has focused on Liburnian onomastics, considers that only  the Liburnians at the north-eastern [[Istria]]n coast were strongly Venetic. Untermann has suggested three groups of Liburnian names: one structurally similar to those of the Venetian and Histri; another linked to the [[Dalmatae]], [[Iapodes]] and other [[Illyrians]] on the mainland to the south of the Liburnians, and; a third group of names that were common throughout Liburnian territory, and lacked any relation to those of their neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;J. Untermann, ''Die venetischen Personennamen,'' Wiesbaden, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Untermann, ''Venetisches in Dalmatien,'' GCBI 5, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proper names, such as those of local deities and toponyms also showed differing regional distributions. According to [[Radoslav Katičić|R. Katičić]],  Liburnian toponyms, in both structure and form, also demonstrate diverse influences, including [[Old European hydronymy|Pre-Indo-European]], Indo-European and other, purely local features. Katičić has also stated that toponyms were distributed separately along ethnic and linguistic lines.&lt;ref&gt;R. Katičić, ''Ancient languages of the Balkans, Trends in linguistics'' 4, 5, The Hague and Paris, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; 

S. Čače has noted that it can not be determined whether Liburnian was more related to the North Adriatic language group (Veneti, Histri) or the languages of Iapodes and Dalmatae, due to the scarcity of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;S. Čače, Liburnija u razdoblju od 4. do 1. st. prije nove ere, Zadar, 1985, 101-120&lt;/ref&gt; While the Liburnians differed significantly from the Histri and Veneti, both culturally and ethnically, they have been linked to the Dalmatae by their burial traditions. 

Other toponymical and onomastic similarities have been found between Liburnia and other regions of both Illyria and [[Asian Minor]], especially [[Lycia]], [[Lydia]], [[Caria]], [[Pisidia]], [[Isauria]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Lycaonia]] and [[Cilicia]], as well as similarities in elements of social organization, such as [[matriarchy]]/[[Gynocentrism|ginecocracy]] (''gynaikokratia'') and the numerical organization of territory. These are also features of the wider [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] region, especially [[Etruria]], [[Messapii|Messapia]] and southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;M. Zaninović, On some relations between Anatolia and Dalmatia, Proceedings of the Xth International Congress of Classical Studies, Ankara-Izmir, 20-30, Sept. 1973, Ankara 1978, 81-93&lt;/ref&gt; Topoymical and onomastic connections to Asia Minor may also indicate a Liburnian presence amongst the [[Sea Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43-67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) »65«, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The old toponym ''Liburnum'' in [[Liguria]] may also link the Liburnian name to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Fluss, Liburni, PWRE. Bd. V, 583&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Jokl in Ebert, Reallex. der Vorgeschichte, VI, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the proposed [[Tyrsenian language]] family.

The Liburnians underwent [[Romanization]] after being conquered by the Romans in 35 BCE. The Liburnian language was replaced by [[Latin]], and underwent [[language death]] –most likely during [[Late Antiquity]]. The Liburnians nevertheless retained some of  their cultural traditions until the 4th century CE,  especially in the larger cities – a fact attested by archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;M. Zaninović, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43–67 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13) »65«, page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Onomastics==

===Anthroponyms===
The single name plus [[patronym]]ic formula common among Illyrians is rare among Liburnians. In a region where the Roman three-name formula (''[[praenomen]]'', ''[[nomen gentile]]'', ''[[cognomen]]'': ''Caius Julius Caesar'') spread at an early date, a native two-name formula appears in several variants.
Personal name plus family name is found in southern Liburnia, while personal name plus family name plus patronymic is found throughout the Liburnian area, for example: ''Avita Suioca Vesclevesis'', ''Velsouna Suioca Vesclevesis f(ilia)'', ''Avita Aquillia L(uci) f(ilia)'', ''Volsouna Oplica Pl(a)etoris f(ilia)'', ''Vendo Verica Triti f(ilius)''.

The [[Linguistic Society of America]] (LSA) is a [[learned society]] for [[linguistics]] founded in December 1924. At the first meeting, the LSA membership elected [[Hermann Collitz]] as their first president. Since then, there have been 92 presidencies, with 91 different presidents.&lt;ref group=Note name=Buck&gt;[[Carl Darling Buck]] is the only person to serve twice as president, in 1927 and 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Under the constitution and bylaws of the organization, the president of the LSA serves for a one-year term. The president serves as chair of the executive committee and has the power to appoint a number of positions subject to executive committee approval.

The president serves for one year. A candidate is elected by the membership as vice-president of the LSA which is also carries the distinction of president-elect. The candidate serves as vice-president for one year and then assumes the office of president at the end of the annual meeting. The candidate then serves as president for one year. Upon leaving the office, the former president serves a one-year term on the Executive Committee. Should the sitting president prematurely leave office, the previous president completes the term.

The current president of the LSA is [[Penelope Eckert]].

'''Malak Hifni Nasif''' (25 December 1886 – 17 October 1918) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[Feminism|feminist]] who contributed greatly to the intellectual and political discourse on the advancement of Egyptian women in the early 20th century.

== Personal life ==
Malak was born in [[Cairo]] in 1886 to a middle-class family. Her mother was Saniyyah Abd al-Karim Jalal, and her father was Hifni Bey Nasif, a lawyer who was a member of Muhammad Abduh’s party. Malak’s father encouraged her to learn and be educated. Growing up, she often read Arabic poetry and began writing in her free time.&lt;ref name=Changing&gt;{{cite book | last = Kader | first = Soha | title = Egyptian women in a changing society, 1899–1987 | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | location = Boulder | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780931477478 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65}} While her father encouraged her to be formally educated, he also raised her with a strong connection to native Egyptian culture, teaching her the Arabic language and Arabic culture from an early age.&lt;ref name=Historical&gt;{{cite book | last = Ahmed | first = Leila | title = Women and gender in Islam: historical roots of a modern debate | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780300055832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}}

Malak was among the first graduating class from the Girls’ Section of the ‘Abbas Primary School in 1901, and she continued her education at the Saniyyah Teacher Training College, where she graduated at the top of her class in 1903.&lt;ref name=Yousef&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Yousef | first = Reina | title = Malak Hifni Nasif: negotiations of a feminist agenda between the European and the Colonial | journal = [[Journal of Middle East Women's Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–89 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jmiddeastwomstud.2011.7.1.70 | jstor = 10.2979/jmiddeastwomstud.2011.7.1.70 | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2979/jmiddeastwomstud.2011.7.1.70 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|73}} Malak returned to the ‘Abbas School to teach for two years. She was forced to quit when she married Abd al-Satar al-Basil Pasha in 1907. At the time, Egyptian law forbid women from teaching while married.&lt;ref name=Badran&gt;{{cite book | last = Badran | first = Margot | title = Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt | page = 54 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780691026053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Malak moved with al-Basil to [[faiyum|al-Fayyum]] in the desert, and she began writing under the pseudonym Bahithat al-Badiya.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|65}} It was there that she found out her husband already had a wife and a child. The treatment she received from al-Basil, as well as the observations she made of other women, led her to write thoughtfully and directly about the status of women in Egypt.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|65}} She corresponded significantly with other writers and friends like May Ziadah, and she responded critically to major male writers of the time, like [[Qasim Amin]].&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|66}} Malak stayed with al-Basil for 11 years until she died of influenza in 1918.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|67}}

== Feminist writings ==
Malak lived in Egypt during a period of growing intellectual and political discourse on the status of women in society. This time period included influential players like [[Huda Sha'arawi]], [[Qasim Amin]], [[Nabawiyya Musa]], and many more. During the same period, nationalist and traditionalist thinkers went back and forth with different ideas about the future of the Middle East. These two conversations were intrinsically linked and had a large overlap. Malak entered this dialogue and presented her "attempt at reform" for an Egyptian future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golson|first1=Emily|last2=Youssef|first2=Loubna|last3=Fields|first3=Amanda|title=Toward, Around, and Away from Tahrir: Tracking Emerging Expressions of Egyptian Identity|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=1443859168|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JoxBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=malak+hifni+nasif+feminist+egyptian+culture&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malak first began publishing works Al-jarida, the major newspaper of the Umma party.  Malak also spoke often at universities and the Umma party headquarters.&lt;ref name=Yousef /&gt;{{rp|73}} In 1909, she published Al-Nisa’iyyat, a collection of many of her talks and essays.&lt;ref name=Badran /&gt; Through these methods, she raised her own voice for the advancement of women.

The dominant feminist ideas at the time associated the advancement of women with westernization and movement towards a more European society.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|784}} Women like Huda Sha’rawi supported actions like unveiling as progress towards a more European, more liberated world for women.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|174}} Malak agreed on some level with her contemporaries, but, for the most part, she brought her own ideas. She had an alternative feminist voice; she combined westernization with Islam and traditionalism, claiming that only a combination of the two would move women in the right direction.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|174}} She presented these views by writing on a number of different issues, including unveiling, marriage, and education.

=== Unveiling ===

During the early 1900s, many elite women began using unveiling, or the public removal of their face veils, as a symbol of feminism. Writers like Qasim Amin advocated unveiling as a strategy for women to show their power and liberation.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|184}} Malak, on the other hand, was opposed to unveiling and did not believe that it should be used in this way. She believed that many of the wealthier women who unveiled were doing so because of an obsession with European fashion, not because of a desire for freedom or because they felt repressed by the veil.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|180}} She also argued that the veil had been a part of the culture for a long time and that banning it would be too abrupt a change for many women.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|180}} Malak called for women to be wary of men who, at first, ordered women to wear a veil and then suddenly ordered them not to for the purpose of their ‘liberation.’&lt;ref name=Yousef /&gt;{{rp|73}} Her views on the veil represented a significant difference between her and other feminists.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Marriage ===

Malak wrote extensively about the marital rights of women in Egypt. This issue was one of the feminist issues with which she had significant personal experience. The fact that her husband had two wives caused her to intensely oppose [[polygamy]]. In an article entitled “Or Co-Wives”, she deemed polygamy “women’s mortal enemy.”&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|182}} She felt that significant changes must be made with regards to marriage; polygamy must end, men and women must both be able to divorce, and the age at which women marry must increase to at least sixteen.  She argued that all of these reforms stem from one central idea: love must be the basis for all marriage.&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Baron | first1 = Beth | last2 = Keddie | first2 = Nikki R. | title = Women in Middle Eastern history shifting boundaries in sex and gender | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780300056976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|278}}  Malak despised the idea of a marriage rooted in economic reasons, of a man marrying a woman simply for her money. She also supported her arguments against early marriage by commenting that women who married early often developed hysteria.&lt;ref name=Baron /&gt;{{rp|281}} Overall, marriage in Egypt was one of the biggest problems for Malak, and she sought drastic reform on this issue.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Education ===

Malak viewed [[education reform]] as one of the most promising solutions to many of the problems that women faced. In her writings, she expressed that any girl that did not have an opportunity to attend and finish school had been treated unjustly.&lt;ref name=Remaking&gt;{{cite book | last = Shakry | first = Omnia | contribution = Schooled mothers and structured play: child rearing in turn-of-the-century Egypt 126–170 | editor-last = Abu-Lughod | editor-first = Lila | title = Remaking women: feminism and modernity in the Middle East | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780691057927 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}} She shared this sentiment with the other feminists of the time. She did not believe, though, that just any education would suffice. She opposed the implementation of missionary schools in Egypt, arguing that “the most ignorant of girls are the graduates of the missionary schools.”&lt;ref name=Yousef /&gt;{{rp|84}} Malak called for more Egyptian control over the public education system to create schools that taught girls a more comprehensive curriculum, including history of Egyptian culture.&lt;ref name=Yousef /&gt;{{rp|84}}

Malak diverged from others further when she extended her argument and claimed that formal education alone could not solve [[women's rights|women’s problems]]. She believed that much of the women’s injustice resided in the home, that tarbiya, or the process of raising a child, was responsible for a woman’s future.&lt;ref name=Remaking /&gt;{{rp|145}} She emphasized the difference between European mothers and Egyptian mothers in caring for their children; Egyptian mothers did not take care of their daughters’ physical health and mental development nearly as well as European mothers did.&lt;ref name=Remaking /&gt;{{rp|146}} She argued that mothers must teach their girls to feel empathy for others, to take care of themselves, and to take care of their own children. Malak proposed reforms to better teach religion to girls, to expand schools for female nurses, to increase access to healthcare for women, and to teach hygienic practices.&lt;ref name=Remaking /&gt;{{rp|146}} The practice of child rearing was one of the areas in which Malak thought that some [[Westernization]] would benefit Egyptian society, but she also believed strongly in the importance of teaching [[Islam]] to children. Overall, she believed that most aspects of women’s education needed significant reform.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Politics ==

Malak took action on her views by starting organizations and seeking political action. One aspect of her political activity was connection with women from other countries. She founded the Union for the Education of Women, which brought Egyptian women together with other Arab and European women.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|67}} Malak later founded an emergency health service based on the Red Cross and a nursing school for women in her own home.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|184}} She made sure to physically represent the ideals that she supported in her writing.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

One of Malak’s most significant political actions was her presentation of a ten-point program for the improvement of women to the Egyptian Legislative Assembly in 1911.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|67}} She laid out five points as to how education should be improved: it should have religious orientation; it should be required up to primary school; it should include hygiene, childrearing, first aid, and economics; it should include training for women in nursing and teaching professions; and it should be open to all women for higher studies.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|67}} She asked for legislation on all of these points. The other five points focused on other women’s rights like marriage age and unveiling.&lt;ref name=Changing /&gt;{{rp|67}} Though this program was ignored by the assembly, it was a major example of a woman taking charge of [[feminism]] in a political forum.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Death and legacy ==

Malak died of influenza at the age of 31 on 17 October 1918.  Her funeral was attended by an array of feminists and government leaders.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|183}} On the seventh anniversary of her death, Sha’rawi held another commemoration that included the predominant feminist thinkers [[Nabawiyya Musa]] and Mai Ziyada.&lt;ref name=Historical /&gt;{{rp|184}} While she left a powerful legacy and was remembered by all of her contemporaries, her unique feminist perspective died with her, and Sha’rawi became the foremost feminist thinker of the time.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Life==
[[File:Temple of Mencius - Yasheng Hall - inside - P1050921.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An image of Mencius in the sanctuary of the Mencius Temple, Zoucheng]]
Mencius, also known by his birth name '''Meng Ke''' (孟軻), was born in the [[State of Zou]], now forming the territory of the [[county-level city]] of [[Zoucheng]] (originally Zouxian), [[Shandong]] Province, only thirty kilometres (eighteen miles) south of [[Qufu]], Confucius's birthplace.

He was an itinerant [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosopher]] and sage, and one of the principal interpreters of [[Confucianism]]. Supposedly, he was a pupil of Confucius's grandson, [[Zisi]]. Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 1963: 49.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the [[Jixia Academy]] in the [[State of Qi]] (1046 BC to 221 BC) from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his [[filial piety|filial devotion]] when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother's death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Průšek]] and Zbigniew Słupski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mencius is buried in the "Mencius Cemetery" (孟子林, ''Mengzi Lin'', also known as 亞聖林, ''Yasheng Lin''), which is located 12&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast of Zoucheng's central urban area. A [[stele]] carried by a giant [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]] and crowned with dragons stands in front of his grave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm 孟子林] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805110526/http://www.infobase.gov.cn/intro/fjms/l8/l8016/index.htm |date=2012-08-05 }} (Mencius Cemetery)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mencius's mother===
Mencius's mother is often held up as an exemplary female figure in Chinese culture. One of the most famous traditional Chinese [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] is {{linktext|孟母三遷}} ({{zh|p=mèngmǔ-sānqiān|l=Mencius's mother moves three times|c=|s=|t=}}); this saying refers to the legend that Mencius's mother moved houses three times before finding a location that she felt was suitable for the child's upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of finding the proper environment for raising children.

Mencius's father died when Mencius was very young. His mother {{linktext|Zhǎng}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|仉}}}}) raised her son alone. They were very poor. At first they lived by a cemetery, where the mother found her son imitating the paid mourners in funeral processions. Therefore, the mother decided to move. The next house was near a market in the town. There the boy began to imitate the cries of merchants (merchants were despised in early China). So the mother moved to a house next to a school. Inspired by the scholars and students, Mencius began to study. His mother decided to remain, and Mencius became a scholar.

Another story further illustrates the emphasis that Mencius's mother placed on her son's education. As the story goes, once when Mencius was young, he was truant from school. His mother responded to his apparent disregard for his education by taking up a pair of scissors and cutting the cloth she had been weaving in front of him. This was intended to illustrate that one cannot stop a task midway, and her example inspired Mencius to diligence in his studies.

There is another legend about his mother and his wife, involving a time when his wife was at home alone and was discovered by Mencius not to be sitting properly. Mencius thought his wife had violated a rite, and demanded a divorce. His mother claimed that it was written in The Book of Rites that before a person entered a room, he should announce his imminent presence loudly to let others prepare for his arrival; as he had not done that in this case, the person who had violated the rite was Mencius himself. Eventually Mencius admitted his fault.

She is one of 125 women of which biographies have been included in the [[Lienü zhuan|Lienü zhuan ('Biographies of Exemplary Women')]], written by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]].

===Descendants===
[[Duke Huan of Lu]]'s son through Qingfu (慶父) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the [[State of Lu]] (魯煬公). Duke Yang was the son of [[Bo Qin]], who was the son of the [[Duke of Zhou]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]] royal family. The genealogy is found in the Mencius family tree (孟子世家大宗世系).&lt;ref&gt;《三遷志》，（清）孟衍泰續修&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《孟子世家譜》，（清）孟廣均主編，1824年&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《孟子與孟氏家族》，孟祥居編，2005年&lt;/ref&gt;

Mencius's descendants lived in [[Zoucheng]] in the Mencius Family Mansion, where the Mencius Temple was also built and also a cemetery for Mencius's descendants.

[[Meng Haoran]] and [[Meng Jiao]] were descendants of Mencius who lived during the [[Tang dynasty]].

During the [[Ming dynasty]], one of Mencius's descendants was given a hereditary title at the [[Hanlin Academy]] by the Emperor. The title they held was Wujing Boshi (五經博士; [[w:zh:五經博士|五經博士]]; Wǔjīng Bóshì).&lt;ref name="BrunnertHagelstrom2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.S. Brunnert|author2=V.V.

One of Mencius's direct descendants was Dr. Meng Chih (Anglicised as Dr. Paul Chih Meng) former director of China House, and director of the China Institute in 1944. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported Dr. Meng's age that year as 44.  Dr. Meng died in Arizona in 1990 at the age of 90. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/07/obituaries/paul-chih-meng-90-headed-china-institute.html | work=The New York Times | title=Paul Chih Meng, 90, Headed China Institute | date=7 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina's [[Davidson College]] and [[Columbia University]] were his alma mater.

In the [[Republic of China]] there is an office called the "Sacrificial Official to Mencius" which is held by a descendant of Mencius, like the post of "Sacrificial Official to Zengzi" for a descendant of [[Zengzi]], "Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui" for a descendant of [[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Yan Hui]], and the post of "[[Sacrificial Official to Confucius]], held by a descendant of Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-07/24/content_11764658.htm|title=台湾拟将孔子奉祀官改为荣誉职 可由女性继承_台湾频道_新华网|author=|date=|work=xinhuanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2009-07-23/101716000328s.shtml|title=台湾儒家奉祀官将改为无给职 不排除由女子继任_新闻中心_新浪网|author=|date=|work=sina.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.rfi.fr/actucn/articles/115/article_15023.asp|title=台湾拟减少儒家世袭奉祀官职位并取消俸禄|author=|trans-title=Taiwan intends to reduce Confucian hereditary positions and cancel the salary.|language=zh|date=|work=rfi.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descendants of Mencius still use [[Generation_name#Generation_poem|generation poems]] for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors along with the descendants of the other [[Four Sages]] ([[w:zh:四氏|四氏]]): Confucius, Zengzi, and [[Yan Hui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ 孔姓 (The Kong family, descendents of Confucius)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010033/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 孟姓 (The Meng family, descendents of Mencius)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116060231/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 |date=2006-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Mencius's descendants moved to Korea and founded the [[Sinchang Maeng clan]].

==Main concepts==

[[File:Mencius.jpg|thumb|Mencius, from ''Myths and Legends of China'', 1922 by E. T. C. Werner]]
===Human nature===
While Confucius himself did not explicitly focus on the subject of human nature, Mencius asserted the innate goodness of the individual, believing that it was society's influence – its lack of a positive cultivating influence – that caused bad [[moral character]]. "He who exerts his mind to the utmost knows his nature"&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mencius'' 7:A1 in Chan 1963: 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the way of learning is none other than finding the lost mind."&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mencius'' 6:A11 in Chan 1963: 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The four beginnings (or sprouts)===
To show innate goodness, Mencius used the example of a child falling down a well. Witnesses of this event immediately feel {{cquote|alarm and distress, not to gain friendship with the child's parents, nor to seek the praise of their neighbors and friends, nor because they dislike the reputation [of lack of humanity if they did not rescue the child]...

The feeling of commiseration is the beginning of humanity;
the feeling of shame and dislike is the beginning of righteousness;
the feeling of deference and compliance is the beginning of propriety;
and the feeling of right or wrong is the beginning of [[wisdom]].

Men have these Four Beginnings just as they have their four limbs. Having these Four Beginnings, but saying that they cannot develop them is to destroy themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mencius'' 2A:6 in Chan 1963: 65. Formatting has been applied to ease readability.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human nature has an innate tendency towards goodness, but moral rightness cannot be instructed down to the last detail.  This is why merely external controls always fail in improving society.  True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments.  Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others.  This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not need cultivation, they just needed to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness.  The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism.  Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one's natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence, otherwise known as [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]].

===Education===
According to Mencius, education must awaken the innate abilities of the human mind.  He denounced memorization and advocated active interrogation of the text, saying, "One who believes all of a book would be better off without books" (盡信書，則不如無書, from 孟子.盡心下). One should check for internal consistency by comparing sections and debate the probability of factual accounts by comparing them with experience.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Destiny===
Mencius also believed in the power of Destiny in shaping the roles of human beings in society.  What is destined cannot be contrived by the human intellect or foreseen.   Destiny is shown when a path arises that is both unforeseen and constructive.    Destiny should not be confused with Fate.  Mencius denied that Heaven would protect a person regardless of his actions, saying, "One who understands Destiny will not stand beneath a tottering wall".  The proper path is one which is natural and unforced.  This path must also be maintained because, "Unused pathways are covered with weeds."  One who follows Destiny will live a long and successful life.  One who rebels against Destiny will die before his time.

===Views on politics and economics===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Life of Mencius.jpg|thumb|210px|right|"The Life of Mencius" pictures Mencius walking with the King of [[Teng (state)|Teng]], discussing his philosophy that all men have innate benevolence.]] --&gt;

Mencius emphasized the significance of the common citizens in the state. While Confucianism generally regards rulers highly, he argued that it is acceptable for the subjects to overthrow or even kill a ruler who ignores the people's needs and rules harshly. This is because a ruler who does not rule justly is no longer a true ruler. Speaking of the overthrow of the wicked [[King Zhou of Shang]], Mencius said, "I have merely heard of killing a villain Zhou, but I have not heard of murdering [him as] the ruler."&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mencius'' 1B:8 in Chan 1963: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

This saying should not be taken as an instigation to violence against authorities but as an application of Confucian philosophy to society.  Confucianism requires a clarification of what may be reasonably expected in any given relationship.  All relationships should be beneficial, but each has its own principle or inner logic.  A Ruler must justify his position by acting benevolently before he can expect reciprocation from the people.  In this view, a King is like a steward.  Although Confucius admired Kings of great accomplishment, Mencius is clarifying the proper hierarchy of human society.  Although a King has presumably higher status than a commoner, he is actually subordinate to the masses of people and the resources of society.  Otherwise, there would be an implied disregard of the potential of human society heading into the future.  One is significant only for what one gives, not for what one takes.

Mencius distinguished between superior men who recognize and follow the virtues of righteousness and benevolence and inferior men who do not. He suggested that superior men considered only righteousness, not benefits. That assumes "permanent property" to uphold common morality. &lt;ref&gt;Yagi, Kiichiro (2008). "China, economics in," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, p. 778. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000577&amp;edition=current&amp;q=mencius&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; To secure benefits for the disadvantaged and the aged, he advocated [[free trade]], low [[tax rate]]s, and a more equal sharing of the [[tax burden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael H. Hart|Hart, Michael H.]] (1978), ''The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History'', p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Comparisons to contemporaries==
His alleged years make him contemporary with [[Xun Zi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Gaozi]], and [[Plato]].

===Xun Zi===
[[Xun Zi]] was a Confucian who believed that human nature is centered on self-interest and greed, and the purpose of moral cultivation is to develop our nature into goodness. This put him at odds with Mencius. Later, the thinker [[Zhu Xi]] declared  the views of Xun Zi to be unorthodox, instead supporting the position of Mencius.

===Plato===
Mencius's argument that unjust rulers may be overthrown is reminiscent of [[Socrates]]'s argument in Book I of Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

==Influence==
[[File:Temple of Mencius - possibly Yuan bixi near Qisheng Hall - P1050933.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Yuan Dynasty]] [[bixi (tortoise)|turtle]] with a stele honoring Mencius]]
Mencius's interpretation of Confucianism has generally been considered the orthodox version by subsequent Chinese philosophers, especially by the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] of the [[Song dynasty]].  Mencius's disciples included a large number of feudal lords, and he is said to have been more influential than Confucius had been.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Charles O. Hucker, ''China to 1850: A Short History'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1978, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' (also spelled ''Mengzi'' or ''Meng-tzu''), a book of his conversations with kings of the time, is one of the [[Four Books]] that [[Zhu Xi]] grouped as the core of orthodox Neo-Confucian thought. In contrast to the sayings of Confucius, which are short and self-contained, the ''Mencius'' consists of long dialogues, including arguments, with extensive prose. It was generally neglected by the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] who first translated the [[Confucian canon]] into [[Latin]] and other European languages, as they felt that the Neo-Confucian school largely consisted of [[Buddhism in China|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] contamination of [[Confucianism]]. [[Matteo Ricci]] also particularly disliked Mencius's strong condemnation of [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]] as [[filial piety|unfilial]]. [[François Noël (missionary)|François Noël]], who felt that Zhu's ideas represented a natural and native development of Confucius's thought, was the first to publish a full edition of the ''Mencius'' at [[Prague]] in 1711;{{sfnp|Noël|1711}}{{efn|[[Francois Noel (missionary)|Noël]]'s transcription of the name as "Memcius or Mem Tsu" reflects the orthography of his day, which rendered [[Velar nasal|/ŋ/]] as {{angle bracket|[[m]]}}. See, e.g., "Nankim" for "Nanjing" and "Kiamnim" for "Jiangning" on the map of China published in the 1687 ''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=[[:File:Paradigma XV Provinciarum et CLV Urbium Capitalium Sinensis Imperij.jpg|Paradigma XV Provinciarum et CLV Urbium Capitalium Sinensis Imperij]] [A Schematic of the 15 Provinces and 155 Chief Cities of the Chinese Empire] |url=https://archive.org/stream/confuciussinarum00conf_0#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Confucius Sinarum Philosophus...

In 1978 book purporting to estimate the hundred most influential persons in history to that point, Mencius is ranked at 92.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael H. Hart|Hart, Michael H.]] (1978), ''The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History'', p. 7, discussed on pp. 479–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27657">The '''Proto-Austroasiatic language''' is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] ancestor of the [[Austroasiatic languages]].

Proto-Mon–Khmer (i.e., all Austroasiatic branches except for Munda) has been reconstructed in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary'', while a new Proto-Austroasiatic reconstruction is currently being undertaken by [[Paul Sidwell]]. [[Paul Sidwell]] (2009)&lt;ref name="Sidwell2009"&gt;Sidwell, Paul (2009). [http://www.jolr.ru/files/%2851%29jlr2010-4%28117-134%29.pdf The Austroasiatic Central Riverine Hypothesis]. Keynote address, SEALS, XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the likely [[Urheimat#Austroasiatic homeland|homeland of Austroasiatic]] is in the [[Mekong River]] region, and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaal.org/abstract/sidwell-family.pdf Family Diversity and the Austroasiatic Homeland], Paul Sidwell (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peiros (2011) criticized Sidwells theory heavily and calls it a bunch of contradictions. He show with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near the [[Yangtze]]. He suggests the [[Sichuan Basin]] as likely homeland of proto-Austroasiatic before they migrated to other parts of central and southern China and than into Southeast Asia. He further suggests that the family must be as old as proto-Austronesian and proto-Sinotibetan or even older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jolr.ru/files/(68)jlr2011-6(101-114).pdf|title=Some thoughts on the problem of the Austro-Asiatic homeland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Peiros (2011)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
===Shorto (2006)===
The '''Proto-Mon–Khmer language''' is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] ancestor of the [[Mon–Khmer languages]], a purported primary branch of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]]. However, Mon–Khmer as a taxon has been abandoned in recent classifications, making Proto-Mon–Khmer synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic;&lt;ref name="Sidwell2009"/&gt; the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented, and have been restructured through external language contact, have not been included in the reconstructions.

Proto-Mon–Khmer as reconstructed by [[Harry L. Shorto]] (2006) has a total of 21 [[consonant]]s, 7 distinct [[vowel]]s, which can be lengthened and glottalized, and 3 [[diphthong]]s.

* *(C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(n/r/l))CᵢVC&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;

Sidwell &amp; Rau (2015)&lt;ref name="SidwellRau2015"/&gt; reconstruct 21-22 Proto-Austroasiatic consonants (the reconstruction of *ʄ is uncertain).

All of the Proto-Austroasiatic consonants except for [[Implosive consonant|implosives]] and [[Stop consonant|voiced stops]] can occur as syllable finals (C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).

All of the Proto-Austroasiatic unvoiced stops and voiced stops, as well as *m-, *N-, *r-, *l-, and *s-, can occur as presyllables or [[sesquisyllable]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;).

Medial consonants (C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) are *-w -, *-r -, *-l -, *-j -, and *-h-.

Proto-Austroasiatic diphthongs are *iə and *uə, and possibly *ie and *uo.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"/&gt;

==Morphology==
Common structures include *CV(C) and *CCV(C) roots. *CVC roots can also be affixed either via prefixes or infixes, as in *C-CVC or *C{{infix|C}}VC (Shorto 2006). Sidwell (2008) gives the following phonological shapes for two types of stems.

* '''Monosyllabic''' - C(R)V(V)C
* '''Sesquisyllabic''' - CCV(V)C

''Note'': R is one of the optional medial consonants /r, l, j, w, h/.

Sidwell (2008) considers the two most morphologically conservative Mon–Khmer branches to be [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]] and [[Aslian languages|Aslian]]. On the other hand, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] morphology is far more similar to that of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and the [[Tai languages]] and has lost many morphological features found in Proto-Mon–Khmer.

The following Proto-Mon–Khmer affixes, which are still tentative, have been reconstructed by [[Paul Sidwell]] (Sidwell 2008:257-263).

* Nominalizing '''*-n-''' (instrumental in Kammu, resultative in Khmu)
* Nominalizing agentive '''*-m-'''
* Nominalizing iterative (expressive of repetitiveness/numerousness) '''*-l-'''/'''*-r-'''
* Nominalizing instrumental '''*-p-'''
* Causative '''*p(V)-''' (allomorphs: ''p-, pn-, -m-'')
* Reciprocal '''*tr-'''/*'''t(N)-'''
* Stative '''*h-'''/'''*hN-''' (?)

[[Roger Blench]] (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2012. [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/SEA/Nominal%20affixes%20in%20Austroasiatic%20and%20Sino-Tibetan.pdf The origins of nominal affixes in Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan: convergence, contact and some African parallels]. Paper presented at the [https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2012_MSA_Languages/ Mainland Southeast Asian Languages: The State of the Art in 2012] workshop, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, 29 November - 1 December 2012. ([http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/SEA/Blench%20Leipzig%202012%20ppt.pdf slides])&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan share many similarities regarding word structure, particularly nominal affixes (otherwise known as [[sesquisyllable]]s or minor syllable prefixes). Blench (2012) does not make any definitive conclusions about how these similarities could have arisen, but suggests that this typological diffusion might have come about as a result of intensive contact in an area between northern Vietnam, Laos, and northeast Myanmar.

==Syntax==
Like the [[Tai languages]], Proto-Mon–Khmer has an [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]], or verb-medial, order. Proto-Mon–Khmer also makes use of [[classifier (linguistics)|noun classifiers]] and [[serial verb construction]]s (Shorto 2006).

However, [[Paul Sidwell]] (2018)&lt;ref name="Sidwell2018"/&gt; suggests that Proto-Austroasiatic may have in fact been verb-initial, with SVO order occurring in [[Indochina]] due to convergence in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]]. Various modern-day Austroasiatic languages display verb-initial word order, including [[Pnar language|Pnar]] and [[Wa language|Wa]] (Jenny 2015).&lt;ref&gt;Jenny, Mathias. 2015. Syntactic diversity and change in Austroasiatic languages. In Viti, Carlotta (ed.). ''Perspectives on historical syntax''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 317–340.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicobarese also displays verb-initial word order.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2018"/&gt;

== Origin and dispersal ==
Paul Sidwell (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2018. ''Austroasiatic deep chronology and the problem of cultural lexicon''. Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held May 17-19, 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.

Integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015)&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"&gt;Sidwell, Paul. 2015. ''Phylogeny, innovations, and correlations in the prehistory of Austroasiatic''. Paper presented at the workshop ''Integrating inferences about our past: new findings and current issues in the peopling of the Pacific and South East Asia'', June 22nd – June 23rd, 2015, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into [[Indochina]] from the [[Lingnan]] area of [[southern China]], with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China. Sidwell (2015) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the [[Neolithic transition]] era of [[mainland Southeast Asia]], with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P. Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] watershed of [[Lingnan]], which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the [[Mekong River]] via [[Yunnan]].&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"/&gt; Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and [[millet]], kept livestock such dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"/&gt; At 4,500 B.P., this "Neolithic package" suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"/&gt; However, Sidwell (2015) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages. During the [[Iron Age]] about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as [[Vietic languages|Vietic]], [[Katuic languages|Katuic]], [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] were formed, while the more internally diverse [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"/&gt; By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.&lt;ref name="Sidwell2015"/&gt;

[[Roger Blench]] (2017)&lt;ref name="Blench2017"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2017. ''[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Blench.pdf Waterworld: lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in Austroasiatic]''. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern [[Indochina]] (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 B.C.), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P.&lt;ref name="Blench2017"/&gt; Hence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.&lt;ref name="Blench2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13340">{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}'''Psychological projection''' is a theory in [[psychology]] in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by [[denying]] their existence in themselves while [[Attribution (psychology)|attributing]] them to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates [[blame]] shifting. 

==Historical precursors==
A prominent precursor in the formulation of the projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Van A.|title=Feuerbach and the interpretation of religion|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521470498|pages=4|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Feuerbach_and_the_Interpretation_of_Reli.html?id=KdsKpZ6eJWMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotrupi|first=Caterina Nella|title=Northrop Frye and the poetics of process|year=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|isbn=978-0802081414|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] thinker to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Van A.|title=Feuerbach and the interpretation of religion|year=1997|publisher=University of cambridge|isbn= 978-0521586306|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackey|first=James patrick|title=The Critique of Theological Reason|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University press|isbn=978-0521169233|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=John K.|title=A Field Statement on the Anthropology of Religion|journal=Ejournalofpoliticalscience|year=1990|url=http://ejournalofpoliticalscience.org/anthrel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Babylonian Talmud]] (500 AD) notes the human tendency toward projection and warns against it: "Do not taunt your neighbour with the bleach you yourself drank."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Baba Metsiya 59b; Kiddushin 70a.|quote="And he who [continually] declares [others] unfit is [himself] unfit  and never speaks in praise [of people]. And Samuel said: All who defame others, with their own blemish they stigmatize [these others]."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic developments==
Projection ({{lang-de|Projektion}}) was conceptualised by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his letters to [[Wilhelm Fliess]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2005) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and further refined by [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Anna Freud]]. Freud considered that, in projection, thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one's own are dealt with by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;''Case Studies II'' p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; What the ego repudiates is [[splitting (psychology)|split off]] and placed in another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud would later come to believe that projection did not take place arbitrarily, but rather seized on and [[exaggerated]] an element that already existed on a small scale in the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp.&amp;nbsp;200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; (The related defence of [[projective identification]] differs from projection in that there the other person is expected to become identified with the [[Impulse (psychology)|impulse]] or desire projected outside,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1997) p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; so that the self maintains a connection with what is projected, in contrast to the total repudiation of projection proper.)&lt;ref&gt;Otto F. Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] saw the projection of good parts of the self as leading potentially to over-[[Idealisation and devaluation|idealisation]] of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Klein'' (1979) p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, it may be one's conscience that is projected, in an attempt to escape its control: a more benign version of this allows one to come to terms with outside authority.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wollheim, ''On the Emotions'' (1999) pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical examples ==

Projection tends to come to the fore in normal people at times of personal or political crisis&lt;ref&gt;Erik Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; but is more commonly found in the neurotic or [[psychotic]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'', p. 281n.&lt;/ref&gt; in personalities functioning at a primitive level as in [[narcissistic personality disorder]] or [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name =Gabbard2010&gt;Glen O. Gabbard, ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (London 2010) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] considered that the unacceptable parts of the personality represented by the [[Shadow (psychology)|Shadow]] archetype were particularly likely to give rise to projection, both small-scale and on a national/international basis.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) pp.&amp;nbsp;181–82.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie-Louise Von Franz]] extended her view of projection, stating that "wherever known reality stops, where we touch the unknown, there we project an [[archetype|archetypal]] image".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Patterns of Creativity Mirrored in Creation Myths (Seminar series) |publisher=Spring Publications |first=Marie-Louise von |last=Franz |year=September 1972 |isbn=978-0-88214-106-0}} ''found in'': {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=F23WJ8altDUC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=wherever+known+reality+stops,+where+we+touch+the+unknown,+there+we+project+an+archetypal+image |title=Archetypal explorations: an integrative approach to human behavior |publisher=Routledge |last=Gray |first=Richard M. |year=1996 |page=201 |isbn=978-0-415-12117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological projection is one of the [[medical explanations of bewitchment]] used to explain the behavior of the afflicted children at [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] in 1692. The historian [[John Demos]] asserts that the symptoms of bewitchment experienced by the afflicted girls were due to the girls undergoing psychological projection of repressed aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Demos |title=Underlying Themes in the Witchcraft of Seventeenth-Century New England |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |volume=75 |issue=5 |year=1970 |pages=1311–26 [p. 1322] |jstor=1844480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical examples ==

*'''[[Victim blaming]]:''' The victim of someone else's actions or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Projection of marital guilt:''' Thoughts of [[infidelity]] to a partner may be [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]] projected in self-defence on to the partner in question, so that the [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] attached to the thoughts can be repudiated or turned to [[blame]] instead, in a process linked to [[denial]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987) p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Bullying]]:''' A bully may project his/her own feelings of [[vulnerability]] onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal [[Emotional security|insecurity]] and/or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) pp.&amp;nbsp;185–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of [[interpersonal relationships]], all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"/&gt;
*'''Projection of general guilt:''' Projection of a severe conscience&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; is another form of defense, one which may be linked to the making of [[false accusations]], personal or political.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"/&gt;
*'''Projection of hope:''' Also, in a more positive light, a patient may sometimes project his or her feelings of [[hope]] onto the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counter-projection ==

Jung wrote, "All projections provoke counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject."&lt;ref&gt;''General Aspects of Dream Psychology,'' CW 8, par. 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual [[acting out]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Carl Gustav Jung'' (2001) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rather different usage, [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] saw counter-projection in the therapeutic context as a way of warding off the [[compulsive behavior|compulsive]] re-enactment of a [[psychological trauma]], by emphasizing the difference between the current situation and the projected [[fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with the perceived perpetrator of the original trauma.&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Anderson ed., ''Bodies in Treatment'' (2007) p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical approaches ==

Drawing on [[Gordon Allport]]'s idea of the expression of self onto activities and objects, projective techniques have been devised to aid personality assessment, including the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach]] ink-blots and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. |last=Semeonoff |chapter=Projective Techniques |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Gregory |title=The Oxford Companion to the Mind |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |page=646 |isbn=0-19-866124-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projection may help a fragile [[id, ego, and super-ego|ego]] reduce [[anxiety]], but at the cost of a certain [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], as in [[dissociative identity disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408692 Trauma and Projection] {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, an individual's personality may end up becoming critically depleted.&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge 2006) pp. 115, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, therapy may be required which would include the slow rebuilding of the personality through the "taking back" of such projections.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Jacoby, ''The Analytic Encounter'' (1984) pp. 10, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some studies were critical of Freud's theory. Research supports the existence of a [[false-consensus effect]] whereby humans have a broad tendency to believe that others are similar to themselves, and thus "project" their personal traits onto others. This applies to good traits as well as bad traits and is not a defense mechanism for denying the existence of the trait within the self.&lt;ref name="Empirical Findings"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumeister |first=Roy F. |last2=Dale |first2=Karen |last3=Sommer |first3=Kristin L. |title=Freudian Defense Mechanisms and Empirical Findings in Modern Social Psychology: Reaction Formation, Projection, Displacement, Undoing, Isolation, Sublimation, and Denial |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=66 |issue=6 |year=1998 |pages=1090–92 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Newman, Duff, and Baumeister (1997) proposed a new model of defensive projection. In this view, [[Psychological repression|repressors]] try to [[Thought suppression|suppress thoughts]] of their undesirable traits, and these efforts make those trait categories highly accessible—so that they are then used all the more often when forming impressions of others. The projection is then only a by-product of the real defensive mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A new look at defensive projection: Thought suppression, accessibility, and biased person perception |last=Newman |first=Leonard S. |last2=Duff |first2=Kimberley J. |last3=Baumeister |first3=Roy F. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=72 |issue=5 |year=1997 |pages=980–1001 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.5.980 |pmid=9150580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''querent''' (derived, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', from the Latin ''quærēns'' "seeking", the present participle of ''quærere'' "to seek, gain, ask") is "one who seeks".

''Querent'' became used to denote "a person who questions an [[oracle]]" because it is usually when one has a problem that requires otherworldly advice that one would seek out the oracle in the first place. This oracle may simply be a [[divination|divinatory]] technique, such as the ''[[I Ching]]'', that is manipulated by the querents themselves without recourse to any other human agency. Alternatively it may involve another person, someone perhaps seen as a "[[fortune teller]]" – particularly a practitioner of [[tarot]] reading or other form of [[mediumship]] – from whom advice is sought.&lt;ref name="Froud2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Froud |first1=Brian |title=Faeries' Oracle |date=2000 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743201117 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXKwHAjBaWYC&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=querent+oracle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DYvJ2MKxU5&amp;sig=ISHHQbnDlVjc1eYh8IsAyVkJyNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiB3Knx8tHcAhXBKH0KHVQxAUYQ6AEwDXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=querent&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kinds of questions asked by querents may vary widely according to their needs, and the methodology of the divination system. Some querents seek general advice trusting that they will be told what is most pertinent to their present situation. Others will ask questions that are only slightly more direct such as, "Will I be rich?" and "What kind of person will I marry?" Still others seek specific advice, although opinions are divided amongst practitioners of various divinatory arts as to what constitutes a 'good' question: some say that questions in the form of "What would be likely to happen if I followed course of action X?" are potentially more useful to a querent than "Should I follow course of action X?". Yes-and-no questions are not always best because of the finality they represent, and usually most querents are after far more than just yes and no.

The mindset of a querent plays a significant role in the development of a clear and dynamic reading. Those who approach a reading with heavy skepticism, especially if they are dealing with a human oracle, are often unwilling to engage the reader at all, which can result in a stifling of the prophetic flow that is so intrinsic to divination. Conversely, some approach with great respect, as if they predetermine that the Diviner or the system of divination is influence by some kind of higher, even divine, power and thereby will believe virtually anything they are told. A third ideal group will talk freely with a human oracle and accept their advice with a healthy dose of skepticism, yet still remain open-minded to the possibility of revelation.

These querent attitudes often stem from their personal beliefs concerning spirituality and the nature of the particular oracular system they are consulting. Common theories that inform these attitudes divide generally into three classes:
* The belief that the reading is influenced by [[synchronicity]], or some other system of coincident cause and effect, and can therefore show both personal and more general patterns.
* The belief that their own [[subconscious mind]] or [[higher self]] is somehow influencing the reading in order to pass them advice. These people often point to [[dream interpretation]] as a parallel resource.
* The belief that some external agency, such as deities, spiritual guides and ancestral spirits, will use the reading to advise them.

'''Simon Simonian''' ({{lang-hy|Սիմոն Սիմոնեան}}, {{OldStyleDate|24 March|1914|11 March}}, [[Ayntab]] - March 11, 1986, [[Beirut]]) was an [[Armenia]]n intellectual who founded the literary and social Armenian periodical ''[[Spurk]]'' (Սփիւռք in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]).

==Biography==
In 1921 his family, a survivor of the [[Armenian Genocide]] found refuge in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. From 1930 to 1935 Simonian studied at the [[Antelias]] seminary.&lt;ref&gt;S. Simonyan, Anjamandros, Yerevan. 1998. p. 535&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Aleppo, he taught Armenian language and history at the city's Haigazian and Gulbenkian schools until 1946. In that period he prepared his first textbooks for Armenian history and was a founder Aleppo's teachers' union. From 1936 he was the president of the Sasun Compatriotic Union.

Later on residing in Lebanon, Simonian became the secretary of Catholicos [[Karekin I (Cilicia)|Karekin I Hovsepian]]. He headed the main archive of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]], [[Lebanon]], and was responsible for the official Catholicossate publication ''Hask'' between 1947 and 1955. He taught literary Armenian and Armenian history at the catholicossate seminary and edited Karekin I's colossal work ''Hishadagarank Tserakrats'' (the indexation of manuscripts). He also taught Armenological materials at the Lebanese Armenian Hovagimian-Manoukian and Tarouhi Hagopian secondary schools.

Simonian authored many short stories and novels, as well as many textbooks on history and language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azg.am/AM/2016120925 Simon Simonian, Azg, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; He authored the ''Sevan Armenian dictionary''. In 1954 he visited Soviet Armenia, where he met the poet [[Silva Kaputikyan]].

He was also the director of "Sevan" printshop and publishing house, that he founded in 1957 where he printed about 600 books. Starting 1958, he also published his prominent weekly literary publication ''[[Spurk]]'' that continued to publish with Simonian as editor in chief until 1974. Between 1975 and 1989, Kevork Ajemian became the editor of the publication. He followed a strict non-partisan line in the civil political strife in the life of the Armenian diaspora communities in Lebanon and elsewhere.

==Personal life==
Simonian, born in [[Aintab]] was the elder son of Ove from [[Sasun]] and Manush from [[Ayntab]], was a survivor of the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;(Re)constructing Armenia in Lebanon and Syria: ethno-cultural diversity and the state in the aftermath of a refugee crisis, by Nicola Migliorino, 2008, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Survivors: An Oral History Of The Armenian Genocide, by Donald E. Miller, Lorna Touryan Miller, University of California Press, 1999, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Simonian married Mary Ajemian, a graduate of the American University of Beirut, a practicing nurse and the sister of the Armenian writer and intellectual Kevork Ajemian. The couple had five children; four sons, Hovig, Vartan, Daron and Sasoun and a daughter Maral.

'''Surzhyk''' ({{Lang-uk|су́ржик|translit=surzhyk}}, {{IPA-uk|ˈsurʒɪk|IPA}}) refers to a range of mixed ([[macaronic language|macaronic]]) [[sociolect]]s of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages used in certain regions of [[Ukraine]] and adjacent lands. There is no unifying set of characteristics; the term is used for "norm-breaking, non-obedience to or non-awareness of the rules of the Ukrainian and Russian standard languages".&lt;ref name="Surzhyk and National Identity "&gt;[http://www.oei.fu-berlin.de/media/publikationen/boi/boi_17/11_bernsand.pdf Surzhyk and national identity in Ukrainian nationalist language ideology (Niklas Bernsand in ''Berliner Osteuropa-Info, Vol. 17'' page 41, Freie Universität, Berlin)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Ukrainian word "surzhyk" originally meant flour or bread made from mixed grains, e.g. wheat with rye.

==Overview==
The vocabulary mix of each of its constituent languages (Ukrainian and Russian) varies greatly from locality to locality, or sometimes even from person to person, depending on the degree of [[education]], personal experience, rural or urban residence, the geographical origin of the interlocutors, etc. The percentage of Russian words and phonetic influences tends to be greatest in the east and south and in the vicinity of big Russian-speaking cities. It is commonly spoken in most of eastern Ukraine's rural areas, with the exception of the large metropolitan areas of [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Luhansk]], and especially [[Crimea]], where the majority of the population uses standard Russian. In rural areas of western Ukraine, the language spoken contains fewer Russian elements than in central and eastern Ukraine but has nonetheless been influenced by Russian.

The ancient common origin, and relatively recent divergence, of Russian and Ukrainian make it difficult to establish the degree of mixing in a vernacular of this sort.

==Prevalence==

[[File:SurzhykUseRu.PNG|thumb|350px|Prevalence of Surzhyk in the regions of Ukraine. Data by [[Kyiv International Institute of Sociology]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="Kyiv institute"&gt;[http://kiis.com.ua/materials/articles_HVE/16_linguaethnical.pdf Київський міжнародний інститут соціології]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to data presented by the [[Kyiv International Institute of Sociology]] in 2003, 11% to 18% of the people of Ukraine were found to communicate in Surzhyk. Specifically, in western Ukraine, Surzhyk is spoken by 2.5% of the population, while in the south, it is spoken by over 12.4% of the population. In the east, 9.6% of the population speaks Surzhyk. As [[Western Ukraine]] has a higher ratio of Ukrainian speakers to Russian speakers than the rest of Ukraine, the lesser proportion of Surzhyk speakers compared with the east and south is understandable.&lt;ref name="Kyiv institute"/&gt;

One problem in analysing the linguistic status of Ukraine is that there is a tendency for code-mixing errors to exist across the entire spectrum of languages. In other words, those who identify themselves as Russian-speaking or Ukrainian-speaking can often be found blending the two languages to some degree. Only a few of these individuals were found to acknowledge the incorrectness of the use of either or both languages, or the fact that they were actually blending Russian and Ukrainian in their speech at all.&lt;ref name="how do Ukrainians communicate"/&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Soviet era===
Surzhyk originated at the end of the 18th century, when Ukrainian peasants started to have greater contact with the Russian language as Ukrainian society modernized. Industrialization resulted in workers migrating from [[Central Russia]] to Ukrainian cities and the [[urbanization]] of the Ukrainian peasantry. Russian civil and military administration, together with cultural, business, religious and educational institutions, soon became forces of linguistic [[Russification]].&lt;ref name="Surzhyk and National Identity "/&gt; Ukrainian peasants moving to the cities regarded Russian as being more urban and prestigious than their own language. However, because their schooling in the Russian language was inadequate, most Ukrainian peasants who strived to speak it ended up blending it with their native Ukrainian; this was how Surzhyk was born.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"&gt;Bilaniuk Laada. ''Contested Tongues: Language Politics and Cultural Correction in Ukraine.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speaking of pure Ukrainian (i.e. a language without elements of Russian), was for the most part avoided by the urban [[intelligentsia]], because the Ukrainian language was associated with provincialism and nationalism.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt; At this point, the majority of Ukrainians found it easy to become competent in Russian. The association of the Ukrainian language with a rural lifestyle or narrow-minded nationalism encouraged more Ukrainians to adopt Russian as their language of choice.&lt;ref name="how do Ukrainians communicate"/&gt; Such decisions led to an increased prevalence of Surzhyk in everyday speech and the further dilution of the Ukrainian language.

In 1721, the Russian [[Tsar Peter I]] decreed that the publication of books in Ukraine, except for Russian-language religious works, would be prohibited, and Ukrainian books and records were to be burned. In 1786, it was decreed that services in the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] were to be conducted using only the Russian pronunciation of [[Old Church Slavonic]], and not the Ukrainian pronunciation. Decrees in 1863, 1876, and 1881 prohibited the publication and importation of Ukrainian books, as well as the public use of the Ukrainian language in general. The Russian regime of the day viewed the use of Ukrainian as evidence of political opposition and harshly suppressed it.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt;

The use of the Ukrainian language in theatre and music was also banned, and it had to be translated into other languages. Education in the Ukrainian language also suffered similarly, with ethnically Ukrainian teachers being replaced with ethnic Russians. In the early 1900s, children were punished for speaking Ukrainian to each other in school, and people sometimes lost their jobs for speaking it.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt;

[[Austria|Austrian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] rule in western Ukraine in the late 1700s and 1800s was also linguistically oppressive. For example, in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Zakarpattia]], Hungarian was the only language permitted by the regime, so Ukrainian was excluded from institutions like schools.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt; Even so, language policies here were not as restrictive as those applied in eastern Ukraine by the Tsarist regime of Russia.

===Soviet era===
In the 1920s, after Ukraine became a part of the [[Soviet Union]], the Ukrainian language saw a revival under the Soviet policy of ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' (nativisation), which supported the development of non-Russian languages. The purpose was to gain the support of those ethnic groups that had been oppressed by the Tsarist regime. Soviet government business in Ukraine was conducted in the Ukrainian language, with the aim of integrating the Ukrainian people into the new Soviet system.&lt;ref name="Soviet Ukrainian schools"&gt;Pauly, Matthew D. Teaching place, assembling the nation: local studies in Soviet Ukrainian schools during the 1920s. ''History of Education'' Vol. 39 No. 1. (2010) 75-93&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Ukrainianisation]] brought with it a significant advance in the development, standardisation, and codification of the Ukrainian language. Accompanying it was an increase in the number of Ukrainian-language publications, as well as theatre productions and schools in which Ukrainian was used.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt;

From the 1930s onwards, the Russian language exerted significant influence on Ukrainian, and the regime of [[Joseph Stalin]] began to actively suppress the Ukrainian language. Along with many of the other languages spoken in the Soviet Union, Ukrainian was viewed as a challenge to centralised power and the linguistic unification of the Soviet people. Terminology and wording that was similar or identical to Russian was emphasized in dictionaries, grammar books, and the official guidance issued to editors and publishers. This resulted in a generally more Russianised Ukrainian than had existed prior to the Soviet Union. After Ukraine became independent, this outcome would eventually generate disagreement regarding the question of what constitutes pure Ukrainian.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt;

Words and other Ukrainian-language speech forms that are similar to those of Russian were emphasised. In addition, many Russian words or terms replaced their Ukrainian equivalents and were then modified by Ukrainian grammar and phonetics. The following table contains a few examples of how the Ukrainian language was changed during the Soviet era.

Members of the cultural elite who promoted local languages were later purged from positions of authority during the reign of Stalin, as part of an effort to strengthen the cohesion of the Soviet Union and promote Russian as the official language of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt;

===Independence in the modern era===
After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Ukraine as a sovereign state, the Ukrainian language became a key issue in the nation's politics. Ukrainian became Ukraine’s sole official language, and therefore the ability to master it in speech became an important skill for politicians and other prominent figures. Many such individuals were speakers of Russian who began to use Ukrainian, but because they had not perfected it another form of Surzhyk emerged which clearly showed the effect of Russification on the Ukrainian language. Linguists began to engage in debates over the 'correct' way to speak Ukrainian, because the Soviet language policies had had a profound effect on the Ukrainian language. On the one hand, some linguists argue that Ukrainian should only use the forms that existed prior to the Soviet Union, while others argue that the current forms, which emerged from the Soviet language policy, are more up-to-date and more familiar to the Ukrainians of today, and would therefore be better at meeting contemporary needs.&lt;ref name="Surzhyk and National Identity "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Contested Tongues"/&gt;

==Ethnopolitical issues==
In [[Soviet era|Soviet times]], the usage of Ukrainian gradually decreased, particularly during those times when the [[Russification]] policies intensified (i.e. in the 1930s and during the late 1970s to early 1980s), and so a sizable portion of ethnic Ukrainians possess a better knowledge of formal Russian than they do formal Ukrainian.  Since 1991, however, Ukrainian has been the sole official language. After this change, it was realised that much of the population of Ukraine was actually unable to speak Ukrainian fluently. This was highly apparent in the case of many Ukrainian officials (including the President of Ukraine), who were observed to make code-mixing mistakes in their speech.&lt;ref name="how do Ukrainians communicate"&gt;Podolyan Ilona E. “How Do Ukrainians Communicate? Observations Based upon Youth Population of Kyiv”. ''Kyiv National Linguistic University, Ukraine.'' p. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prevalence of Surzhyk is greatest in the countryside. In the cities, people tend to speak purer forms of Ukrainian or Russian. This contrasts with the more rural inhabitants, who lack the prestige associated with the educational and technological advantages that people in the cities have. However, in spite of the differences that exist between the rural and urban varieties of the spoken language, many visitors find that they have trouble communicating with the local population of Ukraine when they follow guidebooks published abroad. This is because these books tend to focus on either pure Russian or pure Ukrainian and disregard the hybrid form.&lt;ref name="how do Ukrainians communicate"/&gt;

The speaking of Surzhyk instead of Russian or Ukrainian is viewed negatively by nationalist language activists. Because it is neither the one nor the other, they regard Surzhyk as a threat to the uniqueness of Ukrainian culture.&lt;ref name="Surzhyk and National Identity "/&gt;

==Literature==
[[Nikolai Gogol]] used the language extensively in his [[short story]] collection ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]''. Surzhyk has been an object of parody in Ukrainian literature since the very emergence of the Ukrainian language. For example, in the 1798 poem ''Eneyida'', written by [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]] and based on the Roman poem known as the ''[[Aeneid]]'', for satirical purposes the character "Filozop" speaks Surzhyk while standing over the dead [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]].&lt;ref name="Mova i yazyk"&gt;Масенко, Лариса. Суржик: між Мовою і Язиком. Києво-Могилянська Академія, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Surzhyk is often also used for comic effect in the arts. Examples include the short plays of [[Les Poderviansky]], and the repertoire of the pop star [[Verka Serdyuchka]]. The punk-rock group [[Braty Hadyukiny]] (literally "Brothers [[Viper|Viperids"]]) sings many of its songs in Surzhyk, often to underscore the rural simplicity of its songs' protagonists.

The '''Utopian language''' is the language of the [[fictional country|fictional land]] of Utopia, as described in [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''. A brief sample of the [[constructed language]] is found in an addendum to More's book, written by his friend [[Pieter Gillis|Peter Giles]]. Pretending to be factual, the book does not name the creator of the language; both More and Giles have been alternately credited, with Giles often thought to have designed the alphabet.

==Grammar==
Although some words in Utopian show different forms corresponding to different cases in the Latin translation, there is no evidence of a consistent relationship between form and meaning, as can be seen from the following comparison of the nominal, pronominal, and adjectival case forms:

{|class=wikitable
! !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || Vtopos, Boccas, bargol, he&lt;br&gt;''Ūtopus, dux, ūna, ego'' ||
|-
| Accusative || hā, chamāan, āgrama, gymnosophon&lt;br&gt;''mē, insulam, civitātem, philosophicam'' || heman, paglōni&lt;br&gt;''mea, meliōra''
|-
| Ablative || chama, gymnosophāon&lt;br&gt;''insulā, philosophiā'' ||
|-
| Dative || || bōdamilōmin&lt;br&gt;''mortālibus''
|-
| Genitive || || māglōmi, baccan&lt;br&gt;''terrārum, omnium''
|}

There are only four verbs in the Utopian poem, and these also show no evidence of a correspondence between form and function:

{|class=wikitable
! !! 1st person !! 3rd person
|-
| Present || barchin, dramme&lt;br&gt;''impartiō, accipiō'' ||
|-
| Perfect || labarembacha&lt;br&gt;''expressī'' || polta&lt;br&gt;''fēcit''
|}

==Writing system==
[[File:Utopia, More, 1518 - 0016.jpg|thumb|The Utopian quatrain and its Latin translation in the 1518 edition of ''Utopia''.]]
Utopian has its own 22-letter alphabet, with letters based on the shapes of the circle, square, and triangle.&lt;ref name="Basel"&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/nav_button.cgi?pfad=/diglib/more/utopia/jpeg/&amp;seite=00000008.jpg&amp;max=182 Page 13] of the Basel 1518 edition of ''Utopia''.&lt;/ref&gt; These correspond almost exactly to the 23-letter Roman alphabet used in the 16th century, lacking only ''z''. The letters f, k, q, and x only appear in the alphabet, not in the Utopian text.

==Examples==
The only extant text in Utopian is a quatrain written by Peter Giles in an addendum to ''Utopia'':
:''Vtopos ha Boccas peu la chama polta chamaan.&lt;br&gt;Bargol he maglomi baccan ſoma gymno ſophaon.&lt;br&gt;Agrama gymnoſophon labarembacha bodamilomin.&lt;br&gt;Voluala barchin heman la lauoluola dramme pagloni.''&lt;ref&gt;Word divisions are taken from the 1st edition of 1516.[http://theopenutopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/utopian-alphabet.jpg] The 2nd edition of 1518 merges ''peu'' and ''la'' together as well as ''gymno'' and ''sophaon'' (in the latter case certainly correctly); it also separates ''labarembacha'' into ''labarem'' and ''bacha''. The text in Utopian letters in the 1516 edition writes ''cama'', ''camaan'', and ''pafloni'' in place of ''chama'', ''chamaan'', and ''pagloni''. These discrepancies were corrected in the 1518 edition; however, new errors were introduced, e.g. ''utoqos'' for ''utopos'' and ''spma'' for ''soma''.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is translated literally into Latin as:
:''Utopus me dux ex non insula fecit insulam.&lt;br&gt;Una ego terrarum omnium absque philosophia&lt;br&gt;Civitatem philosophicam expressi mortalibus&lt;br&gt;Libenter impartio mea, non gravatim accipio meliora.''&lt;ref&gt;Copied from [http://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/diglib/more/utopia/] (page 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

This, in turn, is translated into English as follows:
:The commander Utopus made me into an island out of a non-island.&lt;br&gt;I alone of all nations, without philosophy, &lt;br&gt;have portrayed for mortals the philosophical city. &lt;br&gt;Freely I impart my benefits; not unwillingly I accept whatever is better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=More|first=Thomas|editor=George M. Logan and Robert M. Adams (eds.)|others=Raymond Geuss and Quentin Skinner (series eds.)|title=Utopia|edition=Revised|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-81925-3 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Robinson, a 16th-century translator, rendered the passage into English as follows:
:My king and conqueror Utopus by name
:A prince of much renown and immortal fame
:Hath made me an isle that erst no island was
:Full fraught with worldly wealth, with pleasure, and solace.
:I one of all other without philosophy
:Have shaped for man a philosophical city.
:As mine I am nothing dangerous to impart,
:So better to receive I am ready with all my heart. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uuFLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed with these translations, it is possible to deduce the following vocabulary:
:{| class="wikitable"
|+ Vocabulary of the Utopian Language
! Utopian !! Latin !! English
|-
|''agrama'' || civitatem || city (accusative; ''cf.'' [[Sanskrit]] ''grāmam'', village)
|-

|-
|''soma'' || absque || without
|-
|''voluala'' || libenter || freely, willingly
|-
|''Vtopos'' || Utopus || Utopus (mythical founder of Utopia)
|-
|}

In accordance with 16th-century typographical custom, the letters v and u marked a distinction in position, not sound; v was used at the beginnings of words and u elsewhere, but the same letters could represent the sounds of either u or v. Analysis of the metre of the verse shows, however, that the reader was expected to read Vtopos as ''Utopos'', voluala as ''volvala'', and lauoluola as ''lavolvola''.

More's text also contains Utopian "native" terms for Utopian concepts.

This article covers the '''phonology of the Uyghur language'''.  [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Turkic language]] spoken primarily in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] features both [[vowel harmony]] and some vowel reduction also plays a role.

==Vowels==

Uyghur vowels are by default [[short vowel|short]], but some phonologists{{Who|date=August 2009}} have argued that long vowels also exist because of historical vowel [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] (above) and through loanwords.  Underlyingly long vowels would resist vowel reduction and [[devoicing]], introduce non-final stress, and be analyzed as |Vj| or |Vr| before a few suffixes. However, the conditions in which they are actually pronounced as distinct from their short counterparts have not been fully researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1998|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official Uyghur orthographies do not mark vowel length, and also do not distinguish between {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (e.g., بىلىم {{IPA|/bɪlɪm/}} 'knowledge') and back {{IPAslink|ɯ}} (e.g., تىلىم {{IPA|/tɯlɯm/}} 'my language'); these two sounds are in [[Complementary distribution#In phonology|complementary distribution]], but phonological analyses claim that they play a role in vowel harmony and are separate phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[high vowel]]s {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/ʏ/}} are devoiced in non-stressed positions when they occur between two [[voiceless consonant]]s, or in word-initial position before a voiceless consonant: e.g. ''uka'' {{IPA|[ʊ̥kɑ]}} 'older brother', ''pütün'' {{IPA|[pʏ̥tʏn]}} 'entire', ''ikki'' {{IPA|[ɪ̥kkɪ]}}.

{{IPA|/e/}} only occurs in words of non-Turkic origin and as the result of vowel raising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaux|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowel reduction===
Uyghur has two processes of systematic [[vowel reduction]] (or vowel raising):
# [[unrounded vowel|Unrounded]] non-high [[vowel]]s ({{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/æ/}}) in initial [[open syllable]]s followed by {{IPA|/ɪ/}} are changed to {{IPA|/e/}}.
# Unrounded [[vowel]]s in other non-final open [[syllable]]s are changed to {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.
The former process is applied before the latter; As with other phenomena, long vowels are exempt.  For example:
: {{IPA|/ɑl + ɪŋ/}} → {{IPA|/elɪŋ/}} (cf. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''alın'') 'take!'
: {{IPA|/ɑtɑ + lɑr + ɪmɪz/}} → {{IPA|/ɑtɪlɪrɪmɪz/}} (cf. Turkish ''atalarımız'') 'our fathers' (not *{{IPA|[etɪlɪrɪmɪz]}} in Uyghur because reduction to {{IPA|/e/}} can only be applied before reduction to {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in a word)
: {{IPA|/ɑt + ɪm/}} → {{IPA|/etɪm/}} (cf. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''atım'') 'my horse')
: {{IPA|/pæːr + ɪm/}} → {{IPA|/pæ(ː)rɪm/}} 'my feather' (in some loanwords, vowel raising does not occur)

===Vowel harmony===
Uyghur, like other Turkic languages, displays vowel harmony. Words usually agree in vowel backness, but compounds, loans, and some other exceptions often break vowel harmony. Suffixes surface with the rightmost [back] value in the stem, and /e, ɪ/ are transparent (as they don't contrast for backness). Uyghur also has rounding harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaux|2001|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur voiceless stops are aspirated word-initially and intervocalically.&lt;ref name="Hahn.1991.89"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pairs {{IPA|/p, b/}}, {{IPA|/t, d/}}, {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}}, and {{IPA|/q, ʁ/}} alternate, with the voiced member devoicing in syllable-final position, except in word-initial syllables. This devoicing process is usually reflected in the official orthography, but an exception has been recently made for certain Perso-Arabic loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voiceless phonemes do not become voiced in standard Uyghur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffixes display a slightly different type of consonant alternation. The phonemes {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} anywhere in a suffix alternate as governed by [[Uyghur language#Vowel harmony|vowel harmony]], where {{IPA|/ɡ/}} occurs with front vowels and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} with back ones.  Devoicing of a suffix-initial consonant can occur only in the cases of {{IPA|/d/}} → {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} → {{IPA|[k]}}, and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} → {{IPA|[q]}}, when the preceding consonant is voiceless. Lastly, the rule that {{IPA|/ɡ/}} must occur with front vowels and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} with back vowels can be broken when either {{IPA|[k]}} or {{IPA|[q]}} in suffix-initial position becomes assimilated by the other due to the preceding consonant being such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=80–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Examples: qoyda, müshükte, atta, qoygha, müshükke, atqa, sözlik, karliq, xaltagha, xelqqe --&gt;

Stops and affricates [[lenition|lenite]] when preceding a dissimilar consonant. {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} goes to {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} to {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, {{IPA|/k/}} to {{IPA|[ç]}}, and {{IPA|/q/}} to {{IPA|[χ]}}. {{IPA|/ɡ/}} goes to {{IPA|/ɣ/}} in word-initial syllables, but in non-initial syllables, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} behave like their unvoiced equivalents and go to {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[χ]}} respectively.&lt;ref name="Hahn.1991.89" /&gt; These changes are not reflected in orthography, except when {{IPA|/b/}} lenites to {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[w]}} as &lt;w&gt;. Similarly, {{IPA|/h/}} tends to become {{IPA|[χ]}} before another consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenition also occurs in certain intervocalic contexts, e.g. {{IPA|/b/}} lenites to {{IPA|[β]}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} as {{IPA|[ɣ]}} (not marked).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uyghur displays [[vowel|vocalic]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], atypical among Turkic languages. Syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}} are optionally assimilated to the preceding vowel which is lengthened, in the case of e and u, made lower and less tense; e.g., ''xelqler'' {{IPA|[xæːqlæː]}} ‘the nations’.  However, this never occurs when {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} are word final. This phenomenon occurs most common in colloquial speech, but is often avoided when reciting, reading, or singing. As a result, Uyghur speakers often [[hypercorrection|hypercorrect]] by inserting an {{IPA|[r]}} after a long vowel where there is no phonemic {{IPA|/r/}}, especially after attaching a vowel-initial suffix (e.g. ''bina'' 'building', ''binarim'' or ''binayim'' 'my building'). In addition, although this is not represented orthographically, a few cases of "r-deletion" have been lexicalized, such as تۆت ''töt'' ('four').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loan phonemes have influenced Uyghur to various degrees. {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}} were borrowed from Arabic and have been nativized, while {{IPA|/ʒ/}} from Persian less so. {{IPA|/f/}} only exists in very recent Russian and Chinese loans, since Perso-Arabic (and older Russian and Chinese) {{IPA|/f/}} became Uyghur {{IPA|/p/}}. Perso-Arabic loans have also made the contrast between {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/q, ʁ/}} phonemic, as they occur as allophones in native words, the former set near front vowels and the latter near a back vowels. Some speakers of Uyghur distinguish {{IPA|/v/}} from {{IPA|/w/}} in Russian loans, but this is not represented in most orthographies. Other phonemes occur natively only in limited contexts, i.e. {{IPA|/h/}} only in few interjections, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and {{IPA|/ʁ/}} rarely initially, and {{IPA|/z/}} only morpheme-final. Therefore, the pairs *{{IPA|/t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ/}}, *{{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}, and *{{IPA|/s, z/}} do not alternate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1998|pp=381–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=59–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonotactics==
The primary [[syllable|syllable structure]] of Uyghur is CV(C)(C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=uig Ethnologue: Uyghur]&lt;/ref&gt; Uyghur syllable structure is usually CV or CVC, but CVCC can also occur in some words. When syllable-coda clusters occur, CC tends to become CVC in some speakers especially if the first consonant is not a [[sonorant]].  In Uyghur, any consonant phoneme can occur as the syllable [[Syllable onset|onset]] or [[Syllable coda|coda]], except for {{IPA|/ʔ/}} which only occurs in the onset and {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, which never occurs word-initially. In general, Uyghur [[phonology]] tends to simplify [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[consonant]] clusters by means of [[elision]] and [[epenthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hahn|1991|pp=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
