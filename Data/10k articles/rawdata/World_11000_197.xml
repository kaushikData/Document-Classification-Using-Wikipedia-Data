In the late sixth century, '''[[Sassanid Empire]]''' of Persia and the [[Ethiopia]]-based '''[[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Empire]]''' fought a series of wars over control of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in [[Yemen]], [[Southern Arabia]]. After the [[Battle of Hadhramaut]] and the [[Siege of Sana'a]] in 570, the Aksumites were expelled from the [[Arabian peninsula]]. They had re-established their power there by 575 or 578, when another Persian army [[Sassanid reconquest of Yemen|invaded Yemen]] and re-established the deposed king on his throne as their client. It marked the end of Ethiopian rule in Arabia.

The '''Blonde d'Aquitaine''' is a modern French [[list of cattle breeds|breed]] of large domestic [[beef cattle]]. It was created in 1962 by merging three blonde [[draught animal|draught]] breeds of south-western France, the Blonde des Pyrénées, the Blonde de Quercy and the Garonnaise.{{r|dad|marie|page2=129}} Since about 1970 it has been [[selectively bred]] specifically for beef production. It is the third-most numerous beef breed of France, after the [[Charolais (cattle)|Charolais]] and the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin]]. It has been exported to many countries round the world.

== History ==

The Blonde d'Aquitaine breed was created in 1962 by merging three blonde breeds of south-western France, the Blonde de Quercy, the Garonnaise and the Blonde des Pyrénées.{{r|dad|marie|page2=129}} All three were principally [[draught animal|draught]] breeds from the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin cattle]]. The Garonnaise had been numerous in [[Aquitaine]] – 400 000 head were recorded in 1880; a [[herd-book]] was started in 1898. The Blonde des Pyrénées was itself an amalgam of several other breeds, including the [[Béarnaise (cattle)|Béarnaise]], the Race d'Urt, and the Basquiaise;{{r|cabi|page=125|marie|page2=207}} its herd-book was started in 1920, the same year as that of the Blonde de Quercy.{{r|marie|page=130}}

The Blonde d'Aquitaine includes almost all the traditional blonde cattle breeds of southern France, although remnant populations of a few of them have allowed them to be reconstituted. The moving force behind the creation of the breed was Raphaël Trémouille, a [[veterinary surgeon]] and member of the lower chamber of the French parliament.{{r|marie|page=130}} From about 1970, concerted efforts were made to improve the beef production attributes of the breed.{{r|cabi|page=132}}

The Blonde d'Aquitaine is the third beef breed of France by numbers, after the [[Charolais (cattle)|Charolais]] and the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin]]. In 2013 there were about 560 000 head in more than 18 000 farms.{{r|cabi|page=132}} The Blonde d'Aquitaine has been exported to many countries of the world, including all countries of the [[European Union]]. It is much used for [[cross-breeding]] in Oceania and in Eastern Europe, and has shown particular promise when crossed with [[zebuine cattle]] breeds in South America.{{r|marie|page=131}}

== Characteristics ==

The Blonde d'Aquitaine is wheat- or cream-coloured, varying from a dark to very light fawn;{{r|cabi|page=132}} the surround of the eyes and the area round the muzzle is paler.{{r|marie|page=132}} The skin is white, and the muzzle and mucous areas pale.{{r|brg}}

== Use ==

The Blonde d'Aquitaine is raised exclusively for beef, whether purebred or cross-bred. Bullocks reach almost {{nobreak|300 kg}} at 210 days, and about {{nobreak|500 kg}} at 15 months. Carcass yield is about {{nobreak|65%.}}{{r|marie|page=132}}

'''Canal+''' was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[satellite broadcasting]] platform. It was previously known as '''Digital+''' since its launch in 2003, and recently since 2011 as '''Canal+''', being named after its main premium channel.

Formed on July 23, 2003 as a result of the equal merger of Via Digital (owned by [[Telefónica]]) and ''Canal Satélite Digital'' (owned by [[PRISA TV|Sociedad de Television Canal Plus, S.A.]]), it was the largest [[Pay television|pay-TV]] broadcaster in Spain.

The company used to be a subdivision of [[PRISA TV]] with shares held by [[Mediaset España Comunicación|Mediaset Espana]] and [[Telefónica]]. In October 2011, Digital+ changed its name to '''Canal+'''.

==History==

===Merging to Vía Digital===

Before the creation of Digital+, there were two pay-TV companies in Spain: Vía Digital, owned by [[Telefónica]] and which operated through [[Hispasat]], and Canal Satélite Digital, property of Prisa TV, which used [[SES S.A.|Astra]] for their services.

The economic loss of both them in the early years and Telefónica’s none investment in its division motivated the fusion process between them for merging, apart from the government. The process finished on May 8, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2002/05/09/comunica/1141146.html Polanco logra que Alierta le dé el monopolio de la TV de pago] ''El Mundo'', 9 de mayo de 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement closed the acquisition of Vía Digital by Prisa TV, carrying out a capital increase in 23% for Vía Digital shareholders. The resultant company would take in 2.5 million subscribers.

However, the agreement was subject to CNMC intervention. After several months of consideration, on August 28, 2002 CNMC published a report in which the organization recognized that the existence of both satellite companies was unviable, but it warned of fusion’s danger to free competition, in markets like movies and sports broadcasting, as well as in pay-TV channels production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2002/08/29/espana/1216621.html Demoledor informe contra la fusión digital de la Comisión del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones] ''El Mundo'', 29 de agosto de 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, CNMC Defense Court sent the definitive report to the government, containing 10 conditions, including PPV’s cession to cable companies, and limitations in football clubs rights contracts renewals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2002/11/14/espana/1271151.html Competencia autoriza la fusión con condiciones cómodas para Polanco] ''El Mundo'', 14 de noviembre de 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, on November 29, Ministers Council approved the fusion, with an increase to 34 conditions (24 more ones than CNMC requested).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2002/11/30/espana/1283418.html El Gobierno entrega a Polanco la TV de pago con condiciones fáciles de aceptar] ''El Mundo'', 30 de noviembre de 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

These requirements didn’t satisfy anyone: companies involved in integration of the two companies (Prisa TV, Vía Digital and Telefónica) as well as affected business because of it, such as [[Telecinco]], Mediapark (Teuve), cable companies joined in [[ONO (Spain)|ONO]] and AOC throughout Auna had brought administrative appeals before [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mundoplus.tv/noticias.php?seccion=tv_digital&amp;id=5903 Mediapark, accionista de Vía Digital, también recurre el acuerdo de fusión] ''Mundoplus'', febrero de 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though, the merger followed its process and on July 21, 2003 the new resultant pay-TV company was born in Astra and Hispasat: Digital+. But business’ creation was controversial, because of cable companies and private TV channels that stated some of the conditions weren’t achieved, like increasing packages prices instead of maintaining them as it should have, or not fulfilling 20% of independent production companies’ contents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2003/07/22/comunicacion/1443105.html Digital Plus comienza a emitir incumpliendo al menos cinco condiciones del Gobierno] ''El Mundo'' 22 de julio de 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital+ broadcasting started encrypted in security system which Canal Satélite Digital and Vía Digital used to operate through. The first one, in Astra using SECA Mediaguard, currently in its second version. The second one, in [[Nagravision|Nagravisión]], in its third version since December 4, 2007.

===Strategy changes===

On February 1, 2008 Digital+ started broadcasting in [[high-definition television|high definition]] with Canal+ HD launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eslatele.com/2008/01/nace-canal-hd-la-primera-cadena-de-alta-definicion.html Nace Canal + HD, la primera cadena de alta definición] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130182814/http://eslatele.com/2008/01/nace-canal-hd-la-primera-cadena-de-alta-definicion.html# |date=2013-01-30 }} ''EsLaTele'', 29 de enero de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It initially would offer repeated HD contents from Canal+, but since December 9, 2008 transmitted the same programming of Canal+ in [[simulcast]], offering in HD all contents that were available to broadcast in this quality. Canal+ Deportes HD and Canal+ DCine HD were launched that day too.

In September 2008, Prisa published on its newspaper [[El País]] that the business had received several offers to buy its pay-TV company, as a part of a corporate reorganization Prisa planned to make. Among the business interested in buying out Digital+, there were [[Telefónica]], [[Vivendi]], [[Telecinco]], [[British Sky Broadcasting]] and [[ONO (Spain)|ONO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/Aumentan/ofertas/comprar/Digital/elpepieco/20080918elpepieco_17/Tes Elpais.com sobre la venta de Digital+]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2009 the group presented its new channel called [[Canal+ Liga]], direct opponent to [[Mediapro]] football channel [[Gol Televisión]] and that would include the same matches as this one. Among these ones, three of them would be from Primera División, always one with [[Real Madrid]] or [[FC Barcelona]] as a player, two from Segunda División, other two from every Copa del Rey season, as well as exclusively [[UEFA Europa League]] encrypted matches. The channel launched on August 29, 2009 with a HD simulcast.

In November 2009, [[Telefónica]] acquired Digital+’s 22% with a 240 million euros payment, moreover the debt repayment Prisa owed to give to Telefónica, which was worth in 230 million. The total cost of the operation was 470 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/telecomunicaciones-tecnologia/noticias/1725360/11/09/Telefonica-adquiere-el-21-de-Digital-por-470-millones-de-euros.html Elconomista.com - "Telefónica adquiere el 21% de Digital+ por 470 millones de euros"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, in December, [[Telecinco]] bought another 22%, as a part of fusion operation of this channel with Prisa’s TV channel Cuatro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elconfidencial.com/comunicacion/telecinco-prisa-anuncian-acuerdo-primera-tarde-20091218.html Telecinco compra Cuatro y el 22% de Digital Plus a Prisa]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the telecommunications operator [[Jazztel]] stopped commercializing its own pay-per-view services on television, to focus its audiovisual offer in agreements and Internet television services. The company signed in the beginning of May an agreement with Digital+ for being able to be commercialized with its telecom offer.

===New naming===

On October 17, 2011 Digital+ was rebranded as Canal+. Consequently, the premium channel known as Canal+ transformed in Canal+ 1. This change also affected Festival de Series de Digital+, which would be from then Festival de Series de Canal+, and later, Canal+ Series.

===Canal+ sale and transformation to Movistar+===

In 2013, even though they had previously happened during 2008,&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=La negociación de venta Digital+ empezará pronto, según fuentes|url=http://es.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idESTIS83478820080908|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; some negotiations about Canal+ sale appeared again. These ones would be more real because of the hurry banks had to solve [[Prisa]]'s debt to them.&lt;ref name="Prisa debt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Telefónica negocia la compra de Canal+ a Prisa para salvarla de los bancos|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2013-02-07/telefonica-negocia-la-compra-de-digital-a-prisa-para-salvarla-de-los-bancos_417270/|work=El Confidencial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Prisa accepted [[Telefónica]]'s offer to own Canal+.&lt;ref name="offer accepted"&gt;{{cite news|title=PRISA firma la venta del 56% de Canal+ a Telefónica por 750 millones|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2014/06/02/actualidad/1401722938_860022.html|work=El País}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, [[Mediaset España]] would sell its share to Telefónica so it could obtain the 100% of the company.&lt;ref name="Mediaset share sale"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mediaset acepta la oferta de Telefónica por su 22% de Canal+, según medios|url=http://www.reuters.es/article/businessNews/idESKBN0F815U20140703|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July  2015, Telefónica launched [[Movistar+]], a new platform as a result of the merger of Canal+ and [[Movistar TV]] which involved changes in the packages and new channels like Canal+ Estrenos, which broadcast the newest films, or Canal+ Series Xtra, which had alternative and European shows. [[Canal+ 1]] disappeared and traditionally named Canal+ was back, although it would not contain premium programming such as premieres of movies, American cable TV series and the exclusive Sunday football match. They all would be transferred to other Canal+ family channels.

==Coverage==

Canal+ offers its services through [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellites (at [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]]) and [[Hispasat]] (30° west).

==HbbTv==
Canal+ is a supporter of the [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has run pilot HbbTV services in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;David Del Valle.

'''Daman and Diu''' {{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|m|ɑː|n|...|'|d|iː|uː}} ({{audio|Daman &amp; Diu.ogg|locally}}) is a [[union territory]] in [[Western India]]. With an area of 112&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is the smallest federal division of [[India]] on the mainland. The territory comprises two distinct regions—[[Daman District, India|Daman]] and [[Diu District|Diu]]—that are geographically separated by the [[Gulf of Khambhat]]. The state of [[Gujarat]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] border the territory. A [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] colony since the 1500s, the territories were [[Annexation of Goa|annexed]] by India in 1961.

== History ==
[[File:Eglise St Paul.jpg|thumb|left|200px|St. Paul's Church in [[Diu, India|Diu]]]]

For over 450 years, the coastal enclaves of Daman ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Damão) and Diu on the Arabian Sea coast were part of [[Portuguese India]], along with [[Goa]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. [[Goa, Daman and Diu]] were incorporated into the Republic of India on December 19, 1961, by [[Operation Vijay (1961)|military conquest]]. [[Portugal]] did not recognise the Indian annexation of these territories until the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974.

The territory of Goa, Daman and Diu was administered as a single union territory until 1987, when Goa was granted statehood, leaving Daman and Diu as a separate union territory. Each enclave constitutes one of the union territory's two [[district]]s. Daman and Diu are approximately 650 kilometres away from each other by road.

== Demographics ==

===Literacy===
According to the 2011 census, Daman and Diu has a literacy rate of 87.1%, higher than the national average of 74.04%.&lt;ref&gt;census 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Male and female literacy rates are 91.5 and 79.5 percent respectively.

{{bar percent|Female|pink|79.5}}
{{bar percent|Total|grey|87.1}}
}}

===Sex ratio===
According to the 2011 census, the lowest female-to-male ratio in India (618 females per thousand males) was recorded in Daman and Diu.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Data_Products/Library/Provisional_Population_Total_link/PDF_Links/chapter3.pdf |title=Ranking of States and Union territories by population size : 1991 and 2001 |work=Government of India (2001) |publisher=Census of India |pages=5–6 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daman district, with a female-to-male ratio of .533, is among the lowest of all the districts.

===Religion===
Hinduism is by far the most common religion in Daman and Diu. Muslims are the second-largest religious group in the territory, followed by Christians.

The Catholic Christians of Daman and Diu are pastorally served by the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman]], which has its see in Goa, the [[primate (bishop)|primatial see]] of India.

===Languages===
[[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] is the mother tongue of most of the territory’s population, as they belong to the Gujarati-speaking [[Damaniya]] sub-caste. Along with Gujarati, [[Hindi]] and [[English language|English]] are all official languages. Hindi and English are official languages because they are official languages of India’s central government. Daman and Diu were once part of a combined union territory along with [[Goa]] (a Konkani-speaking region), before Goa became a state in 1987.

The use of Portuguese, which was the territory’s official language during the colonial period, is in decline and relegated to home use.

{{Politics of the European Union}}

The '''Directorate-General for Legal Service''' is a [[Directorate-General]] of the [[European Commission]].

The Legal Service provides comprehensive in-house assistance to the European Commission and all its departments. Its resources have to be deployed to cover all Commission activities and areas of responsibility. In each area, it must be able to assist the Commission in its functions of drafting legislation and conducting international negotiations, as guardian of the treaties and in the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on it by the Community legislator or by the Treaties.

The service is responsible for ensuring all proposals made have a legal basis, if it finds a technical fault in any proposal then the proposal must be modified or dropped. The legal service may only be overruled by the College of Commissionners. As the service is under the [[President of the European Commission|President's]] remit, some argue it can be useful in allowing the President a way of sinking undesirable proposals from his colleagues as there is usually some technicality the service can raise - although they have been challenged in the [[European Court of Justice]] with some minimal success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Eppink | first = Derk-Jan | authorlink = Derk Jan Eppink |  others=Ian Connerty (trans.) | title = Life of a European Mandarin: Inside the Commission | publisher = Lannoo | edition = 1st | location = Tielt, Belgium | date = 2007 | pages = 220–1 | isbn = 978-90-209-7022-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drought in India''' has resulted in tens of millions of deaths over the course of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. [[India]]n [[agriculture in India|agriculture]] is heavily dependent on the [[climate of India]]: a favorable southwest summer [[monsoon]] is critical in securing water for irrigating Indian crops. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons result in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern [[Maharashtra]] northern [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Gujarat]], [[Telangana]] and [[Rajasthan]].

== History ==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
In the past, droughts have periodically led to [[famine in India|major Indian famine]]s, including the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876&amp;ndash;1877 famine, in which over five million people died; and the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5&amp;nbsp;million died.&lt;ref name="Nash_2002_22-23"&gt;{{harvnb|Nash|2002|pp=22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collier_2002_67"&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|Webb|2002|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of El Niño ==

All such episodes of severe drought correlate with [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) events.&lt;ref name="Kumar_2006"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Kumar KK |author2=Rajagopalan B |author3=Hoerling M. |author4=Bates G |author5=Cane M |title=Unraveling the Mystery of Indian Monsoon Failure During El Niño |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5796 |pages=115–119 |year=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1131152 |pmid=16959975 |postscript=.|bibcode = 2006Sci...314..115K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caviedes_2001_121"&gt;{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Niño-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output.&lt;ref name="Caviedes_2001_259"&gt;{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=259}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C (5&amp;nbsp;°F)—have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Nash_2002_258-259"&gt;{{harvnb|Nash|2002|pp=258–259}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence center forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts.&lt;ref name="Caviedes_2001_117"&gt;{{harvnb|Caviedes|2001|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent that an ENSO event raises [[sea surface temperature]]s in the central [[Pacific Ocean]] influences the degree of drought.&lt;ref name="Kumar_2006"/&gt; Around 43 per cent of El Niño events are followed by drought in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/preparing-for-a-poor-monsoon/article5948470.ece | title=Preparing for a poor monsoon | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georgian International Airlines''' was an [[airline]] based in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

== History ==
Georgian International Airlines was founded as ''EuroLine'' in June 2004 and launched operations later that year. In February 2010, the EuroLine board of directors held a meeting in which they decided to re-brand to ''Georgian International Airlines'' with a new logo, name and livery. The move was to help the airline expand its operations network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avia24.com/m1/en/company/georgian_international About Georgian International Airlines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebranded Georgian International Airlines planned to start flight operations in August 2013.&lt;ref name="ops"/&gt; According to its website, the airline planned to implement direct flights to [[Islamabad]], [[Moscow]], [[Cologne]], [[Tehran]] and [[Baghdad]]{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} using 4 [[Fokker 100]] and 2 [[Boeing 737-400]].&lt;ref name="ops"&gt;http://ch-aviation.com/portal/news/20570-georgian-international-airlines-eyes-two-737-400s-more-fokker-100s&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of late October 2013, the airline had yet to take possession of any aircraft while also thinking about buying a used [[Boeing 767-300ER]] for long-haul flights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ch-aviation.ch/portal/news/22606-georgian-international-looking-to-acquire-a-used-b767-300er&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2014, the airline still hadn't started operations and announced plans to acquire an [[Airbus A320-200]] formerly operated by [[Mexicana de Aviación]].&lt;ref name="news2014"&gt;http://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/25137-georgian-international-to-acquire-an-ex-mexicana-a320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet==
As of January 2014, the Georgian International Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft:&lt;ref name="news2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1142">'''Gull-Þóris saga''' ({{Audio|Is-Gull-Þóris saga.oga|listen}}) is one of the [[sagas of Icelanders]]. It tells the story of Gull-Þórir ('Gold-Thorir') Oddsson, a chieftain in [[Þorskafjörður]], and his dispute with Hallr his neighbour.

Þórir comes to Iceland with his father, Oddr skrauti. They settle in Þorskafjörður. Later Þórir goes raiding with Hyrningr the son of Hallr of Hofstaðir, and obtains gold in [[Finnmark]], where he defeats some dragons in a cave north of Dumbshaf. When the men come back to Iceland, Hallr wants to get a portion of the gold on behalf of his son, but Hyrningr is satisfied with his lot. This becomes a great controversy between Hallr and Þórir. Þórir kills both Hallr and Rauðr, his older son, but is reconciled with Hyrningr, who does not get involved in the dispute.

Þórir's wife is Ingibjörg daughter of Gill, who settled [[Gilsfjörður]], and their son is Guðmundr.

The '''High Court of Cassation and Justice''' ({{lang-ro|Înalta Curte de Casație și Justiție}}) is [[Romania]]'s [[supreme court]], and the court of last resort. It is the equivalent of [[France]]'s [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] and serves a similar function to [[Supreme court|other courts of cassation]] around the world.

It held various names during its existence: "Curtea Supremă" (Supreme Court) and "Tribunalul Suprem" (Supreme Tribunal) during [[Communist Romania|Communist times]] (1948–1952 and 1952–1989 respectively), and "Curtea Supremă de Justiție" (Supreme Court of Justice) from 1990 to 2003. The name "Înalta Curte de Casație și Justiție" was re-introduced in 2003, having been also used during the [[United Principalities]] (1862–1881) and [[Kingdom of Romania]] (1881–1947).

'''Human development''' is the science that seeks to understand how and why the people of all ages and circumstances change or remain the same over time. It involves studies of the [[human condition]] with its core being the [[capability approach]]. The [[inequality adjusted Human Development Index]] is used as a way of measuring actual progress in human development by the [[United Nations]]. It is an alternative approach to a single focus on economic growth, and focused more on [[social justice]], as a way of understanding progress.

The term '''human development''' may be defined as an expansion of human capabilities, a widening of choices, 'an enhancement of freedom, and a fulfilment of human rights.&lt;ref name="Abdulhadi Abba Kyari"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdulhadi Abba Kyari|title=Aminu Saleh College of Education, Azare|url=https://FACEBOOK.COM/ABDULHADI.ABBA.5|year=2017|publisher=Human Development|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510142353/https://www.facebook.com/abdulhadi.abba.5|archivedate=2018-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also simply means developing mentally, socially through growing and experiencing things in your life and learning new things.

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] defines human development as "the process of enlarging people's choices," said choices allowing them to "lead a long and healthy life, to be educated, to enjoy a decent standard of living," as well as "political freedom, other guaranteed human rights and various ingredients of self-respect."&lt;ref name="Programme1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations Development Programme|title=Human Development Report 1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x7VOd6cRj4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=1997|publisher=Human Development Report|isbn=978-0-19-511996-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development concerns expanding the choices people have, to lead lives that they value, and improving the human condition so that people have the chance to lead full lives.&lt;ref name="Streeten, Paul"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Streeten, Paul |title=Human Development: Means and Ends |journal=Human Development |issue=84.2 |date=May 1994 |pages=232–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, human development is about much more than economic growth, which is only a means of enlarging people's choices.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Human Development |publisher=Human Development Reports (UNDP) |date=22 October 2009 |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/humandev/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415134936/http://hdr.undp.org/en/humandev/ |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental to enlarging these choices is building [[capability approach|human capabilities]]—the range of things that people can do or be in life. Capabilities are "the substantive freedoms [a person] enjoys to lead the kind of life [they have] reason to value".&lt;ref name="Human Development and Capability Association"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Human Development and Capability Association |title=Capability &amp; Functionings: Definition &amp; Justification |journal= Human Development and Capability Association Briefing Note |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human development disperses the concentration of the distribution of goods and services underprivileged people need and center its ideas on human decisions.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan, T.N."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Srinivasan, T.N. |title=Human Development: A New Paradigm or Reinvention of the Wheel? |journal=Human Development |issue=84.2 |date=May 1994 |pages=238–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; By investing in people, we enable growth and empower people to pursue many different life paths, thus developing human capabilities.&lt;ref name="HDF"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Human Development Foundation - The Human Development Concept |date=22 October 2009 |url=http://www.hdf.com/dotnetnuke/humandevelopment/Introduction.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126123359/http://www.hdf.com/dotnetnuke/humandevelopment/Introduction.aspx |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic capabilities for human development are to lead long and healthy lives, be knowledgeable (i.e., educated), have access to resources and social services needed for a decent standard of living, and be able to participate in the life of the community. Without these, many choices are not available, and many opportunities in life remain inaccessible.&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt;

An abstract illustration of human capability is a bicycle. A bicycle itself is a resource—a mode of transportation. If the person who owns a bicycle is unable to ride it (due to a lack of balance or knowledge), the bicycle is useless to her or him as transportation and loses its functioning. If a person owns a bicycle and has the ability to ride a bicycle, they have the capability of riding to a friend's house, a local store, or a great number of other places. This capability would (presumably) increase their value of life and expand their choices. A person, therefore, needs both resources and the ability to use them to pursue their capabilities. This is one example of how different resources or skills can contribute to human capability. This way of looking at development, often forgotten in the immediate concern with accumulating commodities and financial wealth, is not new. Philosophers, economists, and political leaders emphasized human well being as the purpose, or the end, of development. As Aristotle said in ancient Greece, "Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking, for it is merely useful for the sake of something else."&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt;

==History==
Human Development Theory has roots in ancient philosophy and early economic theory. [[Aristotle]] noted that "Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking, for it is merely useful for something else", and [[Adam Smith]] and [[Karl Marx]] were concerned with human capabilities. The theory grew in importance in the 1980s with the work of Amartya Sen and his Human Capabilities perspective, which played a role in his receiving the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics. Notable early economists active who formulated the modern concept of human development theory were [[Mahbub ul Haq]], [[Üner Kirdar]], and [[Amartya Sen]]. The [[Human Development Index]]  developed for the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) stems from this early research.&lt;ref&gt;Yousif, Bassam. Human development in Iraq: 1950-1990. Routledge, 2013. p4-6&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Sen and Sudhir Anand published a notable development of the theory to address issues in sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Anand, S. &amp; Sen,A. (2000). Human development and economic sustainability. World Development 28(12): 2029–2049.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welzel2003"&gt;Welzel, Christian, Ronald Inglehart, and Hans Dieter Klikemann. "The theory of human development: A cross-cultural analysis." European Journal of Political Research 42, no. 3 (2003): 341-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]]'s publications in the late 1990s and 2000s pushed theorists to pay more attention to the ''human'' in the theory, and particularly to human emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Gasper, Des. Logos, pathos and ehtos in martha C. Nussbaum's capabilities approach to human development. in Comim, Flavio, and Martha C. Nussbaum, eds. Capabilities, Gender, Equality: towards fundamental entitlements. Cambridge University Press, 2014. p97&lt;/ref&gt; A separate approach stems in part from needs theories of psychology which in part started with [[Abraham Maslow]] (1968). Representative of these are the Human-Scale Development approach developed by [[Manfred Max-Neef]] in the mid-to-late 1980s which addresses human needs and satisfiers which are more or less static across time and context.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a systemic development approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development paradigm." Ecological economics 68, no. 7 (2009): 2021-2030.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists and sociologists have also challenged perspectives on Human Development Theory that stem from neoclassical economics. Examples of scholars include, [[Diane Elson]], Raymond Apthorpe, Irene van Staveren, and Ananta Giri. Elson (1997) proposes that human development should move towards a more diverse approach to individual incentives. This will involve a shift from seeing people as agents in control of their choices selecting from a set of possibilities utilizing human capital as one of many assets. Instead, theorists should see people as having more mutable choices influenced by social structures and changeable capacities and using a humanistic approach to theory including factors relating to an individual's culture, age, gender, and family roles. These extensions express a dynamic approach to the theory, a dynamism that has been advocated by Ul Haq and Sen, in spite of the implicit criticism of those two figures.&lt;ref name="Gasper2002"&gt;Gasper, Des. "Is Sen's capability approach an adequate basis for considering human development?." Review of political economy 14, no. 4 (2002): 435-461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elson, Diane. "Economic paradigms old and new: The case of human development." In Global Development Fifty Years after Bretton Woods, pp. 50-71. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

One measure of human development is the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), formulated by the [[United Nations Development Programme]].&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt; The index encompasses statistics such as [[life expectancy]] at birth, an education index (calculated using mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling), and [[gross national income]] per capital. Though this index does not capture every aspect that contributes to human capability, it is a standardized way of quantifying human capability across nations and communities. Aspects that could be left out of the calculations include incomes that are unable to be quantified, such as staying home to raise children or bartering goods/services, as well as individuals' perceptions of their own well being. Other measures of human development include the [[Human Poverty Index]] (HPI) and the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]]. It measures many aspects of development.

==Pillars==
There are six basic pillars of human development: equity, sustainability, productivity, empowerment, cooperation and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/what-human-development|title=What is Human Development? - Human Development Reports|author=|date=|website=hdr.undp.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027132851/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/what-human-development|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Equity is the idea of fairness for every person, between men and women; we each have the right to education and health care. 
* Sustainability is the view that we all have the right to earn a living that can sustain our lives and have access to a more even distribution of goods. 
* Productivity states the full participation of people in the process of income generation. This also means that the government needs more efficient social programs for its people. 
* Empowerment is the freedom of the people to influence development and decisions that affect their lives. 
* Cooperation stipulates participation and belonging to communities and groups as a means of mutual enrichment and a source of social meaning. 
* Security offers people development opportunities freely and safely with confidence that they will not disappear suddenly in the future.&lt;ref name="undp2"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Human Development?|url=http://www.undp.org.bz/human-development/what-is-human-development/|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=3 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601112934/http://www.undp.org.bz/human-development/what-is-human-development/|archivedate=1 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
In seeking that something else, human development shares a common vision with [[human rights]]. The goal is human freedom. Therefore, human development is interconnected with human rights and human freedom, because in well-managed prisons life expectancy and literacy as measured by the Human Development Index could be quite high.&lt;ref name="Streeten, Paul" /&gt; And in pursuing capabilities and realizing rights, this freedom is vital. People must be free to exercise their choices and to participate in decision-making that affects their lives. Human development and human rights are mutually reinforcing, helping to secure the well-being and dignity of all people, building self-respect and the respect of others.&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt; In the days of fast globalization, human rights issues surface in relation to multilateral corporations and poverty issues. The idea of human development stipulates the need for education, better conditions for work and more choices for individuals. The idea goes with human rights. The two concepts are simultaneously promoted first by good governance, implementation of human rights policy and a formation of participation of community in decision making processes, second by the promotion of civil and political rights and economic and social rights, which are components of the level of development. For instance, the right for education relates to intellectual development, and political rights relates to the level of the political development of that society.&lt;ref name=HRAD&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights And Development: Potential integration?|url=http://www.prof.msu.ru/publ/omsk/25.htm|publisher=Yulia Shirokova|accessdate=3 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616023341/http://www.prof.msu.ru/publ/omsk/25.htm|archivedate=16 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
The  axis of Development is that it may harm or benefit human health, and eventually human development, as it proceeds. In concern of health, we divided it into disease and poverty issues. On 16 June 2006 the World Health Organization
(WHO) presented the report Preventing disease through healthy environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Health Organization|title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: a global assessment of the burden of disease from environmental risks|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventing-disease/en/|accessdate=4 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730124831/http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventing-disease/en/|archivedate=30 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one in the world is without the environmental health issues and wealth problems. Development had been first approached as the future for more cure and hope. However, the criticism argues of the side effects such as environmental pollution and the gap between increasing wealth and poor. The Ineffectiveness of many public health policies in terms of health inequality issues and social problems should be held by global community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilkinson R.|title=The impact of inequality: how to make sick societies|year=2005|issue=London: Routledge;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the ultimate goal is to achieve environmental sustainability. 
Some critics say development is undermined by health concerns as it both directly and indirectly influences growth to be lower. [[HIV/AIDS]], in addition to [[malaria]], has negatively influenced development and increased [[poverty]] in many places, especially in [[Africa]]. Achieving adequate health standards is important for the success of development and the abolition of poverty.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |title=World Health Organization- Poverty and Development |date=22 October 2009 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/10/07-045955/en/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022172211/http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/10/07-045955/en/index.html |archivedate=22 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Development Report==

The Global [[Human Development Report]]s (HDR) is an annual publication released by the UNDP's Human Development Report Office and contains the Human Development Index. There is not only a global Human Development Report but there are regional and national reports as well that specifically show certain areas. Within global HDR there are four main indexes: Human Development Index, Gender-related Development Index, Gender Empowerment Measure and the Human Poverty Index.&lt;ref name="UNDP" /&gt; The Regional, National and subnational (for portions of countries) HDRs take various approaches, according to the strategic thinking of the individual authorship groups that craft the individual reports. In the United States, for example, [[Measure of America]] has been publishing human development reports since 2008 with a modified index, the [http://www.measureofamerica.org/human-development/#american human development index American Human Development Index], which measures the same three basic dimensions but uses slightly different indicators to better reflect the U.S. context and to maximize use of available data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.measureofamerica.org/human-development/|title=About Human Development — Measure of America: A Program of the Social Science Research Council|website=www.measureofamerica.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117161207/http://www.measureofamerica.org/human-development/|archivedate=2018-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Development Index]] is a way for people and nations to see the policy flaws of regions and countries. Although the releasing of this information is believed to encourage countries to alter their policies, there is no evidence demonstrating changes nor is there any motivation for countries to do so.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan, T.N." /&gt;

The '''Human Development Index''' ('''HDI''') is the normalized measure of [[life expectancy]], [[education]] and [[per capita income]] for countries worldwide. It is an improved standard means of measuring well-being, especially child [[welfare economics|welfare]] and thus human development.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt; Although this index makes an effort to simplify human development, it is much more complex than any index or set of indicators.&lt;ref name="Streeten, Paul" /&gt;

The 2007 report showed a small increase in world HDI in comparison with the previous year's report. This rise was fueled by a general improvement in the [[developing countries|developing world]], especially of the [[least developed countries]] group. This marked improvement at the bottom was offset with a decrease in HDI of [[high income countries]].

==Human Poverty Index==

To reflect gaps in the Human Development Index, the United Nations came out with the Human Poverty Index (HPI) in 1997&lt;small&gt;[[citation needed]]&lt;/small&gt;. The HPI measures the deficiencies in the three indexes of the human development index: long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. The HPI is meant to provide a broader view of human development and is adapted to developed countries to reveal social exclusion.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

==Social Progress Index==
{{main|List of countries by Social Progress Index}}

The Social Progress Index is published by Social Progress Imperative. It combines indicators related to social welfare, equality, personal freedom and sustainability.

== The Earth Summits, Agenda21, the Millennium Development Goals and the 17#GlobalGoals==

In an attempt to promote human development, the [[United Nations]] supports decennial [[Earth Summits]] where the members to the UN bring together the best of humanity.  In several rounds they discuss what are humanities biggest problems, quantify them and develop a plan of action on how to solve these problems.  This plan of action is called [[Agenda 21]] - an agenda to make sure humanity will still be around after the year 2100.  Thousands of cities now have a [[local Agenda 21]] and more and more companies and organisations also align their strategic plan with the strategic plan of Agenda21.  With the approaching of the year 2000, [[UN Secretary General]] [[Kofi ANNAN]] was compelled to develop something that existed in the private sector: setting out a long term plan, a mid term plan and a short term planning.  This endeavour supports on Agenda21 and was named the [[Millennium Development Goals]] which ran from 2000 - 2015.  The United Nations made a commitment to accomplish these goals by 2015 and thus make an attempt to promote human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals |date=22 October 2009 |url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/index.shtml |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619213557/http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/index.shtml |archivedate=19 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the experience of this exercise was perceived successful, a follow-up program was developed which got the name the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] - in 2016 - after an evaluation - rebranded to the 17#GlobalGoals or [[Global Goals]].

'''Intelsat 704''' (also known as '''IS-704''' and '''Intelsat 7-F4''') is a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] that was built by [[Space Systems/Loral]] (SSL). It is located in the orbital position of 29.5 degrees east longitude and it is currently in an [[inclined orbit]]. The same is owned by [[Intelsat]] and after sold to [[SES World Skies]] on November 30, 1998. The satellite was based on the LS-1300 platform and its estimated useful life was 15 years.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on January 10, 1995, at 06:18, using an [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas II]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 3,695&amp;nbsp;kg.

The Intelsat 704 is equipped with 26 transponders in [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and 10 in [[Ku band]] to provide broadcasting, business-to-home services, [[telecommunications]], VSATnetworks.

The '''Kartvelian peoples''' are the ethno-linguistic groups of speakers of [[Kartvelian languages]]. "A Kartvelian people" may refer to:

* [[Georgians]]
** [[Svan people|Svans]]
** [[Zan people|Zans]]
*** [[Mingrelians]]
*** [[Lazs]]

The Svans and the Mingrelians, and the Lazs of Georgia are today commonly thought to be subgroups of the Georgians, and the term ''Kartvelian peoples'' is obsolescent (to refer to the modern-day peoples).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The '''Makololo''' ('''Kololo''') are a [[Sotho people]] of [[Southern Africa]], closely related to the other [[Basotho]], from which they separated themselves{{what?|date=May 2015}} in the early 19th century.  Originally residing in what is now [[South Africa]] just south of [[Lesotho]], they were displaced by the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]] and in 1823 started a migration north through [[Botswana]] to [[Barotseland]].&lt;ref name="Phiri"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H-O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;pg=PA851 851–852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In what is now southern Botswana they defeated a number of societies before suffering a catastrophic defeat to the Bangwaketse at Dithubaruba in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ramsay, B. Morton, and T. Mgadla, ''Building a Nation: A History of Botswana from 1800 to 1910''. Gaborone: Longmans, 1996, 66-8.&lt;/ref&gt; After losing all their cattle they moved north east and raided again, but subsequent defeats led them north to Okavango Delta where they again suffered major losses but were able to defeat the Batawana people in 1835. This victory enabled them to replenish their population and cattle holdings, although they moved north after several years.&lt;ref&gt;Moanaphuti Segolodi, "Ditso Tsa Batawana," 1940. https://www.academia.edu/12170767/Ditso_Tsa_Batawana_by_Moanaphuti_Segolodi_1940&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, the Makololo leader,  [[Sebetwane]] crossed the [[Zambezi River]] and, by 1845, he had conquered the [[Lozi people]] of the [[Barotseland]] kingdom and became king. He died in 1851 shortly after meeting [[David Livingstone]], and was succeeded, first, by his daughter [[Mamochisane]], who soon abdicated in favour of her younger half-brother [[Sekeletu]].&lt;ref&gt; N. R. Bennett, (1970). David Livingstone: Exploration for Christianity in R. I. Rotberg (editor), Africa and its Explorers. Harvard University Press, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; After about 20 years the Makololo kingdom was overthrown in a [[revolution]], although some survivors (women and children) remained,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1= Lewis H.|last1= Gann|first2= Peter|last2= Duignan|year= 1999|title=Africa and the world: An introduction to the history of sub-Saharan Africa from antiquity to 1840|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=University Press of America|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IWFOBb9rOgEC&amp;pg=PA413 413–414]|isbn= 0-7618-1520-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sekeletu provided Livingstone with manu porters for his transcontinental journey from [[Luanda]] on the [[Atlantic]] to [[Quelimane]] on the Indian Ocean, made between 1854 and 1856. Around 100 of these men were left at [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] in 1856 when Livingstone made his way to Quelimane and then to Britain.&lt;ref&gt; T. Jeal, (2013). Livingstone: Revised and Expanded Edition, Yale University Press, pp. 93, 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Livingstone returned to Africa to start his second Zambezi expedition in 1858. On reaching Tete, he was reunited with the porters he left there in 1856 and attempted to repatriate them all to Barotseland. However, by this time Sekeletu was facing increasing opposition from the Lozi majority, and around 16 of them decided to remain on the middle Zambezi.&lt;ref&gt;J. McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, Woodbridge, James Currey, pp. 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those Makololo remaining were used from 1859 onward, by Livingstone and by missionaries of the [[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]] (UMCA), as porters and armed guards to support their activities in the Shire valley and [[Shire Highlands]] including the freeing of slaves, and were paid in guns, ammunition and cloth. The Makololo decided to remain in the Shire valley when the missionaries left in January 1864. &lt;ref&gt;L. White, (1987). Magomero: Portrait of an African Village, Cambridge University Press, pp. 17, 39, 64-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the 1864 departure of the UMCA mission, which left behind supplies of arms and ammunition, the Makololo maintained themselves by hunting elephants for ivory and attracted dependents seeking protection, many of whom were freed slaves. They and their armed dependents established chieftaincies in the present-day [[Chikwawa District]]. Originally, ten Makololo became chiefs or headmen and five [[Makololo Chiefs (Malawi)|Makololo chiefs]] still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;J. McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, Woodbridge, James Currey, pp. 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

They appear to be named after Kololo, the wife of their first chief, [[Sebitwane]]. Another theory is that it is a [[Luyana]] word meaning "bald" referring to their conqueror's hairstyles.

The highest state functionaries are all [[Catholic clergy]] of various national origins. Since the return of the popes from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] in 1377, they have generally resided at the [[Apostolic Palace]] within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the [[Quirinal Palace]] in Rome or elsewhere.

The Holy See dates back to [[early Christianity]], and is the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] [[episcopal see]] of the Catholic Church, with 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion Catholics around the world distributed in the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. The independent Vatican City-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 11 February 1929 by the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the Holy See and [[Italy]], which spoke of it as a new creation,&lt;ref name=Preamble /&gt; not as a vestige of the much larger [[Papal States]] (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy.

Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and the [[Vatican Museums]]. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique [[economy of Vatican City]] is supported financially by the sale of [[postage stamp]]s and [[souvenir]]s, fees for admission to museums, and sales of [[publication]]s.

== Name ==
The name {{linktext|Vatican city}} was first used in the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state. The name is taken from [[Vatican Hill]], the geographic location of the state. "Vatican" is derived from the name of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] settlement,  ''Vatica'' or ''Vaticum'' meaning garden, located in the general area the Romans called ''vaticanus ager'', "Vatican territory".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The official [[Italian language|Italian]] name of the city is ''{{lang|it|Città del Vaticano}}'' or, more formally, ''{{lang|it|Stato della Città del Vaticano}}'', meaning "Vatican City State". Although the [[Holy See]] (which is distinct from the Vatican City) and the Catholic Church use [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] in official documents, the Vatican City officially uses Italian. The [[Latin]] name is ''{{lang|la|Status Civitatis Vaticanæ}}'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19451208_vacantis-apostolicae-sedis.html| title=Apostolic Constitution| language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Letter to John Cardinal Lajolo| author=Pope Francis| date=8 September 2014| publisher=The Vatican| url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/la/letters/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20140908_lettera-card-giovanni-lajolo.html| language=Latin| accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is used in official documents by not just the Holy See, but in most official Church and [[Pope|Papal]] documents.

[[File:Obelisque Saint Peter's square Vatican City.jpg|thumb|left|The Vatican [[obelisk]], originally taken from Egypt by [[Caligula]]]]
{{History of Vatican City}}

The name "Vatican" was already in use in the time of the [[Roman Republic]] for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome. Under the [[Roman Empire]], many villas were constructed there, after [[Agrippina the Elder]] (14 BC&amp;nbsp;– 18 October [[Anno Domini|AD]] 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor [[Caligula]] (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by [[Nero]], the ''Circus Gaii et Neronis'',&lt;ref&gt;Lanciani, Rodolfo (1892). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Lanciani/LANPAC/3*.html#sec16 Pagan and Christian Rome] Houghton, Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; usually called, simply, the [[Circus of Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/storia/la-citta-del-vaticano-nel-tempo.html|title=Vatican City in the Past|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the arrival of Christianity, it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome (the ''ager vaticanus'') had long been considered sacred, or at least not available for habitation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]] and her consort [[Attis]] remained active long after the [[Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter]] was built nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Altar dedicated to Cybele and Attis|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/MGEs/MGEs_Sala16_03_040.html|publisher=Vatican Museums|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particularly low quality of Vatican water, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet [[Martial]] (40 – between 102 and 104 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/8100/research.pdf?sequence=3|title=Damien Martin, "Wine and Drunkenness in Roman Society"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tacitus]] wrote, that in AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], when the northern army that brought [[Vitellius]] to power arrived in Rome, "a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease".&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''The Histories'', II, 93, translation by Clifford H. Moore (The Loeb Classical Library, first printed 1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican Obelisk]] was originally taken by [[Caligula]] from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] to decorate the ''spina'' of his [[Roman circus|circus]] and is thus its last visible remnant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] XVI.76.&lt;/ref&gt; This area became the site of martyrdom of many Christians after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64. Ancient tradition holds that it was in this circus that [[Saint Peter]] was [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm#IV|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the [[Via Cornelia]]. Funeral monuments and mausoleums and small tombs as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter's in the first half of the 4th century. Remains of this ancient [[list of necropoleis|necropolis]] were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the [[Renaissance]] until it was systematically excavated by orders of [[Pope Pius XII]] from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the [[Saint Peter's tomb|tomb of Saint Peter]], buried in that cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=37b9V9IXDsYC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Gardner+%22reputed+grave%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A3gQUqPdOYWThgeirYCgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gardner%20%22reputed%20grave%22&amp;f=false Fred S. Kleiner, ''Gardner's Art through the Ages'' (Cengage Learning 2012] {{ISBN|978-1-13395479-8}}), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of [[Pope Symmachus]] (reigned 498–514).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Vatican.html |title=Vatican |work=Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth |date=2001–2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207064352/http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Vatican.html |archive-date=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papal States ===
{{Main|Papal States}}
{{See also|History of the Papacy}}

[[File:Italy 1796 AD.png|thumb|left|upright|The Italian peninsula in 1796. The shaded yellow territory in central Italy is the Papal State.]]

Popes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the [[Papal States]], which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the [[Italian unification|newly created]] Kingdom of Italy.

For most of this time the popes did not live at the Vatican. The [[Lateran Palace]], on the opposite side of Rome was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at [[Avignon]] in France. On their return to Rome they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the [[Quirinal Palace]] in 1583, after work on it was completed under [[Pope Paul V]] (1605–1621), but on the [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the [[Kingdom of Italy|King of Italy]].

=== Italian unification ===
{{Main|Roman Question}}

In 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when [[capture of Rome|Rome itself was annexed]] by the [[Piedmont]]-led forces which had [[Italian unification|united the rest of Italy]], after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the "Roman Question".

Italy made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871 the [[Quirinal Palace]] was confiscated by the king of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846–1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a "[[prisoner in the Vatican]]". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.&lt;ref name="World History"&gt;{{cite book| last=Wetterau| first=Bruce| title=World History: A Dictionary of Important People, Places, and Events, from Ancient Times to the Present| location=New York| publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.| year=1994| isbn=978-0805023503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lateran treaties ===
{{Main|Lateran Treaty}}

This situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].&lt;ref name=Preamble&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf|title=Preamble of the Lateran Treaty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lateran"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html#TRATTATO_FRA_LA_SANTA_SEDE_E_L’ITALIA Trattato fra la Santa Sede e l'Italia]&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholicism in Italy.&lt;ref name=Statute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|title=Patti lateranensi, 11 febbraio 1929 – Segreteria di Stato, card.

=== World War II ===
{{Main|Vatican City during World War II}}

[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA16179.jpg|thumb|Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944.]]

The Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during [[World War II]], under the leadership of [[Pope Pius XII]]. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 [[Armistice of Cassibile]], and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005446 |title=Rome |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main diplomatic priorities of the [[bishop of Rome]] was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.&lt;ref name="Chadwick1"&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222–32&lt;/ref&gt; The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: "that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war".&lt;ref name="Chadwick1"/&gt;

After the American entry into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that "they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided". The British uncompromisingly said "they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded".&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232–36&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, the British envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an "[[open city]]", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the British, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], 500 American aircraft [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed Rome on 19 July 1943]], aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed; Pius XII himself, who had been described in the previous month as "worried sick" about the possible bombing, went to the scene of the tragedy. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|ousted from power]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236–44&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the British had decided that they would never recognize Rome as an open city.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war history ===
Pius XII had refrained from creating [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], [[Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church|Chancellor]], and Prefect for the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life|Congregation for the Religious]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1988|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|created 32 cardinals in early 1946]], having announced his intentions to do so in his preceding Christmas message.

The [[Military in Vatican City|Pontifical Military Corps]], except for the [[Swiss Guard]], was disbanded by will of [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.&lt;ref name="Vatican State" /&gt; The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie Corps]] was transformed into a civilian [[police]] and security force.

In 1984, a new [[concordat]] between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholicism as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] of 1848.&lt;ref name=Statute/&gt;

Construction in 1995 of a new guest house, [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]], adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.&lt;ref name="guest house"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thavis|first=John|title=The Vatican Diaries: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Power, Personalities and Politics at the Heart of the Catholic Church|year=2013|publisher=Viking|location=NY |isbn=978-0-670-02671-5 |pages=121–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.&lt;ref name="guest house" /&gt;

{{Main|Geography of Vatican City}}
[[File:Vatican City map EN.png|thumb|upright=2.25|Map of Vatican City, highlighting notable buildings and the Vatican gardens.]]

The name "Vatican" predates Christianity and comes from the Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Vatican Hill|Mons Vaticanus]]}}'', meaning Vatican Mount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Vatican|title=Vatican (search)|publisher=Online Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields. It is in this territory that [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman ''[[rione]]'' of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river [[Tiber]], the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847–855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534–1549), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559–1565) and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–1644).
[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|Territory of Vatican City State according to the [[Lateran Treaty]].]]

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[St. Peter's Square]], distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio&amp;nbsp;XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]] which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.

According to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]].&lt;ref name="treaty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treaty text"/&gt; These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.&lt;ref name="treaty text"&gt;Lateran Treaty of 1929, Articles 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Castel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|police agents of Vatican City State]] and not by [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian police]]. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.&lt;ref name="treaty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patti Lateranensi|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica. Other places are open to only those individuals who have business to transact there.

=== Climate ===
Vatican City's climate is the same as Rome's: a temperate, [[Mediterranean climate]] ''Csa'' with mild, rainy winters from October to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to September. Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains and the size of the large paved square.

=== Gardens ===
{{Main|Gardens of Vatican City}}

Within the territory of Vatican City are the [[Gardens of Vatican City|Vatican Gardens]] ({{lang-it|Giardini Vaticani|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="VaticanMap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/vaticancity-map.htm |title=Map of Vatican City |publisher=saintpetersbasilica.org |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which account for more than half of this territory. The gardens, established during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.

The gardens cover approximately {{convert|23|ha|acres}} which is most of the [[Vatican Hill]]. The highest point is {{convert|60|m}} [[above mean sea level]]. Stone walls bound the area in the North, South and West.

The gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal [[Apostolic Palace]].&lt;ref name="Pellegrino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pellegrinocattolico.com/ctv/gardens.htm|title=Al Pellegrino Cattolico: ''The Vatican Gardens''|accessdate=21 November 2008|publisher=2008 Al Pellegrino Cattolico s.r.l.

{{Politics of Vatican City|Government of Vatican City}}
{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}

The politics of Vatican City takes place in an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]], in which the head of the Roman Catholic Church takes power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the [[Holy See]]), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.&lt;ref name="nationsencyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Vatican-City-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html|title=Vatican City (Politics, government, and taxation)|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City is one of the few widely recognized independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56121#.WnNenpM-dsM|title=UN News - FEATURE: Diplomacy of the conscience – The Holy See at the United Nations|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2017-02-07|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].

=== Political system ===
The government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The pope is the sovereign of the state. Legislative authority is vested in the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], a body of cardinals appointed by the pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State|President of that commission]], assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative and judicial branches over Vatican City. He is currently the only absolute monarch in Europe.

There are specific departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp|accessdate=4 March 2007|title=Vatican City|publisher=Catholic-Pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Cardinal Camerlengo]] presides over the [[Apostolic Camera]] to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other [[temporal power (papal)|papal temporal powers and rights]] of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or Sede Vacante [[sede vacante|(papal vacancy)]]. Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the [[College of Cardinals]] as a whole.

The nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see [[Master of the Horse#Papal Master of the Horse|Papal Master of the Horse]], [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household]], [[Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], [[Black Nobility]]). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, [[Executive (government)|executive functions]] were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of 28 March 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19680328_pontificalis-domus_lt.html ''Pontificalis Domus''], 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as [[Quartermaster general]] and [[Master of the Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;The site [http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm "Hereditary Officers of the Papal Court"] continues to present these functions and titles as still in use, several decades after their abolition. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313165610/http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognized as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since [[Late Antiquity]] to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929). The Holy See has the oldest active continuous diplomatic service in the world, dating back to at least AD 325 with its legation to the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/diplomacy.asp "Vatican Diplomacy"].

The Pope is [[Ex officio member|''ex officio'']] [[head of state]]&lt;ref&gt;One of the titles of the Pope listed in the [[Annuario Pontificio]] is "[[List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State|Sovereign of Vatican City State]]" (page 23* in recent editions).&lt;/ref&gt; of Vatican City since the 1860s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Vatican-City-considered-a-country|title=Why is Vatican City considered a country?|website=Quora|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; functions dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the [[diocese of Rome]]. The term "[[Holy See]]" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the [[Roman Curia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P19.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text – IntraText CT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His official title with regard to Vatican City is ''Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City''.

[[Pope Francis]], born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], was [[Papal conclave, 2013|elected]] on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's [[head of government]] is the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the [[Governor of Vatican City]]. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The current president is Italian Cardinal [[Giuseppe Bertello]], who was appointed on 1 October 2011.

=== Administration ===
{{Main|Law of Vatican City}}

[[Legislature|Legislative]] functions are delegated to the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], led by the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]''. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.

[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title "President of the Governorate of Vatican City"—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.

The Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the ''[[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano]]''.

[[Judiciary|Judicial]] functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal ([[Tribunal of Vatican City State]]), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the [[#Crime|section on crime]], below).

The [[Postal code#Country code prefixes|international postal country code prefix]] is ''SCV'', and the only postal code is ''00120'' – altogether ''SCV-00120''.&lt;ref&gt;"International postal code: SCV-00120."

{{Main|Military in Vatican City|Pontifical Swiss Guard|Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State}}

As the Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the [[Military of Italy|Italian armed forces]]. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as the Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the [[Swiss Guard]] is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and resident in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] was founded by [[Pope Julius II]] on 22 January 1506 as the pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the [[Annuario Pontificio]] under "Holy See", not under "State of Vatican City". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and [[Switzerland]]. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their [[basic training]] with the [[Swiss Armed Forces]] with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least {{convert|174|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} in height. Members are equipped with [[small arms]] and the traditional [[halberd]] (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The [[Palatine Guard]] and the [[Noble Guard (Vatican)|Noble Guard]], the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Vatican State"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/Vatican_City_today.htm |title=Vatican City Today |publisher=Vatican City Government |accessdate=28 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211020340/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/Vatican_City_today.htm |archivedate=11 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duursma |first=Jorri C. |date=1996 |title=Fragmentation and the International Relations of Micro-states: Self-determination and Statehood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgVDprXjkIYC&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;pg=PA396#v=onepage |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=396 |isbn=9780521563604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil defence is the responsibility of the [[Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State]], the national [[fire brigade]]. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).

The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie Corps]] (''Corpo della Gendarmeria'') is the [[gendarmerie]], or police and security force, of Vatican City and the [[extraterritorial properties of the Holy See]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/IT/Servizi/Direzione_SdS_VVFF/corpo_della_gendarmeria.htm |title=Corpo della Gendarmeria |publisher=Stato della Città del Vaticano |language=Italian |accessdate=15 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225094441/http://www.vaticanstate.va/IT/Servizi/Direzione_SdS_VVFF/corpo_della_gendarmeria.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The corps is responsible for security, [[public order]], [[border control]], [[road traffic control|traffic control]], [[criminal procedure|criminal investigation]], and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{See also|Foreign relations of the Holy See|List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See}}
[[File:Palace of the Governorate. Vatican City State..jpg|thumb|right|[[Governor's Palace, Vatican|Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State]].]]
[[File:Vatican City - main entrance with Swiss Guard.jpg|thumb|The ''Ingresso di Sant'Anna'', an entrance to Vatican City from Italy.]]

Vatican City State is a recognized national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into [[treaty|international agreements]] in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.

Because of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.

The size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukinholysee.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2007/4485113/gregorian "The Holy See and Diplomacy"], [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521105212/http://ukinholysee.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2007/4485113/gregorian |date=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:&lt;ref name=Participation&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Internationalrelations/Participation_with_international_Organizations.htm "Vatican City State: Participation in International Organizations"].

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Vatican City}}
The Vatican City State budget includes the [[Vatican Museums]] and post office and is supported financially by the sale of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Vatican City|stamps]], [[Vatican euro coins|coins]], medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.{{efn|1=The Holy See's budget, which is distinct from that of Vatican City State, is supported financially by a variety of sources, including investments, real estate income, and donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions; these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic missions, and media outlets. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.}} The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.&lt;ref name="economy factbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html|title=Holy See (Vatican City): Economy|work=CIA – The World Factbook|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a [[Vatican Pharmacy]].

The [[Institute for Works of Religion]] (IOR, ''Istituto per le Opere di Religione''), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual [[automated teller machine|ATM]]s with instructions in [[Latin]], possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalseansblog.org/?p=232|title=A Glimpse Inside the Vatican &amp; Msgr.

Vatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue [[euro banknotes]]. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/l25040_en.htm|title=Agreements on monetary relations (Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican and Andorra)|accessdate=23 February 2007|work=Activities of the European Union: Summaries of legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/604/100.html|title=Benedict Vatican euros set for release|accessdate=25 September 2014|work=Catholic News|date=21 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own [[Vatican lira]] currency, which was on par with the Italian [[lira]].

Vatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7&amp;nbsp;million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15&amp;nbsp;million euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue6216.html Holy See's budget shortfall shrinks in 2008]. ''Christian Telegraph''. The report quoted deals mainly with the revenues and expenses of the Holy See and mentions only briefly the finances of Vatican City.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the U.S. State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Pullella, Philip (8 March 2012).

On 24 February 2014 the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal [[George Pell]]. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offenses. [[Pope Francis]] also appointed an auditor-general authorized to carry out random audits of any agency at any time, and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the [[Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See]] would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.&lt;ref name="VaticanEconomicSecretariat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vatican financial system restructuring begins with new secretariat|url=http://www.theitalynews.net/index.php/sid/220216280/scat/145bb158ac2f80f2/ht/Vatican-financial-system-restructuring-begins-with-new-secretariat|date=25 February 2014|publisher=The Italy News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population and languages===
{{Further|Languages of Vatican City}}

[[File:Seal of Vatican City.svg|thumb|right|The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.]]

Almost all of Vatican City's more than 450&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html |title=Vatican City State: Population|year=2017 |website=Vatican City State |publisher=Presidency of the Governorate of Vatican City State |language=English |access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; citizens either live inside the Vatican's walls or serve in the Holy See's [[List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See|diplomatic service]] in embassies (called "[[Apostolic Nunciature|nunciature]]"; a papal ambassador is a "nuncio") around the world. The Vatican citizenry consists almost entirely of two groups: clergy, most of whom work in the service of the Holy See, and a very few as officials of the state; and the Swiss Guard. Most of the 2,400 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican workforce reside outside the Vatican and are citizens of Italy, while a few are citizens of other nations. As a result, all of the City's actual citizens are Catholic as are all the [[Place of worship|places of worship]].

Vatican City has no formally enacted [[official language]], but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses [[Latin]] for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.&lt;ref&gt;Vatican City State appendix to the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] is entirely in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the [[Swiss Guard]], Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] or Italian. Vatican City's official website languages are Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish. (This site should not be confused with that of the Holy See, which uses all these languages, along with Portuguese, with Latin since 9 May 2008 and Chinese since 18 March 2009.)

=== Citizenship ===
Unlike [[citizenship]] of other states, which is based either on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on ''[[jus soli]]'' (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted ''jus officii'', namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is extended also to the spouse, parents and descendants of a citizen, provided they are living with the person who is a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,VAT,3ae6b52f10,0.html |title=Law on Citizenship and Residence, 7 June 1992 |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=7 June 1992 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717160038/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,VAT,3ae6b52f10,0.html |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadinanza_it.html |title=Cittadinanza vaticana |publisher=Vatican.va |date=31 December 2001 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See]], not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.

Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an [[Italian citizenship|Italian citizen]] as provided in the Lateran Treaty.&lt;ref name="treaty"/&gt;

As of 31 December 2011, other than the pope, there were 594 persons possessing Vatican citizenship, of which:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadini-vaticani_en.html|title=Vatican citizenship|accessdate=3 December 2006|publisher=Holy See Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

72% were clergy, including:
* 71 cardinals residing in Rome,  
* 307 titular bishops and other clergy serving as papal diplomats, 
* 51 other members of the clergy.

28% were laity, including:
* 1 religious sister, 
* 109 members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard 
* 55 other lay persons.

The persons authorized to reside in the Vatican City maintaining their original citizenship were 238, of the aforementioned numbers.

The persons residing in buildings outside of the Vatican City in buildings exempt from expropriation and taxation were 3,500 on the above-mentioned date.

On 22 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated a new "Law concerning citizenship, residency and access" to Vatican City, which became effective on 1 March. It replaced the 1929 "Law concerning citizenship and residence".&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law on Citizenship, Residency and Access to the Vatican|date=1 March 2011|publisher=VIS – Vatican Information Service|url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.com/2011/03/law-on-citizenship-residency-and-access.html|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 16 articles in the new law, whereas the old law had 33 articles.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows&gt;{{cite web|title=Law Now Allows for Vatican Residents: 1929 Code Replaced |date=2 March 2011 |work=ZENIT |publisher=Innovative Media, Inc. |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-31900?l=english |accessdate=2 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623221238/http://www.zenit.org/article-31900?l=english |archivedate=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It updated the old law by incorporating changes made after 1929, such as the 1940 granting of Vatican City citizenship, ''[[List of Latin phrases (D)|durante munere]]'', to the members of the Holy See's diplomatic service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toscanaoggi.it/Vita-Chiesa/STATO-CITTA-DEL-VATICANO-NUOVA-LEGGE-SULLA-CITTADINANZA "Stato Città del Vaticano: Nuova legge sulla cittadinanza" in ''Toscana Oggi'', 3 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It also created a new category, that of official Vatican "residents", i.e., people living in Vatican City; these are not necessarily Vatican citizens.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;

On 1 March 2011, only 220 of the over 800 people living in Vatican City were citizens. There was a total of 572 Vatican citizens, of whom 352 were not residents, mainly [[apostolic nuncio]]s and diplomatic staff.&lt;ref name=LawNowAllows/&gt;

===Wine consumption===
More wine is drunk per person in the Vatican City than in any other country in the world, according to statistics released by the California Wine Institute. The figures show that residents of the Vatican consume 74 litres of wine on average – roughly equivalent to 105 bottles over the course of a year. That amount is around double the amount drunk by the average person in France or Italy as a whole, and triple the quantity consumed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vatican-city-drinks-more-wine-per-person-than-anywhere-else-in-the-world-9151475.html|title=Vatican City drinks more wine per person than anywhere else in the world|accessdate=27 July 2018|work=The Independent|date=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. [[St. Peter's Basilica]], whose successive architects include [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giacomo della Porta]], [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]] and [[Bernini]], is a renowned work of [[Renaissance architecture]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is famous for its frescos, which include works by [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] as well as the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling]] and [[Last Judgment]] by [[Michelangelo]]. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include [[Raphael]] and [[Fra Angelico]].

The [[Vatican Library|Vatican Apostolic Library]] and the collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance. In 1984, the Vatican was added by [[UNESCO]] to the List of [[World Heritage Site]]s; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/286 |title=Vatican City – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a ''centre containing monuments'' in the "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection" according to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

==Sport==
There is a [[football]] championship, called the [[Vatican City Championship]], with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's [[FC Guardia]] and police and museum guard teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/guardia/vita-nella-guardia.html |title=Life in the Guard |website=Pontifical Swiss Guard |date=  |author= |accessdate= 10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Vatican City}}
[[File:0 Gare du Vatican.JPG|thumb|The [[Rail transport in Vatican City|shortest national railway system]] in the world.]]

Vatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). A state that is {{convert|1.05|km|mi|2|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|0.85|km|mi|2|abbr=off}} wide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/sp_ss_scv_info-generale_en.html|title=Holy See – State of the Vatican City|publisher=Vatican Papal Conclave|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has a small [[Transport network|transportation system]] with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the [[Vatican City Heliport]]. Vatican City is one of the few independent [[List of countries without an airport|countries without an airport]], and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]], and to a lesser extent [[Rome Ciampino Airport|Ciampino Airport]].&lt;ref name="Sinfin"/&gt;

There is a [[standard gauge]] [[rail transport in Vatican City|railway]], mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an {{Convert|852|m|yd|adj=mid|-long}} spur, {{Convert|300|m|yd|}} of which is within Vatican territory.&lt;ref name="Sinfin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfin.net/railways/world/vatican/vaticanrail.html#Origini |title=Railways of the World|publisher=Sinfin.net|accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John XXIII]] was the first Pope to make use of the railway; [[Pope John Paul II]] rarely used it.&lt;ref name="Sinfin"/&gt;

The closest [[Rome Metro|metro]] station is [[Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani (Rome Metro)|Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rometoolkit.com/whattodo/vatican.htm|title=The Vatican Museums &amp; St Peter's, Rome; gettting there -|website=www.rometoolkit.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communications ===

[[File:Poste_Vaticane.jpg|thumb|The Vatican's post office was established on the 11 February 1929.]]

The City&lt;!--Referring to Vatican City, not city. Do not decapitalise.--&gt; is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the [[Vatican Telephone Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20631 On call 24/7: Vatican phone system directs thousands of call each day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219033109/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20631 |date=19 December 2012 }}, 24 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Mail|postal system]] that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the [[Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanphilately.org/vc.htm|title=The Early Definitives|publisher=Vatican Philatelic Society|accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211191109/http://www.vaticanphilately.org/vc.htm|archivedate= 11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City's postal service is sometimes said to be "the best in the world",&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEFDE1738F934A15755C0A9629C8B63&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Vatican%20City|title=Hail Marys Not Needed: Vatican Mail Will Deliver|work=The New York Times |accessdate=28 November 2007 |first=Al |last=Baker |date=27 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and faster than the postal service in Rome.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The Vatican also controls its own Internet [[Top-level domain|TLD]], which is registered as ([[.va]]). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio [[ITU prefix]], HV, and this is sometimes used by [[amateur radio]] operators.

[[Vatican Radio]], which was organized by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], broadcasts on [[Shortwave|short-wave]], [[Medium wave|medium-wave]] and FM frequencies and on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/radio/index.htm |title=Vatican Radio – Index |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2 September 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been [[Vatican Radio lawsuit|sued]]. Television services are provided through another entity, the [[Vatican Television Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/television/index.htm |title=Vatican Television Center – Index |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Roman Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', the [[Gazette|official gazette]] of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.

Vatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the [[Annuario Pontificio]], which places them in the section "Institutions linked with the Holy See", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the [[Diplomatic corps]] accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.

===Recycling===
In 2008, the Vatican began an "ecological island" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of [[Pope Francis|Francis]].

== Crime ==
{{Main|Crime in Vatican City}}

Crime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, [[pickpocketing]] and [[shoplifting]] by outsiders.&lt;ref name="crime rate"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2639777.stm|title=Vatican crime rate 'soars'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 November 2007 | date=8 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tourist foot-traffic in [[St. Peter's Square]] is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romereports.com/palio/vatican-surpasses-all-nations-in-pickpockets-english-3545.html#.UPt_Wc0hclk "Vatican surpasses all nations... in pickpockets?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115144215/http://www.romereports.com/palio/Vatican-surpasses-all-nations-in-pickpockets-english-3545.html |date=15 November 2012 }}. Rome Reports, 14 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.&lt;ref&gt;Glatz, Carol (19 December 2013) [http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2013/man-seriously-injured-after-setting-self-on-fire-in-st-peter-s-square.cfm "Man seriously injured after setting self on fire in St. Peter's Square"]. ''Catholic News Service''&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,&lt;ref name="treaty1"&gt;{{cite web|title=INTER SANCTAM SEDEM ET ITALIAE REGNUM CONVENTIONES* INITAE DIE 11 FEBRUARII 1929|language=Italian|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offense, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognized as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.&lt;ref name="treaty1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shea |first=Alison |title=Researching the Law of the Vatican City State |url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/vatican1.htm |work=Hauser Global Law School Program |publisher=[[New York University School of Law]] |date=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017130729/https://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Vatican1.htm |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/05/paolo_gabriele_case_how_does_the_vatican_deal_with_criminals_.html How Does Vatican City Deal With Criminals?] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. 30 May 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">'''William fitzWimund''' was a Norman landholder in England after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].

FitzWimund was from [[Avranches]] in Normandy, where he held land. In ''[[Domesday Book]]'' fitzWimund is recorded as holding land in Exeter as a tenant of [[Baldwin FitzGilbert|Baldwin fitzGilbert]].&lt;ref name=DP490&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday People'' p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;

FitzWimund married a daughter of his overlord, Baldwin fitzGilbert. She may possibly have been named Matilda, as she is given that name on a document dated in 1066 but that must date later than that, as the text of the document refers to Michael, [[Bishop of Avranches]], who was bishop from 1069 to 1084.&lt;ref name=DP490/&gt;

FitzWimund donated to abbey at [[Mont-Saint-Michel]].&lt;ref name=DP490/&gt;

FitzWimund probably died before 1130. His son was named Robert.&lt;ref name=DP490/&gt; A daughter married [[William Paynel]], but her name is not known.&lt;ref name=DD1057&gt;Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' pp. 1057–1058&lt;/ref&gt;
