      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">The phrase '''101st kilometre''' ({{lang-ru|101-й километр}}, ''sto pervyy kilometr'') is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial name]] for the law restricting [[freedom of movement]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=tayler&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/99feb/kilo101.htm |title=Exiled Beyond Kilometer 101 |author=[[Jeffrey Tayler]] |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=February 1999 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Banishment by a Thousand Laws: Residency Restrictions on Sex Offenders |last1=Yung |first1=Corey Rayburn |volume=85 |number=1 |year=2007 |journal=[[Washington University Law Review]] |url=http://lawreview.wustl.edu/in-print/banishment-by-a-thousand-laws-residency-restrictions-on-sex-offenders/ |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622043911/http://lawreview.wustl.edu/in-print/banishment-by-a-thousand-laws-residency-restrictions-on-sex-offenders/ |archive-date=2010-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first coined after the [[1980 Moscow Olympics]] when all "undesirable elements" (loiterers, prostitutes, alcoholics, etc.) were forcibly removed beyond the eastern boundary of the Moscow Oblast, which lay 101&amp;nbsp;km from Moscow.

== Practice ==
During most of the Soviet era, criminals and other undesirables, including supposedly rehabilitated [[political prisoner]]s returning from the [[Gulag]]s, were often banished from urban centers such as [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=tayler/&gt; It was intended in part to keep undesirable elements away from foreigners, who were usually restricted to areas within {{nowrap|{{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=in}}}} of city centers.&lt;ref name=tayler/&gt;

The rights of an inmate to move freely about the country after release from a [[prison]] would be restricted for a long period. Instead of regular documents, inmates would receive a temporary substitute, a [[wolf ticket (Russia)|"wolf ticket"]] ({{lang-ru|волчий билет|''volchiy bilet''}}), confining them to internal exile without the right to settle closer than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} to large [[urban area|urban]] centres where they would be refused the residency permit (''[[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]]'').

In modern Russia, this 100&amp;nbsp;km restriction has been abolished—although a version of ''propiska'' still remains—and the expression is used in a context similar to that of [[boondocks]]. The cultural divide by the 100&amp;nbsp;km line though still exists in [[Russia]] to some degree.&lt;ref name=tayler/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">'''Proposition 49''' was a proposition in the state of [[California]] on the November 5, 2002 ballot.  The official title was "The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002."  The proposition passed with 3,946,448 (56.7%) votes in favor and 3,023,433 (43.3%) against.  It was placed on the ballot through the [[initiative]] process.  The proposition was heavily pushed and backed by actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and its passage marked his first political success.

When put on the ballot, the question before voters was:
{{quote|''Should funding for before and after school programs be substantially increased, and starting in 2004-05, should general funds be permanently earmarked for this program?''}}

== Official summary ==
The passing of California Proposition 49:
* Increases state grant funds available for before/after school programs, providing tutoring, homework assistance, and educational enrichment.
* Makes every public elementary, middle/junior high school, including charter schools, eligible for after school grants ranging from $50,000–$75,000. Maintains local funding match requirement. California 
* Provides priority for additional funding to schools with predominantly low-income students.
* Requires that, beginning 2004–05, new funding for before/after school programs not be taken from education funding, guaranteed under [[California Proposition 98 (1988)|Proposition 98]]. Gives priority to schools already receiving grants and requires increasing expenditures only if state revenues grow.

== State and Local Government ==
The passing of California Proposition 49 for before and after school programs resulted in an additional annual state costs of up to $455 million, beginning in 2004–05.

[[File:Hikoi-foreshore.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|Protests]] against the [[Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004]], which extinguished claims to aboriginal title to the foreshore and seabeds in New Zealand]]
'''Aboriginal title''' is a [[common law]] doctrine that the  [[Indigenous land rights|land rights]] of [[indigenous peoples]] to [[customary land|customary tenure]] persist after the assumption of [[sovereignty]] under [[settler colonialism]]. The requirements of proof for the recognition of aboriginal title, the content of aboriginal title, the methods of extinguishing aboriginal title, and the availability of compensation in the case of extinguishment vary significantly by jurisdiction. Nearly all jurisdictions are in agreement that aboriginal title is [[Alienation (property law)|inalienable]], and that it may be held [[Individual and group rights|either individually or collectively]].

Aboriginal title was first acknowledged in the early 19th century, in decisions in which indigenous peoples were not a party. Significant aboriginal title litigation resulting in victories for indigenous peoples did not arise until recent decades.  The majority of court cases have been litigated in [[Native title in Australia|Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Aboriginal title in the United States|United States]]. Aboriginal title is an important area of [[comparative law]], with many cases being cited as persuasive authority across jurisdictions. Many commentators believe that the doctrine is applicable in all common law legal systems.

Aboriginal title is also referred to as '''indigenous title''', '''native title''' (particularly in Australia), '''original Indian title''' (particularly in the United States), and '''customary title''' (particularly in New Zealand). Aboriginal title jurisprudence is related to [[indigenous rights]], influencing and influenced by non-land issues, such as whether the government owes a [[fiduciary duty]] to indigenous peoples. While the judge-made doctrine arises from [[customary international law]], it has been codified nationally by legislation,  treaties, and constitutions.

==British colonial legacy==
[[File:Sky Tower, Mohegan Sun, Uncasville, CT.jpg|thumb|The [[Mohegan Sun]] casino commemorates the site of the world's first common-law indigenous land rights case, decided in 1773.]]
Aboriginal title arose at the intersection of three common law doctrines articulated by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]: the [[Act of State]] doctrine, the [[Doctrine of Continuity]], and the [[Recognition Doctrine]].&lt;ref name="m161"&gt;{{smallcaps|McNeil}}, 1989, at 161–179.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of State doctrine held that the Crown could confiscate or extinguish real or personal property rights in the process of conquering, without scrutiny from any British court, but could not perpetrate an Act of State against its own subjects.&lt;ref name="m161"/&gt; The Doctrine of Continuity presumed that the Crown did not intend to extinguish [[private property]] upon acquiring sovereignty, and thus that pre-existing interests were enforceable under British law.&lt;ref name="m161"/&gt; Its mirror was the Recognition Doctrine, which held that private property rights were presumed to be extinguished in the absence of explicit recognition.&lt;ref name="m161"/&gt;

In 1608, the same year in which the Doctrine of Continuity emerged,&lt;ref&gt;''The Case of Tanistry'' (1608) Davis 28 (conquest of Ireland).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witrong v. Blany (1674) 3 Keb. 401 (conquest of Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Coke]] delivered a famous dictum in ''[[Calvin’s Case]]'' (1608) that the laws of all non-Christians would be abrogated upon their conquest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Calvin’s Case]]'' (1608) 77 E.R. 377, 397&amp;ndash;98 (K.B.):&lt;br&gt;"All infidels are in law perpetui inimici, perpetual enemies (for the law presumes not that they will be converted, that being remota potentia, a remote possibility) for between them, as with the devils, whose subjects they be, and the Christian, there is perpetual hostility, and can be no peace; . . . And upon this ground there is a diversity between a conquest of a kingdom of a Christian King, and the conquest of a kingdom of an infidel; for if a King come to a Christian kingdom by conquest, . . . he may at his pleasure alter and change the laws of that kingdom: but until he doth make an alteration of those laws the ancient laws of that kingdom remain. But if a Christian King should conquer a kingdom of an infidel, and bring them under his subjection, there ipso facto the laws of the infidel are abrogated, for that they be not only against Christianity, but against the law of God and of nature, contained in the decalogue; and in that case, until certain laws be established amongst them, the King by himself, and such Judges as he shall appoint, shall judge them and their causes according to natural equity."&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's view was not put into practice, but was rejected by [[Lord Mansfield]] in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell v. Hall (1774) Lofft 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The two doctrines were reconciled, with the Doctrine of Continuity prevailing in nearly all situations (except, for example, public property of the predecessor state) in ''[[Oyekan v Adele]]'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Oyekan &amp; Ors v Adele [1957] 2 All ER 785 (Nigeria).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Indigenous land rights case under the common law, ''[[Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut]]'', was litigated from 1705 to 1773, with the Privy Council affirming without opinion the judgement of a non-judicial tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Walters, [http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/33_4_walters.pdf "'Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut'(1705–1773) and the Legal Status of Aboriginal Customary Laws and Government in British North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706191329/http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/33_4_walters.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }}, 33 ''{{smallcaps|Osgoode Hall L.J.}}'' 4 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;For modern litigation over the same land, see ''Mohegan Tribe v. Connecticut'', 483 F. Supp. 597 (D. Conn. 1980), ''aff’d'', 638 F.2d 612 (2d Cir. 1980), ''cert. denied'' 452 U.S. 968, ''on remand'', 528 F. Supp. 1359 (D. Conn. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Other important Privy Council decisions include ''[[In re Southern Rhodesia]]'' (1919)&lt;ref&gt;In re Southern Rhodesia [1919] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Amodu Tijani v. Southern Nigeria (Secretary)]]'' (1921).&lt;ref name="amodu"&gt;Amodu Tijani v. Southern Nigeria (Secretary), [1921] 2 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former rejected a claim for aboriginal title, noting that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some tribes are so low in the scale of social organization that their usages and conceptions of rights and duties are not to be reconciled with the institutions or the legal ideas of civilized society. Such a gulf cannot be bridged."&lt;ref&gt;In re Southern Rhodesia [1919] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 211, 233&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Two years later, ''Amodu Tijani'' laid the basis for several elements of the modern aboriginal title doctrine, upholding a customary land claim and urging the need to "study of the history of the particular community and its usages in each case."&lt;ref name="amodu"/&gt; Subsequently, the Privy Council issued many opinions confirming the existence of aboriginal title, and upholding customary land claims; many of these arose in African colonies.&lt;ref&gt;In chronological order: ''Sobhuza II v Miller'' [1926] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 518 (Swaziland); ''Sunmonu v Disu Raphael (Deceased)'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 881 (Nigeria); ''Bakare Ajakaiye v Lieutenant Governor of the Southern Provinces'' [1929] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 679 (Nigeria); ''Sakariyawo Oshodi v Moriamo Dakolo'' (4) [1930] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 667 (Nigeria); ''Stool of Abinabina v. Chief Kojo Enyimadu'' (1953) [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 207 (West African Gold Coast); ''Nalukuya (Rata Taito) v Director of Lands'' [1957] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 325 (Fiji); ''Adeyinka Oyekan v Musendiku Adele'' [1957]2 All ER 785 (West Africa).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern decisions have heaped criticism upon the views expressed in ''Southern Rhodesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nyali v Attorney General'' [1956] 1 QB 1 (Lord Denning).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrinal overview==

===Recognition===
The requirements for establishing an aboriginal title to the land vary across countries, but generally speaking, the aboriginal claimant must establish (exclusive) occupation (or possession) from a long time ago, generally before the assertion of [[sovereignty]], and continuity to the present day.

===Content===
Aboriginal title does not constitute [[allodial title]] or [[radical title]] in any jurisdiction. Instead, its content is generally described as a [[usufruct]], i.e. a right to use, although in practice this may mean anything from a right to use land for specific, enumerated purposes, or a general right to use which approximate [[fee simple]].

It is common ground among the relevant jurisdictions that aboriginal title is inalienable, in the sense that it cannot be transferred except to the general government (known, in many of the relevant jurisdictions, as "[[the Crown]]"){{mdash}}although Malaysia allows aboriginal title to be sold between indigenous peoples, unless contrary to [[customary law]]. Especially in Australia, the content of aboriginal title varies with the degree to which claimants are able to satisfy the standard of proof for recognition. In particular, the content of aboriginal title may be tied to the traditions and customs of the indigenous peoples, and only accommodate growth and change to a limited extent.

===Extinguishment===
Aboriginal title can be extinguished by the general government, but again, the requirement to do this varies by country. Some require the legislature to be explicit when it does this, others hold that extinguishment can be inferred from the government's treatment of the land. In Canada, the Crown cannot extinguish aboriginal title without the explicit prior informed consent of the proper aboriginal title holders. New Zealand formerly required consent, but today requires only a justification, akin to a [[public purpose]] requirement.

Jurisdictions differ on whether the state is required to pay compensation upon extinguishing aboriginal title. Theories for the payment of compensation include the [[right to property]], as protected by constitutional or common law, and the breach of a [[fiduciary duty]].

==Percentage of land==
* [[Native title in Australia|Native title]] in Australia - 1,228,373 km2 (or approximately 16 per cent of the country)
* [[Indian reserve]]s in Canada - 28,000 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi, 0.2804% of Canada's land area)
* [[Native Community Lands]] in [[Bolivia]] - 16.8 million hectares (15% of Bolivia's land area)
* [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous territories]] in Brazil - 1,105,258 km2 (13% of the country's land area)
* [[Indigenous territory (Colombia)|Indigenous territories]] in Colombia - {{convert|1141748|km2}} (31.5% of the country's land area)
* [[Indian reservation]]s in the [[United States]] - 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2 or 2.308% of the country's land area)

==History by jurisdiction==

===Australia===
{{main|Native title in Australia}}
Australia did not experience native title litigation until the 1970s, when [[Indigenous Australians]] (both [[Australian Aborigines]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]]) became more politically active.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Several earlier cases tangentially involved issues of native title: ''Attorney-General v Brown'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLeggeSC/1847/2.pdf (1847) 1 Legge 312]; 2 SCR (NSW) App 30; {{cite BAILII| litigants=Cooper v Stuart |year=1889 |court=UKPC |num=16 |format=1 |parallelcite=(1889) 14 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 286 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|33|1913|litigants=Williams v Attorney General (NSW) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/Cth/HCA/1913/33.pdf (1913) 16 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 404] |courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|63|1959|litigants=Randwick Corporation v Rutledge |parallelcite=(1959) 102 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 54 |courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|28|1969|litigants=Wade v New South Wales Rutile Mining Co Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1969) 121 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 177 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Richard Blackburn|Blackburn J]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]] rejected the concept in ''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'' (the "Gove land rights case").&lt;ref name="Milirrpum"&gt;''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'' (1971) 17 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 141 (27 April 1971) [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory|Supreme Court]] (NT, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission]] was established in 1973 in the wake of ''Milirrpum''. [[Paul Coe]], in ''Coe v Commonwealth'' (1979), attempted (unsuccessfully) to bring a [[class action]] on behalf of all Aborigines claiming all of Australia.&lt;ref name="Coe v Cth"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|68|1979|litigants=Coe v Commonwealth |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]],&lt;ref name="Aboriginal Land Rights Act"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|alrta1976444|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established a statutory procedure that returned approximately 40% of the [[Northern Territory]] to Aboriginal ownership; the ''[[Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981]]'',&lt;ref name="APY Act"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|SA|act|apylra1981489|Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had a similar effect in [[South Australia]].

The [[High Court of Australia]], after paving the way in [[Mabo v Queensland (No 1)|''Mabo No 1'']] by striking down a State statute under the ''[[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]'',&lt;ref name="Mabo #1"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|69|1988|litigants=[[Mabo v Queensland (No 1)]] |parallelcite=(1988) 166 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 186 |date=8 December 1988 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; overruled ''Milirrpum'' in ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Mabo #2"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|23|1992|litigants=[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |date=3 June 1992 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mabo No 2'', rejecting ''[[terra nullius]]'', held that native title exists (6–1) and is extinguishable by the sovereign (7–0), without compensation (4–3). In the wake of the decision, the Australian Parliament passed the [[Native Title Act 1993]] (NTA),&lt;ref name="Native Title Act"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|nta1993147|Native Title Act}}.&lt;/ref&gt; codifying the doctrine and establishing the [[National Native Title Tribunal]] (NNTT).

In 1996, the High Court held that [[pastoral lease]]s, which cover nearly half of Australia, do not extinguish native title in ''[[Wik Peoples v Queensland]]''.&lt;ref name="Wik HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1996|litigants=Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland |parallelcite=(1996) 187 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |date=23 December 1996 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Parliament passed the [[Native Title Amendment Act 1998]] (the "Ten Point Plan"), extinguishing a variety of Aboriginal land rights and giving state governments the ability to follow suit.

''[[Western Australia v Ward]]'' (2002) held that native title is a [[bundle of rights]], which may be extinguished one by one, for example, by a mining lease.&lt;ref name="Ward HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|28|2002|litigants=[[Western Australia v Ward]] |parallelcite=(2002) 213 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto |date=8 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yorta Yorta v Victoria]]'' (2002), an appeal from the first native title claim to go to trial since the Native Title Act, adopted strict requirements of continuity of traditional laws and customs for native title claims to succeed.&lt;ref name="Yorta Yorta HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|58|2002|litigants=[[Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria]] |parallelcite=(2002) 214 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 422}} {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2002/hca58-2002-12-12.pdf |title=Judgment Summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia) |date=12 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belize===
In ''[[A-G for British Honduras v Bristowe]]'' (1880), the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] held that the property rights of British subjects who had been living in [[Belize]] under Spanish rule with limited property rights, were enforceable against the Crown, and had been upgraded to [[fee simple]] during the gap between Spanish and British sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |court=UKPC |year=1880 |num=46 |format=1 |litigants=Attorney-General for British Honduras v Bristowe |parallelcite=(1880) 6 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 143 |courtname=auto |juris=British Honduras}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision did not involve indigenous peoples, but was an important example of the key doctrines that underlie aboriginal title.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|McNeil}}, 1989, at 141&amp;ndash;147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botswana===
A [[Botswana]] High Court recognized aboriginal title in ''[[Sesana and Others v Attorney General]]'' (2006), a case brought by named plaintiff [[Roy Sesana]], which held that the [[Bushmen|San]] have the right to reside in the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] (CKGR), which was violated by their 2001 eviction.&lt;ref&gt;Sesana and Others v Attorney General (52/2002) [2006] BWHC 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision quoted ''Mabo'' and other international case law, and based the right on the San's occupation of their traditional lands from [[time immemorial]]. The court described the right as a "right to use and occupy the lands" rather than a right of ownership. The government has interpreted the ruling very narrowly and has allowed only a small number of San to re-enter the CKGR.

===Canada===
{{further|Canadian Indigenous law}}
Aboriginal title has been recognized in Common Law in [[Canada]] since the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]], in ''[[St. Catherines Milling v. The Queen|St. Catharines Milling v. The Queen]]'' (1888), characterized it as a personal [[usufruct]] at the pleasure of the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Catharines Milling v. The Queen'' (1888) 14 App. Cas. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This case did not involve indigenous parties, but rather was a lumber dispute between the provincial government of Ontario and the federal government of Canada. ''St. Catharines'' was decided in the wake of the [[Indian Act]] (1876), which laid out an assimilationist policy towards the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] ([[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]]), allowed provinces to abrogate treaties (until 1951), and made it a federal crime to prosecute First Nation claims in court, raise money, or organize to pursue such claims.&lt;ref&gt;66 WashLRev 643&lt;/ref&gt;

''St. Catharines'' was more or less the prevailing law until ''[[Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General)]]'' (1973). All seven of the judges in ''Calder'' agreed that the claimed Aboriginal title existed, and did not solely depend upon the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].&lt;ref name="calder"&gt;''[[Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General)]]'' (1973) 34 DRL (3d) 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the judges split 3–3 on the question of whether Aboriginal title had been extinguished.  The [[Nisga'a]] did not prevail because the seventh justice, Pigeon J, found that the Court did not have jurisdiction to make a declaration in favour of the Nisga'a in the absence of a fiat of the Lieutenant-Governor of B.C. permitting suit against the provincial government.&lt;ref name="calder"/&gt;

Section 91(24) of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] ("British North America Act 1867") gives the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over First Nations, and thus the exclusive ability to extinguish Aboriginal title. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982]] explicitly recognized and preserved aboriginal rights. ''[[R. v. Guerin]]'' (1982), the first [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision handed down after the Constitution Act 1982, declared that Aboriginal title was ''[[sui generis]]'' and that the federal government has a [[fiduciary duty]] to preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Guerin]]'' [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 (Wilson J.).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[R. v. Simon]]'' (1985) overruled ''[[R. v. Syliboy]]'' (1929)&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Syliboy'' [1929] 1 D.L.R. 307 (Nova Scotia County Court).&lt;/ref&gt; which had held that Aboriginal peoples had no capacity to enter into treaties, and thus that the [[Numbered Treaties]] were void.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Simon'' [1985] 2 S.C.R. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of non-land rights cases, anchored on the Constitution Act 1982, have also been influential.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Sparrow]]'' [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Adams]]''  (1996) 138 DLR (4th) 657.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Van der Peet]]'' (1996) 137 DLR (4th) 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Côté]]'' [1996] 3 S.C.R. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Sappier'' [2006] 2 S.C.R. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Morris'' [2006] 2 S.C.R. 915.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]'' (1997) laid down the essentials of the current test to prove Aboriginal title: "in order to make out a claim for [A]boriginal title, the [A]boriginal group asserting title must satisfy the following criteria: (i) the land must have been occupied prior to sovereignty, (ii) if present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation, and (iii) at sovereignty, that occupation must have been exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]'' [1997] 153 D.L.R. (4th).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mitchell v. Canada'' [2001] 1 S.C.R. 911.&lt;br&gt;"Stripped to essentials, an [A]boriginal claimant must prove a modern practice, tradition or custom that has a reasonable degree of continuity with the practices, traditions or customs that existed prior to contact. The practice, custom or tradition must have been "integral to the distinctive culture" of the [A]boriginal peoples, in the sense that it distinguished or characterized their traditional culture and lay at the core of the peoples' identity. It must be a "defining feature" of the Aboriginal society, such that the culture would be "fundamentally altered" without it. It must be a feature of "central significance" to the peoples' culture, one that "truly made the society what it was" (Van der Peet, supra, at paras. 54–59). This excludes practices, traditions and customs that are only marginal or incidental to the Aboriginal society's cultural identity, and emphasizes practices, traditions and customs that are vital to the life, culture and identity of the aboriginal society in question.” (Paragraph 12)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia'', 2007 BCSC 1700.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Marshall]]'', 2005 SCC 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, R.. "The Content and Proof of Native Title: Delgamuukw v Queen in right of British Columbia", ''Indigenous Law Bulletin'' 19 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, R., "The Different Approach to Native Title in Canada," ''Australian Law Librarian'' 9(1): 32–41 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent decisions have drawn on the fiduciary duty to limit the ways in which the Crown can extinguish Aboriginal title,&lt;ref&gt;''Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town)'', 2001 SCC 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and to require prior consultation where the government has knowledge of a credible, but yet unproven, claim to Aboriginal title.&lt;ref&gt;''Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)'', 2004 SCC 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canada Heritage)'', 2005 SCC 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously for the plaintif in ''[[Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia]]''. Rejecting the government's claim that Aboriginal title applied only to villages and fishing sites, it instead agreed with the First Nation that Aboriginal title extends to the entire traditional territory of an indigenous group, even if that group was semi-nomadic and did not create settlements on that territory.  It also stated that governments must have consent from First Nations which hold Aboriginal title in order to approve developments on that land, and governments can override the First Nation's wishes only in exceptional circumstances.  The court reaffirmed, however, that areas under Aboriginal title are not outside the jurisdiction of the provinces, and provincial law still applies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Landmark+Supreme+Court+ruling+grants+land+title+Tsilhqot+First/9970838/story.html|title=Landmark Supreme Court ruling grants land title to B.C.

===Malaysia===
[[Malaysia]] recognized various statutory rights related to native customary laws ("''[[adat]]''")  before its courts acknowledged the independent existence of common law aboriginal title. Native Customary Rights (NCR) and Native Customary Land (NCL) are provided for under section 4(2) of the National Land Code 1965, the Sarawak Land Code 1957, the respective provisions of the National Land Code (Penang and Malacca Titles) Act 1963, and the Customary Tenure Enactment (FMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apem/borneo/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html|title=Defining Native Customary Rights to Land|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajah's Order IX of 1875 recognized aboriginal title by providing for its extinguishment where cleared land was abandoned. Rajah's Order VIII of 1920 ("Land Order 1920") divided "State Lands" into four categories, one of them being "native holdings," and provided for the registration of customary holdings. The Aboriginal People's Act 1954 creates aboriginal areas and reserves, also providing for state acquisition of land without compensation. Article 160 of the Federal Constitution declares that custom has the force of law.

Malaysian court decisions from the 1950s on have held that customary lands were [[inalienable right|inalienable]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sumbang Anak Sekam v Engkarong Anak Ajah'' [1958] SCR 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sat Anak Akum &amp; Anor v RAndong Anak Charanak Charereng'' [1958] SCR 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Galau &amp; Ors v Penghuluimang &amp; Ors'' [1967] 1 MLJ 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bisi ak Jinggot @ Hilarion Bisi ak Jenggut v Superintendent of Lands and Surveys Kuching Division &amp; Ors'' [2008] 4 MLJ 415.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sapiah binti Mahmud (F) v Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Samarahan Division &amp; 2 Ors'' [2009] MLJU 0410.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, aboriginal rights were declared to be property rights, as protected by the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Selangor Pilot Association v Government of Malaysia'' [1975] 2 MLJ 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions in the 1970s and 1980s blocked state-sanctioned logging on customary land.&lt;ref&gt;''Keruntum Sdn Bhd v. Minister of Resource Planning'' [1987].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Koperasi Kijang Mas v. Kerajaan Negeri Perak'' [1991] CLJ 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Mokhtar Sidin]] JCA of the Jahore High Court became the first Malaysian judge to acknowledge common law aboriginal title in ''[[Adong bin Kuwau v. Kerajaan Negeri Johor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Adong bin Kuwau v. Kerajaan Negeri Johor'' [1997] 1 MLJ 418.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court cited the Federal Constitution and the Aboriginal Peoples Act, as well as decisions from the Privy Council, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. That case was the first time where [[Orang Asli]] directly and expressly challenged a state taking of their land. The opinion held that: "the aborigines' common law rights include, inter alia, the right to live on their land as their forefathers had lived." The case was upheld on appeal, but the Federal Court did not write an opinion.&lt;ref&gt;''Kerajaan Negri Johor &amp; Anor v Adong bin Kuwau &amp; Ors'' [1998] 2 MLJ 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later High Court and Court of Appeal decisions built upon the foundation of ''Adong bin Kuwau''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nor anak Nyawai &amp; Ors v Borneo Pulp Plantation Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors'' [2001] 6 MLJ 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sagong bin Tasi &amp; Ors v Kerajaan Negeri Selangor &amp; Ors'' [2002] 2 MLJ 591.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kerajaan Negeri Selangor &amp; Ors v Sagong Bin Tasi &amp; Ors'' [2005] 6 MLJ 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Amit bin Salleh &amp; Ors v The Superindent, Land &amp; Survey Department, Bintulu &amp; Ors'' [2005] 7 MLJ 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Madeli bin Salleh (Suing as Administrator of the Estate of the Deceased, Salleh bin Kilong) v Superintendent of Lands &amp; Surveys (Miri Division) and Ors'' [2005] MLJU 240; [2005] 5 MLJ 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Superintendent of Lands &amp; Surveys, Bintulu v Nor Anak Nyawai &amp; Ors'' [2005] 4 AMR 621; [2006] 1 MLJ 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hamit bin Matusin &amp; Ors v Penguasa Tanah dan Survei &amp; Anor'' [2006] 3 MLJ 289.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ability for indigenous peoples to bring such suits was seriously limited by a 2005 ruling that claims must be brought under [[Rules of the High Court|O. 53 RHC]], rather than the [[representative action]] provision.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaharuddin bin Ali &amp; Anor v Superintendent of Lands and Surveys, Kuching Division &amp; Anor'' [2005] 2 MLJ 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Federal Court of Malaysia]] wrote an opinion endorsing common law aboriginal title for the first time in ''[[Superintendent of Lands v. Madeli bin Salleh]]''.&lt;ref name="2007 6 CLJ 509"&gt;''Superintendent of Lands &amp; Surveys Miri Division &amp; Anor v Madeli bin Salleh (suing as the administrator of the estate of the deceased, Salleh bin Kilong)'' [2007] 6 CLJ 509; [2008] 2 MLJ 677.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Court endorsed ''Mabo'' and ''Calder'', stating that "the proposition of law as enunciated in these two cases reflected the common law position with regard to native titles throughout the Commonwealth."&lt;ref name="2007 6 CLJ 509"/&gt;{{rp|para 19}} The High Court of Kuching held in 2010, for the first time, that NCL may be transferred for [[consideration]] between members of the same community, as long as such transfers are not contrary to [[customary law]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mohamad Rambli bin Kawi v Superintendent of Lands Kuching &amp; Anor'' [2010] 8 MLJ 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (1840)]]
New Zealand was the second jurisdiction in the world to recognize aboriginal title, but a slew of extinguishing legislation (beginning with the [[New Zealand land confiscations]]) has left the [[Māori people|Māori]] with little to claim except for [[river beds]], [[lake beds]], and the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore and seabed]]. In 1847, in a decision that was not appealed to the Privy Council, the Supreme Court of the colony of New Zealand recognized aboriginal title in ''[[R v Symonds]]''.&lt;ref name="R v Symonds"&gt;''[[R v Symonds]]'' {{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/NZLostCases/CaseDetails.aspx?casenumber=00047|title=(1847) NZPCC 387.|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501135340/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/NZLostCases/CaseDetails.aspx?casenumber=00047 |archive-date=1 May 2014 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on common law and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (1840). [[Henry Samuel Chapman|Chapman J]] went farther than any judge&amp;mdash;before or since&amp;mdash;in declaring that aboriginal title "cannot be extinguished (at least in times of peace) otherwise than by the free consent of the Native occupiers".&lt;ref name="R v Symonds"/&gt;{{rp|390}}

The New Zealand Parliament responded with the [[Maori Lands Act 1862]] and the [[Native Rights Act 1865]] which established the Native Land Court (today the [[Māori Land Court]]) to hear aboriginal title claims, and&amp;mdash;if proven&amp;mdash;convert them into freehold interests that could be sold to [[Pākehā]] (New Zealanders of European descent). That court created the "1840 rule," which converted Māori interests into [[fee simple]] if they were sufficiently in existence in 1840, or else disregarded them.&lt;ref&gt;''Oakura'' (1866) (unreported) (CJ Fenton).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kauwaeranga'' (1870)  (unreported).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Symonds'' remained the guiding principle,&lt;ref&gt;''Re Lundon and Whitaker Claims Act 1871'' (1872) NZPCC 387.&lt;/ref&gt; until ''[[Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington]]'' (1877).&lt;ref&gt;''Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington'' (1877) 3 N.Z. Jur. (N.S.) 72.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wi Parata'' undid ''Symonds'', advocating the doctrine of ''[[terra nullius]]'' and declaring the Treaty of Waitangi unenforceable.

The Privy Council disagreed in ''[[Nireaha Tamaki v Baker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Nireaha Tamaki v Baker]] |court=UKPC |year=1901 |num=18 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1901] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 561 |courtname=auto |juris=New Zealand}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other rulings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Te Teira Te Paea v [[Te Roera Tareha]] |court=UKPC |year=1901 |num=50 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1902] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 56 |courtname=auto |juris=New Zealand}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Wallis v Solicitor-General for New Zealand |court=UKPC |year=1901 |num=50 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1903] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 173 |courtname=auto |juris=New Zealand}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but courts in New Zealand continued to hand down decisions materially similar to ''Wi Parata''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hohepa Wi Neera v Wallis (Bishop of Wellington)'' [http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZGazLawRp/1902/175.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[1902]&lt;/nowiki&gt; NZGazLawRp 175]; (1902) 21 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 655, [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] (New Zealand)..&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Coal Mines Amendment Act 1903]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Currently, section 261 of the [[Coal Mines Act 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Native Land Act 1909]] declared aboriginal title unenforceable against the Crown.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Land was also lost under other legislation. The Counties Act 1886 s.245 said that tracks, "''over any Crown lands or Native lands, and generally used without obstruction as roads, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be public roads, not exceeding sixty-six feet in width, and under the control of the Council''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/ca188650v1886n49196/|title=Counties Act 1886|last=|first=|date=|website=NZLII|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to such confiscation was met by force, as at [[Lake Opuatia#History|Opuatia]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH18940310.2.78|title=The Opuatia Survey Dispute,|date=1894-03-10|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=2018-04-27|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Acts, beginning a year after the Treaty of Waitangi with the Land Claims Ordinance 1841, allowed the government to take and sell 'Waste Lands'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trc.org.nz/sites/trc.org.nz/files/Treaty%20education%20resources/Treaty%20Violations.pdf|title=Some Government Breaches of Te Tiriti o Waitangi|last=|first=|date=|website=Treaty Resource Centre|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favorable court decisions turned aboriginal title litigation towards the lake beds,&lt;ref&gt;''Tamihana Korokai v Solicitor-General'' (1912) 32 NZLR 321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Lake Omapere'' (1929) 11 Bay of Islands MB 253.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Māori were unsuccessful in claiming the rivers&lt;ref&gt;''In Re Bed of Wanganui River'' [1955].&lt;/ref&gt; the beaches,&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Re Ninety-Mile Beach]]'' [1963] NZLR 461.&lt;/ref&gt; and customary fishing rights on the foreshore.&lt;ref&gt;''Keepa v. Inspector of Fisheries; consolidated with Wiki v. Inspector of Fisheries'' [1965] NZLR 322.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Limitation Act 1950]] established a 12-year [[statute of limitations]] for aboriginal title claims (6 years for damages), and the [[Maori Affairs Act 1953]] prevented the enforcement of customary tenure against the Crown. The [[Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975]] created the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] to issue non-binding decisions, concerning alleged breaches of the Treaty, and [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|facilitate settlements]].

''[[Te Weehi v Regional Fisheries Office]]'' (1986) was the first modern case to recognize an aboriginal title claim in a New Zealand court since ''Wi Parata'', granting non-exclusive customary fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Te Weehi v Regional Fisheries Office'' (1986) 1 NZLR 682.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court cited the writings of Dr [[Paul McHugh]] and indicated that whilst the Treaty of Waitangi confirmed those property rights, their legal foundation was the common law principle of continuity.   The Crown did not appeal ''Te Weehi'' which was regarded as the motivation for Crown settlement of the sea fisheries claims (1992).  Subsequent cases began meanwhile – and apart from the common law doctrine – to rehabilitate the Treaty of Waitangi, declaring it the "fabric of New Zealand society" and thus relevant even to legislation of general applicability.&lt;ref&gt;''Huakina Development Trust v Waikato Valley Authority [1987] 2 NZLR 188.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General]]'' held that the government owed a duty analogous to a [[fiduciary duty]] toward the Māori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NZLII|court=NZCA |year=1987 |num=60 |litigants=New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General |parallelcite=[1987] 1 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 641 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NZLII|court=NZCA |year=2007 |num=269 |litigants=New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General |parallelcite= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This cleared the way for a variety of Treaty-based non-land Māori customary rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Tainui Maori Trust Board v Attorney-General'' [1989] 2 NZLR 513 (coal).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Te Runanganui o Te Ika Whenua Inc Society v Attorney-General'' [1990] 2 NZLR 641 (fishing rights).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ngai Tahu Maori Trust Board v Director-General of Conservation'' [1995] 3 NZLR 553 (whale watching).&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the Waitangi Tribunal in its ''Muriwhenua Fishing Report'' (1988) was describing Treaty-based and common law aboriginal title derived rights as complementary and having an 'aura' of their own.

Circa the [[Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993]], less than 5% of New Zealand was held as Māori customary land. In 2002, the Privy Council confirmed that the Maori Land Court, which does not have [[judicial review]] jurisdiction, was the exclusive forum for territorial aboriginal title claims (i.e. those equivalent to a customary title claim)&lt;ref&gt;''McGuire v Hastings District Council'' [2000] UKPC 43; [2002] 2 NZLR 577.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, ''[[Ngati Apa v Attorney-General]]'' overruled ''[[In Re the Ninety-Mile Beach]]'' and ''Wi Parata'', declaring that Māori could bring claims to the foreshore in Land Court.&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Ngati Apa'' [2002] 2 NZLR 661.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v Ngati Apa'' [2003] 3 NZLR 643.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also indicated that customary aboriginal title interests (non-territorial) might also remain around the coastline.  The [[Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004]] extinguished those rights before any lower court could hear a claim to either territorial customary title (the Maori Land Court) or non-territorial customary rights (the High Court's inherent common law jurisdiction). That legislation has been condemned by the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]].  The 2004 Act was repealed with the passage of the [[Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011]].

===Papua New Guinea===
The [[High Court of Australia]], which had appellate jurisdiction before 1975, recognized aboriginal title in [[Papua New Guinea]]&amp;mdash;decades before it did so in Australia&amp;mdash;in ''[[Geita Sebea v Territory of Papua]]'' (1941),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|37|1941|litigants=Geita Sebea v Territory of Papua |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/Cth/HCA/1941/373.pdf (1941) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 544] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Administration of Papua and New Guinea v Daera Guba]]'' (1973) (the "Newtown case"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|59|1973|litigants=Administration of Papua and New Guinea v Daera Guba |parallelcite=(1973) 130 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|75|1964|litigants=Custodian of Expropriated Property v Tedep |parallelcite=(1964) 113 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 318 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|62|1969|litigants=Teori Tau v The Commonwealth |parallelcite=(19659) 119 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 564 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea]] followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolain, Tapalau, Tomaret, Towarunga, and Other Villagers of Latlat Village v Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea; In re Vulcan Land'' [1965–66] PNGLR 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea v Blasius Tirupia and Others (In Re Vunapaladig and Japalik Land)'' [1971–72] P&amp;NGLR 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rahonamo v Enai and Another (Re Hitau)'' (1971) unreported judgment N612 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Toare Karakara v The Independent State of Papua New Guines'' [1986] PNGLR 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Madaha Resena and Others v The Independent State of Papua New Guinea'' [1990] PNGLR 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schedule 2 of the [[Constitution of Papua New Guinea]] recognizes [[customary land tenure]], and 97% of the land in the country remains unalienated.

===South Africa===
[[File:Tylecodon paniculatus-PICT2534.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Richtersveld]] desert]]
In ''[[Alexkor v Richtersveld Community]]'' (2003), a suit under the [[Restitution of Land Rights Act 1994]],&lt;ref name="alexkor"&gt;''Alexkor Ltd v Richtersveld Community'' [2003] ZACC 18; 2004 (5) SA 460; 2003 (12) BCLR 1301.&lt;/ref&gt; lawyers gathered case law from settler jurisdictions around the world, and judges of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] of South Africa talked frankly about Aboriginal title.&lt;ref name="cavanagh13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanagh|first1=Edward|title=The History of Dispossession at Orania and the Politics of Land Restitution in South Africa|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|date=June 2013|volume=39|issue=2|pages=391–407|doi=10.1080/03057070.2013.795811}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Claims Court had dismissed the complaint of the [[Richtersveld]] peoples, whose land was seized by a government owned [[List of diamond mines|diamond mining operation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Richtersveld Community v Alexkor Ltd and Anor'', 2001 (3) 1293 (22 March 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of Appeal disagreed, citing ''Mabo'' and ''Yorta Yorta'', but held that the aboriginal title had been extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;''Richtersveld Community &amp; Ors v Alexkor Limited &amp; Anor'' (unreported, 24 March 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the precedent will be the start of further land rights claims by indigenous peoples is an open question, given the cut-off date of 1913 in the Restitution Act.&lt;ref&gt;Dorsett, S., "Making Amends for Past Injustice: Restitution of Land Rights in South Africa," '''4'''(23) ''Indigenous Law Bulletin'' 4(23), pp. 9–11 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mostert, H. and Fitzpatrick, P., ''Law Against Law: Indigenous Rights and the Richtersveld Decision'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, S., "The Foundations of Aboriginal Title in South Africa? The Richtersveld Community v Alexkor Ltd Decisions," ''Indigenous Law Bulletin'' 18 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The case ultimately did not lead to the inclusion of the Aboriginal title in South African doctrine.&lt;ref name="cavanagh13"/&gt; Legal scholars allege that this is because the application of terms like ‘indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ in a South African context would lead to a number of contradictions.&lt;ref name="cavanagh13"/&gt;

The identity of the indigenous groups in South Africa is not self-evident.&lt;ref name="lehmann"/&gt; The adoption of a strict definition, including only communities descended from [[San people|San]] and [[Khoekhoe]] people, would entail the exclusion of black African communities, an approach deemed detrimental to the spirit of national unity.&lt;ref name="lehmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehmann|first1=Karin|title=Aboriginal Title, Indigenous Rights and the Right to Culture|journal=South African Journal on Human Rights|date=7 April 2017|volume=20|issue=1|pages=86–118|doi=10.1080/19962126.2004.11864810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of the [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Natives Land Act]] also means that few communities retain relationships with the land of which they held before 1913.&lt;ref name="lehmann"/&gt;

===Tanzania===
In 1976, the [[Barabaig people]] challenged their eviction from the Hanang District of the Manyara Region, due to the government's decision to grow wheat in the region, funded by the [[Canadian Food Aid Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Bukunda Kilanga and Others'', High Court Sessional Case No. 168 of 1976 (Unreported).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Noya Gomusha and Others v. R.''[1980] TLR 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The wheat program would later become the National Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO). NAFCO would lose a different suit to the Mulbadaw Village Council in 1981, which upheld customary land rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Mulbadaw Village Council and 67 Others v. National Agricultural and Food Corporation'', High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Civil Case No. 10 of 1981 (Unreported).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Appeal of Tanzania]] overturned the judgement in 1985, without reversing the doctrine of aboriginal title, holding that the specific claimants had not proved that they were native.&lt;ref&gt;''National Agricultural and Food Corporation v. Mulbadaw Village Council and Others'' [1985] TLR 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Extinction of Customary Land Right Order 1987,&lt;ref&gt;Government Notice No. 88 of 13 February 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; which purported to extinguish Barabaig customary rights,  was declared null and void that year.&lt;ref&gt;''Tito Saturo and 7 Others v. Matiya Seneya and Others'', High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Civil Appeal No. 27 of 1985 (Unreported) (Chua, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal delivered a decision in 1994 that sided with the aboriginal title claimant on nearly all issues, but ultimately ruled against them, holding that the Constitution (Consequential, Transitional and Temporary Provisions) Act, 1984&amp;mdash;which rendered the constitutional right to property enforceable in court&amp;mdash;was not retroactive.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=tz/cases/TZCA/1994/1.html Attorney-General v. Lohay Akonaay and Another]'' [1994] TZCA 1; [1995] 2 LRC 399 (Court of Appeal of Tanzania, Civil Appeal No. 31 of 1994) (Nyalali, C.J.).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] were awarded monetary compensation and alternative land by the Court of Appeal due to their eviction from the [[Mkomazi Game Reserve]] when a foreign investor started a [[Rhinoceros|rhino]] farm.&lt;ref&gt;''Lekengere Faru Parutu Kamunyu and 52 Others v. Minister for Tourism, Natural Resources and Environment and 3 Others'', Civil Appeal No 53 of 1998, unreported, (1999) 2 CHRLD 416 (Court of Appeal of Tanzania at Arusha) (Nyalali, C.J.).&lt;/ref&gt; The government has yet to comply with the ruling.

===United States===
{{main|Aboriginal title in the United States}}
The United States, under the tenure of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], became the first jurisdiction in the world to judicially acknowledge (in ''[[dicta]]'') the existence of aboriginal title in [[aboriginal title in the Marshall Court|series of key decisions]]. Marshall envisioned a [[usufruct]], whose content was limited only by "their own discretion," inalienable except to the federal government, and extinguishable only by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'', 21 U.S. 543, 573 (1823).&lt;/ref&gt; Early state court decisions also presumed the existence of some form of aboriginal title.&lt;ref&gt;''Marshall v. Clark'', 1 Ky. 77 (1791).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Goodell v. Jackson'', 20 Johns. 693 (N.Y. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later cases established that aboriginal title could be terminated only by the "clear and plain intention" of the federal government, a test that has been adopted by most other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Santa Fe Pac. R. Co.'', 314 U.S. 339 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government was found to owe a [[fiduciary duty]] to the holders of aboriginal title, but such duty did not become enforceable until the late-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock'', 187 U.S. 553 (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seminole Nation v. United States]]'', 316 U.S. 286 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''United States v Sioux Nation'', 448 U.S. 371 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the property right itself is not created by statute, [[Sovereign immunity in the United States|sovereign immunity]] barred the enforcement of aboriginal title until the passage of the [[Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946]],&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|25|70}}, et seq {{usc|28|1505}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which created the [[Indian Claims Commission]] (succeeded by the [[United States Court of Claims]] in 1978, and later the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] in 1982). These bodies have no authority to title land, only to pay compensation. ''[[United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks]]'' (1946) was the first ever judicial compensation for a taking of Indian lands unrecognized by a specific treaty obligation.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks'', 329 U.S. 40 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States]]'' (1955) established that the extinguishment of aboriginal title was not a "[[Takings Clause|taking]]" within the meaning of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States'', 348 U.S. 272 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of this precedent, claimants in the Court of Federal Claims have been denied interest&amp;mdash;which otherwise would be payable under Fifth Amendment jurisprudence&amp;mdash;totalling billions of dollars ($9 billion alone, as estimated by a footnote in ''Tee-Hit-Ton'', in interest for claims then pending based on existing jurisdictional statutes).&lt;ref&gt;''Fort Berthold Reservation v. United States'', 390 F.2d 686, 690 (Ct. Cl. 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, the United States allows aboriginal title to be created post-sovereignty; rather than existing since pre-sovereignty, aboriginal title need only have existed for a "long time" (as little as 30 years) to be compensable.&lt;ref&gt;''Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas v. United States'', 28 Fed Cl 95 (1993); order modified by 2000 WL 1013532 (unreported).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictions rejecting the doctrine==
[[File:Mutiny HMS Bounty.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]] landed on the [[Pitcairn Islands]], hundreds of years after archaeologists estimate the original [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] inhabitants departed.]]  
There is no possibility for aboriginal title litigation in some [[Commonwealth]] jurisdictions; for instance, [[Barbados]] and [[Pitcairn Islands]] were uninhabited for hundreds of years prior to colonization, although they had previously been inhabited by the [[Arawak]] and [[Island Caribs|Carib]], and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] peoples, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, 1989, pp. 136–141, 147–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Unlike most jurisdictions, the doctrine that aboriginal title is [[inalienable right|inalienable]] never took hold in India. Sales of land from indigenous persons to both British subjects and aliens were widely upheld.&lt;ref&gt;''Freeman v. Fairie'' (1828) 1 Moo. IA 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pratt-Yorke opinion]] (1757), a joint opinion of England's Attorney-General and Solicitor-General, declared that land purchases by the [[British East India Company]] from the [[Princely state]]s were valid even without a crown patent authorizing the purchase.

In a 1924 appeal from India, the Privy Council issued an opinion that largely corresponded to the Continuity Doctrine: ''[[Vaje Singji Jorava Ssingji v Secretary of State for India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vaje Singji Jorava Ssingji v Secretary of State for India'' (1924) L.R. 51 I.A. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; This line of reasoning was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of India]] in a line of decisions, originating with the proprietary claims of the former rulers of the Princely states, as well as their heirs and assigns.&lt;ref&gt;''Virendra Singh &amp; Ors v. The State of Uttar Pradesh'' [1954] INSC 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Vinod Kumar Shantilal Gosalia v. Gangadhar Narsingdas Agarwal &amp; Ors'' [1981] INSC 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sardar Govindrao &amp; Ors v. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors'' [1982] INSC 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R.C. Poudyal &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors'' [1993] INSC 77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adivasi]] land rights litigation has yielded little result. Most Adivasi live in state-owned forests.

'''Advancement''' is a [[common law]] doctrine of [[Intestacy|intestate succession]] that presumes that [[Gift (law)|gifts]] given to a person's [[heir]] during that person's life are intended as an advance on what that heir would inherit upon the death of the parent.

==Example==
Suppose person P had two children, A and B. Suppose also that P had $100,000, and gave $20,000 to child A before P's death, leaving $80,000 in P's estate. If P died without a will, and A and B were P's only heirs, A and B would be entitled to split P's estate evenly. If the doctrine of advancement were not applied, then each child would receive half of the remaining $80,000, or $40,000. However, if the doctrine of advancement is applied, then the $20,000 already given to A would be considered part of P's estate advanced to A. Thus, the estate would still be valued at $100,000, and each heir would be entitled to $50,000, with the $20,000 already given to A being counted as part of his share. Of the remaining $80,000, A would take $30,000 and B would take $50,000.

==History==
The principle is of ancient origin; as regards [[Personal property|goods and chattels]] it was part of the ancient customs of [[London]] and the province of [[York]], and as regards land descending in [[Hereditary title#Coparcenary|coparcenary]] (under which only one heir can claim an inheritance) it was always part of the common law of England under the name of ''[[hotchpot]]''. Land which belongs or would belong to a child as heir need not be brought in to the common fund, even though such land was given during the father's{{efn|At the time the common law was established, inheritance was universally considered to be from father to sons}} life.

The widow can gain no advantage from any advancement. No child can be forced to account for his or her advancement, but instead he will be excluded from a share in the intestate's estate. The usual judicial view was that any considerable sum of money paid to a child at that child's request is an advancement; thus payment of a son's debts of honour has been held to be an advancement. On the other hand, trivial gifts and presents to a child were undoubtedly not advancements.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Advancement|volume=1|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary law==
A number of [[jurisdiction]]s have enacted statutes which ameliorate the doctrine of advancement by requiring, for example, that the person giving the gift must indicate in writing that it is intended to be counted as an advancement against the estate. The [[Uniform Probate Code]], which has been adopted in whole or in part by a number of states, limits the doctrine by requiring a contemporaneous writing from the deceased, or any writing from the property recipient, indicating that the property is intended to be treated as an advance upon the estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/upc/final2005.htm Uniform Probate Code] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602005504/http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/upc/final2005.htm |date=2009-06-02 }} hosted at the University of Pennsylvania, § 2-109 (accessed June 9, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annual Bulletin''''' of the '''Comparative Law Bureau&lt;!--redirect--&gt;''' of the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) was a [[United States|U.S.]] specialty [[law journal]] (1908–1914, 1933). The first [[comparative law]] journal in the United States,&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; it surveyed foreign legislation and legal literature. Circulated to all ABA members, it was absorbed in 1915 by the newly formed ''[[American Bar Association Journal]]''.

==History==
===Bureau===
In 1905, a committee of the [[Pennsylvania]] State Bar Association considered the creation of a [[comparative law]] society and recommended to bring such large project to the [[American Bar Association]].&lt;ref name=Clark2005&gt;Clark 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA created such entity at its 1907 annual meeting, as a new section named the Comparative Law Bureau: the Bureau members would meet annually at the ABA's summer meeting and publish an annual bulletin.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The Bureau's officers included: [[Simeon E. Baldwin]] (as director, 1907–1919; ABA co-founder and president, later Governor of Connecticut) and William Smithers (as secretary, also the chairman of the ''Bulletin'''s editorial staff).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; The Bureau's managers included: [[James Barr Ames]] (dean at Harvard), [[George Kirchwey]] (dean at Columbia), [[William Draper Lewis]]  (dean at Pennsylvania, later the founding director of the [[American Law Institute]]), and [[John Henry Wigmore]] (dean at Northwestern).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The Bureau's aims were presented in the ''Bulletin'''s first issue: (1) to publish an annual ''Bulletin'' with foreign legislation and reviews of foreign legal literature; (2) to translate and publish foreign legislation as well as relevant expert opinions; (3) to hold an annual conference for discussing comparative law; (4) to improve means by which foreign laws can become available to U.S. lawyers; (5) to promote research in the areas of foreign law; (6) to establish a list of foreign correspondents; and (7) to gather information on foreign law, such as bibliographies, for the benefit of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and students.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The Bureau met annually and published its ''Bulletin'' (separately, then within the ''Journal'') until financial difficulties in the 1930s due to the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, after publishing an ultimate separate ''Bulletin'', the Bureau was merged with the ABA's International Law section, forming the ABA Section of International &amp; Comparative Law.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

===Bulletin===
In July 1908, the ''Annual Bulletin'' (no [[ISSN]])&lt;ref&gt;The ''Bulletin'' is referenced under various titles. The main uniform title used in library catalogs (Library of Congress, OCLC/WorldCat) is "Annual &lt;!--here lowercase b--&gt;bulletin (American Bar Association. Comparative Law Bureau)". Other titles found in citations include: "Annual Bulletin - Comparative Law Bureau", "Annual Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau", "Annual Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association", etc., and sometimes "Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association", etc.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by the Bureau. The first [[comparative law]] journal in the United States,&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; it provided a survey of foreign legislation and legal literature. Its first issue was a 200 or so page bulletin.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The editor (chairman of the editorial staff) was Bureau secretary Smithers (from Philadelphia, where was also the ''Bulletin'''s printer).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; The editorial staff in 1908 included: [[Simeon E. Baldwin]] (Yale) for general [[jurisprudence]]; Ernest Lorenzen (George Washington) and [[Roscoe Pound]] (then at Northwestern) for [[Germany]]; Charles Wetherill for [[Great Britain]]; Masuji Miyakawa for [[Japan]]; Leo Rowe (University of Pennsylvania) for [[Latin America]]; William Hastings (University of Nebraska, dean in 1910) for [[Russia]]; Samuel Scott for [[Spain]]; and Gordon Sherman for [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; There were foreign correspondents from fourteen countries, including Gaston de Leval from [[Belgium]] and [[Eugen Huber]] (creator of the [[Swiss civil code of 1907]], still in force) from [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The ''Bulletin'' was circulated to all ABA members and to other subscribers.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; Published by International Printing Co. (Philadelphia, PA), it ran from July 1, 1908 to July 1, 1914,&lt;ref name=LOC-AnnualBulletin&gt;LOC, "Annual bulletin".&lt;/ref&gt; for volume 1 to 7.

The separate ''Bulletin'' was discontinued for two reasons:&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; in 1914, [[World War I]] disrupted cross-Atlantic connections; and in 1915, the ABA started publishing its own ''Journal'', into which the ''Bulletin'' was merged as an annual issue. (Though in 1933,&lt;ref name=LOC-Bulletin1933&gt;LOC, "Bulletin for 1933".&lt;/ref&gt; there was an ultimate separate ''Bulletin'', 215 page long. And in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;[[WorldCat]]. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22590456?tab=details "Annual bulletin" (1964 reprint), OCLC 22590456].&lt;/ref&gt; two backissues were reprinted.)

===Journal===
{{Main|American Bar Association Journal}}
&lt;!-- (Only a paragraph summary of the main article.) --&gt;In 1915, the ''American Bar Association Journal'' ({{ISSN|0002-7596}}) was founded by the [[American Bar Association]] as a quarterly magazine (it became monthly in 1921). From 1915 to 1928, the ''Bulletin'' was merged into it:&lt;ref name=LOC-Bulletin1933/&gt;&lt;ref name=LOC-AnnualBulletin/&gt; the Comparative Law Bureau controlled the second issue each year,&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; the April number. Bureau issues stopped in 1929, but comparative and foreign law articles still regularly appeared in the ''Journal'' (about five to ten per volume).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

An '''appropriations bill''' is [[Bill (proposed law)|legislation]] in the [[United States Congress]] to [[Appropriation (law)|appropriate]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[wikt:set aside|set aside]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States federal budget|federal funds]] to specific federal government departments, agencies and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment and activities.&lt;ref name=CRSappropsIntro&gt;{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=23 January 2014|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The ''fiscal year'' is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.&lt;ref name=crsBasicBudgetTerms&gt;{{cite web|last=Heniff Jr.|first=Bill|title=Basic Federal Budgeting Terminology|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-410.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=9 January 2014|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriations bills are under the jurisdiction of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations]].&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; Both Committees have twelve matching subcommittees, each tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills.

There are three types of appropriations bills: '''regular appropriations bills''', '''continuing resolutions''', and '''supplemental appropriations bills'''.&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it may pass a continuing resolution, which generally continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time.&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief.

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger [[United States budget process|United States budget and spending process]]. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, section 9, clause 7]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law..." This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills;&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; however, the President does not have [[line-item veto]] authority but must veto the entire bill.

==Types of appropriations bills==
There are three types of appropriations bills: '''regular appropriations bills''', '''continuing resolutions''', and '''supplemental appropriations bills'''.&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; In any given fiscal year, all three may be used.

===Regular appropriations bills===
Traditionally, regular appropriations bills have provided most of the federal government's annual funding.&lt;ref name=tollestrupCRSapprops1011&gt;{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=24 January 2014|pages=10–11|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the bill is divided into "accounts" with some larger agencies having several separate accounts (for things like salaries or research/development) and some smaller agencies just having one.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops1011"/&gt; The appropriations bill provides a specified amount of money for each individual account, and can also include conditions or restrictions on the use of the money.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops1011"/&gt;

Agencies cannot move money from one account to another without permission from Congress, which can be found in some appropriations bills.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops1011"/&gt; These are known as transfers. Agencies can shift some of the funding around to different activities within the same account, known as reprogramming.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops1011"/&gt; The appropriations subcommittees oversee such changes.

Occasionally Congress packages several of the twelve appropriations bills into one larger bill called an [[omnibus spending bill]] or an omnibus appropriation measure. Often the bills are considered separately at the beginning and get combined later because inability to pass bills individually has led to the exigency of a potential government shutdown.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops1011"/&gt; Omnibus bills can "veto-proof" items: measures that the president would otherwise veto can be passed by folding them into an omnibus bill, the vetoing of which would be perceived as harmful.&lt;ref name=oleszek3&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleszek|first=Walter J.|title=Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process|year=2007|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-87289-303-0|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing resolutions===
When a new fiscal year starts on October 1 and Congress has not passed some or all of the regular appropriations bills, Congress extends their funding and budget authority from the previous year, with possible minor modifications, using a continuing resolution.&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; If all twelve regular appropriations bills have been passed, a continuing resolution will not be necessary.

Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year's funding.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops12"/&gt; The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed, whichever comes first. There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution.

===Supplemental appropriations bills===
Supplemental appropriations bills increase funding for activities that were already funded in previous appropriations bills or they provide new funding for unexpected expenses.&lt;ref name=tollestrupCRSapprops13&gt;{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=24 January 2014|page=13|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]] were funded with a [[Financial cost of the Iraq War#Appropriations|variety of supplemental appropriations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://costofwar.com/numbers.html National Priorities Project | Bringing the Federal Budget Home] from the [[Cost of War]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zfacts.com/p/272.html |title=Congressional Reports: Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan since 9/11 |publisher=zFacts.org |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2006-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821155154/http://zfacts.com/p/272.html |archivedate=2006-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supplemental appropriations bills also provide funding for recovering from unexpected [[natural disaster]]s like [[Hurricane Sandy]] (the [[Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013]]).

==Appropriations process==
{{See also|United States budget process}}

Traditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings.&lt;ref name=tollestrupCRSapprops34&gt;{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=24 January 2014|pages=3–4|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called 302(b) allocations after section 302(b) of the [[Congressional Budget Act of 1974]]. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is a guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops34"/&gt; However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops34"/&gt; The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.&lt;ref name="tollestrupCRSapprops34"/&gt;

==Appropriations committees==
The [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]] and the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations]] have jurisdiction over appropriations bills.&lt;ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/&gt; Both committees have twelve matching subcommittees tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. Other Committees and lawmakers in Congress write legislation creating programs and reauthorizing old ones to continue. This legislation is called an [[authorization bill]]. In this legislation, they ''authorize'' these programs to exist, and they authorize the expenditure of funds on them, but they cannot actually give them the money. That second step, of granting the money, is done in an appropriations bill. The appropriations committees have power because they can decide whether to fund these programs at the maximum level authorized, a lesser amount, or not at all.&lt;ref name=oleszek48&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleszek|first=Walter J.|title=Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process|year=2007|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-87289-303-0|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Between fiscal year 1977 and fiscal year 2012, Congress only passed all twelve regular appropriations bills on time in four years - fiscal years 1977, 1989, 1995, and 1997.&lt;ref name=tollestrupCRSapprops12&gt;{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=24 January 2014|page=12|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every other fiscal year since 1977 has required at least one continuing resolution. For example, in 2013, Congress failed to agree on any regular appropriations bills prior to the start of fiscal year 2014. An attempt was made to pass the [[Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59)]] prior to October 1, but the House and Senate could not agree on its provisions, leading to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].&lt;ref name=hjres59sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.J.Res 59 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-joint-resolution/59|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=senaterejects30&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=Senate rejects House funding bill with government shutdown in clear sight|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/325519-senate-rejects-house-bill-with-shutdown-in-clear-sight|accessdate=1 October 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government resumed operations on October 17, 2013 after the passage of a continuing resolution, the [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]], that provided funding until January 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakamura|first=David|title=Congress sends Obama bill to end shutdown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-effort-to-end-fiscal-crisis-collapses-leaving-senate-to-forge-last-minute-solution/2013/10/16/1e8bb150-364d-11e3-be86-6aeaa439845b_story.html|accessdate=17 October 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=16 October 2013|author2=Kane, Paul|author3=Montgomery, Lori}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 2014, Congress passed another continuing resolution, {{USBill|113|H.J.Res.|106}} [[Making further continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014]], to provide funding until January 18, 2014.&lt;ref name=passaSpeBillortwo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Next Week: Time to pass a spending bill (or two)|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/195143-next-week-time-to-pass-a-spending-bill-or-two|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress finally passed the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014]], an omnibus appropriations bill, on January 17, 2014 to provide funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2014.&lt;ref name=3547allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3547 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3547/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act)''' amends the [[Public Health Service Act]] (PHS Act) to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be [[biosimilar]] to, or interchangeable with, an [[FDA]]-licensed reference biological product. The BPCI Act is closely related to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (or referred to as the "[[Hatch-Waxman Act]]"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/Biosimilars/|title=Information on Biosimilars|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|last=Research|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM273001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]] operates two court systems. Both systems can punish [[blasphemy]]. The Constitution provides a Customary (secular) system and a system that incorporates [[Sharia]]. The Customary system prohibits blasphemy by section 204 of Nigeria's Criminal Code. Section 204 is entitled "Insult to religion". The section states:
: Any person who does an act which any class of persons consider as a public insult on their religion, with the intention that they should consider the act such an insult, and any person who does an unlawful act with the knowledge that any class of persons will consider it such an insult, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Twelve out of Nigeria's thirty-six states have [[Sunni Islam]] as the dominant religion. In 1999, those states chose to have Sharia courts as well as Customary courts.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"&gt;{{Cite web

==The Constitution==



The prohibition against blasphemy in the Criminal Code and the prohibition recognized by Sharia may not be lawful because Section 38 of the Constitution entitles every Nigerian to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and Section 39 gives every Nigerian the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Law enforcement==
The system of law enforcement in Nigeria is beset by a lack of resources, sectarian loyalties, and corruption. As a consequence, vigilantism often goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vigilantism frequently occurs after an accusation of blasphemy (See below.).

==Selected cases==
On 19 June 2009, a Muslim mob in the town of Sara in Jigawa state burned a police outpost and injured about twelve persons over an alleged blasphemy against the Islamic [[prophet Mohammed]]. The mob complained that someone was distributing blasphemous pamphlets, and it demanded that the police give up a mad man who had sought safety at the police outpost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On 9 February 2008, a Muslim mob rioted in the town of Sumaila in Kano state. The mob acted upon the alleged distribution of a leaflet that allegedly slandered Mohammed. The mob killed a Christian police inspector and two civilians, and wounded twenty others. The mob set fire to vehicles and destroyed the police station.&lt;ref name = "Bos"&gt;{{Cite web

On 4 February 2008 2:46, a Muslim mob besieged a police station and set it on fire in the city of Yano in Bauchi state. The police station was the refuge of a Christian woman whom the mob accused of desecrating the Quran. One report said that the woman had spurned an offer of marriage from a Muslim man, and that he and his companions had seized the opportunity to riot. In the ensuing violence, five churches were set alight by Muslims, Christian shops were torched, and policemen's homes were attacked and a blood shed happed. The police arrested 1000 children.&lt;ref name = "Bos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In October 2007, a sharia court convicted Sani Kabili, a Christian and a father of six, of the town of Kano, of blasphemy against  Mohammed. The court sentenced Kabili to three years in prison. In February 2009, an appeal court overturned the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On 28 September 2007, a Muslim mob rioted at Tudun Wada in Kano state. The mob killed nine Christians, burned several churches, and destroyed the homes and businesses of some non-Muslims. The Muslims complained that Christian students had drawn a picture of  Mohammed. The Christians reported that the violence erupted after they had prevented one of their members from converting to Islam.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;

On 21 March 2007, a mob of Muslim students and neighbourhood extremists beat to death [[Christianah Oluwatoyin Oluwasesin]], a mother of two and a teacher at Government Secondary School of Gandu in the city of Gombe. A student complained that Oluwasesin, a Christian, had touched a bag which allegedly contained a Quran, and had thereby defiled the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In February 2006, thousands of Muslim rioters went on rampages in different states. The rioters burned churches, torched Christian shops and homes, and killed Christians. The reason for the violence was ostensibly outrage at the publication in the Danish magazine [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'']] of cartoons that some Muslims consider blasphemous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In February 2006 in Bauchi state, Florence Chuckwu, a Christian teacher, confiscated a copy of a Quran from a pupil who was reading it during an English lesson. The incident provoked rioting by Muslims. The riot killed more than twenty Christians and destroyed two churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

{{Main article|Miss World riots}}
On 20 November 2002, Muslim and Christian mobs rampaged in the cities of [[Kaduna]] and [[Abuja]]. The rampage began after an article in a daily newspaper, ''[[Thisday]]'', suggested that Mohammed would have approved of a [[Miss World]] pageant that was taking place in Abuja. ''Thisday'' columnist [[Isioma Daniel]] wrote that Mohammed would probably have taken a wife from among the contestants. Muslim mobs accused the newspaper of blasphemy, and burned down its office building in Kaduna. Then the mobs attacked churches and properties owned by Christians. Christian mobs confronted the Muslim mobs. Soldiers and police intervened. About two hundred and fifty people died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Basis''' (or '''cost basis'''), as used in [[United States tax law]], is the original cost of property, adjusted for factors such as [[depreciation]].  When property is sold, the taxpayer pays/(saves) taxes on a [[capital gain]]/(loss) that equals the amount realized on the sale minus the sold property's basis.

Cost basis is needed because tax is due based on the gain in value of an asset. For example, if a person buys a rock for $20, and sells the same rock for $20, there is no tax, since there is no profit. If, however, that person buys a rock for $20 and then sells the same rock for $25, then there is a capital gain on the rock of $5, which is thus taxable. The purchase price of $20 is analogous to cost of sales.

Typically, capital gains tax is due only when an asset is sold. However the rules for this are very complicated. If tax is paid because the value has increased, the new value will be the cost basis for any future tax.

[[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) Publication 551 contains the IRS's definition of basis: "Basis is the amount of your investment in property for tax purposes. Use the basis of property to figure depreciation, amortization, [[Depletion (accounting)|depletion]], and [[casualty loss]]es. Also use it to figure gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of property."

==Determining basis== 

For federal income taxation purposes, determining basis depends on how the asset in question was acquired.

'''Assets acquired by purchase or contract:'''  For assets purchased or acquired contractually, the basis equals the purchase price.  ''See'' IRC ([[Internal Revenue Code]]) § 1012.

'''Assets acquired by gift or trust:'''  The general rule is that assets acquired by gift or trust receive ''transferred basis'' (also called ''carryover basis'').  ''See'' IRC § 1015.  Put simply, gifted assets retain the donor's basis.  This means that the value of the asset at the time of transfer is irrelevant to computing the donee's new basis.  The general rule does not apply, however, if at the time of transfer the donor's adjusted basis in the property exceeds its fair market value and the recipient disposes of the property at a loss.  In this situation the asset's basis is its fair market value at the time of transfer.  ''See'' Treas. Reg. § 1.1015-1(a)(1).

'''Assets acquired by inheritance:'''  Assets acquired by inheritance are eligible to receive ''[[stepped-up basis]]'', meaning the fair market value of the asset at the time of the decedent's death.  ''See'' IRC § 1014.  This provision shields the appreciation in value of the asset during the life of the decedent from any income taxation whatsoever.

'''Adjusted basis:'''  An asset's basis can increase or decrease depending on changes that occur throughout its lifetime.  For this reason, IRC § 1001(a) provides that computing gain requires determining the amount realized from the sale or disposition of property minus the ''adjusted basis''.  '''''Capital improvements''''' (such as adding a deck to your house) increase the asset's basis while '''''depreciation deductions''''' (statutory deductions that reduce the taxpayer's taxable income for a given year) diminish the asset's basis.  Another way of viewing adjusted basis is to think of the asset as a savings account, with capital improvements representing deposits and depreciation deductions representing withdrawals.

==Mutual Fund Basis Methods==
For mutual funds, there are 4 basis methods approved by the IRS, detailed in Publication 564:

Cost basis methods:
* Specific share identification
* First-in, first-out ([[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO]])
Average basis methods:
* Average cost single category (ACSC)
* Average cost double category (ACDC)

Starting in Jan 2012, broker/dealers are required to track cost basis on covered shares (shares purchased on or after 1 Jan 2012) and are required by law to offer at least the following 3 basis methods:

* Specific share identification (Spec ID)
* First-in, first-out (FIFO)
* Average cost single category

The following other methods are now available to be used as well:

* Highest-in, first-out (HIFO)
* Min Tax
* Max Gain

==Reporting==
Cost Basis Reporting is a term used in the [[financial services industry]] that refers to identifying the actual cost of a [[Security (finance)|security]] for [[income tax]] purposes. Cost basis reporting became mandatory on January 1, 2011. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] – popularly known as the “bailout bill” – was signed into law on October 3, 2008 to address the mounting global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/10/03/us-financial-bailout-bush-sign-idUSTRE4927QN20081003 "Bush signs financial bailout package"], Reuters, October 3, 2008, accessed April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also had important cost basis ramifications, because Section 403 contained provisions that place significant cost basis-related requirements on brokers and other intermediaries who report their clients’ adjusted cost basis on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[Form 1099]].&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Helen [https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/30/us-costbasis-advisers-idUSTRE68T5EQ20100930 "Advisers must gear up for cost-basis angst"], Reuters, September 30, 2010, accessed April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new legislation, financial intermediaries must report accurate adjusted cost basis information to both investors and the IRS for:

* Equities acquired on or after January 1, 2011
* Mutual fund and dividend reinvestment plan (DRiP) shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012. 
* Financial instruments such as debt securities, options and private placements acquired on or after January 1, 2014

Additionally, an intermediary who transfers a client account to another intermediary must provide information necessary for cost basis reporting within 15 days of the account transfer.  Financial intermediaries need to develop a compliance plan now, since penalties for non-compliance are stiff – up to $350,000 per year for incorrect Form 1099-B cost basis reporting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtcc.com/downloads/leadership/whitepapers/costbasis_whitepaper.pdf "Complying with new cost basis legislation: What brokers, banks, transfer agents, mutual funds and issuers need to know"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726095635/http://dtcc.com/downloads/leadership/whitepapers/costbasis_whitepaper.pdf |date=2012-07-26 }} , DTCC (The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation), page 15 (section titled Penalties for Inaccurate Reporting), December 2008, accessed April 15, 2011, page not found March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and unlimited penalties for intentional disregard of the new requirements.

Under the new law, taxpayers are also subject to penalties of up to $1,000 for underreporting capital gains taxes, and up to $5,000 for willful disregard of the law or reckless conduct in reporting capital gains taxes.

Note that these examples highlight selected aspects of the new legislation, and are not meant to provide a complete view of the compliance issues facing any specific organization.

==Evaluation of methods==
Specific share identification is the most record and labor-intensive, as one must track all purchases and sales and specify which share was sold on which date. It almost always allows the lowest tax bill, however, as one has discretion on which gains to realize. Starting in 2012, the shares being sold must be identified at the time of the sale.

FIFO is the default method used for brokerage securities if no other is specified, and generally results in the highest tax bill, as it sells oldest (hence generally most appreciated) shares first.

Average cost single category is widely used by mutual funds, as it is the simplest in terms of record keeping (only total basis need be tracked) and sale (no specifying required), and results in moderate tax.

HIFO sells the shares with the highest cost first in an attempt to minimize the tax bill.

Min Tax sells shares in the following order: shares with short-term losses, long-term losses, long-term gains and lastly short-term gains.

Max Gain is the exact opposite of Min Tax.

==2012 legislation changes==

Shareholders are no longer required to petition the IRS to switch cost basis methods starting in 2012, however to move into or out of average cost, the shareholder must do so in writing. The IRS considers in writing to be letters from the shareholder to their financial institution, changing methods online, or filling out a method election/change form from their financial institution. The IRS does not currently consider verbal permission on a recorded line as being "in writing."

Transfer agents and broker/dealers are now required by law to report the gains or losses of any sales of covered shares to the IRS. Institutions transferring covered shares to another institution must transfer the basis for those shares within 15 days of transfer. Because FIFO and Spec ID require a complete lot history, institutions must transfer and track full lot history and cannot transfer a "rolled up" total cost when transferring the cost basis to another institution. Several financial institutions will be participating in a Cost Basis Reporting System or CBRS to ease the transfer of cost basis between institutions but are not required by the IRS to do so.

The '''Digital Economy Act 2017''' is an act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is substantially different from, and shorter than, the [[Digital Economy Act 2010]], whose provisions largely ended up not being passed into law. The act addresses policy issues related to electronic communications infrastructure and services, and updates the conditions for and sentencing of criminal copyright infringement. It was introduced to Parliament by [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|culture secretary]] [[John Whittingdale]] on 5 July 2016. Whittingdale was replaced as culture secretary by [[Karen Bradley]] on 14 July 2016. The act received Royal Assent on 27 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Economy Act 2017|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/digitaleconomy.html|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The provisions of the act include:
* Allowing data sharing between government departments in order to provide [[Digital Government]].&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* Creating an age-verification regulator to publish guidelines about how [[pornography|pornographic]] websites which operate "on a commercial basis" should ensure their users are aged 18 or older.&lt;ref name=Perrigo&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Time|title=The U.K. Is About To Regulate Online Porn, and Free Speech Advocates Are Terrified|url=http://time.com/5352875/uk-porn-block-age-verification/|author=Billy Perrigo|date=20 August 2018|access-date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulator is empowered to fine those who fail to comply up to £250,000 (or up to 5% of their turnover), to order the blocking of non-compliant websites, and to require those providing financial or advertising services to non-compliant websites to cease doing so.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt; The regulator's proposals have to be approved three months before coming into effect.&lt;ref name=Perrigo/&gt; The [[BBFC]] has been commissioned to fulfil this role&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs to force Google to tackle piracy in Digital Economy Bill|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2475509/mps-to-force-google-to-tackle-piracy-in-digital-economy-bill|author=Graeme Burton|date=27 October 2016|work=The Inquirer|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and age-verification is expected to begin in 2018.&lt;ref name=Kleinmann&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn check critics fear data breach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43292457|work=BBC News|date=6 March 2018|author=Zoe Kleinman|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn site age checks are delayed to make sure officials 'get it right'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/porn-site-age-checks-delayed-government-gets-process-right|date=12 Mar 2018|author=Damien Gayle|work=BBC News|access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Requiring [[Internet service provider]]s to use Internet filters to block all websites that have adult content, unless customers have opted out.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* Introducing a [[Universal Service]] Obligation which allows users to request broadband speeds of at least 10 Mbps. The obligation is to be introduced by 2020, and Ofcom are empowered to subsequently increase the minimum broadband speed requirement.&lt;ref name=Rigg&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Digital Economy Act will come between you and porn|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/03/digital-economy-act-explainer/|work=engadget|author=Jamie Rigg|date=3 May 2017|access-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Requiring Internet service providers to provide compensation to customers if service requirements are not met.&lt;ref name=Beeb1/&gt;
* Allowing [[Ofcom]], the communications sector's regulator, to financially penalise communications providers for failing to comply with licence commitments.&lt;ref name=Beeb1&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Economy Bill: Networks and porn sites face fines|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36725774|website=BBC News|date=6 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Requiring [[mobile telephony]] providers to offer a contract cap to customers limiting monthly spending to an agreed figure.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* Providing for increased penalties for [[nuisance call]]s.&lt;ref name=Beeb1/&gt;
* Updating the [[Ofcom Electronic Communications Code]] to make it easier for [[telecommunications companies]] to erect and extend mobile masts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Small cells and 5G: What the Digital Economy Bill changes mean for operators|url=http://www.telecomstechnews.com/news/2016/oct/18/small-cells-and-5g-what-digital-economy-bill-changes-mean/|date=18 October 2016|author=Paul Carter|work=Telecoms Tech|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extending [[Public Lending Right]] to remotely lent e-books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government passes legislation to extend PLR to ebooks|url=http://www.societyofauthors.org/News/News/2017/April/Digital-Economy-Bill-passes-into-law|date=28 April 2017|publisher=The Society of Authors}}&lt;/ref&gt; (section 31 of the Act).
* Modifying the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] to raise the maximum sentence for Internet [[copyright infringement]] to 10 years in prison,&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt; and allowing English and Welsh courts a greater range of sentencing options in such cases.&lt;ref name=Beeb1/&gt;
* Modifying the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to allow public service broadcasters to charge retransmission fees.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* Giving Ofcom oversight of the [[BBC]]&lt;ref name=Beeb1/&gt; as its external regulator.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* Empowering Ofcom to require [[public service broadcaster]]s to include a minimum quantity of children's programming made in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;

==Timetable==
The bill completed its passage through the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] during the Autumn of 2016. It then moved to the [[House of Lords]]. [[Royal Assent]] was achieved by the end of Spring 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill stages — Digital Economy Act 2017|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/digitaleconomy/stages.html|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final stages of the legislative process occurred during the [[wash-up period]] before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], as was the case with the [[Digital Economy Act 2010]] which completed its course through parliament during the wash-up before the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref name=Fiveash&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Economy Act 2017 gets royal assent and is now law|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2017/04/digital-economy-act-2017-gets-royal-assent-and-is-now-law/|author=Kelly Fiveash|date=28 April 2017|work=Ars Technica UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments==
* An amendment to the bill making it an offence to use "digital purchasing software" to purchase an excessive number of event tickets for [[ticket resale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Touts using bots to buy tickets could face jail |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/19/touts-using-bots-buy-tickets-face-jail |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Rob Davies |date=19 October 2016 |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was withdrawn at the committee stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You Me At Six To Give Evidence Against Secondary Ticketing |url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/news/six-give-evidence-secondary-ticketing/ |date=14 November 2016 |work=M Magazine |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a subsequent amendment giving the government the power to create a new criminal offence of using [[Internet bot]]s to bypass limits on maximum ticket purchases set by event organisers was included in the final bill, with offenders potentially subject to unlimited fines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Economy Bill becomes law|url=http://www.musicweek.com/live/read/digital-economy-bill-becomes-law/068292|date=27 April 2017|author=James Hanley|work=Music Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this came into force in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Ticket touts face unlimited fines for using bots|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jul/05/ticket-touts-face-unlimited-fines-for-using-bots|author=Rob Davies|date=5 July 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An amendment to the bill was put forward making it an offence to publish or host on-line footage or photographs in cases where the distributors "knew or ought to have known" that it "involved exploited persons". The amendment was subsequently withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Put online porn barons in prison for showing 'forced' sex acts, says Bristol MP |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/put-porn-barons-in-prison-for-showing-women-forced-into-sex-acts-says-bristol-mp/story-29857756-detail/story.html |date=1 November 2016 |author=Patrick Daly |newspaper=[[Bristol Post]] |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An amendment to the bill was tabled clarifying the employment rights of workers employed via a digital service such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Labour pushes Tories to enshrine workers' rights for Uber drivers into law |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uber-judgment-workers-rights-minimum-wage-holiday-pay-london-uk-a7385591.html |date=28 October 2016 |author=Jon Stone |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An amendment to the bill was tabled by the shadow minister for digital economy [[Louise Haigh]], extending the legal obligation on television broadcasters to include [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]s, [[sign language]] and [[audio description]] when providing [[video on demand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government has chance to bring subtitling provision 'into 21st century' |url=https://www.cable.co.uk/news/government-has-chance-to-bring-subtitling-provision-into-21st-century-700001648/ |work=www.cable.co.uk |date=20 October 2016 |author=Phil Wilkinson-Jones |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government amendment to the same effect was subsequently published by the minister responsible for digital policy [[Matthew Hancock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Economy Bill will require on-demand programmes to include subtitles|url=https://www.cable.co.uk/news/digital-economy-bill-will-require-on-demand-programmes-to-include-subtitles-700001735/|author=Phil Wilkinson-Jones|date=9 February 2017|work=cable.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audio description on Catch-up TV becomes law|url=https://www.rnib.org.uk/audio-desciption-catch-tv-becomes-law|publisher=RNIB|date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An amendment requiring the universal prominence of public service broadcasters in digital television [[electronic program guides]] was modified so that the act as passed requires Ofcom to report in 2020 on how such prominence can be ensured in the context of greater on-demand viewing.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* In October 2016 a clause entitled: "Power to provide for a code of practice related to copyright infringement" was proposed after a lobbying campaign led by copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPs amend Digital Economy Bill to force search engines to deal with piracy |url=http://www.itproportal.com/news/mps-amend-digital-economy-bill-to-force-search-engines-to-deal-with-piracy/ |work=IT Pro Portal |author=Anthony Spadafora |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment would have required search engines to de-list sites linked to piracy from their search results. It would also have granted the government powers to investigate and sanction search engine operators for failure to comply.&lt;ref name="Burton"/&gt; The clause was not included in the final act.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;
* In November 2016, following pressure from MPs, the government proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0087/amend/digital_rm_rep_1124.1-6.html |title=Notices of amendments given up to and including Thursday 24 November 2016 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=24 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an amendment to the bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Digital Economy Bill could block porn sites that fail to age check |url=http://www.alphr.com/politics/1004695/digital-economy-bill-could-block-porn-sites-that-fail-to-age-check |author=Dale Walker |date=4 November 2016 |work=alphr |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the age verification regulator to require internet service providers to block pornographic websites that do not offer age verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MPs table another porn site-blocking amendment to the Digital Economy Bill |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2476296/mps-table-another-porn-site-blocking-amendment-to-the-digital-economy-bill |work=[[The Inquirer]] |date=3 November 2016 |author=Dave Neal |accessdate=15 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[BBFC]] were expected to become the regulator, this caused discussion about ISPs being required to block content that is prohibited even under an [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]],&lt;ref name="Ars 2016-11-24"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/isps-block-porn-sites-age-verification-digital-economy-bill/ |title=UK ISPs may be forced to block porn sites that snub age checks, sex acts face ban |author=Kelly Fiveash |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=24 November 2016 |accessdate=24 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 2016-11-23"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/23/censor-non-conventional-sex-acts-online-internet-pornography |title=UK to censor online videos of 'non-conventional' sex acts |author=Damien Gayle |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 November 2016 |accessdate=24 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the prohibition of some of which is itself controversial.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2016-11-23"/&gt;
*An amendment in the House of Lords raising the Universal Service Obligation for broadband to 30 Mbps was abandoned as being too ambitious.&lt;ref name=Rigg/&gt;

Although privacy and technical safeguards for the sharing of citizens' data are not included in the act, the government stated that it intended to publish codes of practice following a public consultation.&lt;ref name=Fiveash/&gt; The consultation took place in the Autumn of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Consultation on the Digital Economy Act, Part 5: Data Sharing Codes and Regulations|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=6b79d8e1-21ce-4445-919b-de7c4625db14|publisher=Squire Patton Boggs|website=Lexology|date=16 October 2017|author=Stéphanie Faber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The [[Open Rights Group]] (ORG), a digital rights campaigning organisation, raised concerns over aspects of the Bill. The provisions for the age verification of pornographic website users raised concerns about the privacy implications of collecting user data, and the possible ineffectiveness of a method focused on restricting payments to pornographic websites.&lt;ref name=ORG2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.openrightsgroup.org/ourwork/reports/digital-economy-bill-briefing-to-the-house-of-commons-on-second-reading|title=Digital Economy Bill: Briefing To The House Of Commons On Second Reading|date=12 September 2016|publisher=Open Rights Group|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myles Jackman]], ORG's legal director, highlighted the potential vulnerability of [[age verification system]]s to [[Security hacker|hacking]], and suggested that it would result in more people using [[virtual private networks]], or anonymous web browsers such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].&lt;ref name=Kleinmann/&gt; A public consultation on the BBFC's draft guidance to age verification service providers began in March 2018.&lt;ref name=delay/&gt; The age verification provisions were due to come into effect in April 2018, were delayed until the end of 2018&lt;ref name=Perrigo/&gt; and then further delayed until spring 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Porn site age verification to be in force by spring next year after delays, minister says|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/porn-site-age-verification-uk-pornhub-sex-online-adult-video-government-id-a8631886.html|author=Alex Matthews-King|date=13 November 2018|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORG also raised concerns over the risk of misuse of bulk data sharing.&lt;ref name=ORG2016/&gt; The provisions regarding copyright infringements were criticised for the vagueness of the definition and the severity of the maximum sentence (10 years in prison). BILETA, the British and Irish Law, Education and Technology Association, also criticised the proposal to increase maximum jail term in its submission to the Government's consultation. The proposal was described as 'unacceptable', 'unaffordable', and 'infeasible'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/legal-scholars-warn-against-10-year-prison-for-online-pirates-150815|title=Legal scholars warn against 10 year prison for online pirates|date=15 August 2015|publisher=TorrentFreak|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2015/08/10-year-jail-sentence-for-online-piracy-infeasible-unaffordable-say-academics|title=10-year jail sentence for online piracy 'infeasible, unaffordable' say academics|date=17 August 2015|publisher=Arstechnica|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/18/you_simply_cant_jail_online_pirates_for_10_years_legal_eagles_warn_governement|title=You CAN'T jail online pirates for 10 years, legal eagles tell UK govt|date=18 August 2015|publisher=The Register|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/04/uk-file-sharing-10-years-jail-time|title= UK ploughs ahead with plan for 10-year jail term for online file sharing|date=22 April 2016|publisher=Arstechnica|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this provision may be intended to dissuade users of technology such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi software]] from downloading content that breaches copyright regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kodi: the good, the bad, and the illegal|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/kodi-the-good-the-bad-and-the-illegal|date=14 May 2017|author=Luke Johnson|work=Tech Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of expert witnesses to the Digital Economy Bill Committee expressed concerns about the bill. [[Jerry Fishenden]], co-chair of the Cabinet Office’s Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group until he resigned in protest on 2 May 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntouk.wordpress.com/2017/05/03/the-canary-that-ceased-to-be|author= Jerry Fishenden|work=new tech observations from the UK – Jerry Fishenden's blog|title=The canary that ceased to be|date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the opinion that the bill was based on an "obsolete" model of data sharing. He commented: "I find it surprising the bill doesn’t have definition of what data sharing is, both practically and legally… I’d like to see some precision around what’s meant by data sharing. The lack of detail is concerning." He also said that the bill "appears to weaken citizens’ control over their personal data", something that is "likely to undermine trust in government and make citizens less willing to share their personal data". [[Jeni Tennison]], CEO of the [[Open Data Institute]], commented on the lack of transparency regarding existing public sector data sharing agreements and how the bill's measures fit with them. She spoke of her belief that the bill lacks the transparency needed to avoid the kind of problems that arose with [[NHS Digital]]'s abandoned ''Care.data'' programme. Mike Bracken, chief digital officer at [[the Co-operative Group]] and former head of the [[Government Digital Service]], expressed the opinion that "the government relies on bulk data sets too often, instead of simply asking for the individual data set pertaining to the information needed". The civil liberties and privacy advocacy group [[Big Brother Watch]] told the committee said that bill overlooked the work of the Government Digital Service in setting up the [[GOV.UK Verify]] scheme, a model based on the government not centrally storing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Economy Bill lacks clarity on data sharing, experts say|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450401071/Economy-Bill-lacks-clarity-on-data-sharing|date=14 October 2016|author=Lis Evenstad|magazine=Computer Weekly|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federal tribunals in the United States''' are those [[tribunal]]s established by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the [[United States]] for the purpose of deciding the constitutionality of [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] and for resolving other disputes about federal laws. They include both '''Article III tribunals''' (federal courts) as well as [[Adjudication|adjudicative]] entities which  are classified as '''Article I''' or '''Article IV tribunals'''. Some of the latter entities are also formally denominated as courts, but they do not enjoy certain protections afforded to Article III courts. These tribunals are described in reference to the article of the [[United States Constitution]] from which the tribunal's authority stems. The use of the term "tribunal" in this context as a blanket term to encompass both courts and other adjudicative entities comes from section 8 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the Constitution, which expressly grants Congress the power to constitute tribunals inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].

==Article III courts==
{{main|Federal judiciary of the United States}}
{{See also|List of United States district and territorial courts}}

'''Article III courts''' (also called '''Article III tribunals''') are the U.S. Supreme Court and the [[inferior courts of the United States]] established by the [[United States Congress|Congress]], which currently are the 13 [[United States courts of appeals]], the 91 [[United States district court]]s (including the districts of D.C. and Puerto Rico, but excluding three other territorial district courts), and the [[U.S. Court of International Trade]]. They constitute the [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] of the federal government (which is defined by [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the Constitution).  

Pursuant to the [[Appointments Clause]] in Article II, all members of Article III tribunals are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These courts are protected against undue influence by the other branches of government. Judges may not have their salaries reduced during their tenure in office, and their appointment is for life—barring removal from office "on [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] for, and [[conviction]] of, Treason, Bribery, or other [[high crimes and misdemeanors]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Presser| first=Stephen B.| title=Essays on Article I: Impeachment| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/11/impeachment| work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=Heritage Foundation| accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the Constitution, Congress can vest these courts with jurisdiction to hear cases involving the Constitution or [[Law of the United States|federal law]] and certain cases involving disputes between citizens of different states or countries.  Among the matters susceptible of judicial determination, but not requiring it, are: claims against the United States, the disposal of [[Public land#United States|public lands]] and related claims, questions concerning membership in [[List of federally recognized tribes|Indian tribes]], and questions arising out of the administration of [[customs]] laws and the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name=Art3GPO&gt;{{cite web| title=Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis, and Interpretation – Centennial Edition – Interim| work=S.

==Article I tribunals==
'''Article I tribunals''' include Article I courts (also called legislative courts) set up by Congress to review agency decisions, military courts-martial appeal courts, ancillary courts with judges appointed by Article III appeals court judges, or [[administrative law of the United States|administrative agencies]] and [[administrative law judge]]s (ALJs). Article I judges do not enjoy the same protections as their Article III counterparts. For example, these judges do not enjoy life tenure, and Congress may reduce their salaries.

The existence of Article I tribunals has long been controversial, and their power challenged numerous times. The Supreme Court has consistently affirmed their Constitutionality, and has delineated their power on several occasions. In ''[[Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.]]'' ({{ussc|59|272|1856|How.|18}}) the Court ruled that some legal matters, specifically those involving ''public rights'', are inherently judicial, and thus Article I tribunal decisions are susceptible to review by an Article III court. Later, in ''Ex parte Bakelite Corp.'' ({{ussc|279|438|1929}}), the Court declared that Article I courts "may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it."&lt;ref name=Art3GPO/&gt;

==Article IV tribunals==
Article IV tribunals are the '''[[United States territorial court]]s''', established in [[United States territory|territories of the United States]] by the [[United States Congress]], pursuant to its power under [[Article Four of the United States Constitution]], the [[Territorial Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

An example of a territorial court is the [[High Court of American Samoa]], a court established pursuant to the [[Constitution of American Samoa]]. As an [[unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]], the [[Ratification Act of 1929]] vested all civil, judicial and military powers in the [[President of the United States|President]], who in turn delegated authority to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] in {{Executive Order|10264}}, who in turn promulgated the Constitution of American Samoa, which authorizes the court. As such, the Secretary retains ultimate authority over the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Defining Status: A Comprehensive Analysis of United States Territorial Relations | last= Leibowitz | first= Arnold H. | year= 1989 | page= 420 | isbn= 978-0-7923-0069-4 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=s1NEdqvtd3IC&amp;pg=PA420 | ref= harv | quote= His legal position would not only permit him to investigate and overturn decisions of the judiciary in American Samoa, but the decisions of the Executive and Legislative branches as well. … The very fact that his office exists as an ombudsman, to put it kindly, or as a benevolent dictator — to put it less generously — depreciates all Samoan government institutions and makes the Samoan Constitution adopted in 1960 a giant deceit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[District Court of Guam]]
* [[District Court of the Virgin Islands]]

===Congress establishes Article III Court for Puerto Rico===
Before 1966, the United States District Court in Puerto Rico was an Article IV court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Balzac v. Porto Rico]]'', 258 U.S. 298 (1922).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed {{USPL|89|571}}, {{USStat|80|764}}, which transformed the Article IV federal district court in Puerto Rico into an Article III court. This Act of Congress was not enacted pursuant to Article IV of the Constitution, the Territorial Clause, but rather under Article III. This marks the first and only occasion in United States history in which Congress has established an Article III court in a territory other than the District of Columbia. From then on, judges appointed to serve on the Puerto Rico federal district court have been Article III judges appointed under the Constitution of the United States. Like their mainland counterparts, they are entitled to [[life tenure]] and salary protection.

This important change in the federal judicial structure of the island was implemented not as a request of the Commonwealth government, but rather at the repeated request of the Judicial Conference of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Report No. 1504, 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2786-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The District Court of Puerto Rico is part of the First Circuit, which sits in Boston.

==Supreme Court rulings limiting the power of Article I and Article IV tribunals==
The concept of a legislative court was first defined by Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] in the case of ''[[American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton]]'', 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 511 (1828),&lt;ref&gt;The name on the actual slip opinion originally handed down by the Supreme Court was ''American Insur. Co. v. Canter''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes referred to as ''Canter'', after a claimant in the case.  In this case, a court in what was then the [[Territory of Florida]] had made a ruling on the disposition of some bales of cotton that had been recovered from a sunken ship. This clearly fell into the realm of [[admiralty law]], which is part of the federal judicial power according to Article III of the Constitution.  Yet the judges of the [[Florida Territorial Court]] had four-year terms, not the lifetime appointments required by Article III of the Constitution.  Marshall's solution was to declare that territorial courts were established under Article I of the constitution.  As such, they could not exercise the federal judicial power, and therefore the law that placed admiralty cases in their jurisdiction was unconstitutional.

Tenure that is guaranteed by the Constitution is a badge of a judge of an Article III court. The argument that mere statutory tenure is sufficient for judges of Article III courts was authoritatively answered in ''Ex parte Bakelite Corp.'':&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Bakelite Corp.'', at 459-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he argument is fallacious. It mistakenly assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred. Nor has there been any settled practice on the part of Congress which gives special significance to the absence or presence of a provision respecting the tenure of judges. This may be illustrated by two citations. The same Congress that created the Court of Customs Appeals made provision for five additional circuit judges and declared that they should [370 U.S. 530, 597] hold their offices during good behavior; and yet the status of the judges was the same as it would have been had that declaration been omitted. In creating courts for some of the Territories Congress failed to include a provision fixing the tenure of the judges; but the courts became legislative courts just as if such a provision had been included.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Glidden Co. v. Zdanok]]'', the court made the following statement regarding courts in [[unincorporated territories]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside the mainland, ''Downes v. Bidwell'', 182 U.S. 244, 266-267; ''Balzac v. Porto Rico'', 258 U.S. 298, 312-313; cf. ''Dorr v. United States'', 195 U.S. 138, 145, 149, and to the consular courts established by concessions from foreign countries, ''In re Ross'', 140 U.S. 453, 464-465, 480. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ever since ''Canter'', the federal courts have been wrestling with the division between legislative and judicial courts.  The Supreme Court most thoroughly delineated the permissible scope of Article I tribunals in ''[[Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.]]'', 458 U.S. 50 (1982), striking down the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]] that created the original [[United States bankruptcy court|U.S. bankruptcy courts]]. The Court noted in that opinion that the framers of the Constitution had developed a scheme of [[separation of powers]] which clearly required that the [[judiciary]] be kept independent of the other two branches via the mechanism of lifetime appointments. This decision was subsequently revisited and affirmed in ''[[Stern v. Marshall]]'', 564 U.S. 462 (2011). However, the Court noted three situations (based on historical understanding) in which Congress could give judicial power to non-Article III courts:

#Courts for non-state areas (U.S. territories and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]) in which Congress is acting as both local and national government.
#Military courts (or courts-martial), under the historical understanding and clearly laid out exceptions in the Constitution.
#Legislative courts established under the premise that, where Congress ''could'' have simply given the Executive Branch the power to make a decision, it has the lesser power to create a tribunal to make that decision.  This power is limited to adjudication of public rights, such as the settling of disputes between the citizens and the government.

The Court also found that Congress has the power under Article I to create ''adjunct tribunals'', so long as the "essential attributes of judicial power" stay in Article III courts. This power derives from two sources. First, when Congress ''creates'' rights, it can require those asserting such rights to go through an Article I tribunal. Second, Congress can create non-Article III tribunals to help Article III courts deal with their workload, but only if the Article I tribunals are under the control of the Article III courts. The bankruptcy courts, as well as the tribunals of [[United States magistrate judge|magistrate judges]] who decide some issues in the district courts, fall within this category of "adjunct" tribunals. All actions heard in an Article I tribunal are subject to [[Trial de novo|''de novo'' review]] in the supervising Article III court, which retains the exclusive power to make and enforce final judgments.

Pursuant to Congress' authority under Article IV, §3, of the Constitution to "make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States;" Congress may create territorial courts and vest them with [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] over causes arising under both federal law and local law. But "the Supreme Court long ago determined that in the 'unincorporated' territories, such as [[American Samoa]], the guarantees of the Constitution apply only insofar as its 'fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights' express 'principles which are the basis of all free government which cannot be with impunity transcended.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Mormons v. Hodel'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/830/830.F2d.374.86-5451.html 830 F.2d 374] (1987), citing Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court noted in ''[[Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor]]'', 478 U.S. 833 (1986), that parties to litigation may voluntarily waive their right to an Article III tribunal and thereby submit themselves to a binding judgment from an Article I tribunal. However, the Supreme Court later noted in ''[[Stern v. Marshall]]'', 564 U.S. ___ (2011), that a party's right to an Article III tribunal is not always voluntarily waiveable in an Article I tribunal for suits at [[common law]].  Similarly, in ''[[Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg]]'', 492 U.S. 33 (1989), the Court noted that a litigant's right to [[jury trial]] under the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] is also not generally waivable in an Article I tribunal for suits at common law. The Supreme Court further noted in ''Granfinanciera'' and ''Stern'' the parallel analysis of rights under Article III and the Seventh Amendment.

Article IV judges, in that capacity, cannot sit on the [[United States courts of appeals|United States Courts of Appeals]] or decide an [[appeals|appeal]] as part of such panels.&lt;ref&gt;''Nguyen v. United States'', 539 U.S. 69 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|2013 IRS controversy}}

In 2013, the IRS revealed that it had selected political groups applying for tax-exempt status for closer scrutiny based on their names or political themes. This disclosure led to wide condemnation of the agency and triggered several investigations, including a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) criminal probe ordered by [[United States Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/15/us-usa-irs-idUSBRE94E02J20130515 FBI opens criminal probe of tax agency, audit cites disarray]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimeSwampland"&gt;{{cite news |last=Altman |first=Alex |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/14/the-real-irs-scandal |title=The Real IRS Scandal &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Swampland.time.com |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports described the selections as nearly exclusively of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] groups with terms such as "Tea Party" in their names. Further investigation revealed that [[liberalism in the United States|liberal-leaning]] groups and the [[Occupy movement]] had also triggered additional scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57591358/irs-progressive-groups-flagged-but-tea-party-bigger-target/ IRS: Progressive groups flagged, but tea party bigger target].

On May 10, 2013, in advance of the public release of the audit findings, Director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division [[Lois Lerner]] answered what was later revealed to be a planted question by stating that the IRS was "apologetic" for what she termed "absolutely inappropriate" actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/irs-planted-question-about-tax-exempt-groups/|title=IRS Planted Question About Tax Exempt Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lerner's superior, then-Acting [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|IRS Commissioner]] [[Steven T.

Following the Inspector General's report, the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] began an investigation into the IRS. Additionally, the House Committee on Ways and Means expanded its ongoing 2011 investigation into IRS political targeting to include the BOLO keyword targeting allegations.

On May 22, 2013, in an opening statement to the House committee chaired by Representative [[Darrell Issa]], Lerner stated: "I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations. And I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee." Lerner then invoked her [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against [[Self-incrimination|compelled testimony]] and refused to testify.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lois-lerner-invokes-fifth-amendment-in-house-hearing-on-irs-targeting/2013/05/22/03539900-c2e6-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story.html Lois Lerner invokes Fifth Amendment in House hearing on IRS targeting], William Branigin and Ed O'Keefe, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Issa later asserted that Lerner had waived her Fifth Amendment rights by giving partial testimony, and that he intended to call her back into the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Friedman |url =http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2013/05/issa-irs-lerner-waived-fifth-amendment-right-likely-to-be-recalled |title =Issa: IRS' Lerner Waived Fifth Amendment Right, Likely to be Recalled |publisher =[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date =May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellison |last=Barber |url =http://freebeacon.com/waiving-the-fifth/ |title =Waiving the Fifth |publisher =The Washington Free Beacon |date =May 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Trey Gowdy]] agreed with Issa. Gowdy stated: "She [Lois Lerner] just waived her Fifth Amendment right. You don't get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross examination — that's not the way it works. She waived her right to Fifth Amendment privilege by issuing an opening statement. She ought to stand here and answer our questions."

Law professor [[James Duane (professor)|James Duane]] told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that Gowdy's assertion was "extremely imaginative" but "mistaken," because a person who is involuntarily summoned before a grand jury or a legislative body may selectively invoke the right to silence.&lt;ref name="NYMagFifth"&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/lerner-gowdy-waive-right-5th-amendment-irs.html Expert: Lois Lerner Didn't Waive Her Right to Plead the Fifth], Dan Amira, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, May 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] took a different view, arguing: "You can't simply make statements about a subject and then plead the Fifth in response to questions about the very same subject," and asserting, "[o]nce you open the door to an area of inquiry, you have waived your Fifth Amendment right."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/301557-dershowitz-irs-chief-lerner-can-be-held-in-contempt-of-congress Dershowitz: IRS official Lerner 'can be held in contempt' of Congress - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room].

==Provisions of the resolution==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=hres574sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.Res. 574 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/574|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution resolves that Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), be found in contempt of Congress for failure to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as required by a [[congressional subpoena]].&lt;ref name="hres574sum"/&gt;

The resolution directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives to certify the Committee's report detailing the refusal of Ms. Lerner to testify before the Committee as directed by the subpoena to the [[U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia]] to the end that Ms. Lerner be proceeded against in the manner and form provided by law, and to otherwise take all appropriate action to enforce the subpoena.&lt;ref name="hres574sum"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
H.Res. 574 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on May 7, 2014 by [[Darrell Issa|Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA)]].&lt;ref name=hres574allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.Res. 574 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/574/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision was considered on May 7, 2014, and was passed in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll203.xml Roll Call Vote 203] with a vote of 231-187.&lt;ref name="hres574allactions"/&gt; All of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] voted in favor of the resolution, along with six [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref name=SixDemsHill&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Six Dems vote for Lerner contempt resolution|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/205547-six-dems-vote-for-lerner-contempt-resolution|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six Democrats who voted in favor were: [[Ron Barber]] (AZ), [[John Barrow (U.S. politician)|John Barrow]] (GA), [[Collin Peterson]] (MN), [[Mike McIntyre]] (NC), [[Nick Rahall]] (WV), and [[Patrick Murphy (Florida politician)|Patrick Murphy]] (FL).&lt;ref name="SixDemsHill"/&gt; Seven Republicans and six Democrats were not present to vote.&lt;ref name=rollcall203&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 203|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll203.xml|publisher=House Clerk's Office|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justice Department later determined that Ms. Lerner had not waived her Fifth Amendment rights and declined to seek an indictment on the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/lois-lerner-no-contempt-charges-justice-department-116577|title = DOJ: No contempt charges for former IRS official Lerner|website = POLITICO|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
House Democrats argued that Lerner had properly invoked her Fifth Amendment rights, and that she therefore was not in contempt of Congress.&lt;ref name="UrbanMay10"/&gt;

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform previously voted in a straight party vote with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed to the conclusion that Lerner had given up her Fifth Amendment right not to testify because she had given the committee an opening statement at the hearing.&lt;ref name=FoxMay3&gt;{{cite news|title=House sets vote on measure pushing special counsel for IRS probe|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/03/house-gop-pushing-for-special-counsel-to-look-into-irs-scandal/|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Letter_from_DOJ_4_1_15.pdf|title = Letter from Ronald C.

The '''Food Quality Protection Act''' (FQPA), or H.R.1627, was passed unanimously by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in 1996 and was signed into law by [[U.S. President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on August 3, 1996.&lt;ref name="EPA SITE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/laws/fqpa/backgrnd.htm|title=FQPA Background|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FQPA standardized the way the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) would manage the use of pesticides and amended the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] and the [[Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act]]. It mandated a health-based standard for [[pesticides]] used in foods, provided special protections for babies and infants, streamlined the approval of safe pesticides, established incentives for the creation of safer pesticides, and required that pesticide registrations remain current.&lt;ref name="EPA SITE"/&gt;

One of the most prominent sections of the act, the specified protections for babies and infants, was the topic of the [[National Academy of Science]]'s 1993 report, ''Pesticides in the Diets of Infants &amp; Children''. The EPA has cited this report as a catalyst for the creation of the FQPA.&lt;ref name="EPA PUBLISHED"/&gt;

== Background ==

Legislation similar to the FQPA was drafted and presented to Congress in 1995 but was never acted on. In 1996, the political landscape had changed and new pressures to act on pesticide control reform surfaced.&lt;ref name="REFORMS"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bealey, R|title=Pesticide Bill Reforms Delaney|journal=Chemical Week|date=May 10, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a coalition of environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to enforce the [[Delaney clause]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The Delaney clause, an amendment of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, banned all food that contained any trace amount of any pesticide that may cause cancer.&lt;ref name="VICTORIES"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Food Safety Changes, Victories for Many|author=Lee, G|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 28, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the EPA argued that the legislation was outdated and should not apply to the current situation, the coalition won in 1995 and the EPA was slated to ban 80 pesticides in late 1996.&lt;ref name="VICTORIES"/&gt; Under these new, more urgent circumstances, Congress was able to pass a bill that was celebrated by both sides of the debate; farmers, food processors and pesticide manufactures were glad to see the Delaney Clause go, while environmental groups and consumer advocates were pleased to have a formalized safety standard with an added emphasis on children.&lt;ref name="WEISS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Signs New Standards on Food Safety; President also Ratifies Gambling Commission|author=Weiss, R|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 4, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cady, president of the [[National Food Processors Association]], praised the legislation for being "...based on modern, real-world science".&lt;ref name="REFORMS"/&gt; 
[[File:Cropduster spraying pesticides.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[cropduster]] spraying pesticide on a field]]

==FQPA requirements==
The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 has the following requirements:&lt;ref name="requirements"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/laws/fqpa/fqpa_implementation.htm|title=Implementation of Requirements under FQPA|date=September 23, 2010|work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved health standards for food commodities===
The FQPA established a new safety standard (reasonable certainty of no harm) that must be applied to all food commodities. In addition to the new standard the EPA now has to consider the specific risks pesticides might have for infants and children. The FQPA required the re-testing of all existing pesticide tolerance levels within 10 years.  When assessing this risk the EPA is required to take into account the "aggregate risk" (the exposure to a pesticide from multiple sources) and the "cumulative exposure" to pesticides with similar mechanisms of [[toxicity]]. To do this the EPA is required to establish new science policies to assess the risks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/pesticide-science-and-assessing-pesticide-risks/cumulative-assessment-risk-pesticides&lt;/ref&gt;  The FQPA requires the EPA to set tolerances for pesticide uses that fall under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (emergency exemptions).

====Cumulative risk assessment====
The EPA has established guidance for assessing the cumulative risk for multiroute exposures to pesticide groups determined to have a common mechanism of toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/guidance_on_common_mechanism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency has also published guidance on determining whether chemicals share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e., whether they can be assessed as a common mechanism group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/guide-2-identify-pest-chem_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The risk calculation is based on dose addition, where individual pesticide exposure levels are scaled by their relative potency and then summed. Some key uncertainties in this approach include the possibility that relative potency changes with dose, and the potential for toxicological interactions (dose addition assumes no toxicological interactions&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA. 2000. Supplementary guidance for conducting health risk assessment of chemical mixtures. EPA/630/R-00/002. Washington, DC:Risk Assessment Forum.
&lt;/ref&gt;). Another caution is that the resulting risk assessments are not complete environmental health evaluations of all chemical exposures, but only represent risks from those common mechanism pesticides.

===Reduced risk pesticides===
The FQPA mandates that the EPA expedite the approval of reduced risk pesticides. To be considered reduced risk pesticides must have a proven low-impact on human health, have low toxicity to non-target [[organisms]] and have a low potential to contaminate [[groundwater]].

====Minor uses====
The FQPA requires the EPA to give special consideration to pesticides used on products that have less than 300,000 acres of total U.S. production or products that do not have enough economic incentive to either support an initial registration or a continuing registration.

===Public health pesticides===
The FQPA requires the EPA to establish a list of [[pest (organism)|pests]] that are considered significant to [[public health]] and to give special consideration to pesticides with public health uses.  The EPA is also required to provide maintenance fee waivers to and encourage the safe and necessary use of methods/pesticides that either combat or control pests that have been deemed of public health importance. The EPA also provides waiver fees for the pesticides used on pests that are deemed of public health importance.

====Antimicrobial reform====
The FQPA mandates the EPA to expedite the review of applications that are requesting the registration of [[antimicrobial]] products. The FQPA also exempts certain antimicrobial products from the container provisions in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.

====USDA initiatives====
The FQPA requires the conduction of food consumption surveys that track food consumption and related behaviors in the U.S. population. The FQPA mandates the collection of pesticide residue and use data.  The FQPA mandated the promotion of [[integrated pest management]] solutions.

====Other====
The FQPA requires that pesticide registration be reviewed periodically, with a goal of once every 15 years. The FQPA mandated changes in the collection of tolerance fee's, increasing the amount of fee money from $14 million to $16 million to help with the reassessment of tolerances. The FQPA requires the EPA to specifically screen pesticides for disruption to the [[endocrine system]]. The FQPA requires the EPA to establish an integrated pest management education program and implement integrated pest management research and demonstration. The FQPA encourages the syncing of U.S. pesticide tolerances with those of international standards. Under the FQPA individual states are not allowed to set different pesticide tolerances than the EPA and the EPA is required to coordinate data requirements between the state and federal levels. The EPA is required to develop and distribute a food safety brochure and create an annual report on the progress of its registration program.

== Impact ==
The FQPA was the most comprehensive reform of food safety and pesticide laws in decades and posed an implementation challenge for the EPA. Immediately following the passing of the FQPA, the EPA moved to create the Food Safety Advisory Committee.&lt;ref name="EPA PUBLISHED"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/230146100|title=EPA Seeks Public Health Views on New Pesticide Law|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|via=ProQuest Research Library|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was founded with the intention of fostering an open and public implementation process. Within 10 years, the EPA had successfully reassessed 99% of the nation's pesticide tolerances (recommending the revocation of 3,200, recommending the modification of 1,200 and approving 5,237). In addition to the reassessing of pesticide tolerances, the EPA accommodated the use of special classes of pesticides, addressed the public policy issue of [[clinical studies]] to verify pesticide effects, and expedited the availability of safe pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/laws/fqpa/fqpa_accomplishments.htm|title=Accomplishments Under the Food Quality Protection Act|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the EPA did limit, and in some cases ban, the use of pesticides following the passing of the FQPA, not every stakeholder was pleased with their level of action. Referring to the discrepancies between what constitutes reliable data when determining whether or not to increase the margin of safety tenfold, Richard Weiss (a pesticide expert with the [[Environmental Working Group]]) said, "The EPA has failed to comply with the clear intent and requirements of the law".&lt;ref name="FIRE"/&gt; While environmentalists complained, so did farmers. As their ability to harvest quality crops was threatened, farmers said the EPA was unfairly enforcing a "zero risk" instead of a "reasonable certainty of no harm" policy. The EPA responded saying that while they were more stringent after the passing of the FQPA, they were not operating under a no risk/no harm rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concern Grows About EPA Rules, Pesticide Limits Worry Farmers|author=Valentine, P|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 10, 1998|agency=LexisNexis Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emphasis on children ==
The passing of the FQPA marked the first time the EPA was asked to directly address the risks pesticides pose for infants and children. Because children are smaller, the pesticides they ingest have a proportionately greater impact. The FQPA required the EPA to enforce a safety margin 10 times greater than before if reliable data proving that the pesticide posed no risk for children could not be provided.&lt;ref name="FIRE"&gt;{{cite news|title=Environmental Agency Under Fire on Safety Rules|author=Cushman, J|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 29, 1997|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A15FF3F550C7A8EDDAB0994DF494D81&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the bill's passing, former President Bill Clinton said, "If a pesticide poses a danger to our children, then it won't be in our food".&lt;ref name="CLINTON"&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Praises Bill Regulating Pesticides|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 4, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/04/us/clinton-praises-bill-regulating-pesticides.html?scp=19&amp;sq=%22food%20quality%20protection%20act%22&amp;st=cse|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of [[methyl parathion]] and [[azinphos methyl]], citing the risks they pose to children.&lt;ref name="CITING CHILDREN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Citing Children, EPA is limiting use of a Pesticide|author=Wald, M|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 3, 1999|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A16FB35550C708CDDA10894D1494D81&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=%22food%20quality%20protection%20act%22&amp;st=cse|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both methyl parathion and azinphos methyl are [[organophosphates]]. Organophosphates are pesticides that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides have the same effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, ([[chlorpyrifos]]), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.&lt;ref name="CITING RISKS"&gt;{{cite news|title=EPA, Citing Risks to Children, Signs Accord to Limit Insecticide|author=Revkin, A|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 9, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/09/us/epa-citing-risks-to-children-signs-accord-to-limit-insecticide.html?scp=17&amp;sq=%22food%20quality%20protection%20act%22&amp;st=cse|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions on these pesticides, although mandated on the premise of child safety, were not received unanimously well by groups outside the EPA. Both agriculture representatives and environmentalists sounded off after the EPA made its decisions.&lt;ref name="CUSHMAN"&gt;Cushman, J. (December 19, 1997) Pesticide child-safety limits have EPA drawing fire. The Charleston Gazette.&lt;/ref&gt; "Chemical Business News" published an article suggesting that the idea that pesticides pose special dangers for children was actually an alarmist issue not based in science.&lt;ref name="CHEMICAL"&gt;Pesticide Outlook: Are infants and children really more vulnerable than adults to the potential adverse effects of pesticides? (November 16, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Agriculture lobbies claimed that the banning of organophosphates would cause the agriculture industry an annual loss of $1.8 billion.&lt;ref name="SANFRAN"&gt;EPA Pesticide crackdown gets plenty of complaints. (August 9, 1999) The San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists argued that the EPA was buckling under the pressure of these lobbies and needed to uphold the legal safety standard mandated in the FQPA.&lt;ref name="SANFRAN"/&gt;  In response the EPA published a report saying that they stood by their decisions and the 10 fold safety increase was both conservative and prudent and was only applicable under special circumstances.&lt;ref name="CUSHMAN"/&gt;

== Clinical studies debate ==
In 1998, the EPA placed a moratorium on clinical studies, or human studies, citing both ethical and scientific concerns.&lt;ref name="DEBATE"&gt;{{cite news|title=Debate Erupts Over Testing Pesticides on Humans|author=Grady, D|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 2003|accessdate=October 18, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/09/us/debate-erupts-over-testing-pesticides-on-humans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the use of clinical studies for pesticide tolerances had been in decline since the 1980s, the passing of the FQPA re-generated interest in the practice. By testing on humans, pesticide manufacturers could eliminate the additional safety margins required when using data collected from animal testing.&lt;ref name="MILLOY"&gt;{{cite news|title=EPA's Way of Pulling the Pesticide Plug|author=Milloy, S|newspaper=The Washington Times|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their moratorium the EPA had the National Academy of Sciences convene a panel of experts to determine the ethical solution to the human studies debate.&lt;ref name="DEBATE"/&gt; While the National Academy of Sciences established the panel, both pesticide manufacturers and environmentalists established their own opinions. The Environmental Working Group and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] argued that clinical studies were both inaccurate and ethically wrong; pesticide manufacturers argued that not only were clinical studies crucial but that they must be allowed to conduct the tests to determine "No observable adverse effects level", meaning they administer the drug until an effect is observed.&lt;ref name="REPORT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report Sets Stage for Human Testing Debate &amp; Pesticides|author=Franz, N.|newspaper=Chemical Week|date=August 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Academy of Sciences released a report in 2004 supporting the use of clinical studies under strict regulations; the regulations mandated that the study's benefit to society outweigh the risk to the individual, that the study be conducted under a strict ethical code, that there be reasonable certainty that no harm will come to participants and that it has been shown that no other study will work.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sissell,K|title=NAS Backs Limited Use of Human Test Data|journal=Chemical Week|date=February 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, adhering to a congressional directive, the EPA adopted the Human Studies Regulation; the regulations permit human studies, do not allow the use of pregnant women or children in human studies, mandate that a strict ethical code be followed and establish a Human Studies Review Board to oversee the use of human studies. The EPA considers the regulations as a major accomplishment in public policy.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/laws/fqpa/fqpa_accomplishments.htm#advancing|title=Addressing Major Public Policy Concerns, "Accomplishments Under the FQPA"|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forum''', formerly known as the '''National Arbitration Forum''' (NAF) is an American organization that provides [[arbitration]] and [[mediation]] services to businesses, based at its [[Minneapolis]] headquarters and offices in [[New Jersey]].  The organization was founded in 1986.  As of 2008, the National Arbitration Forum administered over 200,000 cases a year, most of which were consumer debt collection cases.&lt;ref name=Businessweek /&gt;   In 2009, the National Arbitration Forum ceased administration of new [[consumer arbitration]]s as part of a consent decree with the [[Attorney General of Minnesota]] [[Lori Swanson]] concerning the NAF's ties with [[debt collection]] firms.&lt;ref name=berner&gt;{{cite web|last=Berner|first=Robert|title=Big Arbitration Firm Pulls Out of Credit Card Business|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-07-18/big-arbitration-firm-pulls-out-of-credit-card-business|publisher=Business Week|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The company maintains a panel of over 1,600 [[arbitrator]]s and [[mediation|mediator]]s who are [[Lawyer|attorneys]] and former [[judge]]s located across the [[United States]] and in 35 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adrforum.com/main.aspx?itemID=296&amp;hideBar=False&amp;navID=153&amp;news=3 National Arbitration Forum : Locations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Panelists arbitrate and mediate the disputes.

The company is an "approved"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm ICANN]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dispute resolution]] service provider of [[ICANN]] [[domain name]] disputes and has handled more than 7,600 cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domainsmagazine.com/Domains_12/Domain_6303.shtml ''Domain Mangazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The NAF was founded in 1986 as a subsidiary of another company, Equilaw, which subsequently went bankrupt in 1994.  NAF survived the bankruptcy and appears to have grown rapidly in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/documents/arbitrationtrap.pdf Citizen.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAF and [[Lawyers Associated Worldwide (LAW)]] work together on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawyersworldwide.com/content/newsletters/all_law_members%20LAW%20Member%20Newsletter%2001-19.htm Lawyers world wide]&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Arbitration Forum is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

=== Domain name disputes ===
An approved domain name dispute program provider for [[ICANN]], the NAF has administered over 10,000 [[domain name]] disputes since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domains.adrforum.com/decision.aspx Domains]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of domain name disputes administered is on the rise, up 143 cases from 2006 to 2007.  The NAF deals predominantly with registered domain names that are abused by parties who have no legitimate rights to them.  Some of the famous [[trademark]]s involved in NAF domain name dispute resolutions include [[Los Angeles Angels]], [[Disney]], [[Hershey's Kisses]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], and [[Univision]], most recently [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnforum.com/f247/national-arbitration-forum-reports-rise-domain-name-disputes-page-ranking-usa-net-press-release-thread-282181.html DN Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Consumer advocacy groups and attorneys frequently claim that the National Arbitration Forum is the most biased against consumers of the major arbitration organizations.

In its June 16, 2008 cover story, ''[[Business Week]]'' published an in-depth look at credit collection arbitrations at NAF. The story describes how NAF markets itself to collection lawyers and then works with them in ways that raise questions about its impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_24/b4088072611398.htm ''Business Week'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Citizen study ===
In 2007, non-profit consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] criticized the National Arbitration Forum, including its fee schedule and alleged bias.&lt;ref name=MacLeery&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/pressroomredirect.cfm?ID=2521 | title = New Public Citizen Report Shows that Credit Card Companies Set an Arbitration Trap to Ensnare Consumers | first = Laura | last = MacLeery | publisher = Public Citizen | date = October 11, 2007 | accessdate = 18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a July 2008 Navigant analysis of the Public Citizen data,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/issues/docload.cfm?docid=1212 Institute for Legal Reform]&lt;/ref&gt; 26,665 arbitrations out of a total of 33,948 arbitrations were either heard or dismissed (i.e. excluding [[Settlement (litigation)|settlements]]).  According to the analysis, of these 26,665 arbitrations, consumer parties were reported to have prevailed outright or had the case against them dismissed in 8,558 cases (32.1%).  In an additional 4,376 cases (16.4%), the arbitrator did not award the full amount demanded by the business.

In March 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-report-domain-name-dispute-stats-reveal-concern-over-panelist-appointment-88825337.html Domain Name Dispute Stats Reveal Concern Over Panelist Appointment]&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the National Arbitration Forum's record of panelist appointments for domain name disputes was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnattorney.com/study.shtml Dnattorney.com web site]&lt;/ref&gt; It raised concern that a small handful of the NAF's roster panelists were appointed to hear disproportionately many cases. In one instance, a single panelist was appointed to hear 949 cases, or about 10% of all NAF domain name dispute cases ever heard. In August 2012, the study was updated and it showed a continued concentration of panellists appointments wherein seven NAF-selected panelists were appointed to hear nearly half of all cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnattorney.com/NAFdomainnamedisputestudy2012.shtml DNattorney.com Domain Name Dispute Study, August, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Legislation and lawsuits against NAF==

=== City of San Francisco lawsuit  ===
In March 2008, the City of [[San Francisco]] filed a lawsuit against the National Arbitration Forum on behalf of its citizens, accusing the arbitrator of unfairly favoring credit card companies in disputes with their customers.&lt;ref name=Businessweek&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2008-06-04/banks-vs-dot-consumers-guess-who-wins | title = Banks vs. Consumers (Guess Who Wins) | first = Robert | last = Berner | first2 = Brian | last2= Grow | date = June 4, 2008 | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | work = Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city alleged that the NAF was practicing unethically and wrongly with such specific concerns as ignoring evidence, inflating awards and declining hearing requests by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfcityattorney.org/index.aspx?page=178 | title = National Arbitration Forum case | publisher = San Francisco City Attorney | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140201173219/http://www.sfcityattorney.org/index.aspx?page=178 | archivedate = 1 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit said that between January 2003 and March 2007, consumers won 0.2% of the 18,075 arbitration cases in California that were not dropped, settled or otherwise dismissed.&lt;ref name=Businessweek/&gt;

=== Businessweek's allegations of bias ===
In June 2008, ''Businessweek'' made broad claims of NAF's bias in favor of consumer creditors and hidden conflict of interest.  According to the article, NAF markets itself to consumer credit providers, collection agencies and law firms.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Businessweek]]``, 5 June 2008, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_24/b4088072611398_page_2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ex-employee lawsuit===
In April 2009 an ex-employee filed suit against NAF "for employment discrimination, deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud." The suit said that "During the course of plaintiff’s employment at defendants, she witnessed fraudulent and corrupt practices in the administration of arbitration cases."&lt;ref&gt;''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'', 20 July 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/martens07202009.html Judicial Apartheid: Heralded by the Supreme Court as Fair, Vast Private Judicial System Exposed as Fraud]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minnesota Attorney General lawsuit===
On July 14, 2009, the [[Minnesota Attorney General]] [[Lori Swanson]] brought a lawsuit against the National Arbitration Forum for consumer fraud, deceptive trade and false statements in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ag.state.mn.us/pdf/pressreleases/signedfiledcomplaintarbitrationcompany.pdf | title = State of Minnesota v. National Arbitration Forum, et al. Complaint | first = Lori | last = Swanson | date = July 14, 2009 | accessdate = 18 December 2013 | publisher = State of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key to their complaint was allegations that the NAF had deliberately hidden its ties to the businesses it represented and actively encouraged their naming as mandatory arbitrators in contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/minn._ag_sues_credit_card_arbitration_company_claims_hidden_industry_ties/ | title = Minn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3827">The '''France–Korea Treaty of 1886''' was negotiated between representatives of France and Korea.

==Background==
In 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached [[Ganghwado]] and threatened to fire on the Korean capital city. Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil. (2005). {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|''The History of Korea,'' pp. 107-108.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations,&lt;ref&gt;Yŏng-ho Ch'oe ''et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|A9LoA9L1ABcC|''Sources of Korean Tradition,'' p. 235|page=235}}; excerpt, "''Korea signed a similar accord with the United States (the ''Treaty of Chelump'o'', 1882) that was followed by similar agreements with other Western nations'';" Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921-1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament,'' p. 29.|page=29}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Korea. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation dated May 22, 1882."&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.

==Treaty provisions==
The French and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to other Western nations.&lt;ref name="mission32"&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 32.|page=32}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between Korea and France. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation dated June 4, 1886"; Kim, {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|p. 107.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministers from France to Korea were appointed in accordance with this treaty; and they were: [[Victor Collin de Plancy]], appointed in 1888; H. Fradin, in 1892; and Collin de Plancy again in 1901.&lt;ref name="mission32"/&gt;

The treaty remained in effect even after [[Korea under Japanese rule|the protectorate was established]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 36.|page=36}}; excerpt, "''Official rescript issued by Japan, November 22, 1905, declares: 'In bringing this agreement to the notice of the powers having treaties with Korea, the Imperial Government declares that * * * they will see that these treaties are maintained and respected, and they also engage not to prejudice In any way the legitimate commercial and industrial interests of those powers in Korea'.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9731">A '''freight claim''' or '''cargo claim''' is a legal demand by a shipper or consignee against a carrier in respect of damage to a shipment, or loss thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary - Online Edition. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freight%20claim&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; "Freight" has two meanings: in common parlance, it means "cargo"; in the law of carriage it means the "cost of carriage".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freight claims are also known as "shipping claims", "transportation claims", or "loss and damage claims".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typically, the claimant will seek [[damages]] (financial compensation for loss), but other [[legal remedy|remedies]] include "[[specific performance]]", where the cargo-owner seeks delivery of the goods as agreed. At [[common law]], any carrier has a duty to act with reasonable despatch.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' (1854)   &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea|M'Andrew  v Adams]]'' (1834) 1 Bing NC 29 &lt;/ref&gt; A "[[common carrier]]" may have strict liability,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Seaworthiness (law)|Liver Alkali v Johnson]]'' xx &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; iLaw report on ''Liver Alkali v Johnson'' [https://www.i-law.com/ilaw/doc/view.htm?id=371153]&lt;/ref&gt;  but normally the standard of care is only one of "due diligence", or acting "properly and carefully".&lt;ref&gt; [[Hague-Visby Rules]] Art III Rules 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal aspects==
The purpose of a freight claim is for the carrier to reimburse the shipper / consignee so as to put them in the position is if the carriage had been properly had carried out according to the [[bill of lading]].&lt;ref&gt;The bill of lading will evidence the terms of the contract of carriage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TransportGistics. ''Over, Short and Damage Claims or Loss and Damage Claims'' http://www.insourceaudit.com/Whitepapers/ldclaims.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, claimants are generally expected to file a claim to recover their costs, excluding profits. In very rare cases some profits may be recoverable, but a court will normally consider lost profits as non-recoverable [[economic loss]].
&lt;ref&gt;TranSolutions Inc. ''Question: Can You Profit From a Freight Claim?'' http://www.transolutionsinc.com/blog/question-can-you-profit-from-a-freight-claim/&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, redress will be paid by the carrier's [[cargo insurance|insurer]] or [[protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I Club]], and so the [[law of insurance]] will determine quantum of damages.  Loss is deemed either "total" (either "actual" or "constructive") or "partial".&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Asfar v Blundell]]'' [1896] 1 QB 123]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Asfar v Blundell'' [https://quizlet.com/27678705/perished-goods-frustration-of-contract-flash-cards/]&lt;/ref&gt; If the insurance policy is a "valued policy", the amount agreed is, in the absence of fraud, conclusive (except in cases of "constructive total loss", when the true market value prevails).

Under [[law of contract|contract law]], claimants are obliged to take reasonable measures to mitigate loss. For example, if the damaged product has retained some value, the carrier would only be required to pay for the difference between the original value and the damaged value. The claimant would then be free to salvage the damaged product by selling it at a reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;LeanCor Supply Chain Group. ''Freight Claims: How Much Are They Really Costing You?'' 2013. http://leanlogisticsblog.leancor.com/2013/02/13/freight-claims-how-much-are-they-really-costing-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

The consignee is entitled to inspect the goods, and to reject them if they are damaged or fail to comply with description. The inspection should take place at the first reasonable place and opportunity; this will often be at the consignee's depot or place of business. At the time of delivery, the consignee should examine the shipment for loss or damage, and should note any issues on the delivery receipt; this will be used as evidence to back up the claim.&lt;ref name="Broussard"&gt;Broussard, Steve. ''Back to Basics: Receiving Procedures That Will Save You Money'' TRANSDIGEST-Volume XVII, Issue No. 175, September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

If significant evidence of loss or damage is noticed on delivery, the consignee will be entitled to reject the shipment,&lt;ref&gt; Note: "rejection" of a consignment is NOT in itself a repudiation of the contract.&lt;/ref&gt; and may also have the option to [[anticipatory repudiation|cancel]] the entire contract.

If the consignee signs off on the delivery receipt but the damage is concealed (or "latent" or "hidden") and is discovered only subsequently, a claim will still be allowed provided it is made within a reasonable time. &lt;ref&gt;Move-It With Jon ''Essential Rules On Freight Damage'' http://moveitwithjon.com/blog/essential-rules-freight-damage/&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, the shipper or consignee must show that the damage was indeed caused by the carrier, rather than by the shipper or consignee.&lt;ref name="Broussard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; When damage is not immediately recognizable, this is known as a ''concealed damage claim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier will normally require the shipper to pay freight (the "shipment invoice") in advance; otherwise a"clean" bill of lading will not be issued, and the document will declare "Freight Not Paid". In the event of loss or damage, the consignee would file a freight claim against the carrier for (i) damages to cover the loss and (ii) reimbursement of any freight paid. The shipper will not be able to make any claim except as an [[Agent (law)|agent]] of the consignee.

==Carrier liability==
The extent of the carrier's is liability may depend upon the shipping mode and the governing bodies. The [[Carmack amendment]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} states that motor or rail carriers are liable for the full loss.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Conversely, the US COGSA states that the carrier is liable for no more than $500 per package.&lt;ref&gt;Logistics Management ''Logistics and the Law: Freight claims in plain English'' page 2 http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/logistics_and_the_law_freight_claims_in_plain_english/D2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of import/export transactions international conventions on [[Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims|limitation of liability]] may apply.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd|Scruttons v Midland Silicones]]'' [1962] AC 446 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[NZ Shipping Co Ltd v A M Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1974] UKPC 4 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Article IV of the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] lists more than 17 exclusions of the carrier's liability. Other international conventions such as the [[Hague Rules]], the [[Hamburg Rules]] and the [[Rotterdam Rules]] have similar provisions exempting liability. 

Perhaps the four main scenarios in which a carrier is not deemed liable for damage to goods are:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gregory v Commonwealth Railways Cmr]]'' (1941) 66 CLR 50 at 74&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Act of God|Act of nature]]
* [[Force majeure|Act of the public enemy]]
* Fault of the shipper &lt;ref&gt; ... such as insufficient packaging or labelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Insufficiency of packing: Hague-Visby Rules Art IV, r 2(n)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[Goodwin v Lamport and Holt]]'' [1929] All ER 623&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Inherent vice (library and archival science)#Legal definition|Defects in the goods themselves]]

==Filing a freight claim==

Each carrier typically provides a [[Standard form contract|standard form]] specifically for filing freight claims. However, by law, no particular form is necessary, as long as the following four details are present:

*The shipment must be specified
*The loss or damage type must be specified
*The total of the amount claimed must be specified
*A clear demand for payment must be present

Information to identify the shipment may include the freight bill PRO #, the vehicle number, and the delivery date.

In addition to this basic information, the following documentation should also be provided:

*Shipment invoice
*Delivery receipt
*Bill of lading
*Invoice showing the value of the product being claimed&lt;ref&gt;Freight payment: 10 freight invoice facts everyone should know [https://www.controlpay.com/blog/freight-payment-10-freight-invoice-facts-everyone-should-know]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Invoices for costs incurred (i.e. repairs or replacements of the product)

Additional supporting documentation may also be included or required.&lt;ref&gt;TranSolutions Inc. ''How To File A Freight Claim – The Beginner’s Guide'' http://www.transolutionsinc.com/blog/file-freight-claim-beginners-guide/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filing deadlines===

Different rules and filing deadlines will apply depending on the shipping mode. This is due to differences in how specific shipping modes are governed.

Rail and motor carriers are governed by the Carmack Amendment. The Carmack Amendment states that claimants have a minimum of 9 months from the date of delivery to file a freight claim.

Conversely, ocean carriers that service the US are governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA). This act requires that claimants file a claim within 3 days of delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Logistics Management ''Logistics and the Law: Freight claims in plain English'' page 1 http://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/logistics_and_the_law_freight_claims_in_plain_english/D1/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation and Management of Middle-European Populations of the Great Bustard''' is a multilateral environmental [[memorandum of understanding]] and was concluded in 2000 under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]], and came into effect on 1 June 2001. It aims to protect the Middle-European populations of the great bustard and to manage modern agriculture throughout its range in Central Europe in order to save the remaining individuals. The MoU covers 17 range states (Albania, Austria, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, European Union, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, The Republic of Macedonia and Ukraine). As of August 2012, 13 range states have signed the MoU as well as a number of cooperating organizations.

== Development of MoU ==
[[File:Signing of the Great Bustard MoU by Greece.jpg|thumb|290px|Signing of the Great Bustard MoU by Greece, 22 May 2001]]
To implement the decision of the Fourth Conference of the Parties of CMS to list the [[great bustard]] (''Otis tarda'') on Appendix II of the Convention as a consequence of its unfavourable conservation status and the conviction that the species could benefit from an international agreement for its conservation and management and the middle-European population on Appendix I of the Convention taking into consideration the threatened status, an Article IV agreement was concluded in 2000 and entered into effect on 1 June 2001 after signature by the fifth range state. As of August 2012, the MoU has 13 signatories.

Signatories to the Great Bustard MoU:
* Romania (9 September 2000)
* Hungary (7 October 2000)
* The Republic of Macedonia (7 October 2000)
* Moldova (19 December 2000)
* Bulgaria (16 May 2001)
* Greece (22 May 2001)
* Austria (28 November 2001)
* Slovakia (28 November 2001)
* Ukraine (17 April 2002)
* Albania (18 April 2002)
* Croatia (4 June 2002)
* Germany (18 September 2002)
* Czech Republic (18 February 2008)

In addition, four organizations have signed the MoU as collaborators:
* [[BirdLife International]] (7 October 2000)
* [[International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation]] (CIC) (10 October 2000)
* [[IUCN]] (7 October 2000)
* UNEP/CMS Secretariat (5 October 2000)

== Aim of MoU ==
Concerned by the fact that great bustard populations in Central and Eastern Europe were, with approximately 2,000 individuals at the time the MoU was concluded, in serious decline and had reached a very vulnerable level to the brink of extinction, the MoU provides a framework for governments, scientists, conservation bodies and others to monitor and coordinate conservation efforts. These efforts need to focus on active habitat management and on maintaining large areas of non-intensive farming systems.

== Species covered by MoU ==
[[File:Otis tarda distribution.png|thumb|350px|Great bustard (''Otis tarda'') distribution map]]
The MoU only covers the middle-European populations of the [[great bustard]] (''Otis tarda''). Several remnant great bustard populations that can be found in, inter alia, Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Russia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia are not included.

== Fundamental components ==
All signatories shall endeavour to work closely together and with appropriate international organizations to improve the conservation status of the great bustard throughout its breeding, migratory and wintering range. Therefore, they shall:&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Great Bustard Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/otis_tarda/otis_tarda_text.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conserve the great bustard population and, where feasible and appropriate, restore important habitat
# Prohibit the taking of middle-European population with some exceptions e.g. scientific purposes
# Endeavour to provide maximum protection to, and where feasible, the habitat of the great bustard at its remaining breeding sites including all those areas where the females rear their young
# Identify and monitor processes and categories of activities that are endangering or are likely further to endanger the species and take appropriate steps to regulate and manage these with a view to improving the conservation status
# Endeavour to map the recently abandoned breeding habitat and implement in such areas suitable habitat management measures and agricultural practices with a view to encouraging the return of great bustard populations to those areas in the near future
# Endeavour to identify and conserve potential unoccupied breeding habitats
# Endeavour to take appropriate measures to protect single individuals or small groups appearing on migration or on wintering sites in grasslands or agricultural areas
# Implement the provisions of the Action Plan, annexed to the MoU

The MoU was concluded for a period of five years starting from the date of its entry into effect (June 2001). It was automatically renewed for a period of three years and thereafter every three years for a further period of three years, unless the majority of the signatories decide otherwise.

== Meetings ==
Meetings of signatories – range states that signed the MoU – shall be convened by the Secretariat upon request of at least half of the states which are signatories, subject to the availability of funds. During these meetings the conservation status of the great bustard and the implementation of the Action Plan will be reviewed. Also the national reports submitted by individual signatories, the report prepared by the Secretariat and any recommendation or scientific advice that may have been made by the Conference of the Parties or the Scientific Council of the CMS will be considered. Finally, the meeting can recommend the signatories to take action that it thinks fit.

'''The First Meeting of Signatories''' took place in [[Illmitz|Illmitz, Austria]], 17 and 18 September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2004/240904_GB_First_Range_State_Meeting.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting the following points were addressed:
* Share information on (i) the great bustard’s conservation status within the respective range states, (ii) the status of development and implementation of the National Work Programmes, (iii) the status of implementation of the MoU and the Action Plan and (iv) the status of signatures to the MoU
* Develop a list of designated national contact points
* Consider a draft Medium-term International Work Programme

The signatories represented at the meeting were Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Hungary, Germany, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine. Greece and Albania, also signatories to the MoU were not represented. The first meeting endorsed the Russian Federation to join the MoU, but Russian representatives weren’t able to come because of the ongoing complicated process of the reorganization of their federal bodies. A number of organizations such as BirdLife International, IUCN and WWF Austria were also present during the meeting.

'''The Second Meeting of Signatories''' was held in [[Feodosia|Feodosia, Ukraine]], 11 and 12 November 2008. The signatories represented at the meeting were Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia and Ukraine. Albania, Croatia, Romania, Moldova, Greece and Slovakia, also signatories to the MoU were not represented. Additionally, a representative from the Russian Federation attended the meeting as observer. Finally, a number of organizations such as BirdLife International, Ukrainian Society for the Protection of Birds and the [[Russian Bird Conservation Union]] were present during the meeting.

'''The Third Meeting of Signatories''' was scheduled to take place in April 2013. Hungary offered to host this meeting.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat - located in [[Bonn, Germany]] - acts as the secretariat to the MoU. The main tasks of this body are the following:
* Convene the meeting of the signatories and report the outcome of the meeting to the Conference of the Parties of the CMS;
* Prepare an overview report compiled on the basis of all information at its disposal pertaining to the great bustard and communicate this information to all signatories, other range states and signing organizations;
* Be the depositary of the MoU.

== Action Plan ==
The Action Plan is annexed to the MoU and is an integral part thereof. It consists out of two parts. Part one contains general provision regarding:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/species/otis_tarda/docs/otis_tarda_ap.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;
* Habitat protection
* Prevention of hunting, disturbance and other threats
* Possession and trade
* Recovery measures
* Cross-border conservation measures
* Monitoring and research
* Training of staff working in conservation bodies
* Increasing awareness of the need to protect great bustards and their habitat
* Economic measures

Part two lists specific activities appropriate for each range state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/species/otis_tarda/docs/ot_ap_pt2_countryspecific.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial support ==
Several grants from the European Union LIFE programme have helped fund great bustard protection efforts in central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;EU LIFE Programme: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/&lt;/ref&gt; Programmes are in place to protect breeding areas, provide feeding areas, provide feeding areas for wintering birds and minimize collisions between the birds and power lines. In several EU states, agri-environmental schemes financed by the European Agricultural and Rural Development Fund encourage farmers to maintain or adopt appropriate measures.

== Activities and successes ==
Until recently there had been plans for the construction of a wind farm within and around a [[Special Protection Area|Special protection Area (SPA)]] and [[Natura 2000]] site in the [[Salonta|Salonta region]], Bihor County, Romania, which provides important wintering habitat for the great bustard. At the Second Meeting of Signatories it was acknowledged that the population trends were improving in Germany, Austria and Hungary. However, there was a concern that the population trends might be negative in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Romania. Therefore, the planned wind farm could have negative effects on the great bustard populations in Romania and Hungary as well since the Salonta region is near the Hungarian-Romanian border. In July 2012 the CMS Secretariat has received good news regarding this project. The Romanian Ministry of Environment and Forests confirmed its commitment to relocate the wind farm to an alternative location, thereby limiting conflict with the great bustard populations in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://greatbustard.org/news/2012/09/5624/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Guatemala]] on 30 January 1994.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p323 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed a [[1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] and an attempted [[self-coup]] on 25 May 1993 by President [[Jorge Serrano Elías]]. Among the reforms was a plan to reduce the parliamentary term of the current government.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Nohlen, p330&lt;/ref&gt; The changes were approved by 83.9% of voters, although voter turnout was just 15.9%.&lt;ref name=DN/&gt;

The '''history of competition law''' refers to attempts by governments to regulate competitive markets for goods and services, leading up to the modern [[Competition law|competition]] or [[antitrust]] laws around the world today. The earliest records traces back to the efforts of Roman legislators to control price fluctuations and unfair trade practices. Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, kings and queens repeatedly cracked down on monopolies, including those created through state legislation. The English [[common law]] doctrine of [[restraint of trade]] became the precursor to modern competition law. This grew out of the codifications of United States [[antitrust]] statutes, which in turn had considerable influence on the development of [[European Community competition law]]s after the [[Second World War]]. Increasingly the focus has moved to international competition enforcement in a globalised economy.

==Early history==
{{Competition law}}
Laws governing competition law are found in over two millennia of history. Roman Emperors and Mediaeval monarchs alike used [[tariff]]s to stabilise prices or support local production. The formal study of "competition", began in earnest during the 18th century with such works as [[Adam Smith]]'s [[The Wealth of Nations]]. Different terms were used to describe this area of the law, including "[[restrictive practices]]", "the law of monopolies", "[[combination acts]]" and the "[[restraint of trade]]".

===Roman legislation===
{{seealso|Roman law}}
The earliest surviving example of modern competition law's ancestors appears in the ''Lex Julia de Annona'', enacted during the [[Roman Republic]] around 50 BC.&lt;ref&gt;This is Julius Caesar's time according to Babled in ''De La Cure Annone chez le Romains''&lt;/ref&gt; To protect the corn trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately and insidiously stopping supply ships.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.20"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Diocletian]], in 301 AD an [[Edict on maximum prices]] established a death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.20"/&gt; The most legislation came under the Constitution of Zeno of 483 AD which can be traced into Florentine Municipal laws of 1322 and 1325.&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.22&lt;/ref&gt; It provided for property confiscation and banishment for any trade combinations or joint action of monopolies private ''or'' granted by the Emperor. [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights.&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.21"&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justinian I]] also introduced legislation not long after to pay officials to manage state monopolies. As Europe slipped into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], so did the records of law making until the Middle Ages brought greater expansion of trade in the time of ''[[lex mercatoria]]''.

===Middle ages===
{{seealso|Lex Mercatoria|Guilds}}
[[Image:Edward3.jpg|left|thumb|Edward III during the [[Black Death]] enacted the [[Statute of Labourers]] to cap wages, and provide double damages against infringers]]
Legislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices were in force well before the [[Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref name="Wilberforce 1966 p.21"/&gt; The [[Domesday Book]] recorded that "[[Engrossing (law)|foresteel]]" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reached market and then inflating the prices) was one of three [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]] that [[King Edward the Confessor]] could carry out through England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]], ''History of English Law'' Vol. II, 453&lt;/ref&gt; Concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under Henry III, an Act was passed in 1266&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 1&lt;/ref&gt; to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with corn prices laid down by the [[assize]]s. Penalties for breach included [[amercement]]s, [[pillory]] and [[tumbrel]].&lt;ref&gt;51 &amp; 52 Hen. 3, Stat. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A fourteenth century statute labelled forestallers as "oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country."&lt;ref&gt;Wilberforce (1966) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[King Edward III]], the [[Statute of Labourers]] of 1349&lt;ref&gt;23 Edw. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum they received, an idea that has been replicated in [[Punitive damages|punitive]] [[treble damages]] under [[US antitrust law]]. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision in the poetic language of the time outlawed trade combinations.&lt;ref&gt;27 Edw. 3, Stat. 2, c. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...we have ordained and established, that no merchant or other shall make Confederacy, Conspiracy, Coin, Imagination, or Murmur, or Evil Device in any point that may turn to the Impeachment, Disturbance, Defeating or Decay of the said Staples, or of anything that to them pertaineth, or may pertain."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of legislation in Europe include the ''constitutiones juris metallici'' by [[Wenceslas II]] of [[Bohemia]] between 1283 and 1305, condemning combinations of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]'s legislation against state monopolies; and under [[Emperor Charles V]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] a law was passed "to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands." In 1553 [[King Henry VIII]] reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilise prices in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. The legislation read here that whereas,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"it is very hard and difficult to put certain prices to any such things... [it is necessary because] prices of such victuals be many times enhanced and raised by the Greedy Covetousness and Appetites of the Owners of such Victuals, by occasion of ingrossing and regrating the same, more than upon any reasonable or just ground or cause, to the great damage and impoverishing of the King's subjects."&lt;ref&gt;25 Hen. 8, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around this time, organisations representing various tradesmen and handicraftspeople, known as [[guild]]s had been established and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

===Renaissance developments===
{{seealso|Renaissance}}
[[Image:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth I assured monopolies would not be abused in the early era of [[globalisation]]]]
Europe around the 15th century was changing quickly. The new world had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561, a system of Industrial Monopoly Licences, similar to modern [[patents]] had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new in the way of innovation or manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[William Searle Holdsworth]], 4 Holdsworth, 3rd ed., Chap. 4 p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; When a protest was made in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and a Bill was introduced, the Queen convinced the protesters to challenge the case in the courts. This was the catalyst for the [[Case of Monopolies]] or ''[[Darcy v Allin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1602) 11 Co. Rep. 84b&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff, an officer of the Queen's household, had been granted the sole right of making playing cards and claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increases (2) quality decrease (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put a temporary end to complaints about monopoly, until [[James I of England|King James I]] began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the [[Statute of Monopolies]], which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as the guilds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} From [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], through the civil war and to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], monopolies continued, and were considered especially useful for raising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. one John Manley paid £10,000 p.a. from 1654 to the Crown for a tender on the "postage of letters both inland and foreign" Wilberforce (1966) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1684, in ''[[East India Company v Sandys]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1685) 10 St. Tr. 371&lt;/ref&gt; it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas. In 1710, to deal with high coal prices caused by a Newcastle Coal Monopoly, the New Law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;9 Anne, c. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Its provisions stated that "all and every contract or contracts, Covenants and Agreements, whether the same be in writing or not in writing...[between] persons whatsoever concerned the said Coal trade, for Ingrossing Coals, or for restraining or hindering any Person or Persons whomsoever from freely... disposing of Coals....  are hereby declared to be illegal." When Adam Smith wrote the ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, An Enquiry into the Wealth of Nations'' (1776)&lt;/ref&gt; he was somewhat cynical of the possibility for change.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To expect indeed that freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain is as absurd as to expect that [[The Commonwealth of Oceana|Oceana]] or [[Utopia]] should ever be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the public, but what is more unconquerable, the private interests of many individuals irresistibly oppose it. The Member of Parliament who supports any proposal for strengthening this Monopoly is seen to acquire not only the reputation for understanding trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose members and wealth render them of great importance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Restraint of trade===
{{main|Restraint of trade}}
[[Image:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|200pxl|Judge [[Edward Coke|Coke]] in the 17th century thought that general restraints on trade were unreasonable.]]
The English law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law.&lt;ref&gt;"the modern common law of England [has] passed directly into the legislation and thereafter into the judge-made law of the United States." Wilberforce (1966) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Its current use is small, given modern and economically oriented statutes in most common law countries. Its approach was based on the two concepts of prohibiting agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the [[Reasonable person|reasonableness]] of an agreement could be shown. A restraint of trade is simply some kind of agreed provision that is designed to restrain another's trade. For example, in ''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun Co]]''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Gun Co]]'' [1894] AC 535&lt;/ref&gt; a Swedish arms inventor promised on sale of his business to an American gun maker that he "would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world, and would not compete with Maxim in any way."

To consider whether or not there is a restraint of trade in the first place, both parties must have provided valuable [[consideration]] for their agreement. In ''[[Dyer's case]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26&lt;/ref&gt; a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The common law has evolved to reflect changing business conditions. So in the 1613 case of ''[[Rogers v Parry]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rogers v Parry]]'' (1613) 2 Bulstr. 136; (1613) 79 ER 278&lt;/ref&gt; a court held that a joiner who promised not to trade from his house for 21 years could have this bond enforced against him since the time and place was certain. It was also held that a man cannot bind himself to not use his trade generally by [[Edward Coke|Chief Justice Coke]]. This was followed in ''[[Broad v Jolyffe]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Broad v Jolyffe]]'' (1620) Cro. Jac. 596&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mitchel v Reynolds]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mitchel v Reynolds]]'' (1711) 1 P.Wms. 181&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Lord Macclesfield]] asked, "What does it signify to a tradesman in London what another does in Newcastle?" In times of such slow communications, commerce around the country it seemed axiomatic that a general restraint served no legitimate purpose for one's business and ought to be void. But already in 1880 in ''[[Roussillon v Roussillon]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roussillon v Roussillon]]'' (1880) 14 ChD 351&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Fry|Lord Justice Fry]] stated that a restraint unlimited in space need not be void, since the real question was whether it went further than necessary for the promisee's protection. So in the ''Nordenfelt'' case&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; case Lord McNaughton rule that while one could validly promise to "not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world" it was and unreasonable restraint to "not compete with Maxim in any way." This approach in England was confirmed by the House of Lords in ''[[Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co.]]'' [1913] AC 724&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern age==
Modern competition law begins with the United States legislation of the [[Sherman Act]] of 1890 and the [[Clayton Act]] of 1914. While other, particularly European, countries also had some form of regulation on monopolies and cartels, the U.S. codification of the common law position on restraint of trade had a widespread effect on subsequent competition law development. Both after [[World War II]] and after the fall of the [[Berlin wall]], competition law has gone through phases of renewed attention and legislative updates around the world.

===United States antitrust===
{{main|United States antitrust law}}
[[Image:Standard Oil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Standard Oil]] was one of the greatest companies to be broken up under United States antitrust laws]]
The American term [[Trust (19th century)|anti-trust]] arose not because the U.S. statutes had anything to do with ordinary [[trust law]], but because the large American corporations used trusts to conceal the nature of their business arrangements. Big trusts became synonymous with big monopolies, the perceived threat to democracy and the free market these trusts represented led passage of the [[Sherman Act|Sherman]] and [[Clayton Act]]s. These laws, in part, codified past American and English [[common law]] of restraints of trade. [[George Frisbie Hoar|Senator Hoar]], an author of the [[Sherman Act]] said in a debate, "We have affirmed the old doctrine of the common law in regard to all inter-state and international commercial transactions and have clothed the United States courts with authority to enforce that doctrine by injunction." Evidence of the common law basis of the Sherman and Clayton Acts is found in ''[[Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;221 U.S. 1 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Edward Douglass White|Chief Justice White]] explicitly linked the Sherman Act with the common law and sixteenth-century English statutes on engrossing.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Under [[King Edward VI]] in 1552, 5 &amp; 6 Edw. 6, c. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Act's wording also reflects common law. The first two sections read as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Sherman Act did not have the immediate effects its authors intended, although [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s federal government sued 45 companies, and [[William Taft]] used it against 75 companies. The [[Clayton Act]] of 1914 was passed to supplement the Sherman Act. Specific categories of abusive conduct were listed, including [[price discrimination]](section 2), exclusive dealings (section 3) and mergers which substantially lessened competition (section 7). Section 6 exempted trade unions from the law's operation. Both the Sherman and Clayton Acts are now codified under [[Title 15 of the United States Code|Title 15]] of the [[United States Code]].

===Post war consensus===
{{morefootnotes|section|date=July 2008}}
{{seealso|Competition regulator}}

It was after the [[First World War]] that countries began to follow the United States' lead in competition policy. In 1923, Canada introduced the [[Combines Investigation Act]] and in 1926 France reinforced its basic competition provisions from the 1810 Code Napoleon. After [[World War II]], the Allies, led by the United States, introduced tight regulation of cartels and monopolies in occupied Germany and Japan. In Germany, despite the existence of laws against [[unfair business practices]] and [[unfair competition]] passed in 1909 (''Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb'' or ''UWG'') it was widely believed that the predominance of large cartels of German industry had made it easier for the [[Nazis]] to assume total economic control simply by bribing or blackmailing the heads of a small number of industrial magnates. Similarly in Japan, where business was organised along family and nepotistic ties, the [[zaibatsu]] were easy for the government to manipulate into the war effort. Following World War II and the unconditional surrender of Japan and Germany, tighter controls, replicating the existing American policies and regulations were introduced.

However, further developments were considerably overshadowed by the move towards [[nationalisation]] and industry-wide planning in many countries. Making the economy and industry democratically accountable through direct government action became a priority. Coal industry, railroads, steel, electricity, [[Water law|water]], health care and many other sectors were targeted for their special qualities of being [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]]. [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries were slow in enacting statutory competition law provisions. The United Kingdom introduced the (considerably less stringent) Restrictive Practices Act in 1956. Australia introduced its current [[Trade Practices Act 1974|Trade Practices Act]] in 1974. Recently however there has been a wave of updates, especially in Europe to harmonise legislation with contemporary competition law thinking.

===European Union law===
{{morefootnotes|section|date=July 2008}}
{{main|European Community competition law}}
In 1957 six Western European countries signed the [[Treaty of the European Community]] (EC Treaty or Treaty of Rome), which over the last fifty years has grown into a [[European Union]] of nearly half a billion citizens. The European Community is the name for the economic and social pillar of [[EU law]], under which competition law falls. Healthy competition is seen as an essential element in the creation of a common market free from restraints on trade. The first provision is Article 81 EC, which deals with cartels and restrictive vertical agreements. Prohibited are...

&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) ...all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 81(1) EC then gives examples of "hard core" restrictive practices such as price fixing or market sharing and 81(2) EC confirms that any agreements are automatically void. However, just like the [[Statute of Monopolies 1623]], Article 81(3) EC creates exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a "fair share" of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints (or disproportionate, in ECJ terminology) that risk eliminating competition anywhere. Article 82 EC deals with monopolies, or more precisely firms who have a dominant market share and abuse that position. Unlike [[U.S. Antitrust]], EC law has never been used to punish the existence of dominant firms, but merely imposes a special responsibility to conduct oneself appropriately. Specific categories of abuse listed in Article 82 EC include price discrimination and exclusive dealing, much the same as sections 2 and 3 of the U.S. Clayton Act. Also under Article 82 EC, the Council of the European Union was empowered to enact a [[European Union regulation|regulation]] to control mergers between firms, currently the latest known by the abbreviation of ECMR "Reg. 139/2004". The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede [[effective competition]]. Again, the similarity to the [[Clayton Act]]'s substantial lessening of competition. Finally, Articles 86 and 87 EC regulate the state's role in the market. Article 86(2) EC states clearly that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else. Article 87 EC, similar to Article 81 EC, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but then grants exceptions for things like charities, natural disasters or regional development.

===International enforcement===
{{seealso|World Trade Organization|International Competition Network}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wto logo.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[World Trade Organization]] members have been recently discussing how future global competition law could look]] --&gt;
Competition law has already been substantially internationalised along the lines of the US model by nation states themselves, however the involvement of international organisations has been growing. Increasingly active at all international conferences are the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), which is prone to making neo-liberal recommendations about the total application of competition law for public and private industries.&lt;ref&gt;see, [[Tony Prosser]], ''The Limits of Competition Law'' (2005) ch.1&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 5 of the post war [[Havana Charter]] contained an Antitrust code&lt;ref&gt;see a speech by Wood, ''The Internationalisation of Antitrust Law: Options for the Future'' 3 February 1995, at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/future.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] 1947. [[Office of Fair Trading]] Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it "seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p.448&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, at the ongoing [[Doha round]] of trade talks for the [[World Trade Organization]], discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established [[International Competition Network]]&lt;ref&gt;see, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

Probate duty was introduced as part of the [[Stamp act#Stamps Act 1694|Stamps Act 1694]], in order to help finance England's involvement in the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]].{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=139}} It originally applied to all probates of wills and letters of administration for personal estates valued greater than £20, at a fixed duty of 5 ''s.'' (one [[Crown (English coin)|crown]], or a quarter of a pound).{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=139}} It was converted into a [[sliding scale|graduated rate]] in 1780 by [[Lord North]], as a consequence of financing British activity in the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=139}} Penalties for failing to file probate or administration documents were introduced in 1795, and accounts for calculating liability were first required in 1805.{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=141}} As probate and administration were unknown in Scotland, inventory duty was introduced in 1804 to provide for similar liability there.{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=142}} Ireland introduced probate duty separately in 1774.{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=143}}

Legacy duty was also imposed in 1780, initially upon receipts or discharges given with respect to a legacy. As receipts were not in practice given or required,{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=148}} revenues were insignificant until [[William Pitt the Younger]] reformed the regime to require executors to account for the property in question, as well as varying rates according to the type of [[collateral succession]].{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=149}} Further measures and later court decisions clarified the duty's extent.

Probate and legacy duty focused on the [[wikt:legacy|legacy]] of the estate, as opposed to its [[wikt:devise|devise]], thus excluding real property from taxation.{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=150}} Neither duty captured property passing by way of [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]], which was outside the scope of probate and administration.{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=150}} Succession duty was introduced by [[William Gladstone]] as a measure to capture more unearned wealth at the point of succession that would not otherwise be chargeable to legacy duty. In that regard, real property was included in its scope, but only on the [[life interest]] therein, as opposed to its full market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Miller|first= George|date= 2000|title= On Fairness and Efficiency: The privatisation of the public income over the past millennium|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=eVUXALnSc1cC&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;ots=0Go8K3oWkJ&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;f=false|location= Bristol|publisher= The Policy Press|pages= 276–277 |isbn= 1-86134-221-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leasehold interests were excluded from legacy duty, thus having them fall within the new duty.{{sfn|Dowell|1884|p=151}}

The administration of legacy and succession duties was integrated in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=Hd4uAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Part II]&lt;/ref&gt; with the requirement that no probate or letters of administration would be granted by the Court if a court officer cannot certify that an affidavit has been filed  stating the estate's value and stamped where liability for duty is shown.&lt;ref&gt;CIRA 1881, s. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Relief from legacy and succession duties at the rate of 1% was allowed on such affidavits and inventories filed and stamped,&lt;ref name="CIRA 1881, s. 38"&gt;CIRA 1881, s. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and a penalty equal to double the amount of duty due was imposed on any person failing to file them on time.&lt;ref&gt;CIRA 1881, s. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Account duty was also introduced, charging certain gifts and voluntary settlements to be taxed.&lt;ref name="CIRA 1881, s. 38"&gt;CIRA 1881, s. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional succession duties were introduced in 1888:&lt;ref&gt;Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1888, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=adsuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;f=false s.21]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* on any successor who is the lineal issue or lineal ancestor of the predecessor, 10 ''s.'' per centum (0.5%)
:* in all other cases, £1 10 ''s.'' per centum (1.5%)
:* but this additional duty does not apply to interests in leaseholds passing by will or by devolution by law, nor to property subject to account duty

Corporation duty was imposed in 1885,&lt;ref&gt;Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1885, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=KZ5KAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=E6oNd-AbLc&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;f=false Part II]&lt;/ref&gt; and a temporary estate duty in 1889 (intended to last until 1896),&lt;ref&gt;Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=qtouAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;ots=QYKSgBO6E6&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;f=false Part II]&lt;/ref&gt; to encompass activities which the previous duties had not captured.

|Legacy duty
|
*Imposed on all deceased persons with UK domicile.
*Initially imposed in 1780 as a duty on "every receipt or other discharge for any legacy," it was expanded in 1796 to include "every share or residue of the personal estate of any person dying and leaving such estate of the clear value of £100 or upwards." However, the 1796 Act also declared that money left to pay legacy duty was not chargeable to duty as a legacy.
*In 1805, duty is charged on legacies charged upon or made payable out of any real estate, or out of any moneys to arise from the sale of real estate.
*In 1815, duty was expanded to include the devolution of personal estate under a partial or total intestacy.
*In 1823, it was held that the forgiveness of debt due to a testator constituted a legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Attorney-General v Holbrook|reporter=ER|year=1823|num=229|volume=147|firstpage=761|parallelcite=12 Price 407|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1845, the definition of "legacy" was expanded to include gifts made by will or testamentary instrument, as well as gifts made as ''[[donatio mortis causa]]''.
*Only the will can determine what constitutes a legacy, and any secret trust outside it cannot change who the legatee is.&lt;ref&gt;''Cullen v Attorney-General for Ireland'', [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044106251218?urlappend=%3Bseq=196 (1866) LR 1 HL 190]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A bequest upon the trusts of a settlement, even if in satisfaction of a covenant, is chargeable with duty, the trusts in effect being incorporated in the will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=In re Arthur Palmer|reporter=ER|year=1858|num=331|volume=157|firstpage=374|parallelcite=3 H&amp;N 26|date=9 Feb 1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In cases where property is disposed by way of a [[power of appointment]], it has been held that a power arising from a will will constitute a legacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Pickard v The Attorney-General|reporter=ER|year=1840|num=172|volume=151|firstpage=446|parallelcite=6 M&amp;W 348|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one arising from a deed will constitute a gift not subject to duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=The Attorney-General v The Marquis of Hertford|reporter=ER|year=1845|num=978|volume=153|firstpage=484|parallelcite=14 M&amp;W 284|date=12 June 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rentcharge]]s will give rise to duty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Attorney-General v Randle Jackson and William Jackson|reporter=ER|year=1831|num=246|volume=149|firstpage=43|parallelcite=2 Cr&amp;J 101|date=|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it must be in general a charge in favour of one person on the estate of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Shirley v Earl Ferrers|reporter=ER|year=1842|num=1179|volume=41|firstpage=595|parallelcite=1 Ph 167|date=9 December 1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A general direction to sell land will render it liable to legacy duty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Custance v Bradshaw|reporter=ER|year=1845|num=849|volume=67|firstpage=669|parallelcite=4 Hare 315|date=26 May 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless coupled with a direction to invest the proceeds in other real estate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Mules v Jennings|reporter=ER|year=1853|num=698|volume=155|firstpage=1589|parallelcite=8 Ex 830|date=10 June 1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; or where a sale is made by order of the Court for purposes unconnected with the trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=In re Evans|reporter=ER|year=1835|num=128|volume=150|firstpage=89|parallelcite=2 CrM&amp;R 206|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where any legacy,&lt;ref group=a&gt;Including gifts of annuities or by way of annuity&lt;/ref&gt; residue or any share of residue is greater than £20:&lt;ref group=a&gt;Where a legatee receives two or more distinct legacies or benefits, they shall be grouped together&lt;/ref&gt;

|Succession duty
|
Applies to every succession (conferred by disposition or operation of law) to the beneficial enjoyment of any real or personal property, or to the receipt of any portion or additional portion of the income or profits thereof, upon or in consequence of the death of any person.&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

*Disposition arises from any limitation, provision, condition or other act of man, written or unwritten, by means of which property is disposed of in favour of any particular person, body corporate, company or society named or sufficiently pointed out in such disposition.{{sfn|Freeth|Wallace|1881|p=151}}
*Devolution by law arises from the operation by which the law, in the absence of any act of man, carries property to particular persons, such as in the case of intestacy.{{sfn|Freeth|Wallace|1881|p=151}}
*The succession to be taxed is the right to possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Wilcox v Smith|link=|reporter=ER|year=1857|num=627|volume=62|firstpage=16|parallelcite=4 Drew 40|date=6 June 1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The beneficial interest accruing to a surviving joint tenant is deemed to be a disposition,&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 3&lt;/ref&gt; except where the joint tenants are husband and wife, as they hold the status of [[tenants by the entirety]]{{sfn|Freeth|Wallace|1881|p=168}}
*An increase in benefit arising from the extinction of any charge, estate or interest in property by the death of a person or at any period ascertainable only by reference to such death is deemed to be a succession,&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, ss. 5, 20&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not apply to persons who, at the passing of the SDA 1853, possessed estates subject to outstanding leases for lives,&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 6&lt;/ref&gt; or purporting to be leases at [[rack rent]]&lt;ref name="SDA 1853, s. 20"&gt;SDA 1853, s. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

However:

*Property may escape the tax forever by always passing ''inter vivos'', but will be taxed when a succession accrues{{efn|But it may be subject to account duty as of 1881&lt;ref name="CIRA 1881, s. 38"&gt;CIRA 1881, s. 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*Property is exempt where it is already subject to legacy duty,&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 18; {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Re Chapman's Trusts|link=|reporter=ER|year=1865|num=660|volume=71|firstpage=537|parallelcite=2 H&amp;M 447|date=10 July 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is already exempt therefrom&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where the deceased does not have UK domicile, personal property in the estate will not be subject to succession duty, but where the resulting will creates a trust that assumes the character of a British settlement and British property, it is liable to duty upon the death of any person who has a limited interest in it{{sfn|Freeth|Wallace|1881|p=163}}
|
*At the time the successor, or any person in his right or on his behalf, becomes entitled to possession of the property.&lt;ref name="SDA 1853, s. 20"/&gt;

The value to be included is:

*For personal property, the total value thereof
*For real property where the successor is a body corporate, company or society, the principal value of the property
*For all other cases of real property, excepting advowsons and timber, the value is considered to be in the nature of an annuity equal to the net annual value of the property, to be ascertained at the time the interest of the successor accrues
*In the case of a succession comprising timber, the value is the sum of the yearly rental in its uncultivated state, plus the net moneys derived from the sale of timber where they exceed £10 per year
*Duty arises on an advowson only where a sale is made
|
*In general, the same schedule of rates as for legacy duty.&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
*However, where any person chargeable with succession duty with respect to any succession shall have been married to any wife or husband of nearer [[consanguinity]] than himself or herself to the predecessor, testator or deceased person, then the person taking such succession shall pay the same rate of duty as his or her spouse would have been chargeable with as if he or she had taken the succession directly.&lt;ref&gt;SDA 1853, s. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
|Account duty
|
Personal or moveable property, being:

*property taken as ''donatio mortis causa'', or as an immediate gift ''[[inter vivos]]'' made within three months of death
*property, to which a person was absolutely entitled, which was vested in [[joint tenancy]] that accrues or passes by [[survivorship]] upon death
*property passing under any past or future voluntary settlement, by deed or any other instrument not taking effect as a will, where the settlor reserved the right to take back the absolute interest in the property
|
*a beneficiary, trustee or any other person who acquires possession or assumes the management of any property included in the account
|
*for estates between £100 and £500, £1 per £50 (i.e., 2%) or part thereof
*between £500 and £1000, £1 5 ''s.'' per £50 (i.e., 2.5%) or part thereof
*above £1000, £3 per £100 (i.e., 3%) or part thereof

Any stamp duty of 5 ''s.'' per £100 (i.e., 0.25%) previously paid on a deed of voluntary arrangement of property included in the account is to be returned upon production of the settlement.
|- valign="top"
|Corporation duty
|
Income (less applicable expenses) earned from all real and personal property vested in a body corporate or unincorporate, other than property vested in:&lt;ref name="CIRA1885s11"&gt;CIRA 1885, s. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

*Any government authority
*Any religious persuasion or charitable purpose
*Any [[friendly society]] or [[savings bank]]
*A body corporate or unincorporate established for any trade or business, or any body whose capital stock is divided and held to be subject to legacy duty or succession duty

Property acquired by subject bodies corporate or unincorporate with funds contributed within the previous 30 years, whether voluntarily contributed or where legacy or succession duty had been paid thereon, is exempt from such duty.&lt;ref name="CIRA1885s11"/&gt;

"Body unincorporate" includes every unincorporated company, fellowship, society, and association. It also includes a trustee or trustees of a permanent trust into which property has been vested in circumstances where it was not liable to legacy or succession duty.&lt;ref&gt;CIRA 1885, s. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
|
*All bodies subject to the duty.&lt;ref&gt;CIRA 1885, s. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
|
*5% of the net income concerned&lt;ref name="CIRA1885s11"/&gt;
|- valign="top"
|Estate duty
|
Estates and successions greater than £10,000 in value&lt;ref name="CIRA1889"&gt;CIRA 1889, ss. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;
|
*In the case of estates, any person filing probate or letters of administration, or exhibiting an inventory in Scotland
*In the case of successions, the successor
|
*£1 per £100 (i.e., 1%) or part thereof, payable on the entire value, in addition to any other duty&lt;ref name="CIRA1889"/&gt;

==Estate duty framework (1894-1949)==
[[Image:Sir William Harcourt.jpg|thumb|right| [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], successful promoter of 1894 reforms]]
The succession duty's taxation of the life interest in real property, as opposed to its full capital value, was seen to be unfair to heirs of different ages, as elder heirs effectively received a life interest that was lower in value than one received by a younger heir, even when they were shares in the same property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gardiner|first= A.G.|author-link=Alfred George Gardiner|date= 1923|title= The Life of Sir William Harcourt|volume=II|url= https://archive.org/stream/lifeofsirwilliam02garduoft#page/282/mode/2up|location= London|publisher= Constable and Co. Ltd.|page= 282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his famous 1894 budget,&lt;ref&gt;* {{EB1911|wstitle=Harcourt, Sir William George Granville Venables Vernon |volume=12 |noprescript=1|pages=939–940}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]] further noted the unfairness of the system that had developed:

{{cquote|
The whole system is admittedly difficult and complicated. The Death Duties have grown up piecemeal, and bear traces of their fragmentary origin. They have never been established upon any general principles, and they present an extraordinary specimen of [[Tessellation|tessellated]] legislation. Various measures have been made at different times to redress some of their inequalities. Here a patch and there a patch, but each successive modification has only left confusion worse compounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= United Kingdom|title= Financial Statement|url= https://archive.org/stream/financeact18945700cartuoft#page/94/mode/2up|house= House of Commons|date= 16 April 1894|speaker= William Harcourt|position=Chancellor of the Exchequer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In the Finance Act 1894, estate duty replaced probate duty, account duty, certain additional succession duties, and the 1889 estate duty.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1894, [https://archive.org/stream/deathdutiescompr00dymo#page/376/mode/2up s.1] and [https://archive.org/stream/deathdutiescompr00dymo#page/390/mode/2up First Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|However, these duties still remained in force with respect to deaths that occurred before estate duty came into effect. These duties were not finally repealed until the passage of the Finance Act 1949,&lt;ref&gt;FA 1949, Eleventh Schedule, Part IV&lt;/ref&gt; and all requirements to account for such duties were repealed by the Finance Act 1975&lt;ref name="FA 1975, s. 50 and Sch. 13, Part I"&gt;FA 1975, s. 50 and Sch. 13, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was collected in addition to the legacy duty and succession duty which still remained in effect.

With respect to real property, succession duty ceased to be calculated on the value of the life interest in the succession, being instead based on the principal value of the property after deducting the liability for related estate duty, together with expenses incurred in raising funds for paying it.&lt;ref&gt;FA 1894, s. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

!Duty !!Scope !!Paid by !!Rate in 1894
|- valign="top"
|Estate duty{{sfn|Dymond|1920|loc=Part I}}
|All property passing on the death of the deceased, at its market value at the date of death, including:
* the deceased's free estate
* property situated outside the United Kingdom
* property of which the deceased was competent to dispose
* donations ''[[Gift (law)|mortis causa]]''
* gifts ''[[inter vivos]]'' (from 1910, notably gifts made within three years of death and those made with reservations)
* property owned jointly or purchased and invested in joint names
* insurance policies, annuities and other interests purchased by the deceased
* property in which the deceased or any other person had an interest ceasing on the death of the deceased, to the extent that a benefit accrues or arises by his death
* property comprised in a [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]]

In this regard, "property passing on the death" includes property passing either immediately on the death or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and the expression "on the death" includes "at a period ascertainable only by reference to the death".&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1894, s. 22(1)(l)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the following property is exempt from duty:{{sfn|Dymond|1920|pp=131-133}}

* gifts ''inter vivos'' made in consideration or contemplation of marriage, for public or charitable purposes (if made more than a year before death), which form part of the normal expenditure of the deceased, or which amount to less than £100 per donee&lt;ref&gt;FA 1910, s. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* settled property upon which probate duty or account duty was paid on the death of the deceased's spouse
* immoveable property located outside the UK
* moveable property outside the UK, where the deceased has no UK domicile
* property held by the deceased in the capacity of an officeholder, recipient of charity or as a [[corporation sole]]
* property passing by reason of sale or lease for full money consideration
* property held by the deceased merely as a trustee
* property of soldiers, marines and sailors{{efn|and later airmen}} who are killed or die in Her Majesty's service
* estates of soldiers who are killed or die in service, not over £5,000, provided that they are given to the widow and children concerned
* works of art given for national purposes, for which [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] has remitted the duty
* similar articles of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest, until sold
* pensions and annuities granted by the British and Indian governments to widows and children of deceased officers
* advowsons and Church patronage

|Settlement estate duty
|Additional duty, charged where property in respect of which estate duty is leviable is settled by will of the deceased, or having been settled by some other disposition is passed on death of the deceased, to some other person not competent to dispose of the property.&lt;ref&gt;FA 1894, s. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement estate duty was increased to 2% by the Finance Act 1909-10, and was later abolished by the Finance Act 1914.{{sfn|Dymond|p=149}}

Estate duty was designed to be a [[progressive tax]]. It became more highly progressive over time, with the highest [[marginal rate]]s fixed as follows:

:* in 1907, 15% on taxable amounts over £1,000,000, where the total estate was greater than £3,000,000&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1907, [https://archive.org/stream/deathdutiescompr00dymo#page/398/mode/2up First Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* in 1914, 20% on taxable amounts over £1,000,000&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1914, [https://archive.org/stream/deathdutiescompr00dymo#page/412/mode/2up First Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* in 1949, 80% on taxable amounts over £1,000,000 (following the abolition of legacy and succession duty)&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1949, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1949/47/pdfs/ukpga_19490047_en.pdf Seventh Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estate duty (1949-1975)==
[[Image:Stafford Cripps 1947.jpg|thumb|left| [[Stafford Cripps]], who abolished the legacy and succession duties in 1949]]
The complexity and unfairness in how the duties were applied was discussed by [[Stafford Cripps]] in his 1949 Budget speech:

{{cquote|
The Legacy and Succession Duties also have the drawback that they impose a proportionately heavier burden on the small than on the large estate. For example, an estate of £6,000, passing wholly to brothers and sisters, pays a total charge of 3 per cent. Estate Duty and 10 per cent. Legacy and Succession Duties, equivalent to a rate of nearly 13 per cent., or 10 per cent over the Estate Duty rate; whereas, at the other extreme, an estate of £3 million would pay only 2½ per cent. over the rate of Estate Duty. It is, no doubt, because of this unequal incidence of the duty that testators, in fact, leave about two-thirds of the total legacies and bequests free of duty, and in all such cases the Legacy and Succession Duties merely become a wholly illogical, extra Estate Duty, falling upon the residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title= Death Duties|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1949/apr/06/death-duties|house= House of Commons|date= 6 April 1949|column_start= 2088|column_end= 2090|speaker= Stafford Cripps|position=Chancellor of the Exchequer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Accordingly, legacy duty and succession duty were abolished by the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1949/47/pdfs/ukpga_19490047_en.pdf Finance Act 1949],{{efn|However, these duties still remained in force with respect to deaths that occurred before abolition came into effect. These duties were not finally repealed until the passage of the Finance Act 1975&lt;ref name="FA 1975, s. 50 and Sch. 13, Part I"&gt;FA 1975, s. 50 and Sch. 13, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;}} followed by the repeal of corporation duty by the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1959/58/pdfs/ukpga_19590058_en.pdf Finance Act 1959]. The three-year period for gifts made prior to death was extended to five years by the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1946/64/pdfs/ukpga_19460064_en.pdf?view=extent Finance Act 1946], and then to seven years by the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/32/pdfs/ukpga_19690032_en.pdf Finance Act 1969].

Estate duty became more progressive in scale, eventually peaking in 1969 with the highest marginal rate fixed at 85% of amounts in excess of £750,000, provided that total duty did not exceed 80% of the value of the total estate.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1969, Schedule 17, Part I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital Transfer Tax (1975-1986)==
[[Image:Denis Healey.jpg|thumb|left| [[Denis Healey]] replaced estate duty with the capital transfer tax in 1975]]
Estate duty was criticised for failing to capture the value of gifts made more than seven years before a person's death, as well as that of any property vested in trusts prior to death. In his 1974 Budget speech, [[Denis Healey]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], declared:

{{cquote|
Nothing is more offensive to the vast majority of ordinary taxpayers, most of whom are subject to PAYE, than the knowledge that people far better off than themselves are avoiding taxation by exploiting loopholes in the existing law. If the existing estate duty operated effectively, the great concentrations of private wealth would already have been broken up and with them many of the unfair advantages enjoyed by generation after generation of the heirs and relatives of wealthy men. In practice, however, the estate duty has always been a largely avoidable, indeed, a voluntary, tax. In particular, it does not bite on transfers of wealth made long enough before death to fall outside the charge.... I therefore propose to introduce this year in my second Finance Bill a tax on lifetime gifts—that is, any transactions containing an element of bounty and including gifts in settlement—which will mesh in with the existing estate duty so as effectively to replace it with a comprehensive tax on all transmissions of personal wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title= Estate Duty|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1974/mar/26/estate-duty|house= House of Commons|date= 26 March 1974|column_start= 313|column_end= 314|speaker= Denis Healey|position=Chancellor of the Exchequer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

This was implemented with the passage of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/7/pdfs/ukpga_19750007_en.pdf Finance Act 1975], which abolished estate duty{{efn|but certain deferrals from estate duty still exist, for which technical amendments were made in the Finance Act 2016 to ensure that potential recapture of duty would not be lost in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 2016, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/24/section/97/enacted s. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://artlawandmore.com/2016/05/10/changes-to-the-estate-duty-regime-explained/|title= Changes to the Estate Duty Regime explained|last= Nolan|first= Min|last2= Todd|first2= Geoffrey|date= 10 May 2016|website= artlawandmore.com|publisher= Boodle Hatfield LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and created the capital transfer tax, with the following characteristics:

:* It captured all transfers of value, not made at an [[arm's length]] basis, by which the transferor's estate was less in value after the disposition than it was before.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1975, s. 20(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Value was generally defined as "the price which the property might reasonably be expected to fetch in the open market at that time; but that price shall not be assumed to be reduced on the ground that the whole property is to be placed on the market at one and the same time."&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1975, s. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Transfers (in excess of specified limits, or not otherwise excluded) made during a person's lifetime were accumulated with tax assessed on a sliding scale on the total amount.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1975, s. 37, Second Table&lt;/ref&gt;
:* All transfers made at death or within three years before were taxable at a separate, higher sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1975, s. 37, First Table&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Where the transferor was domiciled in the United Kingdom, tax was chargeable on all subject property; otherwise, it was chargeable only on property situated in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1975, s. 24(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

CTT was reduced in scope during the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher years]],{{sfn|Seeley|1995|pp=9-10}} with the rates applicable to gifts adjusted to encourage business property to be given during a lifetime, and a ten-year accumulation period introduced to cap the effect of graduated rates.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 1981, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/35/pdfs/ukpga_19810035_en.pdf Part V]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance tax (1986 to present)==
[[Image:Nigel Lawson 006.jpg|thumb|right| [[Nigel Lawson]] arranged to convert capital transfer tax into inheritance tax in 1986]]
[[Nigel Lawson]], in his 1986 Budget speech, moved to abolish the tax on lifetime gifts altogether, explaining:

{{cquote|
:My last proposal in this section concerns capital transfer tax which, ever since its introduction by the Labour Government in 1974, has been a thorn in the side of those owning and running family businesses, and as such has had a damaging effect on risk taking and enterprise within a particularly important sector of the economy. In addition to statutory indexation of the threshold and rate bands, I propose this year to reform the tax radically.

:In essence, the capital transfer tax is two taxes, as its two separate scales imply: an inheritance tax and a lifetime gifts tax. We have had an inheritance tax in some shape or form ever since Sir William Harcourt introduced his estate duty in 1894. But the lifetime gifts tax which the Labour Government introduced in 1974, in the teeth of united Conservative opposition, is an unwelcome and unwarranted impost. By deterring lifetime giving, it has had the effect of locking in assets, particularly the ownership of family businesses, often to the detriment of the businesses concerned.

:Accordingly, I propose to abolish entirely the tax on lifetime gifts to individuals. As with the old estate duty, there will be a tapered charge on gifts made within seven years of death and provisions to charge gifts made with reservation; and the regime for trusts, which is needed as a protection for the death charge, will be kept broadly unchanged.... In recognition of the radically changed nature of the tax, I have decided to rename it the [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|inheritance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title= Business and Enterprise|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1986/mar/18/business-and-enterprise|house= House of Commons|date= 18 March 1976|column_start= 173|column_end= 176|speaker= Nigel Lawson|position=Chancellor of the Exchequer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

This was implemented in the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/41/pdfs/ukpga_19860041_en.pdf Finance Act 1986].

===Estate on death===
For IHT purposes, a person's estate includes:&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, s. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

#the aggregate of all the property, other than excluded property and specified interests in possession, to which he is beneficially entitled;
#beneficial entitlement includes the general power to dispose or charge money on any property;
#except where otherwise provided, the person's liabilities must be taken into account, but it does not include liability with respect to any other tax that may arise on the transfer, and a liability incurred by a transferor shall be taken into account only to the extent that it was incurred for a consideration in money or money’s worth.

Excluded property comprises:&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, s. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

#property situated outside the United Kingdom, where the person beneficially entitled to it is an individual domiciled outside the United Kingdom;
#decorations and awards granted for valour or gallant conduct, and which have never been the subject of a disposition for a consideration in money or money's worth; and
#certain specified securities.

Relief is also granted,&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, Part V&lt;/ref&gt; where the value of the estate is reduced with respect to specified business property, agricultural property, woodlands, certain transfers made within three years of death made at a diminished value, and certain other cases.

===Chargeable transfers prior to death===
Deductions will be made from an estate's [[nil rate band]] with respect to transfers of value made in excess of specified limits,{{sfn|HMRC|2015|p=19}} other than "potentially exempt transfers" made more than seven years before the transferor's death. Transfers of value made within specified limits are known as "exempt transfers".&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, ss. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfers of value will also include gifts arising from the amount by which an asset is sold for less than it could have been sold on the open market, as for a sale from a parent to a child.{{sfn|HMRC|2015|p=18}} Gifts can also arise where:{{sfn|HMRC|2015|pp=20-21}}

:* a lease is granted at less than full market rent, shares in a private company are rearranged, rights in such shares are altered, or there has been agreement to act as a guarantor for someone else's debts
:* transfers of value, at a loss to the donor, have been made to certain trusts
:* premiums have been paid on a life insurance policy for the benefit of someone else
:* the deceased ceased to have a right to a benefit from a trust or settlement

Where the value of such transfers exhausts the amount available to the nil rate band, IHT is assessed on the excess amount, to which the recipients of such transfers bear the liability to pay.{{sfn|HMRC|2015|p=19}}

===Rate of tax===
Tax is assessed at 40% of the net value of the estate, after application of the [[nil rate band]].&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, Schedule 1&lt;/ref&gt; The applicable nil rate band will depend on the date of death: if the date falls at any time from 6 August to 5 April in a given tax year, the current year's band will apply; but, where the date is after 5 April but before 6 August, and application for a grant is filed before 6 August, the prior year's band will apply.{{sfn|HMRC|2015|p=3}}

For deaths occurring after 5 April 2012, the tax is assessed at 36%, where at least 10% of a specified baseline amount of the estate has been bequeathed as charitable gifts.&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, Sch. 1, as inserted by FA 2012, Sch. 33&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of calculation, the property of the estate is separated into three components, each of which is tested to see if the charitable gifts are sufficient to qualify for the lesser rate:&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, Sch. 1, par. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:* the survivorship component, comprising joint or common property that passes on death by survivorship or special destination;
:* the settled property component, made up of all settled property in which the deceased had an interest in possession to which he was beneficially entitled immediately before death; and
:* the general component, consisting of all other property in the estate, with the exception of that arising from gifts with reservation.

If applicable gifts meet the 10% threshold for a given component, in certain circumstances, upon election, the 36% rate applies to the whole estate.&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, Sch. 1, par. 7&lt;/ref&gt; There are several options available for estates to be able to achieve that threshold, such as having the will specifying relevant gifts in terms of percentages of assets, or successors executing a [[deed of variation]] to attain the desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/Extranet/Literature/Doc/FP0315|title= Generosity pays: The 36% IHT rate and charity legacies |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= July 2012 |publisher= [[Scottish Widows]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional nil rate band on main residence ===
In the summer budget of 2015 a new measure was outlined to reduce the burden of IHT for most families by making it easier to pass on the family home to direct descendants without a tax charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-main-residence-nil-rate-band-and-the-existing-nil-rate-band/inheritance-tax-main-residence-nil-rate-band-and-the-existing-nil-rate-band|title=Inheritance Tax: main residence nil-rate band and the existing nil-rate band - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came into effect upon the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, and provided for the following scheduled amounts:&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, ss. 8D-8M, as implemented by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/33/part/2/crossheading/rate-bands ss. 9-10]&lt;/ref&gt;

:* £100,000 for the 2017-18 tax year
:* £125,000 for the 2018-19 tax year
:* £150,000 for the 2019-20 tax year
:* £175,000 for the 2020-21 tax year
:* for subsequent tax years, the amount will be linked to the September–September rise in  the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|consumer price index]]

The Finance Act 2016 provided further relief in cases where all or part of the additional band could be lost, where a person had downsized to a less valuable residence or had ceased to own a residence after 8 July 2015 (and before the person has died). This is conditional upon the deceased having left that smaller residence, or assets of equivalent value, to direct descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Finance Act 2016, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/24/schedule/15/enacted Sch. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; These are defined as [[lineal descendant]]s, spouses or civil partners of such lineal descendants, or former spouses or civil partners who have not become anyone else's spouse or civil partner.&lt;ref&gt;IHTA 1984, s. 8K&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-owned assets===
Effective with the 2005-06 tax year,&lt;ref&gt;FA 2004, s. 84&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Finance Act 2004]] introduced a retrospective [[income tax]] regime known as [[pre-owned asset tax]] (POAT) which covers transactions not made at [[arm's length]], where a person either:

:* disposes of a property, or
:* contributes funds to another person to acquire a property,

and then subsequently benefits from its use.&lt;ref&gt;FA 2004, Sch. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The person liable for POAT may, while he is still alive, elect on a timely basis to have such transactions treated as gifts with reservations (thus subject to IHT) with respect to such transactions made in a given tax year.&lt;ref&gt;FA 2004, Sch. 15, par. 21-23&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|HMRC|2015|p=22}}

The '''history of labour law''' concerns the development of [[labour law]] as a way of regulating and improving the life of people at work. In the civilisations of antiquity, the use of [[slave]] labour was widespread. Some of the maladies associated with unregulated labour were identified by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] as " diseases of slaves."&lt;ref&gt;H. D. Traill, ''Social England,'' v. 602 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

==English origins==
{{main|History of labour law in the United Kingdom}}
As [[England]] was the first country to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialise]], it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of capitalist exploitation in a totally unregulated and [[laissez-faire]] economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, as some of the more egregious aspects of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation. This was largely achieved through the concerted pressure from [[social reform]]ers, notably [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]], and others.

===Campaign against child labour===
A serious outbreak of [[fever]] in 1784 in [[cotton]] mills near [[Manchester]] drew widespread public opinion against the use of children in dangerous conditions. A local inquiry presided over by Dr [[Thomas Percival]], was instituted by the justices of the peace for [[Lancashire]], and the resulting report recommended the limitation of children's working hours.&lt;ref&gt;From an " Essay on Trade " (1770), quoted in ''History of Factory Legislation,'' by [[B. Leigh Hutchins]] and [[Amy Harrison]] (1903), pp. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, the first major piece of labour legislation was passed - the [[Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802|Health and Morals of Apprentices Act]]. This was the first, albeit modest, step towards the protection of labour. It targeted the deficiencies of the [[apprentice system]], under which large numbers of pauper children were worked in [[cotton]] and [[wool]]len mills without education, for excessive hours, under awful conditions. The Act limited working hours to twelve a day and abolished night work. It required the provision of a basic level of education for all apprentices, as well as adequate sleeping [[Dwelling|accommodation]] and clothing.

The rapid industrialisation of manufacturing at the turn of the 19th century led to a rapid increase in child employment, and public opinion was steadily made aware of the terrible conditions these children were forced to endure. The [[Factory Acts#Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1819|Factory Act of 1819]] was the outcome of the efforts of the [[industrialist]] [[Robert Owen]] and prohibited [[child labour]] under nine years of age and limited the working day to twelve.

A great milestone in labour law was reached with the [[Factory Acts#labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Act of 1833]], which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, prohibited all night work and, crucially, provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Pivotal in the campaigning for and the securing of this legislation were [[Michael Thomas Sadler|Michael Sadler]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]]. This act was an important step forward, in that it mandated skilled inspection of workplaces and a rigorous enforcement of the law by an independent governmental body. This legislation was further amended by the 1844 [[Factory Acts#Factories Act 1844|Textile Factory Act]], which strengthened the powers of the inspectors and required certified [[surgeon]]s to examine all workers for physical fitness.

A lengthy campaign to limit the working day to ten hours was led by Shaftesbury, and included support from the [[Anglican Church]]. Many different groups, including many [[Quaker]]s, workers, and even some factory owners like [[John Fielden]] also supported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Ten Hours' Bill |newspaper=The Times |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/126/803/158807039w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS117603378&amp;dyn=3!xrn_5_0_CS117603378&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |date=18 January 1847 |page=7 |issue=19449 |accessdate=19 August 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many committees were formed in support of the cause and some previously established groups lent their support as well.

The debate had been a rather contentious one in Parliament and was defeated several times by a coalition of conservatives and free traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first= Marjorie |url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/factmine/factory.htm |title=The Factory Question|website=www.historyhome.co.uk|accessdate= March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working conditions===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Colliery.jpg|thumb|right|Men leaving the [[History of coal mining|pit]], before the start of [[World War I]]. The average [[life expectancy]] of a [[Liverpool]] mineworker was 30 years in 1900.]] --&gt;
These early efforts were principally aimed at limiting child labour. From the mid-19th century, attention was first paid to the plight of working conditions for the workforce in general. For the first time detailed provisions for health and safety began to make their appearance in the law. [[Workers' compensation]] for preventible injuries was the outcome of a discussion by witnesses before the a Royal Commission in 1841. A year later, the first [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842|Mines and Collieries Act]] excluded women and girls from underground working, and limited the employment of boys under the age of ten. It was not until 1850 that systematic reporting of fatal accidents and until 1855 that other safeguards for health, life and [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] in mines were seriously provided by law.

From 1843 onwards, the [[Board of Health]] began issuing annual reports on the state of health and safety in industry. Inspection was made more rigorous from 1850, and a Parliamentary Act in 1855 provided seven further regulations, relating to ventilation, [[fencing]] of [[shaft mining|disused shafts]], [[signalling (telecommunications)|signalling]] standards, proper gauges and [[valve]] for steam-[[boiler]], [[indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|indicator]] and [[brake]] for machine lowering and raising; it also provided that special rules submitted by mine-owners to the [[Secretary of State|secretary of state]], could gain legislative sanction and be enforceable through [[Sanctions (law)|penalties]].

Various inquests discovered the extent to which incompetent management and neglect was to blame for workplace accidents and legislation. This led to legislation in 1872 that required the employ of specifically certified managers. The certificates were issued by a government agency to candidates after passing a series of [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s. Steady development of the [[coal]] industry, increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the extension and rationalisation of the then current legislation to a greater variety of industries.

[[File:John Wilson Carmichael - A View of Murton Colliery near Seaham, County Durham - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A view of Murton colliery near [[Seaham]], United Kingdom, 1843]]
The 1874 Act also included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. For instance, in the coal mining industry, the provision of [[safety lamp]]s was made compulsory, use of [[explosives]] was regulated, and the shaft roof was required to be properly secured at all times. Any willful neglect of these safety provisions became strictly punishable. But the most important new step lay in the sections relating to daily control and supervision of every mine by a manager holding a certificate of competency from the government, granted after passing an examination. Increased levels of inspection were also provided for.

The remit of the law steadily expanded to incorporate more industries, as reformers moved from one pressing issue to another. Other trades that came under legislative scrutiny included [[Bleach]]ing and [[dyeing]] works, [[lace]] factories, and [[Finishing (textiles)|textile finishing]], bakehouses, earthenware-making, [[match]]-making, [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] making and paper-staining. As the result of inquiries by [[expert]] medical and sanitary commissioners, ventilation was required to remove dangerous gases, [[dust]], and other impurities generated in all factories.

By the end of the century, a comprehensive set of [[regulation]]s had been put in place in England. Although the law would undergo further refinement over the following century, its basic contours were already discernible. As other countries industrialised in the late 19th century, they too adopted a similar legal system to prevent and mitigate large scale abuse in industry.

==France==
In [[France]], the working day was first limited in factories for adults in 1848, to 12. The workplaces covered by this law was clarified in 1885 to include industrial establishments with [[electric motor|motor power]] or continual [[furnace]]s, or workshops employing over 20 workers. In 1851, under condition of notification to the local authorities, exceptions, still in force, were made to the general limitation, in favour of certain industries or processes, among others for letterpress and lithographic [[printing]], engineering works, work at furnaces and in heating workshops, manufacture of projectiles of war, and any work for the government in the interests of national defence or security. The limit of 12 hours was reduced, as regards works in which women or young workers are employed, in 1900 to II, and was to be successively reduced to 102 hours and to hours at intervals of two years from April 1900.

This labour law for adults was preceded in 1841 by one for children, which prevented their employment in factories before 8 years of age and prohibited night labour for any child under 13. This was strengthened in 1874, particularly as regards employment of girls under 21, but it was not until 1892 that the labour of women was specially regulated by a law, still in force, with certain amendments in 1900. Under this law factory and workshop labour is prohibited for children under 13 years, though they may begin at 12 if qualified by the prescribed educational certificate and medical certificate of fitness. The limit of daily hours of employment is the same as for adult labour, and, similarly, from 1 April 1902 was 102, and two years later became io hours in the 24. Notice of the hours must be affixed, and meal-times or pauses with absolute cessation of work of at least one hour must be specified. By the act of 1892 one day in the week, not necessarily Sunday, had to be given for entire absence from work, in addition to eight recognized annual holidays, but this was modified by a law of 1906 which generally requires Sunday rest, but allows substitution of another day in certain industries and certain circumstances. Night labour - work between 9 P.M. and 5 A.M. - is prohibited for workers under 18, and only exceptionally permitted, under conditions, for girls and women over 18 in specified trades. In mines and underground quarries employment of women and girls is prohibited except at surface works, and at the latter is subject to the same limits as in factories. Boys of 13 may be employed in certain work underground, but under 16 may not be employed more than 8 hours in the 24 from bank to bank. A law of 1905 provided for miners a 9 hours' day and in 1907 an 8 hours' day from the foot of the entrance gallery back to the same point.

As in Great Britain, distinct services of inspection enforce the law in factories and mines respectively. In factories and workshops an inspector may order re-examination as to physical fitness for the work imposed of any worker under 16; certain occupations and processes are prohibited - e.g. girls under 16 at machines worked by treadles, and the weights that may be lifted, pushed or carried by girls or boys under 18 are carefully specified. The law applies generally to philanthropic and religious institutions where industrial work is carried on, as in ordinary trading establishments; and this holds good even if the work is by way of technical instruction. Domestic workshops are not controlled unless the industry is classed as dangerous or unhealthy; introduction of motor power brings them under inspection.

General sanitation in industrial establishments is provided for in a law of 1893, amended in 1903, and is supplemented by administrative regulations for special risks due to poisons, dust, explosive substances, gases, fumes, &amp;c. Ventilation, both general and special, [[lighting]], provision of lavatories, cloakrooms, good drinking water, drainage and cleanliness are required in all workplaces, shops, warehouses, restaurant kitchens, and where workers are lodged by their employers hygienic conditions are prescribed for dormitories. In many industries women, children and young workers are either absolutely excluded from specified unhealthy processes, or are admitted only under conditions. As regards shops and offices, the labour laws are: one which protects apprentices against overwork (law of 22 February 1851), one (law of 29 December 1900) which requires that seats shall be provided for women and girls employed in retail sale of articles, and a [[decree]] of 28 July 1904 defining in detail conditions of hygiene in dormitories for workmen and shop assistants. The law relating to seats is enforced by the inspectors of factories.

In France there is no special penal legislation against abuses of the [[truck system]], or excessive fines and deductions from wages, although bills with that end in view have frequently been before parliament. Indirect protection to workers is no doubt in many cases afforded in organized industries by the action of the ''Conseils de Prud'hommes.  Belgium. - In'' 1848 in Belgium the Commission on Labour proposed legislation to limit, as in France, the hours of labour for adults, but this proposal was never passed. Belgian regulation of labour in industry remains essentially, in harmony with its earliest beginnings in 1863 and onwards, a series of specialized provisions to meet particular risks of individual trades, and did not, until 1889, give any adherence to a common principle of limitation of hours and times of labour for " protected " persons. This was in the law of 13 December 1889, which applies to mines, quarries, factories, workshops classed as unhealthy, wharves and docks, transports. As in France, industrial establishments having a charitable or philanthropic or educational character are included. The persons protected are girls and women under 21 years, and boys under 16; and women over 21 only find a place in the law through the prohibition of their employment within four weeks after childbirth. As the hours of labour of adult women remain ordinarily unlimited by law, so are the hours of boys from 16 to 21. The law of Sunday rest dated 17 July 1905, however, applies to labour generally in all industrial and commercial undertakings except transport and [[fisheries]], with certain regulated exceptions for (a) cases of breakdown or urgency due to ''force majeure, (b'') certain [[repairs]] and cleaning, (''c) '' perishable materials, (''d'') retail food supply. Young workers are excluded from the exceptions. The absolute prohibitions of employment are: for children under 12 years in any industry, manufacturing or mining or transport, and for women and girls under 21 years below the surface in working of mines. Boys under. 16 years and women and girls under 21 years may in general not be employed before 5 A.M. or after 9 P.M., and one day in the seven is to be set apart for rest from employment; to these rules exception may be made either by royal decree for classes or groups of processes, or by local authorities in exceptional cases. The exceptions may be applied, generally, only to workers over 14 years, but in mines, by royal decree, boys over 12 years may be employed from 4 A.M. The law of 1889 fixes only a maximum of 12 hours of effective work, to be interrupted by pauses for rest of not less than 12 hours, empowering the king by decree to formulate more precise limits suited to the special circumstances of individual industries. Royal decrees have accordingly laid down the conditions for many groups, including textile trades, manufacture of paper, pottery, glass, clothing, mines, quarries, engineering and printing works. In some the daily limit is 10 hours, but in more 102 or I I hours. In a few exceptionally unhealthy trades, such as the manufacture of lucifer matches, vulcanization of [[india]]-[[rubber]] by means of carbcn bi-sulphide, the age of exclusion from employment has been raised, and in the last-named process hours have been reduced to 5, broken into two spells of 21. hours each.

As a rule the conditions of health and safeguarding of employments in exceptionally injurious trades have been sought by a series of decrees under the law of 1863 relating to public health in such industries. Special regulations for safety of workers have been introduced in manufactures of white-lead, oxides of lead, chromate of lead, lucifer match works, rag and [[shoddy]] works; and for dangers common to many industries, provisions against dust, poisons, accidents and other risks to health or limb have been codified in a decree of 1896. A royal decree of 31 March 1903 prohibits employment of persons under 16 years in [[fur]]-pulling and in carotting of [[rabbit]] skins, and another of 13 May 1905 regulates use of lead in house-[[painting]]. In 1898 a law was passed to enable the authorities to deal with risks in quarries under the same procedure. Safety in mines (which are not private property, but state concessions to be worked under strict state control) has been provided for since 1810. In matters of hygiene, until 1899 the powers of the public health authorities to intervene were insufficient, and a law was passed authorizing the government to make regulations for every kind of risk in any undertaking, whether classed under the law of public health or not. By a special law of 1888 children and young persons under 18 years are excluded from employment as pedlars, [[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s or in circuses, except by their parents, and then only if they have attained 14 years.

Abuses of the truck system have, since 1887, been regulated with care. The chief objects of the law of 1887 were to secure payment in full to all workers, other than those in agriculture or domestic service, of wages in [[legal tender]], to prohibit payment of wages in public-houses, and to secure prompt payment of wages. Certain deductions were permitted under careful control for specific customary objects: lodging, use of land, [[uniforms]], food, firing. A royal order of the Loth of October 1903 required use of automatic indicators for estimating wages in certain cases in textile processes. The law of 15 June 1896 regulates the affixing in workplaces, where at least five workers are employed, of a notice of the working rules, the nature and rate of fines, if any, and the mode of their application. Two central services the mines inspectorate and the factory and workshop inspectorate, divide the duties above indicated. There is also a system of local administration of the regulations relating to industries classed as unhealthy, but the tendency has been to give the supreme control in these matters to the factory service, with its expert staff.

==The Netherlands==
The first law for regulation of labour in manufacture was passed in 1874, and this related only to employment of children. The basis of all existing regulations was established in the law of 5 May 1889, which applies to all industrial undertakings, excluding agriculture and forestry, fishing, stock-rearing. Employment of children under 12 years is prohibited, and hours are limited for young persons under 16 and for women of any age. These protected persons may be excluded by royal decree from unhealthy industries, and such industries are specified in a decree of 1897 which supersedes other earlier regulations. Hours of employment must not exceed 11 in the 24, and at least one hour for rest must be given between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M., which hour must not be spent in a workroom. Work before 5 A.M. or after 7 P.M., Sunday work, and work on recognized holidays is generally prohibited, but there are exceptions. Overtime from 7 to P.M., under conditions, is allowed for women and young workers, and Sunday work for 'women, for example, in [[butter]] and [[cheese]] making, and night work for boys over 14 in certain industries. Employment of women within four weeks of childbirth is prohibited. Notices of working hours must be affixed in workplaces. Underground work in mines is prohibited for women and young persons under 16, but in the Netherlands mining is a very small industry.

In 1895 the first legislative provision was made for protection of workers against risk of accident or special injury to health. Sufficient cubic space, lighting, ventilation, sanitary accommodation, reasonable temperature, removal of noxious gases or dust, fencing of machinery, precautions against risk from fire and other matters are provided for. The manufacture of lucifer matches by means of white phosphorus was forbidden and the export, importation and sale was regulated by a law of 28 May 1901. By a regulation of 16 March 1904 provisions for safety and health of women and young workers were strengthened in processes where lead compounds or other poisons are used, and their employment at certain dangerous machines and in cleaning machinery or near [[driving]] belts was prohibited. No penal provision against truck exists in the Netherlands, but possibly [[abuses of the system]] are prevented by the existence of industrial councils representing both employers and workers, with powers to mediate or arbitrate in case of disputes.

==Switzerland==
In Switzerland separate cantonal legislation prepared the way for the general Federal labour law of 1877 on which subsequent legislation rests. Such legislation is also cantonal as well as Federal, but in the latter there is only amplification or interpretation of the principles contained in the law of 1877, whereas cantonal legislation covers industries not included under the Federal law, ''e.g.'' single workers employed in a trade (''métier'') and employment in shops, offices and hotels. The Federal law is applied to factories, workshops employing young persons under 18 or more than 10 workers, and workshops in which unhealthy or dangerous processes are carried on. Mines are not included, but are regulated in some respects as regards health and safety by cantonal laws. Further, the Law of [[Employers' liability and workmen's compensation|Employers' Liability]] 1881-1887, which requires in all industries precautions against accidents and reports of all serious. accidents to the cantonal governments, applies to mines.

This led, in 1896, to the creation of a special mining department, and mines, of which there are few, have to be inspected once a year by a mining engineer. The majority of the provisions of the Federal labour law apply to adult workers of both sexes, and the general limit of the II-hours' day, exclusive of at least one hour for meals, applies to men as well as women. The latter have, however, a legal claim, when they have a household to manage, to leave work at the dinner-hour half an hour earlier than the men. Men and unmarried women may be employed in such subsidiary work as cleaning before or after the general legal limits. On Saturdays and eves of the eight public holidays the II-hours' day is reduced to 10. Sunday work and night work are forbidden, but exceptions are permitted conditionally. Night work is defined as 8 P.M. to 5 A.M. in summer, 8 P.M. to 6 A.M. in winter. Children are excluded from employment in workplaces, under the law until 14 years of age, and until 16 must attend continuation schools. [[Zurich]] [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] has fixed the working day for women at 10 hours generally, and 9 hours on Saturdays and eves of holidays. Bale-Ville canton has the same limits and provides that the very limited Sunday employment permitted shall be compensated by double time off on another day. In the German-speaking cantons girls under 18 are not permitted to work overtime; in all cantons except [[Glarus]] the conditional overtime of 2 hours must be paid for at an enhanced wage.

Sanitary regulations and fencing of machinery are provided for with considerable minuteness in a Federal decree of 1897. The plans of every new factory must be submitted to the cantonal government. In the case of lucifer match factories, not only the building but methods of manufacture must be submitted. Since 1901 the manufacture, sale and import of matches containing white phosphorus have been forbidden. Women must be absent from employment during eight weeks before and after childbirth. In certain dangerous occupations, ''e.g.'' where lead or lead compounds are in use, women may not legally be employed during pregnancy. A resolution of the federal council in 1901 classed thirty-four different substances in use in industry as dangerous and laid down that in case of clearly defined illness of workers directly caused by use of any of these substances the liability provided by article 3 of the law of 25 June 1881, and article I of the law of 26 April 1887, should apply to the manufacture.

Legislative provision against abuses of the truck system appears to be of earlier origin in Switzerland (17th century) than any other European country outside England (15th century). The Federal Labour Law 1877 generally prohibits payment of wages otherwise than in current coin, and provides that no deduction shall be made without an express contract. Some of the cantonal laws go much farther than the British act of 1896 in forbidding certain deductions; ''e.g.'' Zurich prohibits any charge for cleaning, warming or lighting workrooms or for hire of machinery. By the Federal law fines may not exceed half a day's wage. Administration of the Labour laws is divided between inspectors appointed by the [[Federal government|Federal Government]] and local authorities, under supervision of the cantonal governments. The Federal Government forms a court of appeal against decisions of the cantonal governments.

==Germany==
Regulation of the conditions of labour in industry throughout the German empire is provided for in the Imperial Industrial Code and the orders of the Federal Council based thereon. By far the most important recent amendment socially is the law regulating child-labour, dated 30 March 1903, which relates to establishments having industrial character in the sense of the Industrial Code. This Code is based on earlier industrial codes of the separate states, but more especially on the Code of 1869 of the North German [[Confederation]]. It applies in whole or in part to all trades and industrial occupations, except transport, fisheries and agriculture. Mines are only included so far as truck, Sunday and holiday rest, prohibition of employment underground of female labour, limitation of the hours of women and young workers are concerned; otherwise the regulations for protection of life and limb of miners vary, as do the mining laws of the different states.

To estimate the force of the Industrial Code in working, it is necessary to [[bear]] in mind the complicated political history of the empire, the separate administration by the federated states, and the generally considerable powers vested in administration of initiating regulations. The Industrial Code expressly retains power for the states to initiate certain additions or exceptions to the Code which in any given state may form part of the law regulating factories there. The Code (unlike the Austrian Industrial Code) lays down no general limit for a normal working day for adult male workers, but since 1891 full powers were given to the Imperial government to limit hours for any classes of workers in industries where excessive length of the working day endangers the health of the worker (R.G.O. § 120e). Previously application had been made of powers to reduce the working day in such unhealthy industries as silvering of mirrors by [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and the manufacture of white-lead. Separate states had, under mining laws, also limited hours of miners. Sunday rest was, in 1891, secured for every class of workers, commercial, industrial and mining. Annual holidays were also secured on church festivals. These provisions, however, are subject to exceptions under conditions.

An important distinction has to be shown when we turn to the regulations for hours and times of labour for protected persons (women, young persons and children). Setting aside for the moment hours of shop assistants (which are under special sections since 1900), it is to " factory workers " and not to industrial workers in general that these limits apply, although they may be, and in some instances have been, further extended - for instance, in ready-made clothing trades - by imperial decree to workshops, and by the Child Labour Law of 1903 regulation of the scope and duration of employment of children is much strengthened in workshops, commerce, transport and domestic industries. The term " factory " (''Fabrik'') is not defined in the Code, but it is clear from various decisions of the [[Senior Courts of England and Wales|supreme court]] that it only in part coincides with the English term, and that some workplaces, where processes are carried on by aid of mechanical power, rank rather as English workshops. The distinction is rather between wholesale manufacturing industry, with subdivision of labour, and small industry, where the employer works himself. Certain classes of undertaking, viz. forges, [[timber]]-yards, [[dockyards]], brickfields and open quarries, are specifically ranked as factories. Employment of protected persons at the surface of mines and underground quarries, and in [[salt]] works and [[Ore-Dressing|ore-dressing]] works, and of boys underground comes under the factory regulations. These exclude children from employment under 13 years, and even later if an educational certificate has not been obtained; until 14 years hours of employment may not exceed 6 in the 24.

In processes and occupations under the scope of the Child Labour [[Law relating to children|Law children]] may not be employed by their parents or guardians before Jo years of age or by other employers before 12 years of age; nor between the hours of 8 P.M. and 8 A.M., nor otherwise than in full compliance with requirements of educational authorities for school attendance and with due regard to prescribed pauses. In school term time the daily limit of employment for children is three hours, in holiday time three hours. As regards factories Germany, unlike Great Britain, France and Switzerland, requires a shorter day for young persons than for women - io hours for the former, t t hours for the latter. Women over 16 years may be employed i 1 hours. Night work is forbidden, ''i.e.'' work between 8.30 P.M. and 5.30 A.M. Overtime may be granted to meet unforeseen pressure or for work on perishable articles, under conditions, by local authorities and the higher administrative authorities. Prescribed meal-times are - an unbroken half-hour for children in their 6 hours; for young persons a midday pause of one hour, and half an hour respectively in the morning and afternoon spells; for women, an hour at midday, but women with the care of a household have the claim, on demand, to an extra halfhour, as in Switzerland. No woman may be employed within four weeks after childbirth, and unless a medical certificate can then be produced, the absence must extend to six weeks. Notice of working periods and meal-times must be affixed, and copies sent to the local authorities. Employment of protected persons in factory industries where there are special risks to health or morality may be forbidden or made dependent on special conditions. By the Child Labour Law employment of children is forbidden in brickworks, stone breaking, [[chimney]] sweeping, street cleaning and other processes and occupations. By an order of the Federal Council in 1902 female workers were excluded from main processes in forges and rolling mills.

All industrial employers alike are bound to organize labour in such a manner as to secure workers against injury to health and to ensure good conduct and propriety. Sufficient light, suitable cloakrooms and sanitary accommodation, and ventilation to carry off dust, vapours and other impurities are especially required. Dining rooms may be ordered by local authorities. Fencing and provision for safety in case of fire are required in detail. The work of the trade accident [[insurance]] associations in preventing accidents is especially recognized in provisions for special rules in dangerous or unhealthy industries. Officials of the state factory departments are bound to give opportunity to trustees of the trade associations to express an opinion on special rules. In a large number of industries the Federal Council has laid down special rules comparable with those for unhealthy occupations in Great Britain. Among the regulations most recently revised and strengthened are those for manufacture of lead colours and lead compounds, and for horse-hair and brushmaking factories.

The relations between the state inspectors of factories and the ordinary [[police]] authorities are regulated in each state by its constitution. Prohibitions of truck in its original sense - that is, payment of wages otherwise than in current coin - apply to any persons under a contract of service with an employer for a specified time for industrial purposes; members of a family working for a parent or husband are not included; [[outworker]]s are covered. Control of fines and deductions from wages applies only in factory industries and shops employing at least 20 workers. Shop hours are regulated by requiring shops to be closed generally between 9 P.M. and 5 A.M., by requiring a fixed midday rest of t 2 hours and at least 10 hours' rest in the 24 for assistants. These limits can be modified by administrative authority. Notice of hours and working rules must be affixed. During the hours of compulsory closing sale of goods on the streets or from house to house is forbidden. Under the Commercial Code, as under the Civil Code, every employer is bound to adopt every possible measure for maintaining the safety, health and good conduct of his employees. By an order of the Imperial Chancellor under the Commercial Code seats must be provided for commercial assistants and apprentices.

==Austro Hungarian Empire==
The Austro-Hungarian empire was dissolved at the end of the first world war.

The Industrial Code of Austria, as of 1910, dates from 1883, differed from the Industrial Code of the kingdom of [[Hungary]]. The latter is, owing to the predominantly agricultural character of the population, of later origin, and hardly had practical force before the law of 1893 provided for inspection and prevention of accidents in factories. No separate mining code existed in Hungary, and conditions of labour are regulated by the Austrian law of 1854. The truck system is repressed on lines similar to those in Austria and Germany.

The Austrian Code has its origin, however, like the British Factory Acts, in protection of [[child labour]]. Its present scope is determined by the Imperial " Patent " of 1859, and all industrial labour is included except mining, transport, fisheries, forestry, agriculture and domestic industries. Factories are defined as including industries in which a " manufacturing process is carried on in an enclosed place by the aid of not less than twenty workers working with machines, with subdivision of labour, and under an employer who does not himself manually assist in the work." In smaller handicraft industries the compulsory gild system of organization still applies. In every industrial establishment, large or small, the sanitary and safety provisions, general requirement of Sunday rest, and annual holidays (with conditional exceptions), prohibition of truck and limitation of the ages of child labour apply. Night work for women, 8 P.M. to 5 A.M., is prohibited only in factory industries; for young workers it is prohibited in any industry. Pauses in work are required in all industries; one hour at least must be given at midday, and if the morning and afternoon spells exceed 5 hours each, another half-hour's rest at least must be given. Children may not be employed in industrial work before 12 years, and then only 8 hours a day at work that is not injurious and if educational requirements are observed. The age of employment is raised to 14 for " factories," and the work must be such as will not hinder physical development. Women may not be employed in regular industrial occupation within one month after childbirth.

In certain scheduled unhealthy industries, where certificates of authorization from local authorities must be obtained by intending occupiers, conditions of health and safety for workers can be laid down in the certificate. The Minister of the Interior is empowered to draw up regulations prohibiting or making conditions for the employment of young workers or women in dangerous or unhealthy industries. The provisions against truck cover not only all industrial workers engaged in manual labour under a contract with an employer, but also shopassistants; the special regulations against fines and deductions apply to factory workers and shops where at least 20 workers are employed. In mines under the law of 1884, which supplements the general mining law, employment of women and girls underground is prohibited; boys from 12 to 16 and girls from 12 to 18 may only be employed at light work above ground; 14 is the earliest age of admission for boys underground. The shifts from bank to bank must not exceed 12 hours, of which not more than to may be effective work. Sunday rest must begin not later than 6 A.M., and must be of 24 hours' duration. These last two provisions do not hold in case of pressing danger for safety, health or property. Sick and accident funds and mining associations are legislated for in minutest detail. The general law provides for safety in working, but special rules drawn up by the district authorities lay down in detail the conditions of health and safety. As regards manufacturing industry, the Industrial Code lays no obligation on employers to report accidents, and until the Accident Insurance Law of 1889 came into force no [[statistics]] were available. In Austria, unlike Germany, the factory inspectorate is organized throughout under a central chief inspector.

==Scandinavian Countries==
In [[Sweden]] the Factory Law was amended in January 1901; in [[Denmark]] in July 1901. Until that year, however, [[Norway]] was in some respects in advance of the other two countries by its law of 1892, which applied to industrial works, including metal works of all kinds and mining. Women were thereby prohibited from employment: (a) underground; (''b'') in cleaning or oiling machinery in motion; (''c'') during six weeks after childbirth, unless provided with a medical certificate stating that they might return at the end of four weeks without injury to health; (''d'') in dangerous, unhealthy or exhausting trades during pregnancy. Further, work on Sundays and public holidays is prohibited to all workers, adult and youthful, with conditional exceptions under the authority of the inspectors. Children over 12 are admitted to industrial work on obtaining certificates of birth, of physical fitness and of elementary education. The hours of children are limited to 6, with pauses, and of young persons (of 14 to 18 years) to 10, with pauses. Night work between 8 P.M. and 6 A.M. is prohibited. All workers are entitled to a copy of a code of factory rules containing the terms of the contract of work drawn up by representatives of employees with the employers and sanctioned by the inspector. Health and safety in working are provided for in detail in the same law of 1892. Special rules may be made for dangerous trades, and in 1899 such rules were established for match factories, similar to some of the British rules, but notably providing for a dental examination four times yearly by a doctor.

In Denmark, regulation began with unhealthy industries, and it was not until the law of 1901 came into force, on 1 January 1902, that children under 12 years have been excluded from factory labour. Control of child labour can be strengthened by municipal regulation, and this has been done in [[Copenhagen]] by an order of 23 May 1903. In Sweden the 12 years' limit had for some time held in the larger factories; the scope has been extended so that it corresponds with the Norwegian law. The hours of children are, in Denmark, 62 for those under 14 years; in Sweden 6 for those under 13 years. Young persons may not in either country work more than 10 hours daily, and night work, which is forbidden for persons under 18 years, is now defined as in Norway. Women may not be employed in industry within four weeks of childbirth, except on authority of a medical certificate. All factories in Sweden where young workers are employed are subject to medical inspection once a year. Fencing of machinery and hygienic conditions (ventilation, cubic space, temperature, light) are regulated in detail. In Denmark the use of white phosphorus in manufacture of lucifer matches has been prohibited since 1874, and special regulations have been drawn up by administrative orders which strengthen control of various unhealthy or dangerous industries, dry-cleaning works, printing works and type foundries, [[iron]] foundries and engineering works. A special act of 6 April 1906 regulates labour and sanitary conditions in bakehouses and [[confectionery]] works.

==Italy and Spain==
The wide difference between the industrial development of these southern [[Latin]] countries and the two countries with which this summary begins, and the far greater importance of the agricultural interests, produced a situation, as regards labour legislation until as recently as 1903, which makes it convenient to touch on the comparatively limited scope of their regulations at the close of the series. It was stated by competent and impartial observers from each of the two countries, at the International Congress on Labour Laws held at [[Brussels]] in 1897, that the lack of adequate measures for protection of child labour and inefficient administration of such regulations as exist was then responsible for abuse of their forces that could be found in no other European countries. " Their labour in factories, workshops, and mines constitutes a veritable martyrdom " (Spain). " I believe that there is no country where a sacrifice of child life is made that is comparable with that in certain [[Italy|Italian]] factories and industries " (Italy). In both countries important progress has since been made in organizing inspection and preventing accidents. In Spain the first step in the direction of limitation of women's hours of labour was taken by a law of 1900, which took effect in 1902, in regulations for reduction of hours of labour for adults to II, normally, in the 24. Hours of children under 14 must not exceed 6 in any industrial work nor 8 in any commercial undertaking. Labour before the age of 10 years and night work between 6P.M. and 5 A.M. was prohibited, and powers were taken to extend the prohibition of night work to young persons under 16 years. The labour of children in Italy was until 1902 regulated in the main by a law of 1886, but a royal decree of 1899 strengthened it by classing night work for children under 12 years as " injurious," such work being thereby generally prohibited for them, though exceptions are admitted; at the same time it was laid down that children from 12 to 15 years might not be employed for more than 6 hours at night.

The law of 1886 prohibits employment of children under 9 years in industry and under To years in underground mining. Night work for women was in Italy first prohibited by the law of 19 June 1902, and at the same time also for boys under 15, but this regulation was not to take full effect for 5 years as regards persons already so employed; by the same law persons under 15 and women of any age were accorded the claim to one day's complete rest of 24 hours in the week; the age of employment of children in factories, workshops, laboratories, quarries, mines, was raised to 12 years generally and 14 years for underground work; the labour of female workers of any age was prohibited in underground work, and power was reserved to further restrict and regulate their employment as well as that of male workers under 15. Spain and Italy, the former by the law of 13 March 1900, the latter by the law of 19 June 1902, prohibit the employment of women within a fixed period of childbirth; in Spain the limit is three weeks, in Italy one month, which may be reduced to three weeks on a medical certificate of fitness. Sunday rest is secured in industrial works, with regulated exceptions in Spain by the law of 3 March 1904. It is in the direction of fencing and other safeguards against accidents and as regards sanitary provisions, both in industrial workplaces and in mines, that Italy has made most advance since her law of 1890 for prevention of accidents. Special measures for prevention of [[malaria]] are required in cultivation of [[rice]] by a ministerial circular of 23 April 1903; work may not begin until an hour after sunrise and must cease an hour before sunset; children under 13 may not be employed in this industry.

==United States==
{{see also|labor history of the United States}}
Under the general head of Labour Legislation all American statute laws regulating labour, its conditions, and the relation of employer and employee must be classed. It includes what is properly known as factory legislation. Labour legislation belongs to the latter half of the 19th century, so far as the United States is concerned. Like England in the far past, the Americans in colonial days undertook to regulate wages and prices, and later the employment of apprentices. Legislation relating to wages and prices was long ago abandoned, but the laws affecting the employment of apprentices still exist in some form, although conditions of employment have changed so materially that apprenticeships are not entered as of old; but the laws regulating the employment of apprentices were the basis on which English legislation found a foothold when parliament wished to regulate the labour of factory operatives. The code of labour laws of the present time is almost entirely the result of the industrial revolution during the latter part of the 18th century, under which the domestic or hand-labour system was displaced through the introduction of power machinery. As this revolution took place in the United States at a somewhat later date than in England, the labour legislation necessitated by it belongs to a later date. The factory, so far as textiles are concerned, was firmly established in [[United States|America]] during the period from 1820 to 1840, and it was natural that the English legislation found friends and advocates in the United States, although the more objectionable conditions accompanying the English factory were not to be found there.

The first attempt to secure legislation regulating factory employment related to the hours of labour, which were very long - from twelve to thirteen hours a day. Early during the introduction of machinery, it was felt that the tension resulting from speeded machines and the close attention required in the factory ought to be accompanied by a shorter work day. This view took firm hold of the operatives and was the chief cause of the agitation which has resulted in a great body of laws applying in very many directions. As early as 1806 the caulkers and shipbuilders of [[New York City]] agitated for a reduction of hours to ten per day, but no legislation followed. There were several other attempts to secure some regulation relative to hours, but there was no general agitation prior to 1831. As [[Massachusetts]] was the state which first recognized the necessity of regulating employment (following in a measure, and so far as conditions demanded, the English labour or factory legislation), the history of such legislation in that state is indicative of that in the United States, and as it would be impossible in this article to give a detailed history of the origin of laws in the different states, the dates of their enactment, and their provisions, it is best to follow primarily the course of the Eastern states, and especially that of Massachusetts, where the first general agitation took place and the first laws were enacted. That state in 1836 regulated by law the question of the education of young persons employed in manufacturing establishments. The regulation of hours of labour was warmly discussed in 1832, and several legislative committees and commissions reported upon it, but no specific action on the general question of hours of labour secured the [[Political endorsement|indorsement]] of the Massachusetts legislature until 1874, although the day's labour of children under twelve years of age was limited to ten hours in 1842. Ten hours constituted a day's labour, on a voluntary basis, in many trades in Massachusetts and other parts of the country as early as 1853, while in the [[shipbuilding]] trades this was the work-day in 1844. In April 1840 President Van Buren issued an order " that all public establishments will hereafter be regulated, as to working hours, by the ten-hours system." The real aggressive movement began in 1845, through numerous petitions to the Massachusetts legislature urging a reduction of the day's labour to eleven hours, but nothing came of these petitions at that time. Again, in 1850, a similar effort was made, and also in 1851 and 1852, but the bills failed. Then there was a period of quiet until 1865, when an unpaid commission made a report relative to the hours of labour, and recommended the establishment of a bureau of statistics for the purpose of collecting data bearing upon the labour question. This was the first step in this direction in any country. The first bureau of the kind was established in Massachusetts in 1869, but meanwhile, in accordance with reports of commissions and [[Public speaking|the address]] of Governor Bullock in 1866, and the general sentiment which then prevailed, the legislature passed an act regulating in a measure the conditions of the employment of children in manufacturing establishments; and this is one of the first laws of the kind in the United States, although the first legislation in the United States relating to the hours of labour which the writer has been able to find, and for which he can fix a date, was enacted by the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1849, the law providing that ten hours should be a day's work in cotton, woollen, paper, bagging, silk and flax factories.

The Massachusetts law of 1866 provided, firstly, that no child under ten should be employed in any manufacturing establishment, and that no child between ten and fourteen should be so employed unless he had attended some public or private school at least six months during the year preceding such employment, and, further, that such employment should not continue unless the child attended school at least six months in each and every year; secondly, a penalty not exceeding $50 for every owner or agent or other person knowingly employing a child in violation of the act; thirdly, that no child under the age of fourteen should be employed in any manufacturing establishment more than eight hours in any one day; fourthly, that any parent or [[Legal guardian|guardian]] allowing or consenting to employment in violation of the act should forfeit a sum not to exceed $50 for each offence; fifthly, that the Governor instruct the state constable and his deputies to enforce the provisions of all laws for regulating the employment of children in manufacturing establishments. The same legislature also created a commission of three persons, whose duty it was to investigate the subject of hours of labour in relation to the social, educational and sanitary condition of the working classes. In 1867 a fundamental law relating to schooling and hours of labour of children employed in manufacturing and mechanical establishments was passed by the Massachusetts legislature. It differed from the act of the year previous in some respects, going deeper into the general question. It provided that no child under ten should be employed in any manufacturing or mechanical establishment of the [[commonwealth]], and that no child between ten and fifteen should be so employed unless he had attended school, public or private, at least three months during the year next preceding his employment. There were provisions relating to residence, &amp;c., and a further provision that no time less than 120 half-days of actual schooling should be deemed an equivalent of three months, and that no child under fifteen should be employed in any manufacturing or mechanical establishment more than sixty hours any one week. The law also provided penalties for violation. It repealed the act of 1866.

In 1869 began the establishment of that chain of offices in the United States, the principle of which has been adopted by other countries, known as bureaus of statistics of labour, their especial purpose being the collection and dissemination of information relating to all features of industrial employment. As a result of the success of the first bureau, bureaus are in existence in thirty-three states, in addition to the United States Bureau of Labour.

A special piece of legislation which belongs to the commonwealth of Massachusetts, so far as experience shows, was that in 1872, providing for cheap morning and evening trains for the accommodation of working men living in the vicinity of [[Boston]]. Great Britain had long had such trains, which were called parliamentary trains. Under the Massachusetts law some of the [[railways]] running out of Boston furnished the accommodation required, and the system has since been in operation.

In different parts of the country the agitation to secure legislation regulating the hours of labour became aggressive again in 1870 and the years immediately following, there being a constant repetition of attempts to secure the ''Factory '' enactment of a ten-hours law, but in Massachusetts ''legisia- '' ? ''tion, /877 '' all the petitions failed till 1874, when the legislature of that commonwealth established the hours of labour at sixty per week not only for children under eighteen, but for women, the law providing that no minor under eighteen and no woman over that age should be employed by any person, firm or corporation in any manufacturing establishment more than ten hours in any one day. In 1876 Massachusetts reconstructed its [[Laws Relating To Seamen|laws relating to]] the employment of children, although it did not abrogate the principles involved in earlier legislation, while in 1877 the commonwealth passed Factory Acts covering the general provisions of the British laws. It provided for the general inspection of factories and public buildings, the provisions of the law relating to dangerous machinery, such as belting, shafting, gearing, drums, &amp;c., which the legislature insisted must be securely guarded, and that no machinery other than steam engines should be cleaned while running. The question of ventilation and cleanliness was also attended to. Dangers connected with hoistways, [[elevator]]s and well-holes were minimized by their protection by sufficient trap-doors, while fire-escapes were made obligatory on all establishments of three or more storeys in height. All main doors, both inside and outside, of manufacturing establishments, as well as those of churches, school-rooms, town halls, theatres and every building used for public assemblies, should open outwardly whenever the factory inspectors of the commonwealth deemed it necessary. These provisions remain in the laws of Massachusetts, and other states have found it wise to follow them.

The labour legislation in force in 1910 in the various states of the Union might be classified in two general branches: (A) protective labour legislation, or laws for the aid of workers who, on account of their economic dependence, are not in a position fully to protect themselves; (B) legislation having for its purpose the fixing of the legal status of the worker as an employee, such as laws relating to the making and breaking of the labour contract, the right to form organizations and to assemble peaceably, the settlement of labour disputes, the licensing of occupations, &amp;c.

(A) The first class includes factory and workshop acts, laws relating to hours of labour, work on Sundays and holidays, the payment of wages, the liability of employers for injuries to their employees, &amp;c. Factory acts have been passed by ''Factory '' nearly all the states of the Union. These may be ''and work- '' considered in two groups - first, laws which relate to conditions of employment and affect only children, young persons and women; and second, laws which relate to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and to the safety of employees generally. The states adopting such laws have usually made provision for factory inspectors, whose duties are to enforce these laws and who have power to enter and inspect factories and workshops. The most common provisions of the factory acts in the various states are those which fix an age limit below which employment is unlawful. All but five states have enacted such provisions, and these five states have practically no manufacturing industries. In some states the laws fixing an age limit are restricted in their application to factories, while in others they extend also to workshops, bakeries, [[mercantile]] establishments and other work places where children are employed. The prescribed age limit varies from ten to fourteen years. Provisions concerning the education of children in factories and workshops may be considered in two groups, those relating to apprenticeship and those requiring a certain educational qualification as a prerequisite to employment. Apprenticeship laws are numerous, but they do not now have great force, because of the practical abrogation of the apprenticeship system through the operation of modern methods of production. Most states have provisions prohibiting illiterates under a specified age, usually sixteen, from being employed in factories and workshops. The provisions of the factory acts relating to hours of labour and night work generally affect only the employment of women and young persons. Most of the states have enacted such provisions, those limiting the hours of children occurring more frequently than those limiting the hours of women. The hour limit for work in such cases ranges from six per day to sixty-six per week. Where the working time of children is restricted, the minimum age prescribed for such children ranges from twelve to twenty-one years. In some cases the restriction of the hours of labour of women and children is general, while in others it applies only to employment in one or more classes of industries. Other provisions of law for the protection of women and children, but not usually confined in their operation to factories and workshops, are such as require seats for females and separate [[toilet]] facilities for the sexes, and prohibit employment in certain occupations as in mines, places where intoxicants are manufactured or sold, in cleaning or operating dangerous machinery, &amp;c. Provisions of factory acts relating to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and the safety of employees have been enacted in nearly all the manufacturing states of the Union. They prohibit overcrowding, and require proper ventilation, sufficient light and heat, the lime-washing or painting of walls and ceilings, the provision of exhaust fans and blowers in places where dust or dangerous fumes are generated, guards on machinery, mechanical belts and gearing shifters, guards on elevators and hoistways, hand-rails on stairs, fire-escapes, &amp;c.

The statutes relating to hours of labour may be considered under five groups, namely: (1) general laws which merely fix what shall be regarded as a day's labour in the absence of a contract; (2) laws defining what shall constitute a day's work on public roads; (3) laws limiting the hours of labour per day on public works; (4) laws limiting the hours of labour in certain occupations; and (5) laws which specify the hours per day or per week during which women and children may be employed. The statutes included in the first two groups place no restrictions upon the number of hours which may be agreed upon between employers and employees, while those in the other three groups usually limit the freedom of contract and provide penalties for their violation. A considerable number of states have enacted laws which fix a day's labour in the absence of any contract, some at eight and others at ten hours, so that when an employer and an employee make a contract and they do not specify what shall constitute a day's labour, eight or ten hours respectively would be ruled as the day's labour in an action which might come before the courts. In a number of the states it is optional with the citizens to liquidate certain taxes either by [[cash]] payments or by rendering personal service. In the latter case the length of the working day is defined by law, eight hours being usually specified. The Federal government and nearly one-half of the states have laws providing that eight hours shall constitute a day's work for employees on public works. Under the Federal Act it is unlawful for any officer of the government or of any contractor or subcontractor for public works to permit labourers and [[mechanics]] to work longer than eight hours per day. The state laws concerning hours of labour have similar provisions. Exceptions are provided for cases of extraordinary emergencies, such as danger to human life or property. In many states the hours of labour have been limited by law in occupations in which, on account of their dangerous or insanitary character, the health of the employees would be jeopardized by long hours of labour, or in which the fatigue occasioned by long hours would endanger the lives of the employees or of the public. The occupations for which such special legislation has been enacted are those of employees on steam and street railways, in mines and other underground workings, smelting and refining works, bakeries and cotton and woollen mills. Laws limiting the hours of labour of women and children have been considered under factory and workshop acts.

Nearly all states and Territories of the Union have laws prohibiting the employment of labour on Sunday. These laws usually make it a misdemeanour for persons either to labour themselves or to compel or permit their apprentices, servants or other employees, to labour on the first day of the week. Exceptions are made in the case of household duties or works of necessity or [[Charity (practice)|charity]], and in the case of members of religious societies who observe some other than the first day of the week.

Statutes concerning the payment of wages of employees may be considered in two groups: (i) those which relate to the employment contract, such as laws fixing the maximum period of wage payments, prohibiting the payment of wages in [[scrip]] or other evidences of indebtedness in lieu of lawful money, prohibiting wage deductions on account of fines, breakage of machinery, discounts for prepayments, medical attendance, relief funds or other purposes, requiring the giving of notice of reduction of wages, &amp;c.; (2) legislation granting certain privileges or affording special protection to working people with respect to their wages, such as laws exempting wages from [[attachment (law)|attachment]], preferring wage claims in assignments, and granting workmen liens upon buildings and other constructions on which they have been employed.

Employers' liability laws have been passed to enable an employee to recover damages from his employer under certain conditions when he has been injured through accident occurring in the works of the employer. The [[Common law|common-law]] maxim that the principal is responsible for the acts of his agent does not ''liability. '' apply where two or more persons are working together under the same employer and one of the employees is injured through the carelessness of his fellow-employee, although the one causing the accident is the agent of the principal, who under the common law would be responsible. The old [[Roman Law|Roman law]] and the English and American practice under it held that the co-employee was a party to the accident. The injustice of this rule is seen by a single illustration. A weaver in a cotton factory, where there are hundreds of operatives, is injured by the neglect or carelessness of the engineer in charge of the motive power. Under the common law the weaver could not recover damages from the employer, because he was the co-employee of the engineer. So, one of thousands of employees of a railway system, sustaining injuries through the carelessness of a switchman whom he never saw, could recover no damages from the railway company, both being co-employees of the same employer. The injustice of this application of the common-law rule has been recognized, but the only way to avoid the difficulty was through specific legislation providing that under such conditions as those related, and similar ones, the doctrine of co-employment should not apply, and that the workman should have the same right to recover damages as a passenger upon a railway [[train]]. This legislation has upset some of the most notable distinctions of law.

The first agitation for legislation of this character occurred in England in 1880. A number of states in the Union have now enacted statutes fixing the liability of employers under certain conditions and relieving the employee from the application of the common-law rule. Where the employee himself is contributory to the injuries resulting from an accident he cannot recover, nor can he recover in some cases where he knows of the danger from the defects of tools or implements employed by him. The legislation upon the subject involves many features of legislation which need not be described here, such as those concerning the power of employees to make a contract, and those defining the conditions, often elaborate, which lead to the liability of the employer and the duties of the employee, and the relations in which damages for injuries sustained in employment may be recovered from the employer.

(B) The statutes thus far considered may be regarded as protective labour legislation. There is, besides, a large body of statutory laws enacted in the various states for the purpose of fixing the legal status of employers and employees and defining their rights and privileges as such.

A great variety of statutes have been enacted in the various states relating to the labour contract. Among these are laws defining the labour contract, requiring notice of termination of contract, making it a misdemeanour to break a contract of service and thereby endanger human life or expose valuable property to serious injury, or to make a contract of service and accept transportation or pecuniary advancements with [[intent (law)|intent]] to defraud, prohibiting contracts of employment whereby employees waive the right to damages in case of injury, &amp;c. A Federal statute makes it a misdemeanour for any one to prepay the transportation or in any way assist or encourage the importation of aliens under contract to perform labour or service of any kind in the United States, exceptions being made in the case of skilled labour that cannot otherwise be obtained, domestic servants and persons belonging to any of the recognized professions.

The Federal government and nearly all the states and territories have statutory provisions requiring the examination and licensing of persons practising certain trades other than those in the class of recognized professions. The Federal statute relates only to engineers on steam vessels, masters, mates, pilots, &amp;c. The occupations for which [[examinations]] and licences are required by the various state laws are those of barbers, horseshoers, elevator operators, plumbers, stationary firemen, steam engineers, [[telegraph]] operators on railroads and certain classes of mine workers and steam and street railway employees.

The right of combination and peaceable assembly on the part of employees is recognized at common law throughout the United States. Organizations of working-men formed for their mutual benefit, protection and improvement, such for endeavouring to secure higher wages, as g g g shorter hours of labour or better working conditions, are nowhere regarded as unlawful. A number of states and the Federal government have enacted statutes providing for the [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] of [[Trade Unions|trade unions]], but owing to the freedom from regulation or inspection enjoyed by unincorporated trade unions, very few have availed themselves of this privilege. A number of states have enacted laws tending to give special protection to and encourage trade unions. Thus, nearly one-half of the states have passed acts declaring it unlawful for employers to discharge workmen for joining labour organizations, or to make it a condition of employment that they shall not belong to such bodies. Laws of this kind have generally been held to be unconstitutional. Nearly all the states have laws protecting trade unions in the use of the union [[label]], insignia of membership, [[credentials]], &amp;c., and making it a misdemeanour to counterfeit or fraudulently use them. A number of the states exempt labour organizations from the operations of the anti-[[trust (law)|trust]] and insurance acts.

Until recent years all legal action concerning labour disturbances was based upon the principles of the common law.

Some of the states have now fairly complete statutory enactments concerning labour disturbances, while g others have little or no legislation of this class. The right of employees to strike for any cause or for no cause is sustained by the common law everywhere in the United States. Likewise an employer has a right to discharge any or all of his employees when they have no contract with him, and he may refuse to employ any person or class of persons for any reason or for no reason. Agreements among strikers to take peaceable means to induce others to remain away from the works of an employer until he yields to the demands of the strikers are not held to be conspiracies under the common law, and the carrying out of such a purpose by peaceable persuasion and without violence, intimidation or threats, is not unlawful. However, any interference with the constitutional rights of another to employ whom he chooses or to labour when, where or on what terms he pleases, is illegal. The [[boycott]] has been held to be an illegal [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] in [[restraint of trade|restraint]] of trade. The statutory enactments of the various states concerning labour disturbances are in part re-enactments of the rules of common law and in part more or less departures from or additions to the established principles. The list of such statutory enactments is a large one, and includes laws relating to blacklisting, boycotting, conspiracy against working-men, interference with employment, intimidation, [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] and strikes of railway employees; laws requiring statements of causes of discharge of employees and notice of strikes in advertisements for labour; laws prohibiting deception in the employment of labour and the hiring of armed guards by employers; and laws declaring that certain labour agreements do not constitute conspiracy. Some of these laws have been held to be unconstitutional, and some have not yet been tested in the courts.

The laws just treated relate almost entirely to acts either of employers or of employees, but there is another form of law, namely, - that providing for action to be taken by others in the effort to prevent working people from losing employment, either by their own acts or by those of their employers, or to [[Settlement (litigation)|settle]] any differences which arise out of controversies relating to wages, hours of labour, terms and conditions of employment, rules, &amp;c. These laws provide for the [[mediation]] and the arbitration of labour disputes (see [[Compulsory arbitration]] and [[Conciliation]]). Twenty-three states and the Federal government have laws or constitutional provisions of this nature. In some cases they provide for the appointment of state boards, and in others of local boards only. A number of states provide for local or special boards in addition to the regular state boards. In some states it is required that a member of a labour organization must be a member of the board, and, in general, both employers and employees must be represented. Nearly all state boards are required to attempt to mediate between the parties to a dispute when information is received of an actual or threatened labour trouble. Arbitration may be undertaken in some states on application from either party, in others on the application of both parties. An agreement to maintain the ''status quo'' pending arbitration is usually required. The modes of enforcement of obedience to the awards of the boards are various. Some states depend on publicity alone, some give the decisions the effect of judgments of courts of law which may be enforced by execution, while in other states disobedience to such decisions is punishable as for [[contempt of court]]. The Federal statute applies only to common carriers engaged in [[interstate commerce]], and provides for an attempt to be made at mediation by two designated government officials in controversies between common carriers and their employees, and, in case of the failure of such an attempt, for the formation of a board of arbitration consisting of the same officials together with certain other parties to be selected. Such arbitration boards are to be formed only at the request or upon the consent of both parties to the controversy.

The enforcement of laws by executive or judicial action is an important matter relating to labour legislation, for without action such laws would remain dead letters. Under the constitutions of the states, the governor is the commander-in-chief of the military forces, and he has the power to order the [[militia]] or any part of it into active service in case of insurrection, invasion, tumult, riots or breaches of the peace or imminent danger thereof. Frequent action has been taken in the case of strikes with the view of preventing or suppressing violence threatened or happening to persons or property, the effect being, however, that the militia protects those working or desiring to work, or the employers. The president of the United States may use the land and naval forces whenever by reason of insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful obstructions, conspiracy, combinations or assemblages of persons it becomes impracticable to enforce the laws of the land by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or when the execution of the laws is so hindered by reason of such events that any portion or class of the people are deprived thereby of their rights and privileges under the constitution and laws of the country. Under this general power the United States forces have been used for the protection of both employers and employees indirectly, the purpose being to protect mails and, as in the states, to see that the laws are carried out.

The power of the courts to interfere in labour disputes is through the [[injunction]] and punishment thereunder for contempt of court. It is a principle of law that when there are interferences, actual or threatened, with property or with rights of a pecuniary nature, and the common or statute law offers no adequate and immediate remedy for the prevention of injury, a court of [[Equity (law)|equity]] may interpose and issue its order or injunction as to what must or must not be done, a violation of which [[writ]] gives the court which issued it the power to punish for contempt. The doctrine is that something is necessary to be done to stop at once the destruction of property and the obstruction of business, and the injunction is immediate in its action. This writ has been resorted to frequently for the indirect protection of employees and of employers.

The '''House of Assembly''' was the legislature of [[British Guiana]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

==History==
The House of Assembly was established as a result of the [[Waddington Commission]], which led to the enactment of constitutional reforms in 1952; universal suffrage was introduced and the [[Legislative Council (British Guiana)|Legislative Council]] was to be replaced by the House of Assembly. The new House had 28 members; 24 members elected in single member constituencies, a speaker appointed by the Governor and three ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney General and the Financial Secretary).&lt;ref name=P/&gt; The term of the final Legislative Council was extended in order to allow preparations for [[British Guiana general election, 1953|elections]] under the new system on 27 April 1953.&lt;ref name=P&gt;[http://parliament.gov.gy/GUYANA%20PARLIAMENT%20HISTORY%202009-1.pdf Historical information events and dates on the Parliament of Guyana from 1718 to 2006] Parliament of Guyana&lt;/ref&gt;

The elections were won by the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) led by [[Cheddi Jagan]], who became Prime Minister, whilst [[Eustace Gordon Woolford]] was appointed Speaker of the new House. Its first meeting was held on 18 May.&lt;ref name=P/&gt; After assuming power Jagan embarked on implementing a series of policies that involved radical social reform, mainly directed at the colonial oligarchy. The British colonial authorities sent in troops in response to the alleged threat of a [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolution. [[List of Governors of British Guiana|Governor]] [[Alfred Savage]] suspended the constitution on 9 October (only 133 days after it had come into force);&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p354 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the House of Assembly was prorogued, before being dissolved on 21 December. A wholly appointed Interim Legislative Council was established in place of the Assembly.

Constitutional reforms in 1964 led to the re-establishment of the House of Assembly as a replacement for the [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Legislature (British Guiana)|Legislature]], which had been created in 1961. The new House was a 54-seat body, consisting of 53 elected members and the Speaker. The [[British Guiana general election, 1964|elections]] were held  on 7 December 1964 using proportional representation to allocate the seats, and although  the PPP won the most seats, the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) and [[The United Force|United Force]] were able to form a coalition government with a working majority. Despite losing the elections, Jagan refused to resign as Prime Minister, and had to be removed by [[List of Governors of British Guiana|Governor]] [[Richard Luyt]], with [[Forbes Burnham]] replacing him.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, p363&lt;/ref&gt; The new House met for the first time on 31 December, although the meeting was boycotted by the PPP.&lt;ref name=P/&gt; [[Aubrey Percival Alleyne]] of the PNC was elected Speaker, and subsequently vacated his seat, allowing [[Philip Duncan (Guyanese politician)|Philip Duncan]] of the PNC to take his place.

On 26 May 1966 the country became independent under the name of [[Guyana]]. A new constitution came into force, replacing the House of Assembly with the [[National Assembly (Guyana)|National Assembly]].

{{Politics}}

The '''House of Commons''' is the elected [[lower house]] of the [[bicameral]] [[parliament]]s of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]] and historically was the name of the lower houses of the [[Kingdom of England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], [[Kingdom of Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]], [[North Carolina]] and [[South Korea]]. Roughly equivalent bodies in other countries which were once part of the [[British Empire]] include the [[United States House of Representatives]], the [[Australian House of Representatives]], the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]], and India's [[Lok Sabha]].

In the UK and Canada, the Commons holds much more legislative power than the respective [[upper house]] of parliament. The leader of the majority party in the House of Commons usually becomes the [[prime minister]]. Since 2010 the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] has had 650 elected members, and since 2015 the [[House of Commons of Canada]] has had 338 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/process/house/partystandings/standings-E.htm|title=Current Party Standings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commons' functions are to consider through debate new laws and changes to existing ones, authorise taxes,  and provide scrutiny of the policy and expenditure of the Government. It has the power to give a Government a [[vote of no confidence]].

==History and naming==
The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons of the Kingdom of England]] evolved from an undivided parliament to serve as the voice of the tax-paying subjects of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|counties]] and of the [[borough constituency|boroughs]]. [[Knight of the shire|Knights of the shire]], elected from each county, were usually landowners, while the borough members were often from the merchant classes. These members represented subjects of [[the Crown]] who were not Lords Temporal or Spiritual, who themselves sat in the [[House of Lords]]. The House of Commons gained its name because it represented communities (''communes'').&lt;ref&gt;[[A. F. Pollard]], ''The Evolution of Parliament'' (Longmans, 1920), 107–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Commons were all elected, while members of the upper house were summoned to parliament by the monarch, usually on the basis of a [[peerage of England|title]] which would be inherited after the holder's death, or because they held a position in the realm that warranted special recognition, such as the [[bishop]]s of the English and Welsh [[diocese]]s. After the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], these bishops were those of the [[Church of England]]. [[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|right|The British House of Commons Chamber in London]]

Since the 19th century, the British and Canadian Houses of Commons have become increasingly representative, as [[suffrage]] has been extended.  Both bodies are now elected via [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]]. However, from the [[Middle Ages]] until the early 20th century there was a tendency to limit the suffrage in various ways, creating by the 18th century a large number of [[rotten borough]]s. In all countries, the House of Commons now as in the past may be [[Legislative session|prorogued]] for an election or some other purpose only by the Crown, represented outside the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Governor General]] of each [[Commonwealth realm]].

A '''hunting license''' is a [[Regulation|regulatory]] or [[law|legal mechanism]] to control [[recreation]]al and sports [[hunting]].

Hunting may be regulated informally by unwritten law, self-restraint, a moral code, or by governmental laws.&lt;ref&gt;National Shooting Sports Foundation, ''The Ethical Hunter'', brochure p. 6, March 2003, site at [http://www.nssf.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purposes for requiring hunting licenses include the protection of [[natural resources|natural treasures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/opinion/how-to-stop-wildlife-poachers.html|title=How to Stop Wildlife Poachers|last=Bennett|first=Elizabeth|publisher=New York Times|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raising tax revenue (often, but not always, to dedicated funds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/news/2012/05/29/open-season-new-omnibus-game-and-fish-law|title=Open season with new omnibus game and fish law|last=Busse|first=Nick|publisher=Twin Cities daily Planet|date=May 29, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.frontiersman.com/sports/outdoors/hunters-first-to-pony-up-for-conservation/article_dd7c0970-aba2-11e1-a07f-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Hunters first to pony up for conservation |last=Delo|first=Howard|publisher=Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman|date=May 31, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toth&gt;{{cite news|url=http://millelacscountytimes.com/2012/05/10/hunters-anglers-face-higher-license-prices/|title=Hunters, anglers face higher license prices|last=Toth|first=Leslie|publisher=Mille Lacs County Times|date=May 10, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hunting licenses are millennia old.

Amongst the first hunting laws in the [[Common law]] tradition was from the time of [[William the Conqueror]] (reign in England starting 1066).  In the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]]'' entry of 1087, [[The Rime of King William]] reported in verse that:

:Whoever killed a hart or a hind
:Should be blinded. &lt;ref&gt;Seth Lerner, ''Inventing English: A Portable History of the English Language'', p. 43 (Columbia U. Press 2007), citing Cecily Clark, ''The Peterborough Chronicle'' (2nd ed. Clarenden Press 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

This was because "William the Conqueror's moral life lives in the landscape.  His control of the forest mirrors his control of the people, and his establishment of hunting laws reveals the dissonance between his love for animals and his contempt for the populace: ...&lt;ref&gt;[[Old English]] text here is removed.&lt;/ref&gt;

:He loved the wild animals
:As if he were their father.

==Purposes==
Hunting licenses have several purposes.  These reasons include: [[public safety]] (especially of children, both as hunters and bystanders), regulation and conservation of wild animals, revenue for the sovereign state, and containing the transmission of [[Zoonosis|animal-borne diseases]] (such as [[Lyme disease]] and [[rabies]]).  The safety issues are especially highlighted in urban areas and shopping districts.  For example, after in an incident in November 2012 whereby a man allegedly shot at a deer in a [[Walmart]] parking lot in [[Pennsylvania]], he was charged with "reckless endangerment, ... hunting without a license, shooting on or across highways and unlawful killing or taking of big game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/03/27/man-charged-for-hunting-in-a-walmart-parking-lot/||title=Man Charged For Hunting In A Walmart Parking Lot|last=|first=|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
All firearm owners and users in Australia require a firearm's licence, but normally do not require a licence to hunt.  Most target species are feral or introduced species, and almost all native animals are protected.  Landowners may obtain a "Destruction Permit" to kill or remove native species when their numbers impact agriculture.  Hunting in New South Wales national parks requires a R-licence issued by the [[Game Council New South Wales|Game Council]], but (as of mid-2013) this situation has been suspended pending review. 
Professional hunters are issued what is sometimes referred to as a D-licence, but rather than being a hunting licence this is a category of firearms that includes semi-automatics and large capacity magazines.

== Canada ==

{{see also|Gun politics in Canada}}
Hunting regulation and licensing falls under both provincial/territorial and federal jurisdiction. The federal government is responsible for protecting [[Bird migration|migratory birds]] and nationally significant wildlife habitat, the regulation for [[endangered species]] and the international wildlife issues and treaties (i.e. [[CITES]]) for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/wildlife/ Wildlife BC]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Migratory Game Bird Hunting licence is issued by the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cws-scf.ec.gc.ca/legislations/stat_e.cfm Migratory Bird Hunting Permits for the 2008 Season]&lt;/ref&gt; an agency of [[Environment Canada]]. All other matters fall under the provincial/territorial jurisdiction.

The use of [[firearm]]s in hunting is also separated into provincial/territorial and federal jurisdiction. Whereas the [[Canadian Firearms Program]] will determine who is eligible for a [[Possession and Acquisition Licence]] and issuance of firearm registration certificates, it is the provincial/territorial government's responsibility to regulate when and how the firearms can be used in hunting animals.

In Québec hunter education and licensing is managed by the Fédération Québécoise de la Faune. Sécurité Nature, a program managed by the FQF, offers a variety of hunting education courses which allow residents to hunt legally after obtaining their licence and a permit at designated outlets (most hunting &amp; fishing stores, Canadian Tires, etc.) for a fee.

== Germany ==
A German hunting license is a certificate that grants its holder the exercise of hunting within legal ordinances. It is also the precondition to own hunting arms and ammunition (unlimited number of rifles/shotguns and up to two handguns). The actual right to exercise hunting in a specific area is entitled to the respective landowners (if they own an area of more than {{convert|0.75|km²|acre}}, otherwise all landowners of a municipality are integrated into an association) who may use their right for themselves or lease it. Depending on size and value of a hunting area a typical leasing rate may vary from about US$10–100 per acre per year. Additionally the lesse has to pay the landowner any damage by deers, wild hogs etc. The right to hunt is connected to the duty to care for all kind of animals listed by the hunting laws. For several species such as deers plans have to be developed by hunters and authorities, how many animals of a specified class and age may (or have to) be killed within a certain period of time. The purpose of the hunting license is to ensure that only well trained persons may exercise hunting. Applicants must fulfill the following requirements:

* Successful completion of a hunting exam,
* Certificate of a [[liability insurance]] for hunters,
* Personal trustworthiness (§ 5 [[Gun politics in Germany|German Weapons Act]]),
* Applicants must be at least 16 years for a Youth Hunting License, otherwise 18 years,
* Flawless [[Criminal record]].

The hunting exam is a test of expertise with a high failure rate. To pass it, each applicant has to participate in a comprehensive, difficult instruction course which consists largely of the areas shooting ([[shotgun]] and [[rifle]]), theory (esp. [[weapon]]ry, local [[wildlife]] and [[habitat]]) and practice.

In practice the German system of examination for deer hunters (stalkers) is very much in line with the English DMQ level DSC2. Over the last ten years or so European countries in general have made efforts to harmonise the previously fragmented rules and regulations with parallels being taken from the more difficult UK system.

== United States ==
{{USgunlegalbox}}

In the United States, regulation of hunting is primarily performed by state law; additional regulations are imposed through Federal [[environmental law]] regarding [[migratory birds]] (such as ducks and geese) and [[endangered species]]. 
[[File:USHuntingLicenses.png|thumb|A map of total hunting licenses purchased in the United States in 2017.]]
Like many licenses, a hunting license is considered a [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] granted by the [[government]], rather than a [[constitutional right]] under the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;See description of # of tag holders in N.Y. state: [http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dfwmr/license/slholders.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Driver's license]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, unprotected [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species are ''not'' subject to a hunting license. [[Vermin]] may be hunted without a license, or may even be the subject of a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] paid to the hunter.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Learning How to Shoot, ''or'' Is There a Gay NRA?, by Erik F. vonHausen, Diversity Rules!, May/June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Federal law, the [[Airborne Hunting Act]] (AHA), was passed in 1971 with the goal of eliminating [[aerial hunting]], that is, shooting wildlife from planes or helicopters.&lt;ref name=Aerial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenders.org/sites/default/files/publications/aerial_hunting_q_and_a.pdf|work=Defenders of Wildlife|title=Aerial Hunting FAQs |date=n.d.|author=Sandra Purohit|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State licenses ===
{{see also|Gun laws in the United States (by state)}}
Each state has different standards and [[Red tape|paperwork]] requirements for getting a hunting license.  These include the areas, time periods, [[harvesting]] techniques, distinctions between species, and a hunting [[safety]] course.

Licenses to hunt typically go on sale once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Ch. 9 News |date=2007-08-08 |url=http://www.capitalnews9.com/content/top%5Fstories/default.asp?ArID=218021 |title=2007–08 hunting licenses available Monday |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], allow only during a defined single season,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0701, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi], click on "ENV", then Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt; or for a lifetime during such seasons for residents of the state, upon payment of the appropriate fees.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0702, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi], click on "ENV", then Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a general rule, hunting licenses are non-transferable, are a privilege (not a right), and does not allow [[trespass]] on private land.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0703, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi], click on "ENV", then Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting [[Mammal|big game]] typically requires a '''tag''' for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery.  Tags may be further restricted to a specific area or '''wildlife management unit'''.

States with these "tags" include Alaska,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admin.adfg.state.ak.us/license/ |title=Alaska Online Licensing Home Page |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/licensing/ |title=California Dept. of fish and game |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myfwc.com/license/ |title=License and permit requirements |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgiawildlife.dnr.state.ga.us/content/displaycontent.asp?txtDocument=31 |title=Georgia DNR, How to get a hunting License |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnr.state.il.us/admin/systems/ |title=Illinois DNR, Online services |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/ |title=Louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/regs/4066.html |title=New York Department of Environmental Conservation, Section 1.18: Issuance and Use Of Deer Hunting Tags |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiodnr.com/wildlife/dow/regulations/vendor.aspx |title=Ohio DNR, Hunting Licensing |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www4.wildlifelicense.com/tn/ |title=TN DNR, Online licensing |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/ |title=Texas Parks and Wikdlife – Hunting &amp; wildlife |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgif.state.va.us/licenses/ |title=Virginia Hunting &amp; Fishing Licenses |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

49 of the 50 states require a prospective big game hunter take a several-hour course about safety, often termed '''sportsman education''' or "hunter's safety course" in the case of California.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0713 (3), found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi], click on "ENV".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hunter-ed.com/mktg/national_1.htm |title=Hunting Safety Courses and Exams |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[jurisdiction]]s also may limit getting a hunting license to adults or may grant a "[[Youth|junior]]" license for persons as young as twelve years of age.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., New York Environmental Conservation Law section 11-0703 (4), found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi], click on "ENV".&lt;/ref&gt;

Several United States and Canadian provinces have joined in an [[Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact]] (IWVC) to control [[Interstate commerce|interstate]] hunting and to punish violators of differing laws.

=== Federal licenses ===

Federal law requires the purchase of a [[duck stamp]] in order to shoot migratory ducks.   They are regulated by the U.S. [[Fish and Wildlife Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/ |title=The Federal duck stamps program |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law also mandates strict limits on the hunting ("taking") of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;Endangered Species Act of 1973, [[Title 16 of the United States Code]], §§ 1531-1544&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531- |title=US CODE: Title 16, 1531 |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller description of the [[Endangered Species Act]], see that article, or [this portal: http://www.llrx.com/features/esa.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. is a signatory to the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/species/species_accounts/bio_tige.html |title=Tiger, (Panthera tigris) |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush Administration proposed lifting some restrictions in 2005 (for [[antelope]]s), as did the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Government (for [[Wolf|wolves]]) in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-01-22 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg18524832.900 |title=Permission given to hunt endangered wolves |accessdate=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exemptions ===
Both Federal and state laws exempt the following:

# Pest species, as noted above, such as rodents. There is a false [[urban legend]] that a hunting license is required to trap mice.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara and David Mikkelson, "Trapping License", at [http://www.snopes.com/legal/mousetrap.asp Snopes.com website].  Accessed March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] based on Native American treaties; some states require residency on a [[Native American reservation]].&lt;ref name="New York Free"&gt;See [http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6094.html Hunting Licenses: Free Licenses] and [http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/wildlife_pdf/reslicapp.pdf NEW YORK STATE DEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION: RESIDENT SPORTING LICENSE APPLICATION].  Both retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Menominee Tribe v. United States]]'' that Congress must affirmatively take away Native Americans' hunting rights; otherwise, Native Americans are [[Legal presumption|presumed]] to have such rights and do not required hunting licenses.
# Specific statutes, such as the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] and eagle feather laws (see below).
# [[Alaskan Native]]s.
# Active service members of the military, who often get free licenses.&lt;ref name="New York Free" /&gt;
# The [[Blindness|blind]].&lt;ref name="New York Free" /&gt;
# Sport hunting for targets.
# Youth are usually exempt from paying for a hunting or fishing license, but this varies by state from those under 12 years old to those under 16 years of age.&lt;ref name=Toth /&gt;

=== Eagle Feather Law ===
The [[Eagle feather law]], (Title 50 Part 22 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), stipulates that only individuals of certifiable [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain [[eagle]] feathers for [[religious]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] use. American Indians and non-American Indians frequently contest the value and validity of the Eagle feather law, charging that the law is laden with discriminatory racial preferences and infringes on [[tribal sovereignty]]. Their arguments include that the law does not allow American Indians to give eagle feathers to non-American Indians, a common modern and traditional practice. (Many non-American Indians have been adopted into American Indian families, made tribal members, and given eagle feathers.)

===Challenges regarding the Second Amendment===
Some hunters have challenged hunting licenses, as being in violation of the [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]] as guaranteed by [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]; the [[Supreme Court of the US]] in February 2008, heard arguments on the proper [[standard of review]] for gun laws or regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Biskupic]], ''Do you have a legal right to own a gun?'', ''[[USA Today]]'', February 27, 2008, p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''District of Columbia v. Heller'', 554 U.S. ___ (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court declined to examine the broader issues, leaving state hunting licenses valid and in force.

The current law is unclear at to what standard of review would apply, but the [[rational basis]] or [[arbitrary and capricious]] tests are the most likely standards.  Under either standard, most hunting license regimes in the United States would likely pass muster, due to the need to conserve natural resources, to enforce the police power, and to raise revenue, all valid purposes of such laws.

===Public policy arguments===
Most major conservation organizations in the US favor the continued legality and regulation of hunting, including [[Ducks Unlimited]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssf.org/hunting/orgs.cfm|work=national Shooting Sports Foundation|title=Hunters and Conservation|date=n.d.|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Defenders of Wildlife]],&lt;ref name=Aerial /&gt; [[National Audubon Society]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;The WWF website states: "World Wildlife Fund, for example, does not oppose gun hunting or trapping by indigenous people to meet their basic needs. We do insist that hunting and trapping be regulated so that the survival of any species does not become threatened. The decision to allow trophy hunting is a sovereign one made entirely by the government concerned. We vigorously oppose any hunting or trapping activities which violate international, national, or state law."{{cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/53/~/guns-and-hunting|work=World Wildlife Fund|title=Guns and Hunting|date=November 4, 2009|author=Sandra Purohit|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also support licenses for regulated hunting of wildlife.

The [[Sierra Club]] supports hunting licenses, but there has been tension in the group for two decades between those who want to ally with hunters and to regulate them, and those opposed to hunting altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/199609/allies.asp|work=Sierra magazine|title=Natural Allies: If only hunters, anglers, and environmentalists would stop taking potshots at each other, they'd be an invincible force for wildlands protection.|last=Williams|first=Ted|date=September–October 1996 |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200107/bass.asp |work=Sierra magazine|title=Why I Hunt: Stalking wild game in a rugged landscape brings one environmentalist closer to nature.|last=Bass|first=Rick|date=July–August 2001 |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200111/letters.asp |work=Sierra magazine|title= LETTERS (to the Editor)|authors=various|date=November–December 2001|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/layoftheland/2013/01/making-sage-grouse-part-of-our-wildlife-restoration-success-stories.html |work=Sierra Club's Lay of the Land (blog)|title=Making Sage Grouse Part of Our Wildlife Restoration Success Stories|last=Semcer|first=Catherine|date=January 28, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Humane Association]] and the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] are opposed to hunting, and would ban the practice rather than regulating it.

'''indecs'''&lt;ref&gt;http://cordis.europa.eu/econtent/mmrcs/indecs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (an acronym of "[[interoperability]] of data in [[e-commerce]] systems"; written in lower case) was a project partly funded by the [[European Community]] ''Info 2000'' initiative and by several organisations representing the music, rights, text publishing, authors, library and other sectors in 1998-2000, which has since been used in a number of [[metadata]] activities.  A final report and related documents were published; the indecs Metadata Framework document&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doi.org/topics/indecs/indecs_framework_2000.pdf "Principles, model and data dictionary"&lt;/ref&gt; is a concise summary.

indecs provided an analysis of the requirements for metadata for e-commerce of [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] ([[intellectual property]]) in the network environment, focusing on [[semantic interoperability]].  Semantic interoperability deals with the question of how one computer system knows what the terms from another computer system mean (e.g. if A says "owner" and B says "owner", are they referring to the same thing?  If A says "released" and B says "disseminated", do they mean different things?).

indecs was built from a simple generic model of commerce (the "model of making"): a model of the [[Product life cycle management|life cycle]] of any kind of content from conception to the final physical or [[digital copies]].   The top-level model is summarised as  "people make stuff; people use stuff; and (for commerce to take place) people make deals about the stuff".  If secure machine-to-machine management of [[commerce]] is to be possible, the stuff, the people and the deals must all be securely identified and described in standardised ways that machines can interpret and use.  Central to the analysis is the assumption that it is possible to produce a generic mechanism to handle complex metadata for all different types of content. So, for example, instead of treating sound carriers, books, videos and photographs as fundamentally different things with different (if similar) characteristics, they are all recognised as creations with different values of the same higher-level attributes, whose metadata can be supported in a common environment.

==Framework==

The indecs analysis supports interoperability of at least five different types:

* Across [[Media (communication)|media]] (such as books, serials, audio, [[audiovisual]], software, abstract works, visual material).
* Across functions (such as [[cataloging]], discovery, workflow and [[rights management]]).
* Across levels of metadata (from simple to complex).
* Across semantic barriers. 
* Across [[linguistic barrier]]s.

The indecs project developed a framework, described in detail in the final project documents, within which such interoperability could be achieved.   indecs proposed four principles as key to the management of identification:

* ''The principle of Unique Identification:'' every entity should be [[unique identifier|uniquely identified]] within an identified namespace.
* ''The principle of Functional Granularity:'' it should be possible to identify an entity whenever it needs to be distinguished
* ''The principle of Designated Authority:'' the author of an item of metadata should be securely identified.
* ''The principle of Appropriate Access:'' everyone requires access to the metadata on which they depend, and privacy and confidentiality for their own metadata from those who are not dependent on it.

indecs also produced a definition of metadata:
* An item of metadata is a [[semantic relationship|relationship]] that someone claims to exist between two referents (entities).

The indecs framework stresses the significance of relationships, which lie at the heart of the indecs analysis. It underlines the importance of unique identification of all entities (since otherwise expressing relationships between them is of little practical utility). Finally, it raises the question of authority: the identification of the person making the claim is as significant as the identification of any other entity.

(Note: describing metadata as linking two referents may seem unusual: the point is that an unambiguous piece of metadata has to relate to precise enough things - referents - at each end of the link (e.g. my CAR is GREEN) to make a useful statement. "Precise enough" is contextual.  "Green" might be a perfectly precise enough referent if the namespace it's coming from (where we are referring to, and the application we are interested in) is dealing with "what colour is your car: green, red, blue, black, or white...?"; but not if it's intended to describe precisely a green colour to a garage to respray your car following an accident, when you would need to say e.g. "Ford Colour ref 3456/2009 Metallic Green".)

The underlying assumptions or axioms of the indecs approach are (1) Metadata is critical; (2) Stuff is complex; (3): Metadata is modular; and (4) Transactions need automation.

== Use ==

The indecs Framework does not presuppose any specific business model or legal framework; it can be used to describe transactions of copyrighted, open source, or freely available material.

The framework has been developed further as a generic [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]-based approach dealing with defined types of entity and attribute, and the relators that link them within a contextual model structure (where context is defined as an intersection of ''time'' and ''place'', in which ''entities'' may play roles).  Its main use to date has been in applications of commercial transactions of content and in some library-related applications.  Examples of applications using this approach include:
* [https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2007-dunsire RDA/ONIX Framework for Resource Categorization]
* [http://iso21000-6.net ISO/IEC 21000-6]] ([[MPEG]]) Rights Data Dictionary (RDD)
* [http://www.ddex.net DDEX (Digital Data Exchange)] Music industry messaging and data dictionary applications
* [http://www.editeur.org/onix.html ONIX] ([[Online Information Exchange]]) standards for the use of publishers in distributing digital metadata about their products
* [http://www.doi.org/ DOI] [[Digital Object Identifier]] System metadata schemes

One of the deliverables of the indecs project was a specification for a Directory of Parties.  This led to a subsequent project, Interparty,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interparty.org&lt;/ref&gt; funded under the European Commission's Information Society Technologies Programme, to design and specify a network to support interoperability of party identification (for both natural and corporate names) across different domains, building on the indecs principles. InterParty was not proposed as a replacement for existing schemes for the identification of participants in the intellectual property domain (e.g. national library name authority files or systems oriented towards the needs of rights licensing) but as a means of effecting their interoperation. Some of its conclusions have been used elsewhere, e.g. in the work on the proposed ISO ISNI&lt;ref&gt;http://isni.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (International Standard Name Identifier).

Other developments are continuing, notably through the OntologyX semantic engineering tools and services from [http://www.rightscom.com Rightscom].  The approach also has much in common with the [http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/index.html CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)], an ontology for cultural heritage information, and the [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] (FRBR) model in the library world.

In June 2009 a new initiative, the [http://cdlr.strath.ac.uk/VMF/ Vocabulary Mapping Framework (VMF)], was announced by a consortium of partners.   Funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/vocab-framework.aspx JISC], in Nov 2009 this delivered (as the first phase of an ongoing program of work) an extensive and authoritative mapping of vocabularies from nine major content [[metadata standards]], creating a downloadable tool to support interoperability across communities.  The mapping is also extensible to other standards.   The work builds on the principles of interoperability established in the indecs Content Model, and is an expansion of the existing [https://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2007-dunsire RDA/ONIX Framework for Resource Categorization] into a comprehensive vocabulary of resource relators and categories, which will be a superset of those used in major standards from the publisher/producer, education and bibliographic/heritage communities.  The [[International DOI Foundation]], which fully endorses this work, is to provide a web hosting facility for the Framework as part of its commitment to promoting the wider use of interoperable metadata, and will use the vocabulary mapping wherever possible to support the association of metadata with DOI names &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.org/news/DOINewsJun09.html#1''DOI News: Launch of “Vocabulary Mapping Framework”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual property rights ==

Indecs uses one common underlying structure which may be considered in three views: the general view; the commerce view; and the intellectual property (legal) view. An intellectual property right is a legal concept, with terms defined in a series of international conventions and treaties and under national law.  The precise characteristics by which recognition of intellectual property rights is secured are elusive and are settled by editorial, commercial or, ultimately, by a legal judgement.  Indecs does not attempt to replace such legal considerations, though a specific set of legal elements might be included in an indecs-based structure, and the indecs framework specifically includes some definitions from major international treaties such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] and the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

== Mapping of terms ==

Different models of the life cycle of content may have important differences, not least in the specific meaning attached to the names of terms they employ. FRBR, indecs and CRM were each informed by different functional requirements, and so evolved different mechanisms for dealing with the issues that seemed most important to them. Each is a particular view on the "universe of discourse" of resources and relationships: there are many valid views.  Broadly, they are compatible, and effective integration of metadata from schemes based on them should be achievable, but they must be handled with care.  As an example: the terms abstraction, manifestation, item and expression are often used in considering content life cycles (e.g. a [[sound recording]] is the expression of a musical work during a recording session at a particular place and time, and is distinct from, say, the master tape made, which is a manifestation).  These were dealt with in indecs, but may have slightly different meanings in other schemes. Such an analysis of meaning of a term from a scheme is possible in indecs by mapping the precise definitions into further terms with precise definitions within the framework. indecs and other frameworks based on it continue to be developed and refined through the process of implementation.

'''Jack M. Balkin''' (born August 13, 1956) is an American legal scholar. He is the Knight Professor of [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] [[Law]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] at [[Yale Law School]]. Balkin is the founder and director of the [[Yale Information Society Project]] (ISP), a research center whose mission is "to study the implications of the Internet, telecommunications, and the new information technologies for law and society." He also directs the Knight Law and Media Program&lt;ref&gt;The Knight Law and Media Program at Yale Law School, {{cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/lawandmediaprogram.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814133138/http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/lawandmediaprogram.htm |archivedate=2012-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Abrams Institute for Free Expression at Yale Law School.&lt;ref&gt;The Floyd Abrams Institute for Free Expression, {{cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/14038.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819141346/http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/14038.htm |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balkin publishes the legal [[weblog|blog]], [[Balkinization (Blog)|Balkinization]], and is also a correspondent for ''[[The Atlantic]]''. He is a leading scholar of [[Constitutional law|Constitutional]] and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] law. In addition to his work as a legal scholar, he has also written a book on [[meme]]s and [[cultural evolution]] and has translated and written a commentary on the ancient Chinese Book of Changes, or [[I Ching]].

==Education and early career==

Born in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]], Balkin received his A.B. and [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degrees from [[Harvard University]] and his [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy from the [[University of Cambridge]]. He clerked for Judge [[Carolyn Dineen King]] of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. From 1982 to 1984 he was a litigation associate at the New York law firm of [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]]. He taught at the University of Missouri at Kansas City from 1984 to 1988 and at the University of Texas from 1988 to 1994. He joined the Yale faculty in 1994. He has also taught at [[Harvard University]], [[New York University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] at the [[University of London]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memetics, ideology, and transcendence==

Balkin's 1998 book, ''Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology'', argued that ideology could be explained in terms of [[meme]]s and processes of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Software'', p. 14, 42-45&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that ideology is an effect of the "cultural software" or tools of understanding that become part of human beings and that are produced through the evolution and transmission of memes. At the same time, Balkin argued that all ideological and moral analysis presupposes a transcendent ideal of truth and "a transcendent value of justice."&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Software'', p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[T. K. Seung]], he suggests that a transcendent idea of justice—although incapable of perfect realization and inevitably "indeterminate"—underlies political discourse and political persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Software'', p. 144. See Seung's ''Intuition and Construction: The Foundation of Normative Theory'', pp. 194–99 and ''Plato Rediscovered: Human Value and Social Order'', pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideological drift and legal semiotics==

Balkin coined the term ''ideological drift'' to describe a phenomenon by which ideas and concepts change their political valence as they are introduced into new social and political contexts over time. Along with [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]], Balkin developed the field of legal [[semiotics]]. Legal semiotics shows how legal arguments feature recurrent tropes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/topics1.htm "A Night in the Topics: The Reason of Legal Rhetoric and the Rhetoric of Legal Reason," in Law's Stories: Narrative and Rhetoric in the Law 211-224 (P. Brooks and P. Gewirth, eds., Yale Univ. Press, 1996)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614173018/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/topics1.htm |date=2006-06-14 }}. Available at {{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/topics1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614173018/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/topics1.htm |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Inventio#Topoi|topoi]] that respond to each other and whose opposition is reproduced at higher and lower levels of doctrinal detail as legal doctrines evolve. Hence Balkin claimed that legal argument has a self-similar "crystalline"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/crystal.pdf The Crystalline Structure of Legal Thought, 39 Rutgers L. Rev. 1 (1986)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923172102/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/crystal.pdf |date=2002-09-23 }}. Available at {{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/crystal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020923172102/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/jbalkin/articles/crystal.pdf |archivedate=2002-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fractal]] structure. Balkin employed [[deconstruction]] and related literary theories to argue that legal thought was structured in terms of "nested oppositions"—opposed ideas or concepts that turn into each other over time or otherwise depend on each other in novel and unexpected ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=842284 Deconstruction's Legal Career, 27 Cardozo Law Review 719 (2005)]. Available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=842284 (November 13, 2005); Deconstructive Practice and Legal Theory, 96 Yale L.J. 743 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Although he draws on literary theory in his work on legal rhetoric, Balkin and his frequent co-author [[Sanford Levinson]] contend law is best analogized not to literature but to the performing arts such as music and drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2240496 Balkin, Verdi's High C, __ Tex. L. Rev. __ (2013)]. Available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2240496 ; Balkin and Levinson, Interpreting Law and Music: Performance Notes on "The Banjo Serenader" and "The Lying Crowd of Jews," 20 Cardozo L. Rev. 1513 (1999); Balkin and Levinson, Law, Music, and Other Performing Arts, 139 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1597 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partisan entrenchment==

Balkin and Levinson argue that constitutional revolutions in judicial doctrine occur through a process called ''partisan entrenchment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930514 The Processes of Constitutional Change: From Partisan Entrenchment to the National Surveillance State, 75 Fordham Law Review 489 (2006)]. Available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930514 (September 17, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The party that controls the White House can stock the federal courts with new judges and Justices who have views on key constitutional issues roughly similar to those of the President. This shifts the median Justice on the Supreme Court and changes the complexion of the lower federal courts, which, in turn, eventually affects constitutional doctrine. If enough new judges are appointed in a relatively short period of time, changes will occur more quickly, producing a constitutional revolution. For example, a constitutional revolution occurred following the [[New deal|New Deal]] because [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] was able to appoint eight new Supreme Court Justices between 1937 and 1941. Balkin and Levinson's theory contrasts with [[Bruce Ackerman|Bruce Ackerman's ]] theory of constitutional moments, which argues that constitutional revolutions occur because of self-conscious acts of democratic mobilization that establish new standards of political legitimacy. Balkin and Levinson view partisan entrenchment as roughly but imperfectly democratic; it guarantees neither legitimate nor correct constitutional interpretation.

==Constitutional interpretation==

Balkin's constitutional theory, developed in his 2011 book, ''Living Originalism'', is both [[Originalism|originalist]] and [[Living Constitution|living constitutionalist]]. He argues that there is no contradiction between these approaches, properly understood. Interpreters must follow the original meaning of the constitutional text but not its original expected application; hence much constitutional interpretation actually involves constitutional construction and state building by all three branches of government. Balkin's "framework originalism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1290869 Framework Originalism and the Living Constitution,103 Nw. L. Rev. 549 (2009)]. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1290869  (October 23, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; views the Constitution as an initial framework for governance that sets politics in motion and makes politics possible; it must be filled out over time through constitutional construction and state building. This process of building out the Constitution is living constitutionalism.

==Freedom of Speech and Democratic culture==

Balkin's work on the First Amendment argues that the purpose of the free speech principle is to promote what he calls a democratic culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=470842 Digital Speech and Democratic Culture, 79 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1 (2004)]. Available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=470842 (December 3, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2676027 Cultural Democracy and the First Amendment, 110 Nw. L. Rev. 1053 (2016)]. Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2676027 (October 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of democratic culture is broader than a concern with democratic deliberation or democratic self-government, and emphasizes individual freedom, cultural participation and mutual influence. A democratic culture is one in which ordinary individuals can participate in the forms of culture that in turn help shape and constitute them as persons. Balkin argues that free speech on the Internet is characterized by two features: "routing around" media gatekeepers, and "glomming on"—non-exclusive appropriation of cultural content that is melded with other sources to create new forms of culture. These distinctive features of Internet speech, he argues, are actually features of speech in general and thus lead to a focus on democratic participation in culture.

Balkin argues that protection of freedom of speech in the digital age will increasingly rely less on judge-made doctrines of the First Amendment and more on legislation, administrative regulation, and technological design.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1335055 The Future of Free Expression in a Digital Age, 36 Pepperdine L. Rev. 427 (2008-2009)]. Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1335055 (January 29, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we have moved beyond the traditional dyadic model of free expression in which nation states regulated the speech of their citizens. Instead, digital speech involves a [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist model]]. In the pluralist model, territorial governments continue to regulate speech directly. But they also attempt to coerce or co-opt owners of digital infrastructure to regulate the speech of others. This is "new school" speech regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2377526 Old School/New School Speech Regulation,  127 Harv. L. Rev. 2296 (2014)]. Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2377526 (January 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Digital infrastructure owners, and especially social media companies, now act as private governors of speech communities, creating and enforcing various rules and norms of the communities they govern. Finally, end users, civil society organizations, hackers, and other private actors repeatedly put pressure on digital infrastructure companies to regulate speech in certain ways and not to regulate it in others. This triangular tug of war—rather than the traditional dyadic model of states regulating the speech of private parties—characterizes the practical ability to speak in the algorithmic society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3038939 Free Speech in the Algorithmic Society, 51 U.C. Davis L. Rev. __ (forthcoming 2018)]. Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3038939 (September 20, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The National Surveillance State==

In a 2006 essay with Levinson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930514 The Processes of Constitutional Change: From Partisan Entrenchment to the National Surveillance State, 75 Fordham Law Review 489(2006)]. Available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=930514 (September 17, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2008 article,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1141524 The Constitution in the National Surveillance State 93 Minnesota Law Review 1 (2008)]. Available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1141524 (June 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Balkin discusses the emergence of a "National Surveillance State" that uses the collection, collation and analysis of information to govern. The National Surveillance State is a natural byproduct of technological development and demands for government services. Balkin argues that "[t]he question is not whether we will have a surveillance state in the years to come, but what sort of surveillance state we will have."&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution in the National Surveillance State, at 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Balkin distinguishes between two models: an authoritarian information state and a democratic information state. Authoritarian information states are information misers and information gluttons: they collect as much information as possible and they resist sharing it or making their own operations public. Democratic information states are information gourmets and information philanthropists: they collect only what they need, they produce information for and share information with their citizens and they make their own operations democratically accountable. Democratic information states also destroy government collected information when it is no longer necessary. In practice, much privacy protection came from the fact that people forgot what had happened. But in the digital age, nothing is ever forgotten, so appropriate discarding of the results of government surveillance must be mandated.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Konczal, Is a democratic surveillance state possible?, Washington Post, June 8, 2013, at https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/08/is-a-democratic-surveillance-state-possible/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman: Government Tilting Towards 'Authoritarian Surveillance' State, ABC News, June 9, 2013, at http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/06/paul-krugman-government-tilting-towards-authoritarian-surveillance-state/&lt;/ref&gt;

As the surveillance state grows, Balkin argues, new civil liberties protections are necessary, just as they were necessary with the growth of the administrative state after the New Deal and the National Security State after World War II. The executive branch must be redesigned with internal checks and balances to police itself, to report on its activities, and to prevent abuse. Finally, technology must be used to record what officials do and look for signs of government misconduct: "The best way to control the watchers is to watch them as well."&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution in the National Surveillance State, at p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information fiduciaries, robotics, and artificial intelligence==

Balkin coined the term "information fiduciary" to describe the legal and ethical obligations of digital businesses and social media companies.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Balkin, "Information Fiduciaries in the Digital Age, Balkinization, March 5th, 2014, at https://balkin.blogspot.com/2014/03/information-fiduciaries-in-digital-age.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2675270 Information Fiduciaries and the First Amendment 49 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1183 (2016)]. Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2675270 (October 18, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that people must trust and depend on certain digital businesses and social media companies, and are especially vulnerable to them. Therefore the digital age has produced a new kind of [[fiduciary]] obligation analogous to those the law imposes on money managers and on professionals like doctors, lawyers, and accountants.

Balkin argues that digital information fiduciaries must act in a trusthworthy fashion toward their end-users. They must respect end-user privacy and may not manipulate end-users. Those who develop and employ robots, artificial intelligence agents, and algorithms may also be information fiduciaries toward their customers and end-users. In addition, firms may not engage in "algorithmic nuisance": using people's digital identities to discriminate and manipulate them and shifting the costs of algorithmic decisionmaking onto the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2890965 The Three Laws of Robotics in the Age of Big Data 78 Ohio St. L. Rev. __ (forthcoming 2018)]. Available at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2890965 (December 29, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Balkin argues that the obligations of information fiduciaries and the duty not to be algorithmic nuislances are part of new [[Laws of Robotics|laws of robotics]]. Unlike Asimov's famous [[Three Laws of Robotics|three laws of robotics]], these laws are directed not to robots but to the people and organizations who design, own, and operate them. Balkin argues that robotic and artificial intelligence technologies mediate relationships of power between different groups of people; therefore law must focus on regulating the people, firms, and social groups who use robots and artificial intelligence as much as on the technologies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nKNAa1R4H4 Jack Balkin on Robots, Algorithms, and Big Data].

'''James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, 1st Duke of Buccleuch''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (9 April 1649 – 15 July 1685) was a Dutch-born English nobleman. Originally called '''James Crofts''' or '''James Fitzroy''', he was born in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]], the eldest [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] son of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], and his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Lucy Walter]].

He served in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and commanded English troops taking part in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] before commanding the Anglo-Dutch brigade fighting in the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. In 1685 he led the unsuccessful [[Monmouth Rebellion]], an attempt to depose his uncle, King [[James II of England|James II and VII]]. After one of his officers declared Monmouth the legitimate King in the town of Taunton in Somerset, Monmouth attempted to capitalise on his position as the son of Charles II, and his [[Protestantism]], in opposition to James, who was a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]. The rebellion failed, and Monmouth was [[beheading|beheaded]] for treason on 15 July 1685.

==Biography==

===Parentage and early life===
Born in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]], to [[Lucy Walter]], and her lover, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (who was living in continental exile following his father's execution), James spent his early life in [[Schiedam]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|last=Harris |first=Tim |date=October 2009 |origyear=2004 |id=24879 |title=Scott [Crofts], James, duke of Monmouth and first duke of Buccleuch (1649–1685) |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographical research by Hugh Noel Williams (1870–1925), Charles had not arrived at [[The Hague]] until the middle of September 1648 – seven months before the child's birth (but he met Lucy for the first time nine months before) — and some unfounded voices whispered that Lucy Walter had in the summer of 1648 been [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of Colonel Robert Sidney, a younger son of the [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; When the child grew to manhood, contemporaries observed that he bore a strong resemblance to Sidney.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; The unfounded voices had probably originated from the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], brother of King Charles II, who was afraid of his nephew's potential claim to the throne.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Finally, in 2012, a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]] conducted on Monmouth's descendant, the [[Richard Scott, 10th Duke of Buccleuch|10th Duke of Buccleuch]], showed that he shared the same [[Y chromosome]] (inherited from father-to-son) as a distant Stuart cousin, providing strong evidence that Charles II was Monmouth's biological father after all.&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news|work=The Scotsman|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/scotland-s-dna-descended-from-lost-tribes-and-related-to-napoleon-1-2238030|title=Scotland's DNA: Descended from lost tribes…and related to Napoleon|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a younger sister [[Mary Crofts]], who may also have been a daughter of Charles although [[Theobald Taaffe, 1st Earl of Carlingford]] is considered another potential father. Mary married the Irishman [[William Sarsfield (died 1675)|William Sarsfield]] and was a sister-in-law of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] general [[Patrick Sarsfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZNO3WVTokk0C&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=%22mary+crofts%22+sarsfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LI-Dl8u24X&amp;sig=pr2uO37tvd98Kl6VNCeUiWpCEno&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMIvKjp7aDFyAIVCZgaCh2D8gEm#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mary%20crofts%22%20sarsfield&amp;f=false|title=The Family Forest Descendants of Lady Joan Beaufort|page=532|publisher=Milisecond Publishing|first=Bruce|last=Harrison|year=2005|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] son, James was not eligible to succeed to the English or Scottish thrones, though there were rumours that Charles and Lucy did marry secretly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WALT-LUC-1630.html |title=Lucy Walter|publisher=Welsh Biography Online|date= |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monmouth later himself always claimed his parents were married and that he possessed their marriage lines, but he never produced them.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dcs.hull.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gedlkup/n=royal?royal05871|title=Scott, James Crofts, Duke of Monmouth|publisher=University of Hull|accessdate=13 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles, as King, later testified in writing to his Council that he had never been married to anyone except his queen, [[Catherine of Braganza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.south-central-media.co.uk/lit_home/sts/sts-17c/sts-17c.htm|title=Setting the Scene in Wessex: the 17th Century in Literature and Drama|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1658, young James was kidnapped by one of the King's men, sent to Paris, and placed in the care of the [[Crofts baronets]], whose surname he took. He briefly attended a school in [[Familly]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:James Scott, Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch by Jan van Wyck.jpg|250px|right|thumb|James Scott commanding the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War|English against the Dutch]] in 1672, by [[Jan Wyck]]]]
On 14 February 1663, at the age of 13, shortly after having been brought to England, James was created '''Duke of Monmouth''', with the subsidiary titles of '''Earl of Doncaster''' and '''Baron Scott of Tynedale''', all three in the [[Peerage of England]], and on 28 March 1663 he was appointed a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brydges|first=Sir Egerton|title=Collins's Peerage of England; Genealogical, Biographical and Historical|publisher=F.C. and J.

On 20 April 1663, just days after his 14th birthday, he was married to the heiress [[Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch|Anne Scott, 4th Countess of Buccleuch]]. James took his wife's surname upon marriage.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt; The day after his marriage, the couple were made [[Duke of Buccleuch|Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch]], Earl and Countess of Dalkeith, and Lord and Lady Scott of Whitchester and Eskdale in the [[Peerage of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="burkes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Bernard|title=Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire|date=1914|publisher=Burke's Peerage Limited|location=London|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monmouth, as he became known, was popular, particularly since he was a [[Protestant]], whereas the official heir presumptive to the throne, the King's brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], had openly converted to Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1665, at the age of 16, Monmouth served in the [[Royal Navy|English fleet]] under his uncle the Duke of York in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In June 1666, he returned to England to become captain of a troop of cavalry.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; On 16 September 1668 he was made colonel of the [[1st Troop of Horse Guards|His Majesty's Own Troop of Horse Guards]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He acquired [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]] in Hertfordshire in April 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-m/moor-park.htm |title=Moor Park |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212221920/http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-m/moor-park.htm |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, a brigade of 6,000 English and Scottish troops was sent to serve as part of the French army (in return for money paid to King Charles), with Monmouth as its commander.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He became [[Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire]] and [[List of Governors of Kingston-upon-Hull|Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull]] in April 1673.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In the campaign of 1673 and in particular at the [[Siege of Maastricht]] in June 1673, Monmouth gained a considerable reputation as one of Britain's finest soldiers.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He was reported to be replacing [[Marshal Schomberg]] as commander of England's [[Zealand Expedition]], but this did not happen.&lt;ref&gt;Watson p.67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1674 Monmouth became [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor of Cambridge University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MNMT663J|name=Monmouth, James, Duke of Monmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List of Masters of the Horse|Master of the Horse]], and King Charles II directed that all military orders should be brought first to Monmouth for examination, so giving him effective command of the forces; his responsibilities included the movement of troops and the suppression of riots.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In March 1677 he also became [[Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

===Claim to the Crown===

[[File:Monmouth's Execution.gif|250px|thumb|Monmouth's execution on [[Tower Hill]], 15 July 1685 (O.S), in a popular print]]
In 1678 Monmouth was commander of the Anglo-Dutch brigade, now fighting for the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] against the French, and he distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1678)|Battle of St Denis]] in August 1678 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], further increasing his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=1328|page=1|date=8 August 1678}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, after his return to Britain, he commanded the small army raised to put down the rebellion of the Scottish [[Covenanter]]s and despite being heavily outnumbered, he decisively defeated the (admittedly poorly equipped) Covenanter rebels at the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]] on 22 June 1679.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; It was at  about this time that he was first seriously  proposed as the rightful  heir to the Crown, despite the obvious problem of his  illegitimacy, and his father's  refusal to acknowledge that he  had  married Lucy Walter. Monmouth may have come to  sincerely believe that his parents had been married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flantzer|first=Susan|title=James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, illegitimate son of King Charles II of England|url=http://www.unofficialroyalty.com/april-9-1649-birth-of-james-scott-1st-duke-of-monmouth-illegitimate-son-of-king-charles-ii-of-england/|date=|publisher=Unofficial Royalty|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellion===
{{main|Monmouth Rebellion}}

As his popularity with the masses increased Monmouth was obliged to go into exile in the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in September 1679.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Following the discovery of the so-called [[Rye House Plot]] in 1683,  which aimed  to assassinate  both Charles II and his brother  James, Monmouth, who had been encouraged by his supporters to assert his right to the throne, was identified as a conspirator.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=1848|page=2|date=2 August 1683}}&lt;/ref&gt; On King Charles II's death in February 1685 Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion, landing with three ships at [[Lyme Regis]] in Dorset in early June 1685 in an attempt to take the throne from his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=2042|page=1|date=11 June 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a "Declaration for the defence and vindication of the protestant religion and of the laws, rights and priviledges of England from the invasion made upon them, and for delivering the Kingdom from the usurpation and tyranny of us by the name of James, Duke of York": King [[James II of England|James II and VII]] responded by issuing an order for the publishers and distributors of the paper to be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=2043|page=1|date=15 June 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monmouth declared himself King at various places along the route including [[Axminster]], [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessex.me.uk/chardpics.htm|title=King Crowned in Chard|publisher=Chard Tourist Guide|date=26 June 2005|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilminster]] and [[Taunton]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; On 6 July 1685 the two armies met at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]], the last clear-cut [[pitched battle]] on open ground between two military forces fought on English soil: Monmouth's makeshift force could not compete with the regular army, and was soundly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=2049|page=1|date=6 July 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture===
On 8 July 1685 Monmouth was captured and arrested near [[Ringwood]] in Hampshire, &lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=2050|page=1|date=9 July 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; by tradition "in a field of peas". The events surrounding his capture are recorded in detail in ''Tait's Edinburgh Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tait's Edinburgh Magazine'', Volume 12, January 1845, p.57,ed. William Tait, Christian Isobel Johnstone[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9eERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=monmouth+field+of+peas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aGpNvWcZ6r&amp;sig=nnBcpThmjenr7_Bz8KKM-463uZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN2rzatPHQAhUrCsAKHZ7kD-8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=monmouth%20field%20of%20peas&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the battle a reward of £5,000 was offered for his capture.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;Roberts, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Upon the 7th, about five in the morning, some of the Lord Lumley's said scouts riding in the road near Holt Lodge in Dorset, four miles west of Ringwood in Hampshire, just at the turn of a cross way, surprised and seized two suspected persons, which, when the Lord Lumley came up, proved to be Lord Grey and Hollyday the guide. Lord Lumley now commenced a strict examination of the cottages scattered thickly over this heathy country, and called those to assist him who were acquainted with the locality. Sir William Portman was informed of the capture that had been made, and hastened to the spot, with as many of his horse and foot as he could suddenly get together. As Lord Lumley was making inquiries of the cottagers, a poor woman, Amy Farrant, directed him to a hedge, over which she had seen two men go. This hedge proved to be part of the outbounds of several enclosed fields, some overgrown with fern and brakes, and others sown with rye, peas, and oats. The assembled militia were placed around these outbounds, at short distances from each other, while horse and foot performed their assigned duty — that of beating about within".&lt;ref&gt;"Official account published by command", quoted in ''Tait's Edinburgh Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Duke had left his horse at Woodyates Inn, he exchanged clothes with a shepherd, who was soon discovered by local loyalists and interrogated. Dogs were then put onto the Duke's scent. Monmouth dropped his gold snuff-box, full of gold pieces, in a pea-field, where it was afterwards found. From Woodyates Inn the Duke had gone to Shag's Heath, in the middle of which was  a cluster of small farms, called the "Island". Amy Farrant gave information that the fugitives were concealed within the Island. The Duke, accompanied by Busse and Brandenburgher, remained concealed all day, with soldiers surrounding the area and threatening to set fire to the woodland. Brandenburgher deserted him at 1 am, and was later captured and interrogated, and is believed to have given away the Duke's hiding place. The spot was at the north-eastern extremity of the Island, now known as Monmouth's Close, in the manor of Woodlands, the property of the Earl of Shaftesbury. At about 7 am Henry Parkin, a militia-soldier and servant of Samuel Rolle, discovered the brown skirt of Monmouth's coat as he lay hidden in a ditch covered with fern and brambles under an ash tree, and called for help. The Duke was seized. Bystanders shouted out "Shoot him! shoot him!", but Sir William Portman happening to be near the spot, immediately rode up, and laid hands on him as his prisoner. Amy Farrant's family are known to have languished in decay and poverty ever afterwards. Monmouth was then "in the last extremity of hunger and fatigue, with no sustenance but a few raw peas in his pocket. He could not stand, and his appearance was much changed. Since landing in England, the Duke had not had a good night's rest, or eaten one meal in quiet, being perpetually agitated with the cares that attend unfortunate ambition". He had "received no other sustenance than the brook and the field afforded".&lt;ref&gt;''Tait's Edinburgh Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke was taken to Holt Lodge, in the parish of Wimborne, about a mile away, the residence of Anthony Etterick, a magistrate who asked the Duke what he would do if released, to which he answered "that if his horse and arms were but restored to him at the same time, he needed only to ride through the army; and he defied them to take him again". The magistrate ordered him taken to London.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt;

===Attainder and execution===
Following his capture, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] passed an [[Bill of attainder|Act of Attainder]], ''1 Ja. II c. 2''.&lt;ref&gt;Raithby, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whereas James Duke of Monmouth has in an hostile manner Invaded this Kingdome and is now in open Rebellion Levying War against the King contrary to the Duty of his Allegiance, Be it enacted ... That the said James Duke of Monmouth Stand and be Convicted and Attainted of High-Treason and that he suffer Paines of Death and Incurr all Forfeitures as a Traitor Convicted and Attainted of High Treason." ''The Statutes of the Realm'', vol. VI (1819).&lt;/ref&gt;
The King took the unusual step of allowing his nephew an audience, despite having no intention of extending a [[pardon]]  to him, thus breaking with a longstanding tradition that the King should only give an audience when he intended to show clemency.  The prisoner unsuccessfully implored his mercy, and even offered to convert to [[Roman Catholic|Catholicism]], but to no avail. The King, disgusted by his abject behaviour,  coldly told him to prepare to die, and later remarked that Monmouth  "did not behave as well as I expected".  Numerous pleas for mercy  were  addressed to the King, but  he ignored them all, even that  of his sister-in-law, the Dowager  Queen Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Beatty, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Monmouth was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by [[Jack Ketch]] on 15 July 1685, on [[Tower Hill, London|Tower Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=2051|page=2|date=13 July 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly beforehand, Bishops [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Turner]] of [[Bishop of Ely|Ely]] and [[Thomas Ken|Ken]] of [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]] visited the condemned man to prepare him for eternity, but withheld the [[Eucharist]] as he refused to acknowledge that either his rebellion or his relationship with [[Henrietta Wentworth, 6th Baroness Wentworth|Lady Wentworth]] had been [[sin]]ful.&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, p.491&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that before laying his head to the block Monmouth specifically bade Ketch finish him at one blow, saying he had mauled others before. Disconcerted, Ketch did indeed inflict multiple blows with his axe, the prisoner rising up reproachfully the while – a ghastly sight that shocked the witnesses, drawing forth execrations and groans. Some say a knife was at last employed to sever the head from the twitching body. Sources vary; some claim eight blows, the official [[Tower of London]] fact sheet says it took five blows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrp.org.uk/Resources/Prisoners.pdf |title=Tower of London: Fact sheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327165659/http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Prisoners.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles Spencer]], in his book ''Blenheim'', puts it at seven.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, p.54: "Monmouth had a particularly grisly end, the executioner's axe striking seven times before his head severed"&lt;/ref&gt;

Monmouth was buried in the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula]] in the Tower of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/tower_london_8.html|title=The Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula and Tower Green|publisher=English Monarchs|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Dukedom of Monmouth was forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of that dukedom (Earl of Doncaster and Baron Scott of Tindale) were restored to his grandson, [[Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch]] (1695–1751), on 23 March 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlofdoncaster.com/|title=Earl of Doncaster|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, a portrait was painted of Monmouth after his execution: the tradition states that it was realised after the execution that there was no official [[portrait]] of the Duke – so his body was exhumed, the head stitched back on the body, and it was sat for its portrait to be painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/tourist-sights-portrait-of-the-duke-of-monmouth-in-england.htm |title="The People's Almanac" series of books cites this story |publisher=Trivia-library.com |date= |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are at least two formal portraits of Monmouth tentatively dated to before his death currently in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp03129&amp;rNo=4&amp;role=sit |title=National Portrait Gallery NPG 151 |publisher=Npg.org.uk |date= |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another painting once identified with Monmouth that shows a sleeping or dead man that could have given rise to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp03129&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit |title=National Portrait Gallery NPG 1566 |publisher=Npg.org.uk |date= |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the many theories about the identity of [[Man in the Iron Mask|The Man in the Iron Mask]] is that he was Monmouth: this seems to be based on the unlikely reasoning that James II would not execute his own nephew, so someone else was executed, and James II arranged for Monmouth to be taken to France and put in the custody of his cousin [[Louis XIV of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Samuel, "Duke of Monmouth: Man in the Iron Mask" in ''Oxford Journals'' (Oxford, 1870) Vol s4-V, No 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Purcell]] set to music ([[List of compositions by Henry Purcell|Z. 481]]) a satirical poem by an unidentified author, ridiculing Monmouth and his parentage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrypurcell.org.uk/purcell-society-edition/vol-22b/|title= Henry Purcell: Duets, Dialogues and Trios, edited by Ian Spink (Purcell Society Edition Vol. 22B)|publisher=Purcell Society|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A grasshopper and a fly,&lt;br /&gt;In summer hot and dry,&lt;br /&gt;
In eager argument were met&lt;br /&gt;
About priority.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Says the fly to the grasshopper:&lt;br /&gt;
"From mighty race I spring,&lt;br /&gt;
Bright Phoebus was my dad 'tis known,&lt;br /&gt;
And I eat and drink with a king."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Says the grasshopper to the fly:&lt;br /&gt;
"Such rogues are still preferr'd;&lt;br /&gt;
Your father might be of high degree,&lt;br /&gt;
But your mother was but a turd."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, rebel Jemmy Scott,&lt;br /&gt;
That did to the empire soar,&lt;br /&gt;
His father might be the Lord knows what,&lt;br /&gt;
But his mother we knew a whore".

'''Leonidas Carstarphen Dyer''' (June 11, 1871 – December 15, 1957) was an American politician, reformer, [[civil rights activist]], and military officer who served 11 terms in the U.S. Congress as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Missouri]] from 1911 to 1933.  In 1898, enrolling in the U.S. Army as a private, Dyer served notably in the [[Spanish–American War]]; and was promoted to Colonel at the war's end.

Working as an attorney in St. Louis, Dyer started an anti-[[usury]] campaign and was elected to Congress as a Republican in 1910. As a progressive reformer, Dyer authored an anti-usury law in 1914 that limited excessive loan rates by bank lenders in the nation's capital, then still governed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Morrow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=James B. |title=Usury The Bugbear of the Poor |newspaper=Boston Daily Globe |date=June 21, 1914 |page=SM 10 |location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horrified by the race riots in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] and [[East Saint Louis]] in 1917 and the high rate of reported [[lynchings]] in the South, in 1918 Dyer was notable for proposing the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]]. In 1920, the Republican Party supported such legislation in its platform from the National Convention. In January 1922, Dyer's bill was passed by the House, which approved it by a wide margin due to "insistent countrywide demand".&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;  The bill was defeated by the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] voting bloc of [[Southern United States|the South]] in [[filibusters]] in the Senate in December 1922, in 1923 and 1924.

In 1919, Dyer authored the motor-vehicle theft law, which made transporting stolen automobiles across state lines a federal crime. By 1956, the [[FBI]] reported that the law had enabled the recovery of cars worth more than $212 million.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; In terms of [[Prohibition]], Rep. Dyer voted against various anti-liquor laws, including the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]].

Dyer served in Congress from the [[62nd Congress]] to the [[72nd Congress]]. He was defeated for re-election during the 1930s of the [[Great Depression]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s programs to put people to work and extend social welfare during the Depression helped attract voters to Democratic candidates.

==Early life and education==
Dyer was born near Warrenton in [[Warren County, Missouri]], the son of James Coleman Dyer and Martha E. (Camp) Dyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/dyer.html "Index to Politicians: Dyer"], The Political Graveyard, accessed 21 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family had roots in [[Virginia]], where his uncle [[David Patterson Dyer]] was born; he was elected as a Republican Congressman from Missouri (1869–71).&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/families/10445.html "Dyer Family of Virginia"], The Political Graveyard, accessed 22 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonidas attended common schools and [[Central Wesleyan College]]. He studied law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and was admitted to the bar in 1893.&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=D000591  Dyer, Leonidas Carstarphen, (1871–1957)], ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,'' accessed 22 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Served in Spanish–American War==
{{main |Spanish–American War}}
When the [[Spanish–American War]] began, Dyer joined the United States Army and served in combat during the Santiago campaign as a private in 1898.  He was promoted to colonel during the war, and served as a member of the staff of [[Herbert S. Hadley]], future Governor of Missouri.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

==St. Louis attorney and reformer==
{{further |Usury}}
After the war, the young Dyer served as assistant circuit attorney in [[St. Louis]], where he championed an [[usury|anti-usury]] reform campaign that eventually gained national attention.  Dyer successfully represented a railroad clerk who was being charged 34% monthly (''408% annual'') interest on a $100 loan after having paid $480 interest in 14 months.  None of the interest payment to the money lender was used to pay off the [[amortization (business)|principal]]. The money lender, in front of Att. Dyer, tore up the railroad workers loan.  Dyer organized a group of wealthy merchants in St. Louis who through investigations were able to keep interest rates low in Missouri.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

==Congressional career==
[[image:Leonidas C. Dyer Standing.jpg|thumb |250px |Rep. Leonidas C. Dyer from Missouri was elected to Congress in 1910.  Rep. Dyer in 1918 authored the Dyer anti-lynching bill.  Although passed in the House in 1922, the bill was defeated in the Senate by a Southern Democratic [[filibuster]]. Rep. Dyer's motto: "We have just begun to fight."]]
In 1910, Dyer successfully ran and was elected Congressman to the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt; His long career in Congress having begun in 1911, Rep. Dyer was repeatedly re-elected. His time in Congress was briefly interrupted between 1914 and 1915 due to a dispute over 1912 election results, but he was reelected in 1914.

Dyer was defeated for re-election from his district in 1932, 1934 and 1936, and decided to retire from politics. Dyer represented the 12th District of Missouri, which had a majority African-American population. They were disappointed by the Republican failure to pass an anti-lynching bill during the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; and attracted to Democratic candidates during the [[Great Depression]], after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had started some of his work and welfare programs.  Dyer followed [[Harry Coudrey]], also a Republican.&lt;ref name="Leonidas Dyer Elected Positions"&gt;Govtrac.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=403694 Leonidas Dryer Elected Positions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-usury law===
Rep. Dyer continued his anti-usury campaign in 1914 by authoring a law that prevented banks from charging excessive interest rates on loans in Washington D.C., which was then governed by Congress.  Rep. Dyer believed that money lenders went after financially vulnerable people, authorizing loan contracts for unnecessary purposes.  Dyer stated that usury was "an ancient moral crime against the poor and helpless."&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;  He advocated for each state to pass similar anti-usury laws.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

===Advocated postal pneumatic tube system===
{{further |Pneumatic tubes}}
On March 29, 1916, Rep. Dyer spoke before a Senate Committee advocating H.R. 10484, to fund a U.S. Postal [[pneumatic tube]] service in St. Louis.  Under the existing service, U.S. mail was transported by compressed air [[vacuum]] tubes in the St. Louis area.  Dyer asked the committee to extend the pneumatic tube service from 2 to 5 miles; at a cost of $50,000.  According to Dyer, the tube extension would promote business and private citizens in East St. Louis by reducing delivery time 11 hours and 50 minutes. By comparison, the city of Boston had 8 miles of U.S. Postal pneumatic tube service.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Post Offices and Postal Roads United States Senate (March 29, 1916), ''Pneumatic Tube Service'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-lynching bill===

====St. Louis riots 1917====

{{further |Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill |Lynching in the United States|Lynching }}
In May 1917, a riot broke out in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], where mobs of ethnic white men attacked black workers, [[strikebreakers]] who had been brought in to replace [[American Federation of Labor]] strikers. In July 1917, mob violence broke out in [[East St. Louis]] against blacks, also against a background of competition over jobs. Two white police officers were killed early in the confrontation. In retaliation, ethnic white mobs killed 35 blacks, mutilated the bodies and threw them into the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howard |first1=Marilyn K. |last2=Rucker |first2=Walter C. |last3=Upton |first3=James N. |title=Encyclopedia of American race riots |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=183|isbn=0-313-33301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; White rioters openly targeted and lynched several blacks.  Those who attempted to stop the lynchings were threatened by the white mob with physical violence.  As blacks fled into St. Louis, white rioters threatened to kill them upon their return. The white Illinois National guard brought into quell the riot, participated in the violence against blacks or did nothing to stop the violence.  One black child was shot and thrown into a burning building, while white prostitutes openly attacked black women. After the riots, of the 134 persons indicted, only 9 whites who were put on trial went to prison while 12 indicted blacks who went to trial were imprisoned. Nearly 1/3 of the total 134 persons indicted were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=John A. |last2=Rucker |first2=Walter C. |last3=Upton |first3=James N. |title=Encyclopedia of American race riots |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=188–190|isbn=0-313-33301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction rate, mathematically, was more than doubled for blacks then for whites.

Dyer was distressed by such mob violence, with its disregard for the courts and the "rule of law". His district in St. Louis had mostly African-American residents and he wanted to protect his constituents and other citizens. Many people from his district had migrated to St. Louis from [[Southern United States|the South]], in the exodus known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. They settled in St. Louis where industrialization had led to a strong economy and an increase in jobs. The economy had also attracted numerous immigrants from Europe and competition for work was high.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;  Dyer also knew of the continuing high rate of lynchings, mostly of blacks by whites in [[Southern United States|the South]]. Working with [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], who had been working on a national anti-lynching campaign, Dyer helped develop and agreed to sponsor anti-lynching legislation.&lt;ref name="neh"/&gt;  
[[image:Lynching2.jpg|thumb|175px |left |Mob violence and lynching were common against African Americans in the South from the 1890s through the 1920s.]]

====Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill introduced 1918====
Calling for an end to mob violence, on April 1, 1918, Dyer introduced the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], which would have made lynching a federal crime.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; In his speech, he anticipated some members likely objections about the federal government sponsoring "social" legislation, and noted that lynching violated individuals' rights under the 14th Amendment. In addition, he noted that Congress had passed child labor laws and the Prohibition amendment. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Congress has felt its duty to do these things, why should it not also assume jurisdiction and enact laws to protect the lives of citizens of the United States against lynch law and mob violence?

Black leaders in the North had insisted that the Republican Party National platform for the presidential election of 1920 include support for anti-lynching legislation. After the election, the black community complained when months passed without Harding's getting a bill introduced and passed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Harvier"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/07/09/107065716.pdf Ernest Harvier, "Political Effect of the Dyer Bill: Delay in Enacting Anti-Lynching Law Diverted Thousands of Negro Votes"], ''New York Times'', 9 July 1922, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer introduced a revised version of the bill in the House of Representatives in 1921.  Due to "insistent country-wide demand," it passed on January 22, 1922.&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; The first such federal legislation to gain House passage in the twentieth century, it would have enabled the federal government to prosecute the crime. Southern authorities seldom did so. In the South, most blacks had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] from 1890–1911 by constitutional changes and discriminatory legislation after southern Democrats regained power in the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000], accessed 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to vote, blacks were disqualified from serving on juries or holding any political office; they had virtually no political power within the official system. In the few cases that came to trial, [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] generally never convicted a white man of lynching a black.

The Republican President [[Warren G. Harding]] spoke in favor of Dyer's anti-lynching bill at an appearance in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama. With high interest in the bill across the country, it passed the House on January 26, 1922, with the help of Liberal Republicans and eight Democratic Representatives, and went on to the Senate. President Harding stated he would sign the bill if it was passed by the Senate&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;

Proponents of Dyer's anti-lynching bill believed that lynching and mob violence took away African-American citizens' rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. These rights included a speedy and fair trial by an impartial jury. Other citizen rights included the right to be informed of the nature of the crime accused, the ability to have witnesses in the defense's favor, and to be represented by council in court.&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; Many blacks felt betrayed by the Republicans due to the bill's slow process to the Senate. A silent protest march by many blacks took place in front of the Capital grounds and White House in 1922 while the bill's constitutionality was being contemplated. A protest sign read, "Congress discusses constitutionality while the smoke of burning bodies darkens the heavens."&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;

====Senate filibuster 1922====
[[image:U.S. Senator Lee Slater Overman.jpg|thumb|175px |right |U.S. Sen. [[Lee Slater Overman]] from North Carolina, Harris &amp; Ewing, 1914.&lt;br&gt; Southern Democratic senators filibustered the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill in December 1922 and twice more to prevent its passage.]]
After Dyer's bill reached the Senate and received a favorable report from the [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary Committee]], some Republican senators, including most prominently [[William Borah]], an otherwise progressive Senator from [[Idaho]], spoke against it. Borah was concerned about issues of [[state sovereignty]] and believed that the bill was not constitutional.&lt;ref name="neh"&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/naacp%E2%80%99s-anti-lynching-campaign-1920s#sect-background "Lesson 1: NAACP’s Anti-Lynching Campaign in the 1920s"], ''NAACP's Anti-Lynching Campaigns'', 22 December 2009, Edsitement, National Endowment for the Humanities, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially concerned about the clause that provided for federal authorities to punish state officials "remiss in the suppression of lynchings."&lt;ref name="NYTCalder"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/05/30/107058655.pdf "Calder Is Friend of Negro, He Insists"], ''New York Times'', 22 May 1922, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;[http://www.electricprint.com/academic/department/AandL/AAS/ANNOUNCE/vra/lynch/congress/congress1.htm  "Proceedings of the U.S. Senate on June 13, 2005 regarding the "Senate Apology" as Reported in the 'Congressional Record'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322090032/http://www.electricprint.com/academic/department/AandL/AAS/ANNOUNCE/vra/lynch/congress/congress1.htm |date=March 22, 2012 }}, "Part 3, Mr. Craig", at African American Studies, University of Buffalo, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolonged [[filibuster]] by Southern white Democrats prevented consideration of the bill and defeated it. After the Democrats had held up voting on all the national business in the Senate for a week in December 1922 by their filibuster, the Republicans realized they could not overcome the tactic and finally conceded defeat on Dyer's bill.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; Senator [[Lee S. Overman]] of North Carolina told the ''New York Times'' that the "good negroes of the South did not want the legislation for 'they do not need it'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/03/109338699.pdf "Filibuster Kills Anti-Lynching Bil"], ''New York Times'', 3 December 1922, accessed 20 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath and legacy====
Following the defeat of his first bill in the Senate in 1922, Dyer tried unsuccessfully two more times to get it passed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; Some of the bill's opponents claimed that the threat of lynching protected white women from sexual advances from black men.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; The studies by the journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] in the late 1890s had shown that black lynch victims were accused or rape or attempted rape only one third of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ida B. Wells, ''Southern Horrors'' (1892)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the murders of blacks were an extreme form of white extrajudicial punishment and community control, often targeting blacks who were economic competitors with whites, who were trying to advance in society, who were in debt to landowners (settlement season for [[sharecroppers]] was a time of high rates of lynchings in rural areas), or those who failed to "stay in their place".&lt;ref name="whowaslynched"&gt;[http://www.nellpainter.com/cv/articles/32_WhoWasLynched.html Nell Painter, "Who Was Lynched?"], reprinted from ''The Nation'', 11 November 1991, Vol. 253, Issue 16, p. 16, Nell Painter Website, accessed 1 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, according to the Pittsburgh ''Gazette Times'', many Southerners viewed the practice of lynching as a [[sport|sporting event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mississippi's 'Orderly' Lynching |newspaper=The Gazette Times |location=Pittsburgh |date=June 28, 1919 |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yLZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m2gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2143%2C4208920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, to gain national support for his anti-lynching bill, which was to be heard again that year in the Senate, Dyer toured the western United States to generate public support. His motto for his anti-lynching campaign was "We have just begun to fight." (This was the statement made famous by [[John Paul Jones]].)  Dyer attracted mixed black and white audiences in [[Denver]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Los Angeles, [[Omaha]], and Chicago.  He thanked the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) for supporting his bill and praised their continuing to publicize the terrible human toll of lynching in the United States. In Chicago, 4000 people attended his anti-lynching rally. Dyer's campaign received positive coverage by the white mainstream press, which helped strengthen an anti-lynching movement in the West.&lt;ref&gt;"Lynching", ''The Crisis'' (July, 1923), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national attention received by Dyer's anti-lynching bill and speaking campaign may have helped reduce lynchings in the South. Lynchings per year dropped in four years, from 60 in 1918 to 57 in 1922. More significantly, the Great Migration was underway, and black workers by the tens of thousands were leaving the South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, for jobs, education, and a chance to escape [[Jim Crow]] laws and violence. By 1934, when the [[Edward Costigan|Costigan]]-[[Robert F. Wagner|Wagner]] anti-lynching bill was introduced, lynchings had dropped to 15 per year.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; In 1935 and 1938, Senator Borah repeated his constitutional arguments against the bill; he added that he believed such legislation was no longer needed, because the rate of lynchings had fallen so dramatically.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; By 1940, 1.5 million blacks had left the South in the Great Migration. Another five million left from 1940–1970.
 
The political power of the white Democrats in the South came from their having disfranchised most blacks from 1890–1910. The South was essentially a one-party, Democratic region in which only whites voted and held office, well into the 1960s, but Congressional representation was based on the total population. The situation of disfranchisement did not change markedly until passage in the 1960s of federal [[civil rights]] legislation that protected and enforced the constitutional rights of voting and citizenship for African Americans and other minorities.

From 1882–1968, "... nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress, and three passed the House. Seven presidents between 1890 and 1952 petitioned Congress to pass a federal law."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; None was approved by the Senate because of the powerful opposition of the Southern Democratic voting bloc. In June 2005, through passing a bipartisan resolution sponsored by senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] of Virginia, the US Senate officially apologized for not having passed an anti-lynching law "when it was most needed."&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159348,00.html Associated Press, "Senate Apologizes for Not Passing Anti-Lynching Laws"], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-automobile theft law===
In 1919, Rep. Dyer authored an anti-crime law that made transporting stolen cars across state borders a federal crime, to be prosecuted by federal law enforcement.  In 1956, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] said that the law had led to the recovery of 227,752 stolen automobiles worth $212,679,296.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

===Advocated Philippine independence===
In December 1922, Rep. Dyer had traveled to the [[Philippines]], then a U.S. territory,  according to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]].  On December 22, Rep. Dyer spoke before the Philippine Senate in [[Manila]], stating that he believed the Philippines would be independent by the next Congress.  Rep. Dyer stated he favored Philippine independence. He said that the US would always "be proud of the Philippines and what we have accomplished here for the [[Filipinos]] and for the American people."&lt;ref&gt;"Sees Philippines Free", ''New York Times'' (December 23, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines were granted commonwealth status in 1935 and finally given independence in 1946.

===Contraband liquor stock===
The [[New York Curb Exchange]] (NYCE) on April 10, 1929, had received a letter written by Rep. Dyer that demanded he be returned money after he had bought and sold at a loss Canadian whiskey company [[Hiram Walker]] stock.  Rep. Dyer contended he did not know that company made liquor, a contraband product in the U.S. during Prohibition and was forced to sell at a loss.  Rep. Dyer believed Hiram Walker and other company liquor stocks had been sold on the NYCE without acknowledgement that these were whiskey companies.&lt;ref name="Congressman"&gt;The Atlanta Constitution (Apr 11, 1929), Congressman Asks Return of Losses On Whisky Stock&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer had voted against the Prohibition [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], the [[Volstead Act]], the Volstead Act over-riding Presidential veto, and the Jones law. These laws authorized federal enforcement and essentially prohibited the sale of liquor in the United States.&lt;ref name="Congressman"/&gt; Saint Louis had a large beer-brewing industry, and before Prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the country.&lt;ref name="missouriwinecountry.com"&gt;[http://www.missouriwinecountry.com/articles/history/ Brett Dufur, "History of Missouri Wine Industry"], Missouri Wine Country, accessed 19 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Both industries had been started and developed by German immigrants to the state. Prohibition would seriously damage the economies of Dyer's major city and state.

===Terms and voting record===
Rep. Dyer served 11 terms in office for Missouri's 12th District. During his second term in office, on June 19, 1914 Dyer was suspended from taking his seat in the House of Representatives due to contested voting election returns in 1912 in Missouri's 12th District. According to the ''New York Times'', Dyer had nothing to do with the voting fraud.  The House voted to unseat Dyer, who was active in legislative work, by a 147 to 98 vote.  During the vote to oust Dyer, 22 Representatives voted "present", rather than give a vote for or against. By a 126 to 108 vote to replace Dyer, the House seated a Democrat, [[Michael Joseph Gill|Michael J. Gill]], who took the oath of office.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (June 20, 1914), "Ballot Frauds Cost Seat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill served in the House from June 19, 1914, until March 3, 1915.  He was defeated by Dyer in the 1914 elections.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,'' [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000190 Gill, Michael Joseph, (1864–1918)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rep. Dyer's voted 1556 times out of 2,035 Congressional roll calls.  He missed voting 482 times, or 28%, in the Congressional time frame starting on April 5, 1911, and ending on March 1, 1933.&lt;ref name="Leonidas Dyer Elected Positions"/&gt; The two time periods when Rep. Dyer missed voting 80% of the time were April–June 1912, and October–December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Govtrac.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=403694&amp;tab=votes "Leonidas Dyer Missing Votes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement from public office==
Dyer ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"/&gt; Black voters had been disappointed that the Republicans had failed to deliver on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, part of the national platform in 1920,&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; and by President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]]'s approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the [[Works Progress Administration]] and providing social aid programs.

After three successive defeats, Dyer retired from politics and returned to private law practice as an attorney.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;

==Death==
Dyer died in [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, Missouri]] on December 15, 1957, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;"Ex-Rep. Dyer Dies at 86 in St. Louis", ''The Los Angeles Times'' (Dec 17, 1957), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyer was buried in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Saint Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12141068 Find a Grave] (2005), ''Leonidas Carstarphen Dyer''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">'''Leura Collins''' was a member of Retail Clerks Union Local 455 and subject of a workplace theft investigation that resulted in the 1975 [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case ''[[NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|420|251|1975}}.

==History==
[[Weingarten's|Weingarten Inc.]] was founded in 1948 as a retailer.  By 1972, Weingarten Inc. operated 100 stores, some of which included "lunch counters", and others which included "lobby food operations."  These counters/lobbies provided eat-in or carry-out dining options for customers.  Collins was employed from 1961-1970 at store #2 as a "lunch counter" [[retail clerk|sales person]].  She transferred to store #98 where she was a sales person at the "lobby food operation."

[[Loss Prevention Specialists]] were employed by Weingarten Inc and operated at the companies stores undercover, sometimes unbeknownst to management to observe/apprehend people suspected of theft, including employees.  In June 1972, Loss Prevention Specialist "Hardy" observed the lobby operation at store #98 for 2 days (without the knowledge of management) to investigate a report that Collins was stealing money from the cash register.  Hardy disclosed his presence to the store manager only after his 2-day investigation turned up no evidence.  The store manager then told Hardy that he was just informed by a coworker that Collins had taken a $2.98 box of chicken and put only $1 into the cash register.  Collins was then interviewed by both Hardy and the store manager.

==Interview #1==
Collins repeatedly requested [[Labor union|union]] representation at the meeting, but her requests were denied.  The interview continued and Collins explained that the "lobby" had run out of small boxes, so she had to use the large size ($2.98) box to hold her small ($1) order of chicken.  Hardy left the interview and was able to verify with another employee that they had indeed run out of small boxes, and the employee who reported her was unaware of how many pieces of chicken were in the box.  Hardy returned to the interview and apologized for the confusion and informed Collins that his investigation was over.

==Interview #2==
Collins then burst into tears and proclaimed the only thing she ever took was her free lunch.  Hardy and the manager were surprised to hear this because their understanding was that free lunches were provided in stores with "lunch counters" (e.g. #2), but not in those with "lobby food operations" (e.g. #98).  A new interrogation proceeded and Collins' renewed request for union representation was again denied.  Hardy computed a total of $160 owed the company by Collins for these free lunches.  However, a call to company headquarters revealed much confusion regarding the companies 2 different free lunch policies.  In fact, most other employees at the "lobby food operation" at store #98, including the manager, had taken free lunches.  The store manager asked Collins to keep the interview confidential, but she informed her union shop steward.

The '''limited liability limited partnership''' ('''LLLP''') is a relatively new modification of the limited partnership, a form of [[business entity]] recognized under [[Corporate law in the United States|United States commercial law]]. An LLLP is a [[limited partnership]] and as such consists of one or more general [[Partnership|partner]]s and one or more limited partners. Typically, while the general partners manage the LLLP, the limited partners' interest is purely financial. Thus, the most common use of a limited partnership is for purposes of investment, often through a number of private equity firms. Despite their lack of control over day to day operations, the limited partners may nonetheless own substantially all of the equity in the partnership.

==LLLP versus LP==
The difference between an LLLP and a traditional limited partnership lies in the general partner's liability for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership.

In a traditional limited partnership the general partners are jointly and severally liable for its debts and obligations; limited partners are not liable for those debts and obligations beyond the amount of their capital contributions.

In an LLLP, by having the limited 
partnership make an election under state law, the general partners are afforded [[limited liability]] for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership that arise during the period that the LLLP election is in place. Certain LLLP elections take the form of a limited partnership electing to be a [[limited liability partnership]] (this is the format used in [[Delaware]], for example) while in other states the election is made in the certificate of limited partnership (examples being [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Kentucky]]).  Most states require that an LLLP identify itself in its name, but those requirements are not universal.

Because the LLLP is so new, its use is not widespread. [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], l
L[[Maryland]], [[Nevada]], [[Texas]], and [[Kentucky]] have all adopted statutes that allow formation of an LLLP, usually as a conversion of an existing limited partnership (the general partners might want to do this to reduce their legal liability).

The filing fees of an LLLP vs. a limited partnership are at times higher. In the case of [[Nevada]], the Secretary of State charges $75 to register a limited partnership and $100 to register an LLLP. Additionally, the initial and annual report filing for an LLLP in Nevada is $175 vs. $125 for a limited partnership.  Conversely, in Kentucky the filing fee for a limited partnership is no higher if the partnership elects to be an LLLP.

LLLPs are most common in the [[real estate]] business, although other businesses can also use the form, for example, [[CNN]]. There are significant questions about whether the limited liability provided to general partners by the LLLP election will be effective in states that do not have an LLLP statute.

Though California does not have a state statute allowing formation of an LLLP, it does recognize LLLPs formed under the laws of another state. While registering an LLLP formed in another state in California will trigger the annual franchise tax of $800—the same as other entities formed in California&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ftb.ca.gov/businesses/bus_structures/LLLpartner.shtml California Franchise Tax Board instructions]&lt;/ref&gt;—the statute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=rtc&amp;group=17001-18000&amp;file=17935-17937 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064936/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=rtc&amp;group=17001-18000&amp;file=17935-17937 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} R&amp;T 17935(a)&lt;/ref&gt; governing whether a LLLP must register is somewhat less inclusive than the statute &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE  SECTION 17935-17937|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=rtc&amp;group=17001-18000&amp;file=17935-17937|publisher=leginfo.ca.gov|accessdate=27 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064936/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=rtc&amp;group=17001-18000&amp;file=17935-17937|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for out-of-state LLCs.

Illinois, though not having an enabling statute, does allow formation of an LLLP under RULPA (Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act).

==Terms==
The MPL defines rights as passing from "Contributors" who create or modify source code, through an optional auxiliary distributor (themselves a licensee), to the licensee. It grants liberal copyright and patent licenses allowing for free use, modification, distribution, and "exploit[ation]" of the work, but does not grant the licensee any rights to a contributor's [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref name=copyleft /&gt; These rights will terminate if the licensee fails to comply with the license's terms and conditions, but a violating licensee who returns to compliance regains their rights, and even receiving written notice from a Contributor will result in losing rights to that Contributor's code only. A [[patent retaliation]] clause, similar to that of the [[Apache License]], is included to protect an auxiliary distributor's further recipients against [[patent troll]]ing. The contributors disclaim [[warranty]] and [[legal liability|liability]], but allow auxiliary distributors to offer such things on their own behalf.

In exchange for the rights granted by license, the licensee must meet certain responsibilities concerning the distribution of licensed source code. Covered source code files must remain under the MPL, and distributors "may not attempt to alter or restrict recipients' rights" to it. The MPL treats the source code file as the boundary between MPL-licensed and proprietary parts, meaning that all or none of the code in a given source file falls under the MPL. An executable consisting solely of MPL-covered files may be sublicensed, but the licensee must ensure access to or provide all the source code within it. Recipients can combine licensed [[source code]] with other [[computer file|files]] under a different, even proprietary license, thereby forming a "Larger Work" which can be distributed under any terms, but again the MPL-covered source files must be made freely available.&lt;ref name=copyleft/&gt; This makes the MPL a compromise between the [[MIT License|MIT]] or [[BSD licenses]], which permit all derived works to be [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] as proprietary, and the GPL, which requires the derived work as a whole to be licensed under the GPL. By allowing proprietary modules in derived projects while requiring core files to remain open source, the MPL is designed to motivate both businesses and the open-source community to help develop core software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The one exception to covered source files remaining under the MPL occurs when code under version 2.0 or later is combined with separate code files under the GNU GPL, GNU [[GNU Lesser General Public License|Lesser GPL]] (LGPL), or GNU [[Affero General Public License|Affero GPL]] (AGPL). In this case, the program as a whole will be under the chosen GNU license, but the MPL-covered files will be dual-licensed, so that recipients can choose to distribute them under that GNU License or the MPL.&lt;ref name=FSF-list/&gt; The initial author of MPL code may choose to opt out of this GPL-compatibility by adding a notice to their source files.&lt;ref name=copyleft/&gt;

It is explicitly granted that MPL-covered code may be distributed under the terms of the license version under which it was received, or any later version. If code under version 1.0 or 1.1 is upgraded to version 2.0 by this mechanism, the 1.x-covered code must be marked with the aforementioned GPL-incompatible notice. The MPL can be modified to form a new license, provided that said license does not refer to Mozilla or Netscape.

==History==
Version 1.0 of the MPL was written by [[Mitchell Baker]] in 1998 while working as a lawyer at [[Netscape Communications Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape was hoping an open source strategy for developing their own [[Netscape (web browser)|Netscape web browser]] would allow them to compete better with [[Microsoft]]'s browser, [[Internet Explorer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cover the browser's code, the company drafted a license known as the [[Netscape Public License]] (NPL), which included a clause allowing even openly developed code to be theoretically relicensed as proprietary.&lt;ref name=NPL&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=16 August 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the same time, Baker developed a second license similar to the NPL. It was called the Mozilla Public License after Netscape's project name for the new open source codebase, and although it was originally only intended for software that supplemented core modules covered by the NPL, it would become much more popular than the NPL and eventually earn approval from the Open Source Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Less than a year later, Baker and the [[Mozilla Foundation#History|Mozilla Organization]] would make some changes to the MPL, resulting in version 1.1, a minor update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The primary goals were to clarify terms regarding patents and allow for [[dual license|multiple licensing]]. This last feature was meant to encourage cooperation with developers that preferred stricter licenses like the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Both versions 1.0 and 1.1 are incompatible with the GPL, which led the Free Software Foundation to discourage using version 1.1.&lt;ref name=FSF_FAQ_11&gt;{{cite web|title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them|publisher=Free Software Foundation|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#MPL|accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, earlier versions of Firefox were released under multiple licenses: the MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, and LGPL 2.1.&lt;ref name=MPL-relicense&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some old software, such as the Mozilla Application Suite is still under the [[Multi-licensing|three licenses]]. Therefore, in early 2010, after more than a decade without modification, an open process for creating version 2.0 of the MPL began. Over the next 21 months, the MPL was not only changed to make the license clearer and easier to apply, but also to achieve compatibility with the GPL and [[Apache License|Apache]] licenses.&lt;ref name=MPLRevision /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Open knowledge''' is knowledge that one is free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social or technological restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Definition - Defining Open in Open Data, Open Content and Open Knowledge|url=https://opendefinition.org/od/|website=opendefinition.org|publisher=Open Knowledge Open Definition Group|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open knowledge is a set of principles and methodologies related to the production and distribution of how knowledge works in an ''open'' manner. Knowledge is interpreted broadly to include data, content and general information.

The concept is related to [[Open-source model|open source]] and the ''Open Knowledge Definition'' is directly derived from the [[Open Source Definition]]. Open knowledge can be seen as being a superset of [[open data]], [[open content]] and [[Gratis versus libre|libre]] [[open access]] with the aim of highlighting the commonalities between these different groups.

==History==
===Early history===
Similarly to other 'open' concepts such as open data and open content, though the term is rather new, the concept is old. For example, one of the earliest printed texts of which we have record is a copy of the Buddhist Diamond sutra produced in China around 868 AD, and in it can be found the dedication: "for universal free distribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollock|first1=Rufus|title=The Value of the Public Domain|url=https://rufuspollock.com/papers/value_of_the_public_domain.html|website=rufuspollock.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
In the early twentieth century a debate about [[intellectual property rights]] developed within the [[German Social Democratic Party]]. A key contributor was [[Karl Kautsky]] who in 1902 devoted a section of a pamphlet to "Intellectual Production" which he distinguished from [[material production]]:
:"Communism in material production, anarchy in the intellectual that is the type of a Socialist mode of production, as it will develop from the rule of the proletariat—in other words, from the Social Revolution through the logic of economic facts, whatever might be: the wishes, intentions, and theories of the proletariat."&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kautsky|first1=Karl|title=The Social Revolution and, On the Morrow of the Social Revolution|date=1903|publisher=Twentieth Century Press|location=London|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}}

This view was based on an analysis according to which [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Law of value]] only affected material production, not [[intellectual production]].

With the development of the public Internet from the early 1990s, it became far easier to copy and share information across the world. The phrase '[[information wants to be free]]' became a rallying cry for people who wanted to create an internet without the commercial barriers that they felt inhibited creative expression in traditional material production.

Wikipedia was founded in 2001 with the ethos of providing information which could be edited and modified to improve its quality. The success of Wikipedia became instrumental in making open knowledge something that millions of people interacted with and contributed to.

'''Paul D. Gewirtz''' (born May 12, 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n86065103.html|title=Gewirtz, Paul D., 1947-|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Potter Stewart]] Professor of [[Constitutional Law]] at [[Yale Law School]] and the Director of the China Center at Yale.

==Biography==
Gewirtz received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree ''summa cum laude'' from [[Columbia University]] in 1967 and his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from Yale Law School in 1970.  After graduation, he worked as a [[law clerk]] for the U.S. District Judge [[Marvin E. Frankel]] from 1970 to 1971, and as a [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States|law clerk]] for [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]] from 1971 to 1972.  He was admitted to the bar in Washington, D.C., and was a lawyer at Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering and then the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington, D.C.  He joined the faculty at Yale Law School in 1976. In 1994 he was appointed the Potter Stewart Professor of Constitutional Law.  He teaches and writes in various legal and policy fields, including constitutional law, federal courts, antidiscrimination law, law and literature, Chinese law, and American foreign policy.

Gewirtz played various roles in the administration of President Bill Clinton.  He served as the U.S. representative at the European Commission for Democracy through Law of the [[Council of Europe]] from 1996 to 2000, and, on leave of absence from Yale, was the Special Representative for the [[Presidential Rule of Law Initiative]], [[U.S. Department of State]] from 1997 to 1998.  He also was a consultant to the [[Solicitor General of the United States]] in 1997.

In 1996 Gewirtz was the founder of Yale Law School's [//www.law.yale.edu/centers-workshops/gruber-program-global-justice-and-womens-rights/global-constitutionalism-seminar Global Constitutionalism Seminar], which brings Supreme Court judges from around the world to Yale each year, and he served as its Director until 2006.  After returning from the Clinton Administration, Gewirtz founded the [https://www.law.yale.edu/china-center China Center] at Yale Law School in 1999 (originally named the China Law Center), and has been its Director since then.  The China Center focuses on helping to advance China's legal reforms, improving U.S.–China relations, and increasing understanding of China in the United States. In 2015 Gewirtz was named to Foreign Policy magazine's Pacific Power Index, a list of "50 people shaping the future of the U.S.-China relationship."

He was married to [[Zoë Baird]] from 1986 to 2008, and he has two sons, Julian and Alec.

A '''promissory note''', sometimes referred to as a '''note payable''', is a [[legal instrument]] (more particularly, a [[financial instrument]] and a [[debt]] instrument), in which one party (the ''maker'' or ''issuer'') promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of [[money]] to the other (the ''payee''), either at a fixed or determinable future time or on demand of the payee, under specific terms.

==Overview==
The terms of a note usually include the [[:wikt:principal|principal]] amount, the [[interest rate]] if any, the parties, the date, the terms of repayment (which could include interest) and the [[maturity date]].  Sometimes, provisions are included concerning the payee's rights in the event of a [[default (finance)|default]], which may include [[foreclosure]] of the maker's assets. For loans between individuals, writing and signing a promissory note are often instrumental for tax and record keeping. A promissory note alone is typically unsecured.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Use a Promissory Note|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/promissory_note.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term note payable is commonly used in [[accounting]] (as distinguished from [[accounts payable]]) or commonly as just a "note", it is internationally defined by the ''Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes'', but regional variations exist. A [[banknote]] is frequently referred to as a promissory note, as it is made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. [[Mortgage note]]s are another prominent example.

If the promissory note is unconditional and readily saleable, it is called a [[negotiable instrument]].&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;Whaley DJ. (2012). [http://wsulawreview.org/DWhaley.pdf Mortgage Foreclosures, Promissory Notes, and the Uniform Commercial Code]. ''Western State University Law Review''. [https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=39+W.+St.+U.+L.+Rev.+313&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=b4ff3146a501f1f969b427ea9ebfba75 LexisNexis entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demand promissory notes''' are notes that do not carry a specific maturity date, but are due on demand of the lender. Usually the lender will only give the borrower a few days' notice before the payment is due.

Promissory notes may be used in combination with [[security agreement]]s. For example, a promissory note may be used in combination with a [[mortgage law|mortgage]], in which case it is called a [[mortgage note]].

====Loan contracts====
In common speech, other terms, such as "[[loan]]", "[[loan agreement]]", and "loan contract" may be used interchangeably with "promissory note". The term "loan contract" is often used to describe a contract that is lengthy and detailed.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

A promissory note is very similar to a loan. Each is a legally binding contract to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a promissory note is generally less detailed and less rigid than a loan contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp|title=Promissory Note|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=25 November 2003|website=investopedia.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For one thing, loan agreements often require repayment in installments, while promissory notes typically do not. Furthermore, a loan agreement usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a promissory note does not.

====Difference from IOU====
Promissory notes differ from [[IOU (debt)|IOU]]s in that they contain a specific promise to pay along with the steps and timeline for repayment as well as consequences if repayment fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beattie|first=Andrew|title=Promissory Notes: Not Your Average IOU|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/07/promissory_note.asp|publisher=[[Investopedia]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOUs only acknowledge that a debt exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promissory Note Comparison Guide|url=https://www.legalzoom.com/sites/legalzoom.com/themes/legalzoom/assets/includes/Promissory-Note-Comparison-Guide.pdf|website=LegalZoom|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOU|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp|website=Investopedia|publisher=Investopedia, LLC|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiability===
[[Negotiable instrument]]s are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment. In the United States, whether a promissory note is a negotiable instrument can have significant legal impacts, as only negotiable instruments are subject to Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code and the application of the [[holder in due course]] rule.&lt;ref name=Whaley/&gt; The negotiability of [[mortgage note]]s has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and "baggage" associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be negotiable instruments.&lt;ref name=Whaley/&gt;

In the United States, the Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note is not required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Negotiable Long Form Promissory Note|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/6-508-0668|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as financial instruments===
Promissory notes are a common financial instrument in many jurisdictions, employed principally for short time financing of companies. Often, the seller or provider of a service is not paid upfront by the buyer (usually, another company), but within a period of time, the length of which has been agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer. The reasons for this may vary; historically, many companies used to balance their books and execute payments and debts at the end of each week or tax month; any product bought before that time would be paid only then. Depending on the jurisdiction, this [[Standard of deferred payment|deferred payment period]] can be regulated by law; in countries like [[France]], [[Italy]] or [[Spain]], it usually ranges between 30 and 90 days after the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesclesdelabanque.com/Web/Cdb/Entrepreneurs/Content.nsf/DocumentsByIDWeb/7PUHXY?OpenDocument|title=La lettre de change et la LCR|first=Les clés de la banque-|last=FBF|date=|website=Les clés de la banque Entrepreneurs|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a company engages in many of such transactions, for instance by having provided services to many customers all of whom then deferred their payment, it is possible that the company may be owed enough money that its own liquidity position (i.e., the amount of cash it holds) is hampered, and finds itself unable to honour their own debts, despite the fact that by the books, the company remains solvent. In those cases, the company has the option of asking the bank for a short-term loan, or using any other such short-term financial arrangements to avoid [[insolvency]]. However, in jurisdictions where promissory notes are commonplace, the company (called the ''payee'' or ''lender'') can ask one of its debtors (called the ''maker'', ''borrower'' or ''payor'') to ''accept'' a promissory note, whereby the maker signs a legally binding agreement to honour the amount established in the promissory note (usually, part or all its debt) within the agreed period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinkel|first1=Daniel F.|title=Essentials of Practical Real Estate Law|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1133421490|pages=174–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XoJAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lender can then take the promissory note to a financial institution (usually a bank, albeit this could also be a private person, or another company), that will exchange the promissory note for cash; usually, the promissory note is cashed in for the amount established in the promissory note, less a small discount.

Once the promissory note reaches its ''maturity date'', its current holder (the bank) can execute it over the emitter of the note (the debtor), who would have to pay the bank the amount ''promised'' in the note. If the maker fails to pay, however, the bank retains the right to go to the company that cashed the promissory note in, and demand payment. In the case of unsecured promissory notes, the lender accepts the promissory note based solely on the maker's ability to repay; if the maker fails to pay, the lender must honour the debt to the bank. In the case of a secured promissory note, the lender accepts the promissory note based on the maker's ability to repay, but the note is secured by a thing of value; if the maker fails to pay and the bank reclaims payment, the lender has the right to execute the security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/promise.htm|title=SEC.gov - Broken Promises: Promissory Note Fraud|author=|date=|website=www.sec.gov|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as private money===
Thus, promissory notes can work as a form of private money. In the past, particularly during the 19th century, their widespread and unregulated use was a source of great risk for banks and private financiers, who would often face the insolvency of both debtors, or simply be scammed by both.

Roman promissory notes may be the first ones as 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/ancient-rome-London-Londinum-Bloomberg-archaeology-Boudicca-archaeology/|title=Ancient Roman IOUs Found Beneath Bloomberg's New London HQ|date=2016-06-01|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3620788/The-City-s-IOU-2-000-year-old-letters-reveal-daily-life-trade-debts-Roman-London.html|title=Ancient letters reveal daily life, trade and debts in Roman London|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, promissory notes have acted as a form of privately issued [[currency]]. [[Flying cash]] or ''feiqian'' was a promissory note used during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618 – 907). Flying cash was regularly used by Chinese tea merchants, and could be exchanged for hard currency at provincial capitals.&lt;ref name="Origins of value"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William N. Goetzmann|author2=K.

According to tradition, in 1325 a promissory note was signed in [[Milan]]. However, according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub]], small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowiak, Marek. ''Dirhams for slaves''. Medieval Seminar, All Souls, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1150 the [[History of the Knights Templar#Bankers|Knights Templar]] issued promissory notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1877-5888_rpp_com_125078|title=Templar Order|website=Religion Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57175151|title=The Knights Templar : the history and myths of the legendary military order|last=1966-|first=Martin, Sean,|date=2004|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1560256451|edition=1st Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York|oclc=57175151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of promissory notes being issued in 1384 between [[Genoa]] and [[Barcelona]], although the letters themselves are lost. The same happens for the ones issued in Valencia in 1371 by Bernat de Codinachs for Manuel d'Entença, a merchant from [[Huesca]] (then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]]), amounting a total of 100 florins.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Manuel Sanchis Guarner in ''La Ciutat de València''. Ajuntament de València, València. Cinquena Edició 1989, plana 172. Quote in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
{{cita|Onorables senyors, nosaltres havem pres ací en Monsó, C florins de cambi de mossén Manuel d'Entença..., vos plàcia complir e donar aquí en València, per ell al honrat En Bernat de Codinachs, vista la present. Per la lletra que us enviam, vos fem saber aquells havíem ops. Plàtia-us, senyors, aquest cambi aja bon compliment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases, the promissory notes were used as a rudimentary system of paper money, for the amounts issued could not be easily transported in metal coins between the cities involved. [[Strozzi family|Ginaldo Giovanni Battista Strozzi]] issued an early form of promissory note in [[Medina del Campo]] ([[Spain]]), against the city of [[Besançon]] in 1553.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La primera Letra de Cambio|url=http://www.delsolmedina.com/La%20primera%20letra%20de%20cambio.htm|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists notice of promissory notes being in used in Mediterranean commerce well before that date.

===International law===
In 1930, under the League of Nations, a ''Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes'' was drafted and ratified by eighteen  nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention Providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/09/9-03/bills-exchange-notes.xml|publisher=UiO|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&amp;id=551&amp;chapter=30&amp;clang=_en|website=United Nations Treaty Collection|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=7 June 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 75 of the treaty stated that a promissory note shall contain:
* the term "''promissory note''" inserted in the body of the instrument and expressed in the language employed in drawing up the instrument
* an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money;
* a statement of the time of payment;
* a statement of the place where payment is to be made;
* the name of the person to whom or to whose order payment is to be made;
* a statement of the date and of the place where the promissory note is issued;
* the signature of the person who issues the instrument (maker).

''' Promissory note defined

(1) A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to, or to the order of, a specified person or to bearer.

(2) An instrument in the form of a note payable to maker’s order is not a note within the meaning of this section unless and until it is indorsed by the maker.

(3) A note is not invalid by reason only that it contains also a pledge of collateral security with authority to sell or dispose thereof.

(4) A note which is, or on the face of it purports to be, both made and payable within the British Islands is an inland note. Any other note is a foreign note.'''}}

===United States===
[[File:Promissory note - 2nd Bank of US $1000.jpg|thumb|A promissory note issued by the [[Second Bank of the United States]], December 15, 1840, for the amount of $1,000]]
In the [[United States]], a promissory note that meets certain conditions is a [[negotiable instrument]] regulated by article 3 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. Negotiable promissory notes called [[mortgage note]]s are used extensively in combination with [[Mortgage law|mortgages]] in the financing of [[real estate]] transactions. One prominent example is the [[Fannie Mae]] model [[standard form contract]] Multistate Fixed-Rate Note 3200, which is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes|url=https://www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily/notes|publisher=[[FannieMae]]|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promissory notes, or [[commercial paper]]s, are also issued to provide capital to businesses. However, Promissory Notes act as a source of Finance to the company's creditors.

The various State law enactments of the Uniform Commercial Code define what is and what is not a promissory note, in section 3-104(d):

{{cquote|'''§ 3-104. NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT.'''

'''...'''

'''(d) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.'''}}

Thus, a writing containing such a disclaimer removes such a writing from the definition of ''negotiable instrument'', instead simply memorializing a [[contract]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">The '''Rome II Regulation''' (EC) No [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007R0864:EN:HTML 864/2007] is a [[European Union]] [[European Union Regulation|Regulation]] regarding the [[conflict of laws]] on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. From 11 January 2009, the Rome II Regulation creates a [[Harmonisation of law|harmonised]] set of rules within the European Union to govern [[choice of law]] in civil and commercial matters (subject to certain exclusions) concerning non-contractual [[Law of Obligations|obligations]], including specific rules for [[tort]]/[[delict]] and specific categories of tort/delict,&lt;ref&gt;Rome II Regulation, Arts. 4 (general rule), 5 (product liability), 6 (competition), 7 (environmental damage), 8 (IP infringements), 9 (industrial action)&lt;/ref&gt; unjust enrichment,&lt;ref&gt;Rome II Regulation, Art. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''negotiorum gestio''&lt;ref&gt;Rome II Regulation, Art. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and ''culpa in contrahendo''.&lt;ref&gt;Rome II Regulation, Art. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, the parties may choose the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Rome II Regulation, Art. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous rules were established for contractual obligations by the [[Rome Convention (contract)|Rome Convention]] of 1980.  The Rome Convention has, in turn, been replaced by the [[Rome I Regulation]] on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Reg. (EC) No. 593/2008). The regulation applies to all EU member states except Denmark.

==Background==
{{Conflict of laws}}
Initially submitted by the [[European Commission|Commission]] in July 2003, an amended text was finally adopted on 11 July 2007 and published in the Official Journal on 31 July 2007.  It applies from 11 January 2009.  It may apply to obligations arising from events giving rise to damage occurring from 20 August 2007, although the text of the Regulation is unfortunately silent on this point.&lt;ref&gt;Rome II Regulation, Arts. 31-32.  See http://conflictoflaws.net/2009/rome-ii-regulation-applicable-in-eu/comment-page-1/#comment-191002/&lt;/ref&gt;

To accommodate concerns earlier raised by the [[European Parliament]] at Second Reading stage in January 2007, the Commission is mandated to draw up a study by December 2008 on applicable law in [[defamation]] and privacy disputes, which have been excluded from the Regulation as a result of the difficulties in agreeing appropriate choice of law rules for these matters.  That study has not yet been formally published.  This is in addition to their preparing a report within 4 years on the results of practical application of the Regulation, including a specific study of its effects in [[road traffic accident]] disputes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1194">The '''Spanish Constitution of 1869''' ({{lang-es|Constitucion Española}}), enacted on 1 June 1869, was the sixth [[constitution]] of the [[constitutions of Spain]] to emerge from the turbulent period in [[Spanish history]] of [[History of Spain (1814–1873)|1814-1873]].

The Constitution was adopted by the Spanish [[Provisional Government (1868-1871)|Provisional Government of 1868-1871]] which was formed after the triumph of the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 that ended the autocratic reign of [[Isabel II of Spain]], creating a constitutional monarchy, with Marshal [[Francisco Serrano, 1st Duke of la Torre]] as regent, recognizing the right of freedom of religion for the first time.  It was Magna Carta in effect during the more democratic reign of [[Amadeo I of Spain]].

}}'''Stephen Caroyl Shadegg''' (December 8, 1909 &amp;ndash; April 16, 1990) was a [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[political consultant]], [[public relations]] specialist, and author from his adopted city of [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

==Background==

Born in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota,&lt;ref name=french&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=French|editor1-first=Jack |editor2-last=Siegel|editor2-first=David S.|title=Radio Rides the Range: A Reference Guide to Western Drama on the Air, 1929-1967 |date=2014|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|pages=133–4, 179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATAFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp; |accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reared in [[Redlands, California]],&lt;ref name=ahfbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen C. Shadegg Collection|url=http://www.ahfweb.org/download/Shadegg_MSS_53.pdf|publisher=Arizona Historical Foundation |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; little is known of Shadegg's early life, including his education. He worked extensively as a writer and published hundreds of stories in [[pulp magazine]]s before his interest turned to [[politics]]. In 1932, he moved to Phoenix, where he authored [[radio]] scripts for such programs as "Tales of Pioneer Days" and "Phoenix Sun Ranch Chuck Wagon".&lt;ref name=french/&gt; He spent much of 1939–1940 in [[Hollywood]], where he wrote scripts for [[RKO Pictures]].&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Glenn|title=Stephen Shadegg, Goldwater Adviser And Alter Ego, 80|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/24/obituaries/stephen-shadegg-goldwater-adviser-and-alter-ego-80.html|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 24, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a [[Mail order|mail-order]] salesman, [[polygraph]] examiner, sheriff's deputy, an [[insurance agent]], and owned a pharmaceutical company. His public relations firm had as its principal clients the [[Phelps Dodge Corporation]] and the [[Salt River Project]]. Shadegg was considered an authority on Arizona [[water]] issues.&lt;ref name=azmemory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/landingpage/collection/ahfss|title=The Many Personas of Stephen Shadegg: Political Strategist, Author, Actor, Businessman |publisher=[[Arizona State University]] Libraries|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, he developed a political and religious philosophy based on evangelical principles and opposition to [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] [[social policy]], though he continued to worship as an [[Episcopal Church in the United States|Episcopalian]]. He was a vestryman in his Phoenix church and a figure in national Episcopalian affairs too.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Elizabeth Tandy|title=Sunbelt Capitalism: Phoenix and the Transformation of American Politics|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=163–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Gt11CF1YnQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

Over several decades Shadegg managed more than forty campaigns in Arizona for offices at all levels of government. First a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he worked on the 1942 campaign of Lon Jordan for [[sheriff]] of [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]].&lt;ref name=ahfbio/&gt; He managed his first statewide race in 1950, the reelection campaign of U.S. Senator [[Carl Hayden]] of Phoenix. By 1952, however, he had switched parties and played the same role as campaign manager for newcomer Barry Goldwater, a former [[department store]]-owner from Phoenix who challenged the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], Democrat  [[Ernest McFarland]]. Against four-to-one Democratic registration, Shadegg helped to stage a stunning upset which brought  Goldwater to the Senate in 1952, helped by the national popularity of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] that year. Shadegg was regarded as a shrewd strategist and advisor whose influence extended to the [[Republican National Committee]]. Shadegg defined a distinct western political conservatism that set the tone for many later politicians in the region. He subsequently managed all of Goldwater's successful Senate races, 1968, 1974, and 1980. He also managed the reelection of Goldwater in 1958, a very successful year for the Democrats nationwide.&lt;ref name=azmemory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Sean P.|title=American Politics in the Postwar Sunbelt: Conservative Growth in a Battleground Region|date=2014|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DazAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Shadegg was elected chairman of the [[Arizona Republican Party]]. During this time, he [[Ghostwriter|ghost authored]] a nationally [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper column, "How Do You Stand, Sir?", that appeared under Goldwater's name.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Those columns provided most of the material that appeared under Goldwater's name in ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'', a 1960 political tract written by [[L. Brent Bozell Jr.|L. Brent Bozell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Cabell|title=Why the Cheering Stopped|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/08/29/99463764.pdf |accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=New York Times|date=August 29, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered the person closest to Goldwater in political philosophy and as the craftsman of Goldwater as a staunch conservative.&lt;ref name=utexasedu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00096/cah-00096.html|title= Guide to the Stephen Shadegg/Barry Goldwater Collection, 1949-1965|publisher=lib.utexas.edu|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, at Goldwater's urging, Shadegg ran in the Republican primary for the right to challenge Senator Carl Hayden for re-election, but he lost the primary to [[Evan Mecham]], later a short-term [[governor of Arizona]]. Goldwater endorsed no candidate in the primary race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827245,00.html|title=Nation: Out from Backstage|date=April 13, 1962|magazine=[[Time magazine|Time]]|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shadegg later said that he was "terriby let down" by Goldwater's position of neutrality in the primary after Goldwater had urged Shadegg to seek the seat.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In 1964, Shadegg served as [[Western United States|western]] regional director of [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|Goldwater's unsuccessful presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goldwater Names Two Aides in West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/20/goldwater-names-two-aides-in-west.html|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=August 20, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; He managed Goldwater's unsuccessful primary race in [[Oregon]] against [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the [[governor of New York]]. For the [[general election]], his western states assignment was Region VII: Arizona, Oregon, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[New Mexico]], [[Alaska]], and [[Hawaii]]. Of those states, only Arizona voted for Goldwater and by a narrow margin over [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref name=utexasedu/&gt;

Shadegg ran several more campaigns for Republicans, both in Arizona and in several other states.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis |first1=Neil A.|title=A Freshman Who Doesn't Aim to Please... |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/31/us/a-freshman-who-doesn-t-aim-to-please.html|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=New York Times|date=October 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though associated most closely with Goldwater, he also performed campaign duties at least once for Republicans [[Karl Mundt]] of [[South Dakota]], [[Carl Curtis]] of [[Nebraska]] [[Gordon Allott]] of [[Colorado]], [[Henry Dworshak]] of Idaho, [[Edwin Keith Thomson|Keith Thomson]] of Wyoming, [[Andrew Frank Schoeppel]] of [[Kansas]], [[Paul Laxalt]] of Nevada, and [[John Tower]] of [[Texas]]. He was also retained by [[Rockefeller Republicans|Moderate Republican]] U.S. Senators [[Margaret Chase Smith]] of [[Maine]], [[John Sherman Cooper]] of [[Kentucky]], [[Clifford P. Case]] of [[New Jersey]], and [[Leverett Saltonstall]] of [[Massachusetts]]. He managed the successful gubernatorial campaigns in Arizona of [[Paul Fannin]] and [[Jack Richard Williams]], the latter of whom called Shadegg "a real innovator in political campaigns." Shadegg directed the five congressional campaigns of [[U.S. Representative]] [[Eldon Rudd]] of [[Arizona's 4th congressional district]] from 1977 to 1987, for whom he was chief strategist and speechwriter.&lt;ref name=aarchives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/asu/shadegg.xml;query=|title=Stephen C. Shadegg Papers|publisher=azarchivesonline.org|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary life==

In August 1964, he published ''How to Win an Election: The Art of Political Victory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perlstein|first1=Rick|title=Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus|date=2001|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |page=524n22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DG3BE0C0VkAC&amp;pg=PA524&amp;|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book frankly describes Shadegg's belief that voters who are indifferent to issues, who are easily led to vote even against their own interests, provide the margin of victory in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=Stanley|title=Interpreting Elections |date=1983 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=145–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsr_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp; |accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Goldwater's defeat, he published an insider's account of the campaign, ''What Happened to Goldwater?'', that revealed that Goldwater's national campaign manager, [[Denison Kitchel]], also of Phoenix, had been an early member of the [[John Birch Society]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer recommended the book: "students of political organization and political philosophy will find many other minor fascinations in these pages, not least of which is the author's ambivalent attitude toward his hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fremont-Smith|first1=Eliot|title=How to Lose an Election|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/08/03/97216439.pdf |accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=New York Times|date=August 3, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadegg in 1970 authored ''Claire Boothe Luce: A Biography'', which appeared in 1971. [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], described it as "favorable, but not gushy" and wrote that its "principal failure" was "that somehow it does not sufficiently communicate the flavor of her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buckley|first1=William F.|title=Claire Boothe Luce|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/04/11/82002541.pdf|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=New York Times|date=April 11, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luce had given Shadegg access to her papers and press clippings, and he defended himself against suggestions that she exercised control over what he wrote and that he had not interviewed widely. Shadegg said that the "more romantic story" some wanted about the Republican [[secular icon|icon]] would not have been accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shadegg|first1=Stephen|title=Letters: Claire Boothe Luce |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/08/08/90684873.pdf|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=New York Times|date=August 8, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he published ''The New How to Win an Election'', which [[Jeff Greenfield]] called "staggeringly unreadable" and criticized for relying too closely on his earlier book, with its regional focus and [[Eisenhower]]-era issues and for lacking updated material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenfield|first1=Jeff|title=The Process of Politics|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/06/04/103477394.pdf|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=New York Times|date=June 4, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have found Shadegg's emphasis on developing networks of interpersonal communication, which he called ''social precincts'', an early articulation of a strategy now widely-recognized as important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trent |first1=Judith S.|last2=Friedenberg|first2=Robert V.|last3=Denton Jr.|first3=Robert E.|title=Political Campaign Communication: Principles and Practices|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=317–8 |edition=7th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkZE-AE956YC&amp;pg=PA317&amp;|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He collaborated with Goldwater on the latter's political memoir ''With No Apologies'', which appeared in 1979. Following its publication by [[William Morrow &amp; Company]], the two successfully sued their original publisher [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] for rejecting the manuscript after failing to respond to their requests for editorial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Goldwater Wins Book Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/06/books/goldwater-wins-book-suit.html |accessdate=August 29, 2014 |work=New York Times|date=February 6, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, he published a memoir: ''Arizona Politics: The Struggle to End One-Party Rule''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer |first1=Elizabeth Tandy|title=Sunbelt Capitalism: Phoenix and the Transformation of American Politics |date=2013 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |page=276n33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Gt11CF1YnQC&amp;pg=PA376&amp; |accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadegg's papers are held at the Arizona Historical Foundation in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuscripts - S |url=http://www.ahfweb.org/collections_manuscripts_S.htm|website=Arizona Historical Foundation|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and death==

Shadegg married Eugenia Kerr, who died in 1988. They had four children, Stephen David Shadegg (1947–2009), who died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while camping in the northern Arizona mountains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tucson/obituary.aspx?pid=134642047|title=Stephen David Shadegg|newspaper=[[The Arizona Star]] |location=[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Shadegg|John Barden Shadegg]], Cynthia S. Ackel, and Eugenia S. Johnson, all born in Phoenix.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

Stephen Shadegg died of [[cancer]] at his Phoenix home at the age of eighty on April 16, 1990.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Younger son John Shadegg managed Arizona political campaigns as had his father, served as a [[U.S. Representative]] from Arizona from 1995 to 2011,&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; and then joined the staff of the [[Goldwater Institute]] in Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldwaterinstitute.org/article/congressman-john-shadegg-named-goldwater-institute-senior-fellow|title=Congressman John Shadegg named Goldwater Institute Senior Fellow|date=January 4, 2011|publisher=goldwaterinstitute.org|accessdate=August 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903145013/http://goldwaterinstitute.org/article/congressman-john-shadegg-named-goldwater-institute-senior-fellow|archivedate=September 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{politics of Brazil}}
The '''Supreme Federal Court''' ({{lang-pt|Supremo Tribunal Federal}}, {{IPA-pt|suˈpɾẽmu tɾibuˈnaw fedeˈɾaw|}}, abbreviated '''STF''') is the [[supreme court]] (court of last resort) of [[Brazil]], serving primarily as the [[Constitutional Court]] of the country. It is the highest [[court of law]] in Brazil for constitutional issues and its rulings cannot be appealed. On questions involving exclusively non-constitutional issues, regarding federal laws, the highest court is, by rule, the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]].

Alongside its appeal competence, mostly by the Extraordinary Appeal ({{lang|pt|Recurso Extraordinário}}), the Court has a small range of cases of [[original jurisdiction]], including the power of [[judicial review]], judging the [[constitutionality]] of laws passed by the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], through a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality ({{lang|pt|Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade}}, or ADI). There are also other mechanisms for reaching the Court directly, such as the Declaratory Action of Constitutionality ({{lang|pt|Ação Declaratória de Constitucionalidade}}, or ADC) and the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality by Omission ({{lang|pt|Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade por Omissão}} or ADO).

The eleven [[judge]]s of the court are called Ministers ({{lang|pt|Ministro}}), although having no similarity with the government body of [[minister (government)|minister]]s. They are appointed by the [[President of Brazil|President]] and approved by the [[Federal Senate of Brazil|Senate]]. There is no term length but a [[mandatory retirement]] age of 75.

All judicial and administrative meetings of the Supreme Court have been broadcast live on [[television]] since 2002. The Court is open for the public to watch the meetings.

In May 2009 ''[[The Economist]]'' called the Supreme Federal Court "the most overburdened court in the world, thanks to a plethora of rights and privileges entrenched in the country's 1988 constitution (...) till recently the tribunal's decisions did not bind lower courts. The result was a court that is overstretched to the point of mutiny. The Supreme Court received 100,781 cases last year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/world/americas/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13707663 |title=Brazil's supreme court: When less is more |date=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The court was inaugurated during the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial era]] in 1808, the year that the [[royal family]] of [[Portugal]] (the [[House of Braganza]]) arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It was originally called the '''House of Appeals of Brazil''' ({{lang|pt|Casa de Suplicação do Brasil}}).

The proclamation of the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence]] and the adoption of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Imperial Constitution]] in 1824 preceded the establishment of the '''Supreme Court of Justice''' ({{lang|pt|Supremo Tribunal de Justiça}}) in 1829. With the first [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of the Republic]], the current Court was established.

Although the constitutional norms that regulated the creation of the Court allowed [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], Brazil's first president, to nominate an entirely new Court, the president chose to nominate as the first members of the Supreme Federal Court the ministers who were then serving as members of the predecessor imperial Court.

Two hundred members have served on the Court. The [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1891]] decided that the Court would have 15 members. When [[Getúlio Vargas]] came into power, the number of members was reduced to 11. The number was changed to 16 in 1965, but returned to 11 in 1969 and has not changed since. Of all Presidents of Brazil, only one ([[Café Filho]]) never nominated a minister.

==President of the Court==
The President and Vice-president of the Court are elected by their peers for a term of two years by [[secret ballot]]. The currently serving President is [[Dias Toffoli]].

Re-election for a consecutive term is not allowed. By tradition, the members of the Court always elect as president the most senior minister of the Court that has not yet served as President, to avoid politicization of the Court. Therefore, it is known beforehand that the next Presidents of the Court, after Dias Toffoli, will be, in order, [[Luiz Fux]] and [[Rosa Weber]].

If all members currently sitting on the Court have already served as president, the rotation starts all over again; however, due to the existence of a compulsory retirement age, and the consequent appointment of new ministers to fill those vacancies, it is very rare for the cycle to be completed and restarted, and some ministers are forced to retire before their turn in the presidency arrives, as was expected to happen with [[Teori Zavascki]].

According to the same convention, the Court selects as vice-president for a certain term the minister who, according to that tradition, will be selected president in the succeeding term. Also by tradition, the elections of the president and vice-president are never unanimous, there being always one isolated minority vote in each election, as the ministers who are to be elected never cast their votes for themselves; such votes are cast either for the Dean of the Court – its most senior member – or for some other elder minister that the one to be elected admires and wants to pay homage to.

The Chief Justice is also the 4th in the [[Brazilian presidential line of succession|Presidential Succession Line]], when the [[President of Brazil]] becomes prevented to be in charge, being preceded by the [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice-President]], the President of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]], and the President of the [[Federal Senate]], as provided in Article 80 of the [[Brazilian Constitution]].&lt;ref name="CF"&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm Brazilian Constitution] ''(in Portuguese)''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Common Law''''' is a [[book]] that was written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title= The Common Law |last=Holmes, Jr.   |first= O.W. |authorlink=  |editor = |year= 1882 |publisher= Macmillan |location=London |edition=1 |volume= |isbn= |page=|pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft |accessdate=23 September 2015}} via Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; 21 years before Holmes became an [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

The book is about [[common law]] in the United States, including torts, property, contracts, and crime.  It is written as a series of lectures. It has gone out of copyright and is available in full on the web at [[Project Gutenberg]].

One of the most famous aphorisms to be drawn from this book occurs on the first page: "The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience." Holmes's pronouncement is a subtle qualification of a [[dictum]] by the famous seventeenth-century English jurist [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]]: "Reason is the life of the law."&lt;ref&gt;E Coke, ''Commentary Upon Littleton'' (1628) 97b&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''Tolofson v Jensen''''', [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022 is a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on [[conflict of laws]] in [[tort]]. The Court held that the primary determiner in selecting a country's law in tort should be the ''[[lex loci]]'' (the location where the tort occurred). The case was decided with '''''Lucas (Litigation guardian of) v Gagnon'''''.

==Background==
Prior to this case, the leading case on the matter was ''[[McLean v Pettigrew]]'', [1945] S.C.R. 62 which stated that the [[proper law]] to apply would always be the ''[[lex fori]]'', the local law of the court, irrespective of the connection with the jurisdiction.

===Tolofson case===
A father and son from British Columbia are driving in Saskatchewan and are in a motor vehicle accident with Leroy Jensen, a resident of Saskatchewan. The son, Kim Tolofson, sues both Jensen and his father. Under Saskatchewan law the claimant must prove gross negligence in order for a gratuitous passenger to recover and the limitation period is 12 months. Kim did not sue for six years once he became 18 years old.

===Lucas case===
The Gagnon family from Ontario were driving in Quebec and were in a motor vehicle accident with Mr. Lavoie, a Quebec resident. No action was allowed under Quebec no-fault system.

==Ruling of the Court==
Justice La Forest wrote for the majority. He considered the issue of territorial limits of jurisdiction. He concluded that the general policy interests were those of order and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 1050-1051&lt;/ref&gt; He was highly concerned of confusion resulting from complex rules.

La Forest explicitly stated that exceptions to this rule should be rare. He argued that exceptions would "encourage frivolous cross-claims and joinders of third parties", it would create uncertainty, discourage judges to make summary judgments, and would discourage settlement. He contemplated that there may be exception at the international level where there may be injustice&lt;ref&gt;at 307 he stated "However, because a rigid rule on the international level could give rise to injustice, in certain circumstances, I am not averse to retaining a discretion in the court to apply our own law to deal with such circumstances.  I can, however, imagine few cases where this would be necessary."&lt;/ref&gt; or where both parties are [[Domicile (law)|domicile]]d in the forum.&lt;ref&gt;p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta later enacted a ''Limitations Act'' (R.S.A. 2000, c. L‑12, s. 12) to get around the result in Tolofson.

Subsequent cases have considered the limits of the exception to the Tolofson rule. In ''Hanlan v Sernesky'' (1998, Ont.CA) where the court found exception to the rule on an international matter. However, similar reasoning was rejected on provincial matters in ''Leornard v Houle'' (1997, Ont.CA).

[[Point source pollution|Point source]] water pollution comes from discrete conveyances and alters the chemical, biological, and physical characteristics of water. In the United States, it is largely regulated by the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. {{uspl|92|500}}. Approved October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the Act requires dischargers to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to legally discharge pollutants into a water body. However, point source pollution remains an issue in some water bodies, due to some limitations of the Act. Consequently, other regulatory approaches have emerged, such as water quality trading and voluntary community-level efforts.

==Introduction==
[[File:Common Point Source Discharges - EPA 2010.png|thumb|Common point source discharges]]

===Definition===
[[Water pollution]] is the contamination of natural water bodies by chemical, physical, radioactive or pathogenic microbial substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=Michael C |title=Water pollution |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Water_pollution?topic=58075 |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Point sources of water pollution are described by the CWA as "any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance from which pollutants are or may be discharged." These include pipes or man-made ditches&lt;ref name="EPA NPDES basics"&gt;{{cite web|title=NPDES Permit Basics |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) |date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from stationary locations such as [[sewage treatment]] plants, factories, [[industrial wastewater treatment]] facilities, [[Septic tank|septic systems]], [[Environmental impact of shipping|ships]], and other sources that are clearly discharging pollutants into water sources.

===Relevant science===
The input of pollutants into a water body may impact the water's ability to deliver ecological, recreational, educational, and economic services. While the impacts of water pollution vary considerably based on a variety of site-specific factors, they may be either direct or indirect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=H.A.|title=Biology of Water Pollution: Effects and Control|journal=Biochem J|year=1972|volume=4|issue=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollutants that are directly [[Toxicity|toxic]] pose a threat to organisms that may come into contact with contaminated water. These include persistent organic pollutants used as [[pesticide]]s and toxic byproducts of industrial activity (such as [[cyanide]]). Other pollutants may indirectly impact ecosystem services by causing a change in water conditions that allows for a harmful activity to take place. This includes sediment (loose [[soil]]) inputs that decrease the amount of light that can penetrate through the water, reducing plant growth and diminishing oxygen availability for other aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=wetzel&gt;{{cite book |last=Wetzel |first=Robert |title=Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems |year=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-744760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of [[water quality]] parameters that may be affected by point source water pollution. They include: [[dissolved oxygen]] and [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD), temperature, [[pH]], [[turbidity]], [[phosphorus]], [[nitrate]]s, [[total suspended solids]], [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], [[alkalinity]], and [[fecal coliform]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite report |author= |date=November 1997 |title=Volunteer Stream Monitoring, A Methods Manual |url=http://www.epa.gov/quality/volunteer-stream-monitoring-methods-manual-november-1997 |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 5: Water Quality Conditions: Monitoring &amp; Assessment |page= |id=EPA-841-B-97-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that much of the point source water pollution in the United States comes from municipal wastewater treatment plants, BOD is perhaps the most widely used metric to assess water quality.

Water quality is also closely linked with water quantity issues.&lt;ref name=wetzel /&gt; Water shortages from natural and anthropogenic activity reduce the dilutive properties of water and may concentrate water pollution. Oppositely, during flooding events, water pollution may spread to previously uncontaminated waters through surface overflow or the failure of man-made barriers.

===Nature of the problem/context===

====Water pollution incidents and public response====
Before the CWA was enacted, companies indiscriminately discharged their effluents into water bodies. One such water body was the [[Cuyahoga River]] located in north-east [[Ohio]]. The river was thrust into the national limelight in 1969 when it caught fire, although the river had been plagued by fires since 1936. Pollution of the river had become prevalent in the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Cuyahoga River|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/fenlewis/History.html|publisher=Grc.nasa.gov|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; as contaminants from municipal and industrial discharges, bank [[Erosion#Water|erosion]], commercial/residential [[Land development|development]], atmospheric deposition, [[hazardous waste]] disposal sites, [[urban runoff|urban storm water runoff]], [[combined sewer overflow]]s (CSOs) and wastewater treatment plant bypasses were discharged into the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Cuyahoga River AOC |url=http://www.epa.gov/cuyahoga-river-aoc/about-cuyahoga-river-aoc |publisher=EPA |location=Chicago, IL |date=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine described the Cuyahoga as the river that "oozes rather than flows" and in which a person "does not drown but decays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=America's Sewage System and the Price of Optimism |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901182,00.html#ixzz1K5uDy6yShttp://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901182,00.html |work=Time Magazine |accessdate=April 19, 2011|date=August 1, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 river fire, and the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]] in California—the largest such spill in U.S. history at that time—drew significant public attention to the state of the nation's waterways. Although Congress had been holding hearings and considering additional pollution control legislation in the late 1960s, these widely publicized incidents increased the pressure on Congress to act, which they eventually did with the 1972 Clean Water Act, the establishment of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and later the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Pollution |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/pollution/02history.html |date=2008-03-25 |publisher=U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory framework==

===History of regulation===
Historically, regulation of point source water pollution in the United States included health- and use-based standards to protect environmental and economic interests. The [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]] contained provisions that made discharging refuse matter into navigable waters of the United States illegal without a permit issued by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref name="FWS law database"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Resource Laws |url=http://fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/Resourcelaws.html |publisher=US FWS |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act. {{uspl|80|845}} Approved June 30, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The law authorized the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] and the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] to develop programs to combat pollution that was harming surface and underground water sources, but did not create any new regulatory or enforcement authority for pollution control. The FWPCA also authorized cooperation between federal and state agencies to construct waste treatment plants.

The ''Water Quality Act of 1965'' required states to issue water quality standards for interstate waters, and authorized the newly created Federal Water Pollution Control Administration to set standards where states failed to do so. No mechanism for federal enforcement was established.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Water Quality Act of 1965. {{uspl|89|234}}. Approved October 2, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1966 ''Clean Water Restoration Act'' authorized a study to determine the effects of pollution on wildlife, recreation, and water supplies. The Act also set forth guidelines for abatement of water that may flow into international territory and prohibited the dumping of oil into navigable waters of the United States.&lt;ref name="FWS law database" /&gt;

The ''Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970'' required the development of certain water quality standards and expanded federal authority in upholding the standards.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970. {{uspl|91|224}} Approved April 3, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The most substantial amendments to the FWPCA occurred in 1972 and became known as the ''Clean Water Act.''&lt;ref name="FWS law database" /&gt;

===Clean Water Act===
Point source water pollution is largely regulated through the [[Clean Water Act]], which gives the EPA the authority to set limits on the acceptable amount of pollutants that can be discharged into waters of the United States. The 1972 law also created federal authority for a permit system—NPDES—to enforce the pollution standards. The Act broadly defines a pollutant as any type of industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water, such as: dredged soil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste.&lt;ref name="EPA NPDES basics"/&gt; [[Point source water pollution]] is discharged into waters through both direct and indirect methods.

====Indirect point source water pollution====
An indirect discharger is one that sends its wastewater into a city sewer system, which carries it to the municipal sewage treatment plant or [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW).&lt;ref name="EPA pretreatment"&gt;{{cite web |title=National Pretreatment Program: Implementation |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-pretreatment-program#implementation |publisher=EPA |date=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the POTW, harmful pollutants in [[domestic sewage]], called [[conventional pollutant]]s, are removed from the sewage and then the treated effluent is discharged into a surface water body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pretreatment Program |url=http://cfpub1.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=3 |publisher=EPA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308130524/http://cfpub1.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=3 |archivedate=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removed solids constitute [[sewage sludge]], which typically receive further treatment prior to final disposal on land. (''See'' [[Sewage sludge treatment]].) POTWs are not designed to treat toxic or nonconventional pollutants in industrial wastewater, although they may incidentally remove some pollutants.

=====National Pretreatment Program=====
Indirect dischargers are covered by the National Pretreatment Program, which enforces three types of discharge standards:
* prohibited discharge standards – protects against pollutants passing through the POTW untreated, and preventing interference with POTW treatment processes
* categorical standards – national, technology-based standards for industrial categories that limit the discharge of pollutants (''see'' [[Effluent guidelines]])
* local limits – address the specific needs of a POTW and its receiving waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pretreatment Roles and Responsibilities: Industrial Users |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pretreatment-roles-and-responsibilities#industrial |publisher=EPA |date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the pretreatment program is to protect municipal wastewater treatment plants from damage that may occur when hazardous, toxic, or other wastes are discharged into a sewer system, and to protect the quality of sludge generated by these plants. Discharges to a POTW are regulated either by the POTW itself, the state/tribe, or EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pretreatment Roles and Responsibilities: Control Authorities |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pretreatment-roles-and-responsibilities#controlauth |publisher=EPA |date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Direct point source water pollution====
[[File:2008 DeerIsland BostonHarbor DocSearls 2452880753.jpg|thumb|[[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant]], serving the [[Boston, Massachusetts]] area]]
Direct discharges are pollutants that are discharged directly into the water.&lt;ref name="waterpermitting101"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Permitting 101|url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/101pape.pdf|publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; To legally discharge pollutants directly into a waterbody, a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit must be obtained.

=====NPDES Permit Program=====
The [[NPDES]] permit program sets limits on the amount of pollutants that can be discharged into a waterbody. Technology based effluent limits establish a minimum level of pollution controls for all point source discharges. If technology based limits are not sufficient to protect a particular water body, then water quality based effluent limits are developed for facilities discharging to that water body.&lt;ref name="waterpermitting101" /&gt;

;Permits
Individual states are authorized by the EPA to issue permits when they have demonstrated that their program is at least as stringent as the EPA's program.&lt;ref name="introcwa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Clean Water Act |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/acad2000/cwa/cwa38.htm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; States perform the day-to-day issuance of permits and oversight of the program while the EPA provides review and guidance to the states.&lt;ref name="introcwa" /&gt;  All NPDES permits must contain a "specific, numeric, measurable set of limits on the amount of various pollutants that can appear in the wastewater discharged by the facility into the nation's waters" as well as guidelines on how often monitoring should be performed and what "sampling and analytic techniques should be used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Clean Water Act |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/acad2000/cwa/cwa40.htm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Types of permits
* '''Individual''' – A unique permit is issued for each discharger.
* '''General''' – A single permit that covers a large number of similar dischargers in a specific geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NPDES Individual and General Permits |url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/permitissuance/genpermits.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the EPA [[Vessels General Permit]] and [[industrial stormwater]] general permits.

;Permitting process
The authorized 	permit issuing body receives and reviews the permit application. The technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits are developed and then compared to determine which is the more stringent, which is then used as the effluent limit for the permit. Monitoring requirements, special conditions, and standard conditions for each pollutant are developed and the permit is then issued and its requirements are implemented.&lt;ref name="waterpermitting101" /&gt;

* '''Technology-based requirements:''' A minimum level of treatment based on available treatment technologies is required for discharged pollutants, however, a discharger may use any available treatment technologies to meet the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Quality and Technology-Based Permitting |url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/generalissues/watertechnology.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521214532/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/generalissues/watertechnology.cfm |archivedate=May 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effluent limits are derived from different standards for different discharges:
** '''Municipal discharges (POTW):''' National [[secondary treatment]] standards define limits of biological treatment standards based on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and pH balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Technology-based Effluent Limits |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/chapt_05.pdf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Non-municipal discharges:''' Limits for non-municipal (e.g. industrial) discharges are based on national discharge standards for industrial facilities within a certain category (''see'' [[Effluent guidelines]]). These limits are achieved for using pollution control and prevention technologies designed for different types of dischargers.&lt;ref name="effluent41"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Clean Water Act: Effluent Limits |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/acad2000/cwa/cwa41.htm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For existing dischargers, this level of treatment is equivalent to "[[Best available technology|Best Available Technology Economically Achievable]]" (BAT) and for new discharges, the treatment level is "[[New Source Performance Standard#Clean Water Act|New Source Performance Standards]]" (NSPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Tenets of the NPDES Permitting Program|url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/tenets.pdf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Water quality-based requirements:''' Should technology-based standards not be stringent enough, Water Quality Based Effluent Limits (WQBEL) are developed to ensure that water quality standards are attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Water Quality-Based Effluent Limits |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/chapt_06.pdf |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; WQBELs are based on ambient water quality standards.&lt;ref name="effluent41" /&gt;

;Permit components
All NPDES permits must contain the following five components:&lt;ref name="waterpermitting101" /&gt;
* Cover page – indicates authorization for discharging and its locations
* Effluent limits – limits used to control discharges through technology-based or water quality-based standards
* Monitoring and reporting requirements – used to determine permit compliance
* Special conditions – can be used to supplement effluent limits
* Standard conditions – pre-established conditions that apply to all NPDES permits

;Permit violation
A permitee can be in violation of their permit when they discharge pollutants at a level higher than what is specified on their permit or discharge without a permit. They can also be in violation if they fail to comply with the monitoring and enforcement portion of the permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Clean Water Act: Permit Violations |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/acad2000/cwa/cwa50.htm|publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Enforcement
Since the NPDES permit program is a self-monitoring system where permitees are required to carry out detailed monitoring requirements, the EPA promotes "compliance assistance" as an enforcement technique, which "helps permittees come into, and remain, in compliance with their permit, rather than going immediately to enforcement actions."&lt;ref name="enforcement51"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Clean Water Act: Enforcement |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/acad2000/cwa/cwa51.htm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA and state NPDES agencies have can perform periodic inspections and the EPA gives individual states the authority to enforce NPDES permits although the EPA has the right to carry out enforcement should a state not do so. Enforcement actions for violations include: injunctions, fines for typical violations, imprisonment for criminal violations, or supplemental environmental projects (SEP). Citizens may also bring suits against violators but they must first provide the EPA and state NPDES permit agency with the opportunity to take action.&lt;ref name="enforcement51" /&gt;

=====Stormwater management permits=====
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|A [[silt fence]], a type of [[sediment control]], installed on a construction site]]
To address the nationwide problem of [[stormwater]] pollution, Congress broadened the CWA definition of "point source" in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and municipal separate [[storm sewer]] systems ("MS4").&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987, {{uspl|100|4}}, February 4, 1987. Added CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities are required to obtain NPDES permits. This 1987 expansion was promulgated in two phases. The Phase I regulation, promulgated in 1990, required that all [[municipality|municipalities]] of 100,000 persons or more, [[industrial stormwater|industrial dischargers]], and [[construction]] sites of 5 acres (20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or more have NPDES permits for their stormwater discharges.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1990-11-16). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/stormwater_phase1_rule.pdf "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Application Regulations for Storm Water Discharges"]. ''Federal Register,'' 44 FR 47990.&lt;/ref&gt; Phase I permits were issued in much of the U.S. in 1991. The Phase II rule required that all municipalities, construction sites of 1 acre (4,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or more, and other large property owners (such as [[school district]]s) have NPDES permits for their stormwater discharges. EPA published the Phase II regulation in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-rules-and-notices |title=Stormwater Rules and Notices |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-06 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 855 Phase I MS4s and 6,695 Phase II MS4s are regulated by the permit system, as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-municipal-sources#overview |title=Overview |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017-07-21 |website=NPDES / Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Sources |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most construction sites are covered by general permits. Other industrial sites that only discharge stormwater are typically covered by general permits.&lt;ref&gt;EPA's general permit for industrial stormwater is called the [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-industrial-activities#msgp "Multi-Sector General Permit"] (MSGP). Similar general permits are issued by each of the 47 NPDES-authorized states.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrial stormwater]] dischargers that are otherwise required to have individual permits (due to their [[Industrial wastewater treatment|process wastewater]] and/or [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water]] discharges), typically have the stormwater management requirements added to their individual permits.

In addition to implementing the NPDES requirements, many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances, and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Maryland Department of the Environment (2009). Baltimore, MD. [http://mde.maryland.gov/programs/water/StormwaterManagementProgram/Pages/stormwater_design.aspx "Maryland Stormwater Design Manual."]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these state and local requirements have expanded coverage beyond the federal requirements. For example, the State of [[Maryland]] requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft (460 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or more.&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland. ''Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR).'' [http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/26/26.17.01.05.htm ''Activities for Which Approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plans are Required.''] Sec. 26.17.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for state agencies to revise their requirements and impose them upon counties and cities; daily fines ranging as high as $25,000 can be imposed for failure to modify their local stormwater permitting for construction sites, for instance.

===Others===

====EPA water quality trading policy====
The Clean Water Act has made great strides in reducing point source water pollution, but this effect is overshadowed by the fact that [[nonpoint source pollution]], which is not subject to regulation under the Act, has correspondingly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huang |first=Yee |title=Why the EPA May Be About to Take Big Steps to Clean Up Our Water |url=http://www.alternet.org/water/134636/why_the_epa_may_be_about_to_take_big_steps_to_clean_up_our_water/ |publisher=AlterNet |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the solutions to address this imbalance is point/nonpoint source trading of pollutants. In January 2003, the EPA Water Quality Trading Policy was issued. At this time, many waters in the United States did not support their designated uses. Specifically, 40 percent of rivers, 45 percent of streams, and 50 percent of lakes that had been surveyed were unfit. Consequently, when The Water Quality Trading Policy was issued it acknowledged that "the progress made toward restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters under the 1972 Clean Water Act and its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits has been incomplete."&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Water Quality Trading Assessment Handbook |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading/upload/2004_11_08_watershed_trading_handbook_national-wqt-handbook-2004.pdf|publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the policy is to "encourage voluntary trading programs that facilitate the implementation of TMDLs, reduce the costs of compliance with CWA regulations, establish incentives for voluntary reductions, and promote watershed-based initiatives (3).&lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Water Quality Trading Policy |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading/finalpolicy2003.cfm|publisher=EPA |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The policy supports the trading of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and sediment load reductions, but in order for it to be extended to other contaminants, more scrutiny is required.&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet on Final Water Quality Trading Policy |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading/2003factsheet.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All water quality trading programs are subject to the requirements of the Clean Water Act.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Water Quality Trading |url=http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/trading/tradingfaq.cfm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trading Policy outlines basic ground rules for trading by specifying viable pollutants, how to set baselines, and detailing the components of credible trading programs. It also stipulates that trades must occur within the same watershed.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt; Water quality trading programs are subject to the stipulations of the Clean Water Act.&lt;ref name="policy" /&gt;

====Other laws that may affect some NPDES permits====
* [[Endangered Species Act]]: Federal agencies must consult with the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] to ensure that discharges from a project (e.g., a new or expanded industrial facility) will not endanger a threatened species or their habitat.&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Other Federal Laws |url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/fedlaws.cfm?program_id=45 |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA): Only discharges that are subject to New Source Performance Standards (or new sources otherwise defined in the NPDES regulations) are subject to NEPA review prior to being issued a permit.&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws" /&gt;
* [[National Historic Preservation Act]]: Prior to issuing a permit, EPA Regional Administrators must adopt measures that mitigate adverse effects on properties in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws" /&gt;
* [[Coastal Zone Management Act]]:  Permits will not be issued unless the permitees certifies that proposed activities, which would affect land or water use in coastal zones, comply with the Coastal Zone Management Act.&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws" /&gt;
* [[Wild and Scenic Rivers Act]]: Prohibits issuance of permit for water resources projects that will have a direct, adverse effect on the values for which a national wild and scenic river was established.&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws" /&gt;
* [[Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act]]: Jurisdiction over wildlife resources must be established prior to permit issuance so that resources can be conserved.&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws" /&gt;
* ''Magnuson-Stevens Act:'' The "Essential Fish Habitat Provisions" in the law require EPA to consult with the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] for any EPA-issued permits which may adversely affect essential fish habitat.&lt;ref name="otherfedlaws" /&gt;

==Problems/issues/concerns==

===Funding===

====Cost issues for monitoring====
Monitoring of water bodies is the responsibility of authorized states, not the EPA. In 1997, EPA estimated that private and public point source control costs were $14 billion and $34 billion, respectively. The EPA has acknowledged that states have not adequately funded their monitoring programs, which has led to some uncertainty regarding the quality of most surface waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Clean Water Act: Monitoring |url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/watershed/wacademy/acad2000/cwa/cwa22.htm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===

====Self-monitoring and self-reporting====
In many cases, the enforcement mechanisms of the Clean Water Act have created tension between regulators, regulated parties, and local citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandiberg |first=Susan |title=Fault lines in the Clean Water Act: criminal enforcement, continuing violations, and mental state |journal=Environmental Law |year=2003 |volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most NPDES permits require dischargers to monitor and report the contents of their discharges to the appropriate authorities. This requirement is potentially self-incriminating, forcing industries to provide information that may subject them to penalties and legal constraints. As a result, some dischargers go to great lengths to avoid penalties, including falsifying discharge monitoring reports and tampering with monitoring equipment. In ''United States v. Hopkins'', the court ruled on a case where the vice president for manufacturing at Spirol International Corporation was charged with three criminal violations for falsifying water samples sent to state regulatory agencies.&lt;ref name="us v hopkins"&gt;{{cite book |title=United States v. Hopkins |year=1995 |format=53 F.3d 533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirol diluted his samples, which contained high levels of [[zinc]], with tap water on numerous occasions and frequently ordered his subordinates to reduce the zinc concentration in the water by running it through a coffee filter.

====Tensions between state and federal government====
Like other environmental laws, the Clean Water Act delegates many enforcement responsibilities to state agencies. While the burden of enforcement may be transferred to the states, federal agencies reserve the right to approve or reject state plans for dealing with water pollution. This relationship reduces the regulatory burden on federal agencies, but can lead to confusion and tension between the two regulators.

Many of these tensions arise with regards to the [[commerce clause]] of the constitution. Until recently, the commerce clause has given the federal government considerable authority in regulating states' decisions about water use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austin |first=Jay |author2=D. Bruce Meyers Jr |title=Anchoring the Clean Water Act: Congress' Constitutional Sources of Power to Protect the Nation's Waters|year=2007|series=American Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled on ''[[Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers|Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. US Army Corps of Engineers]].'' This ruling struck down the Corps' ability to prevent the construction of a disposal site for non-hazardous waste in Illinois based on power derived from the commerce clause.&lt;ref name=swancc&gt;{{cite book |chapter=SWANCC v. Army Corps of Engineers |year=2000 |title=531 U.S. 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corps cited the [[Migratory Bird Rule]] when they initially denied the section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act. The migratory bird rule was meant to protect habitats used by migratory birds, which included the abandoned mining site that SWANCC had proposed to construct the waste disposal site. [[Chief Justice Rehnquist]] wrote: "Congress passes the CWA for the state purpose of 'restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.' In doing so,, Congress chose to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and use... of land and water resources...".&lt;ref name=swancc /&gt; In reversing the Corps' decision to issue a permit, the court reversed a trend and placed a check on federal power over state land use and water rights. Tensions between federal and state agencies concerning interstate commerce and point source water pollution continue, and are a reality of the Clean Water Act.

===Ambiguity of the CWA===

====''Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council''====
In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled on ''[[Coeur Alaska, Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council]].''&lt;ref name=coeur&gt;{{cite book |title=Coeur Alaska v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council |year=2009 |format=129 S.Ct. 2458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the re-opening of a gold mine outside [[Juneau, Alaska]] that had been out of operation since 1928. Coeur Alaska planned to utilize [[froth flotation]] in order to extract gold, creating 4.5 million tons of [[tailings]] over the course of its lifetime. The mining company opted to dispose of the tailings in nearby Lower Slate Lake, requiring a permit to comply with the Clean Water Act. The tailings would fundamentally change the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake, raising the lake bed by 50 feet and expanding the area from 23 to 60 acres. Coeur Alaska proposed to temporarily re-route nearby streams around Lower Slate Lake until they could purify the water and re-introduce the natural flow patterns.

Tailings from froth flotation contain high concentrations of heavy metals, including aluminum, which have toxic effects of aquatic organisms. As a result, the disposal of these tailings into Lower Slate Lake is eligible for a section 402 permit for discharge of a pollutant from the EPA (NPDES permit). The nature of the tailings also justifies their categorization as a fill material, or a "material [that] has the effect of… changing the bottom elevation" of a water body.&lt;ref name=coeur /&gt; Consequently, Coeur Alaska was also eligible for a "Dredge and Fill" permit from the Army Corps of Engineers under CWA section 404. The company applied for this latter permit and received authorization from the Corps to dump the tailings into Lower Slate Lake. The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council contended that disposal of the tailings is explicitly banned by section 306(e) of the Clean Water Act, and would therefore make Coeur Alaska ineligible for a NPDES permit.

The Court ruled in favor of Coeur Alaska, explaining that if the Army Corps of Engineers has authority to issue a permit under section 404, the EPA does not have authority to issue a section 402 permit. They asserted that the law is ambiguous as to whether section 306 applies to fill materials and found no erroneous or unreasonable behavior by the Corps. As a result, although the tailings would explicitly violate the Clean Water Act under section 402, the Corps may issue a dredge and fill permit.

This decision has not resonated well with environmental groups, who are worried that the decision may allow companies to discharge massive amounts of hazardous pollutants by avoiding the NPDES permitting procedure.&lt;ref name="golden coeur"&gt;{{cite news|last=Golden|first=Kate|title=Coeur Alaska Wins Supreme Court Case |url=http://juneauempire.com/stories/062309/loc_453703862.shtml |newspaper=Juneau Empire |date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern is the mountaintop mining industry, which has the capacity to fundamentally alter aquatic ecosystems by filling in water bodies with sediment and mining debris. This tension between various sections within the Clean Water Act is sure to receive considerable attention in future years.

==Other emerging regulatory approaches==

===Water quality trading===

====Definition====
Water quality trading (WQT) is a market-based approach, implemented on a watershed-scale, used to improve or maintain [[water quality]]. It involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control. WQT programs are still subject to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, but they can be used to reduce the overall cost of compliance. Usually, permitted point sources of water pollution, such as wastewater treatment plants, have high discharge treatment costs, whereas nonpoint sources of water pollution, such as agriculture, have low costs of pollution reduction. Therefore, it is generally assumed that most trades would take place between point sources and nonpoint sources.&lt;ref name="crunch"&gt;{{cite journal |last=King |first=Dennis |title=Crunch Time for Water Quality Trading |journal=Choices |date=2005 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=70–75 |url=http://www.choicesmagazine.org/2005-1/environment/2005-1-14.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, point source-point source trades could also occur as well as pretreatment trades and intra-plant trades.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

====Background====
Most of the water quality trading markets currently in operation are focused on the trading of nutrients such as [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]]. However, increasing interest has been shown in trading programs for sediment runoff, [[biological oxygen demand]], and temperature.&lt;ref name="fact" /&gt; WQT programs can be used to preserve good water quality in unimpaired waters by counterbalancing new or increased pollutant discharges. In impaired waters, a WQT program can be used to improve water quality by reducing pollutant discharges in order to meet a specified water quality standard or [[total maximum daily load]] (TMDL).&lt;ref name="fact" /&gt;

TMDLs apply to both point sources and nonpoint sources and they represent the primary impetus for WQT programs. Point sources of pollutants that require NPDES permits often have strict discharge limits based on a TMDL. WQT can allow these sources to obtain lower costs of compliance, while still achieving the overall desired pollution reduction. Several factors influence whether or not a TMDL-based water quality trading program will be successful. First, the market must be appropriately structured within the regulatory framework of the Clean Water Act. Second, the pollutant must be well-suited for trading. Third, implementation of a WQT market requires public input and voluntary participation. Finally, there must be adequate differences in pollution control costs and available opportunities for reduction.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

====Credits and trade ratios====
In a WQT market, a unit of pollutant reduction is called a credit. A point source can generate credits by reducing its discharge below its most stringent effluent limitation and a nonpoint source can generate credits "by installing [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) beyond its baseline".&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt; Before being able to purchase credits,  source must first meet its technology-based effluent limit (TBEL). The credits can then be used to meet water quality-based effluent limits (WQBEL).&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

In order to ensure that trades are effective and do not result in more pollution than would occur in their absence, trade ratios are used. Trade ratios can have several components including:
*Location: Source location relevant to the downstream area of concern can be an important factor.
*Delivery: The distance between sources can play a role in determining whether permit requirements are met at the [[outfall]].
*Uncertainty: Nonpoint source reductions can be difficult to quantify.
*Equivalency: Sources may be discharging different forms of the same pollutant.
*Retirement: Credits may be retired to achieve further water quality improvement.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

Permitted point sources can trade with other point sources or nonpoint sources. Trades can occur directly, or be brokered by third parties. However, when dealing with nonpoint source reductions, a level of uncertainty does exist. In order to address this, [[environmental monitoring|monitoring]] should be conducted. Modeling can also be used as a supplement to monitoring. Uncertainty can also be mitigated by field testing BMPs and using conservative assumptions for BMP efficacy.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

====Benefits====
There are many economic, environmental, and social benefits that can be gained by establishing a WQT market within a watershed. Economically, since WQT is a market-based policy instrument, substantial savings can be generated while still achieving a mandated water quality goal.&lt;ref name="policy" /&gt; According to The National Cost to Implement Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) Draft report, flexible approaches to improving water quality, such as WQT markets, could save $900 million per year when compared with the least flexible approach (3). In 2008, WQT programs were worth $11 million, but have the potential for rapid growth.&lt;ref name="eureka"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report Offers First Worldwide Estimate of Investments in Combating Water Pollution |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-06/bc-rof062110.php |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economic benefits of WQT include a reduction in the overall costs of compliance, the ability for dischargers to take advantages of economies of scale and differences in treatment efficiencies, and the ability to maintain growth without further harming the environment.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

The environmental benefits of WQT programs are also numerous. First, habitats and ecosystems are protected and/or improved. Second, water quality objectives are able to be achieved in a timely manner. Third, there is incentive for innovation and creation of pollution prevention technologies. Finally, nonpoint sources are included in solving water quality problems. Social benefits include dialog among watershed stakeholders and incentives for all dischargers to reduce their pollution.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

====Factors influencing success====
The success of a WQT market is determined by several factors including the pollutant of interest, physical characteristics of the affected watershed, control costs, trading mechanisms, and stakeholder participation and willingness.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; It is also important that the desired level of pollution reduction is not so great that all sources must reduce the maximum amount possible because this would eliminate surplus reductions to be used for credits.&lt;ref name="policy" /&gt;

====Obstacles to implementation====
The biggest obstacle to the widespread adoption of WQT markets is lack of [[supply and demand]]. In fact, studies of current water quality trading programs indicate that the typical problems associated with inhibition of water quality trading, such as high [[transaction cost]]s, poor institutional infrastructure, and uncertain criteria, are being overcome.&lt;ref name="crunch"/&gt; The main problem is that, under existing regulatory conditions, there are simply not enough willing buyers and sellers. Currently, most nonpoint sources of water pollution are unregulated or, assuming detection occurs, have relatively small consequences for violations. Consequently, nonpoint sources do not have incentive to participate in WQT.&lt;ref name="crunch" /&gt; For WQT markets to be successful, greater demand is needed for pollution credits. For this to happen, water quality standards need to be clear and enforceable.&lt;ref name="eureka" /&gt;

====Contrast to emissions trading====
Given the success of the [[Acid Rain Program|sulfur dioxide emission trading market]] that was established to combat acid rain, at first glance it seems that this level of success should be easily extended to water quality trading. However, the reason this has not occurred yet comes down to a fundamental difference between water pollution and air pollution, and the process of establishing their respective markets. Establishing an [[Emissions trading|emissions market]], in principle, has three steps: (1) set a cap on emissions, (2) allocate portions of the cap to individual firms, and (3) allow each firm to meet its allowance through emission reduction or trade.&lt;ref name="crunch"/&gt; The difference with water pollution, however, is that the problems that cause local water quality issues differ from those that create regional air pollution problems. Discharges into water are difficult to measure and effects are dependent on a variety of other factors and vary with weather and location.&lt;ref name="crunch"/&gt;

=== Dealing with transboundary pollution: a case study of the U.S./Mexico border region===
[[File:Border Region.png|thumb|alt= Map of the U.S. – Mexico Border Region|Map of the U.S. – Mexico border region]]

====Overview====
The border region (approximately {{convert|2000|mi|km}} long and {{convert|62|mi|km}} wide) is predominantly arid and contains seven watersheds including the [[Rio Grande]] which forms part of the border. The watersheds provide numerous benefits for the 14 cities and over nine million people in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S./Mexico Border |url=http://www.epa.gov/region6/6xa/border.htm |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing population, the arid climatic conditions of the region, the nature of economic activities along the rivers, increased trade, and uncontrolled emissions into them have placed tremendous pressure on water resources and threatened natural ecosystems. A large proportion of the population lacks access to clean drinking water and sanitation triggering public health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Border 2010? |url=http://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder/framework/index.html |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Policy issues====
Point source water pollution is a source of concern along the US-Mexico border as pollutants from both countries are entering shared waterways due to agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and untreated sewage. Various policy issues arise in attempting to deal with this and include:
*Some pollution originates from areas beyond the border region as pollution is carried into the region by the waterways. This makes it difficult to regulate as discharges are difficult to apportion and control.
*Pollution is caused by and affects both countries therefore requiring a joint response.
*The socio-economic differences between the two countries have implications for policy implementation and enforcement.
*Various interests are represented with strong influence from environmental and social groups. Multiple levels of government agencies are also involved.

====Policy responses====
There have been several attempts to address environmental concerns in the border region in the past by both governments. Significant intervention, however, resulted from the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) of 1994 between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico which renewed concerns over the environmental quality of the region due to increased trade in the region. The two governments therefore entered into the ''US-Mexico Border Environment Cooperation Agreement'' which created a number of institutions and programs. The [[Border Environment Cooperation Commission]] (BECC) and the [[North American Development Bank]] (NADB) were created to address border environmental-infrastructure issues and began operation in 2004. Distinct characteristics of these institutions and their approach are that they: are truly bi-national (have members from both countries) at all levels; emphasize a bottom-up approach with enhanced public participation; have a preference to assist disadvantaged communities; avoid regulatory or standard-driven approaches; emphasize economic and environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liverman |first=Diana |author2=Varady Robert G. |author3=Chávez Octavio |author4=Sánchez Roberto | title=Environmental Issues Along the United States-Mexico Border: Drivers of Change and Responses of Citizens and Institutions| journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|date=November 1999 |volume=24 |pages=607–643 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.607?prevSearch=US%2BMexico%2Bborder%2Benvironment&amp;searchHistoryKey|accessdate=April 18, 2011 | doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.607}} Subscription required.&lt;/ref&gt; (As of 2018 the two organizations are in the process of merging into a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadbank.org/~nadborg/index.php?acc=contest&amp;tpl=origins |title=Origins |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=About Us |publisher=North American Development Bank (NADB) |location=San Antonio, TX |access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The US-Mexico Border Program was also created by the agreement and placed under the management of EPA (through its Region 6 and 9 offices) to correct the oversights of previous institutions and give guidance to cross-border environmental policy. The three institutions work together to identify, develop, finance and implement projects in the communities and certify them as "environmentally sustainable" subsequently funding them through a grant-making process. Communities, public, and private entities (sponsors) are invited to submit water and wastewater infrastructure projects. These projects are required to meet certain criteria to qualify for certification and funding. Among other requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/small-and-rural-wastewater-systems/us-mexico-border-water-infrastructure-grant-program |title=U.S.-Mexico Border Water Infrastructure Grant Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-15 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have to address an eligible environmental sector;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadbank.org/~nadborg/index.php?acc=contest&amp;tpl=basic_elig |title=Basic Eligibility |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Financing |publisher=NADB}}&lt;/ref&gt; must have a U.S.-side benefit; and have adequate planning, operations and maintenance, and pretreatment provisions. One specific provision touching on point-source water pollution states that "projects where the discharge is directly or indirectly to U.S. side waters, must target achievement of U.S. norms for ambient water quality in U.S. side waters, although infrastructure development may be phased over time.  Any flow reductions that result from implementation of non-discharging alternatives must not threaten U.S. or shared ecosystems". Projects receive significant  input from the communities living in the region in determining their sustainability. After certification, the project then receives funding from the NADB. As of 2018 NADB has certified 246 projects worth approximately three billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Summary Status Report |date=2018-06-30 |url=http://www.nadb.org/pdfs/FreqUpdates/SummaryStatusReport.pdf |publisher=NADB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The border program has also facilitated direct provision of infrastructure by the federal and state governments such as the construction of wastewater treatment plants, sewer lines, and raw water storage lagoons. One such example is the construction of the Matamoros lift station which is the first phase in eliminating raw sewage discharges into the Rio Grande.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Matamoros project improves border environment |date=2006 |url=http://www.epa.gov/region6/6xa/border.htm |publisher=EPA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212040947/http://www.epa.gov/region6/6xa/border.htm |archive-date=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the program emphasizes the provision of environmental education and information to communities living in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/border2020 |title=U.S.-Mexico Border 2020 Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-08 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early mottos===
[[File:Seal of the Northwest Territory.png|thumb|right|Seal of the Territory of the United States Northwest of the River Ohio]]

Ohio is considered the successor to the [[Northwest Territory]], whose [[Seal of Ohio#Territorial seal|seal]] bore the [[Latin]] motto ''{{lang|la|Meliorem lapsa locavit}}'', meaning "He has planted one better than the one fallen." This motto, which may have come from the [[Seal of South Carolina]], celebrated the [[internal improvements]] that succeeded in pushing back the wilderness.&lt;ref name="Reinke"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Edgar C.|last=Reinke|title=Meliorem Lapsa Locavit: An Intriguing Puzzle Solved|location=Columbus, Ohio|work=[[Ohio History]]|publisher=[[Ohio History Connection]]|volume=94|date=Winter 1985|page=74|url=http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohj/search/display.php?vol=94&amp;pages=68-74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seal's first recorded use was on a proclamation on July 26, 1788.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Pamela J.|last1=Bennett|first2=Alan|last2=January|title=Indiana's State Seal—An Overview|publisher=[[Indiana State Library and Historical Bureau|Indiana Historical Bureau]]|date=January 21, 2005|accessdate=May 31, 2008|url=http://www.in.gov/history/2804.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio's statehood in 1803 left it without a motto, though ''{{lang|la|Meliorem lapsa locavit}}'' remains the motto of [[Belmont County, Ohio|Belmont County]].&lt;ref name="Statehouse Belmont"&gt;{{cite web|title=Belmont County Flag|publisher=Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board|accessdate=January 26, 2015|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/museum/county-flags/belmont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henkle wrote to [[Ohio Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Smith (American politician)|William Henry Smith]], listing 125 Greek, Latin, and French phrases from which to choose a state motto.

On May 9, 1868, facing significant cost overruns associated with the new seal, a [[Ohio Democratic Party|Democratic]] Assembly repealed the entire statute.&lt;ref name="OHHist seal" /&gt; Representative [[Jacob Wolf]] proposed to leave the motto in place, while Representative [[Francis Bates Pond]] proposed to replace it with ''{{lang|la|Fiat justicia ruat cœlem}}'', Latin for "Let justice be done even if the sky falls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio Legislature [Official Report]|location=Columbus, Ohio|work=[[The Ohio State Journal]]|date=March 26, 1868|page=3|url=http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16007coll22/id/45274/rec/1|via=Ohio Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these legislators' efforts, the state was once again left without an official motto.&lt;ref name="NYT Fritsch" /&gt;

===Current motto===
In March 1958, ten-year-old Jimmy Mastronardo of [[Cincinnati]] wrote to ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', pointing out that Ohio was the only one out of 48 states that lacked a motto.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Radel"&gt;{{cite news|title=A mom to match our state motto|first=Cliff|last=Radel|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=January 20, 2015|url=http://enquirer.com/columns/radel/1998/09/090498cr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] has never adopted an official motto. Its unofficial motto is {{lang|chn|Al-ki}} or {{lang|chn|Alki}}, meaning "bye and bye" in [[Chinook Jargon]].&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended the phrase, "With God, all things are possible."&lt;ref name="Enquirer Radel" /&gt; [[Ohio Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Ted W. Brown]] encouraged him to promote his proposal to legislators and registered him as a lobbyist.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; He called his State Senator, [[William H.

Although the motto is widely understood to come from [[Jesus]]' words in [[Jesus and the rich young man|an encounter with a rich young man]], Mastronardo told reporters that he simply proposed his mother's favorite saying, unaware of its Biblical origin.&lt;ref name="Enquirer Radel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LimaNews scooter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scooter Bill Gets Final Test Today|location=Lima, Ohio|work=[[The Lima News]]|agency=United Press International|volume=75|issue=168|date=June 17, 1959|page=4|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/ohio/lima/lima-news/1959/06-17/page-4|via=NewspaperArchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a statewide meeting of elections officials, Brown presented him with a Citation Award while a surprise guest, comedian [[Joe E.

===Controversy===

In April 1996, Governor [[George Voinovich]] returned from a [[trade mission]] to India,&lt;ref name="CincyPost trade"&gt;{{cite news|title=Group to sell Ohio in trade trip to India|department=News|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E.

In 1997, just before the bronze fixture was to be installed, the Ohio affiliate of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) sued the board, Voinovich, Secretary of State [[Bob Taft]], and several other state officials.&lt;ref name="District" /&gt; The ACLU alleged that the state had violated the [[Establishment Clause]] in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution and a similar clause in the [[Constitution of Ohio|Ohio Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; The state argued that its motto was not explicitly Christian, likening it to the national motto, "[[In God We Trust]]", and the use of "[[under God]]" in the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]].&lt;ref name="SpartanburgHJ Sidoti" /&gt; It was explained as "a compelling symbol of hope, inspiration and stick-to-it-iveness". The ACLU represented a Cleveland-area Presbyterian associate minister who objected to the state's trivialization of a quote attributed to Jesus.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; An ACLU-sponsored poll in the spring of 1997 found that only two percent of [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]] residents were aware of the motto.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt;

On September 1, 1998, [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio|U.S. District Judge]] [[James L. Graham]] upheld the motto, finding it to be "[[Ceremonial deism|generically theistic]]" without [[Endorsement test|endorsing]] any particular denomination, but he enjoined the state from citing its source.&lt;ref name="District" /&gt; The state carried out the installation within days. On April 25, 2000, a panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the lower court ruling, finding that "the words have no secular purpose and appear to be a government endorsement of the Christian religion".&lt;ref name="BeaverCountyTimes Nolan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio motto, 'With God, all things are possible,' ruled a no-no|first=John|last=Nolan|location=Beaver, Pennsylvania|work=[[The Beaver County Times|Allegheny Times]]|publisher=Beaver Newspapers|agency=Associated Press|date=April 26, 2000|page=A1|url=//news.google.com/newspapers?id=7aI1AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5274,6561871|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] disputed this finding, citing verse {{cite quran|2|106|b=n|s=ns}} of the [[Quran]],&lt;ref name="BocaRatonNews Muslims"&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslims want Christian quote kept as Ohio motto|location=Delray Beach, Florida|work=[[Boca Raton News|Delray Beach News]]|agency=Associated Press|volume=45|issue=139|date=May 5, 2000|page=10A|url=//news.google.com/newspapers?id=XylUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4013,875828|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blade Tarjanyi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Islam leaders join dissent of judgment|first=Judy|last=Tarjanyi|location=Toledo, Ohio|work=The Blade|date=April 28, 2000|page=6|accessdate=February 15, 2015|url=//news.google.com/newspapers?id=c0pPAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6692,4192572|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[World Vaisnava Association]] objected on the basis of Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref name="Blade Hindus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindus call Ohio ruling 'absurd'|location=Toledo, Ohio|work=The Blade|date=May 27, 2000|page=B5|url=//news.google.com/newspapers?id=wUlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,3638008|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, there was significant public support for the motto. A June 2000 Ohio Poll conducted by the [[University of Cincinnati]] found that 62% of Ohioans were aware of the April ruling; of them, 11% agreed with it while 88% disagreed.&lt;ref name="Enquirer poll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Poll finds motto ruling unpopular|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|publisher=Gannett Company|agency=Associated Press|date=July 16, 2000|accessdate=January 22, 2015|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/2000/07/16/loc_poll_finds_motto.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] weighed in, voting 333–27 (with 66 voting "present") to pass a non-binding resolution, sponsored by Representatives [[Mike Oxley]] and [[Tony P.

On March 16, 2001, after an ''[[en banc]]'' review, the full Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Graham's ruling 9–4, leaving the motto in place. In a dissenting opinion, Judge [[Gilbert S. Merritt, Jr.]], expressed skepticism that the state fully intended to separate religious meaning from these words. He noted that Ohio officials had frequently explained the motto to their constituents in religious terms: Secretaries of State from Brown to Taft had cited Matthew 19:26 in pamphlets, and in 2000, Montgomery wrote to constituents that "the destruction of our state motto is part of a carefully constructed plan to strip America of every last symbol of our faith."&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; On June 7, 2001, the ACLU declined to appeal the case further, fearing the repercussions of an adverse ruling by a conservative [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="SpartanburgHJ Sidoti" /&gt;

==Similar mottos==
As noted in ''ACLU v. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board'', the federal government also invokes God in both its [[United States national motto|official motto]], "[[In God We Trust]]", and in the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. Three federal circuit courts have affirmed the national motto (see ''[[Aronow v. United States]]'', ''O'Hair v. Murray'', and ''Gaylor v. United States'').&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt;

Besides Ohio, several other states, territories, and cities refer to God on their seals without quoting the Bible:

* [[Seal of South Dakota|South Dakota's seal]] bears the motto "Under God the people rule". [[Seal of Colorado|Colorado's]] includes ''{{lang|la|Nil sine numine}}'', [[Latin]] for "Nothing without providence" or "Nothing without the Deity". [[Seal of Arizona|Arizona's]] includes ''{{lang|la|Ditat Deus}}'', meaning "God enriches".&lt;ref name="NYT Steinfels" /&gt; The mottos of all three were chosen before statehood by territorial governors.
* [[Seal of Florida|Florida's seal]] bears the national motto.
* Although [[Kentucky]]'s official motto is "[[United we stand, divided we fall]]", in 2002 the legislature also adopted ''{{lang|la|Deo gratiam habeamus}}'' ("Let us be grateful to God") as the state's Latin motto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kentucky Revised Statutes]] section [http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Statutes/statute.aspx?id=41 2.105]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Seal of American Samoa|American Samoa]]'s motto is {{lang|sm|Samoa Muamua Le Atua}}, which means "Samoa, let God be first".{{sfn|Grabowski|1992|p=47}}
* [[Boston]]'s motto is {{lang|la|Sicut patribus sit deus nobis}}, "As to our fathers may God be to us".

The [[coat of arms of Puerto Rico]] bears the motto ''{{lang|la|Joannes est nomen ejus}}'', meaning "John is his name". Like Ohio's motto, it is a quotation from the Bible, in this case the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Gospel of Luke]], verse {{Bibleverse-nb|Luke|1:63|Vulgate}}. The motto is a reference to St. [[John the Baptist]] or {{lang|es|San Juan Bautista}}, the island's original namesake. It reflects the commonwealth's strong [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] heritage as a former Spanish colony.{{sfn|Grabowski|1992|p=7}}
