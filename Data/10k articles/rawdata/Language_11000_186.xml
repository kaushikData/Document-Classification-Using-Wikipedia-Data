'''!Kung''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʊ|ŋ}} ('''!Xuun'''), also known as '''Ju''',{{refn| group =nb |The term ''!Kung'' is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute a single language; ''Ju'' tends to be used when considering them as a language family. The term ''!Kung'' is also sometimes used for the northern or northern and western varieties, as opposed to the well documented ''Ju{{|}}ʼhoansi'' in the southeast; however speakers of nearly all varieties, including the Ju{{|}}ʼhoan, call themselves ''!Kung''. The spelling ''!Xuun'' seen in recent literature is from the Ju{{|}}ʼhoansi form, spelled ''ǃX’uun'' in the 1975 orthography,, since 1994, it has been spelled ''ǃKun''.&lt;br&gt;Additional spellings of ''!Kung / !Xuun'' are ''ǃHu, ǃKhung, ǃKu, Kung, Qxü, ǃung, ǃXo, Xû, ǃXû, Xun, ǃXung, ǃXũũ, !Xun, ʗhũ:'',&lt;ref name=dok&gt;{{harvnb|Doke|1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional spellings of ''Ju'' are ''Dzu, Juu, Zhu''.}} is a [[dialect continuum]] (language complex) spoken in [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], and [[Angola]] by the [[ǃKung people]]. Together with the [[ǂ’Amkoe language|ǂHoan language]], it forms the proposed [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]] [[language family]]. !Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] language family, and was called '''Northern Khoisan''' in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is suspected to be spurious. Nonetheless, the term "Khoisan" has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haacke|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Kung is famous for having a large number of [[click consonant|clicks]], such as the [[alveolar click|ǃ]] in its name, and has some of the most complex inventories of both [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s in the world. It also has [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. For a description, see [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Juǀʼhoansi]]. To pronounce ''!Xuun'' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|!͡χũː˦˥|}} in Western !Kung/!Xuun) one makes a [[alveolar click|click sound]] before the ''x'' sound (which is like a Scottish or German ''ch''), followed by a long [[nasal vowel|nasal ''u'' vowel]] with a high rising tone.{{refn|group=nb|For phonology and tones, see list of !Xun dialect names in Heine and Honken's "The Kx'a Family: A New Khoisan Genealogy" in the [[Journal of Asian and African Studies]]&lt;ref name=hh&gt;{{harvnb|Heine|Honken|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Speakers==
If the !Kung languages are counted together, they would make the third-most-populous click language after [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]].  The most populous !Kung language, Juǀʼhoan, is perhaps tied for third place with [[Naro language|Naro]].

Estimates vary, but there are perhaps 14,000–18,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms, interspersed with speakers of other languages, but there are perhaps 9,000 in Namibia, 2,000 in Botswana, 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola (down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brenzinger|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid–late twentieth century, the ǃʼOǃKung and Maligo dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However, most !Kung fled the [[Angolan Civil War]] to Namibia (primarily to the [[Caprivi Strip]]), where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and [[SWAPO]]. At the end of the [[South African Border War|Border War]], more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to [[Schmidtsdrift]] in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suzman|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a decade living in precarious conditions, the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for a permanent settlement at Platfontein, near Schmidtsdrift.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|Madzudzo|Brenzinger|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of speakers of !Kung languages is around 108,000.

==Varieties==
The better-known !Kung dialects are [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan]], [[Ekoka !Kung]], [[Sekele language|ǃʼOǃKung]], and [[ǂKx'ao-ǁ'ae|ǂKxʼauǁʼein]]. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects, which may not be mutually intelligible when not adjacent, but there are no clear-cut distinctions between them at our present state of knowledge.

Sands et al. classify !Kung varieties into four clusters, with the first two being quite close:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sands|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Sekele language|Northern !Kung]]''': Southern Angola, around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers, but with many refugees now in Namibia:
::ǃʼOǃKung
::Maligo
* '''[[Ekoka !Kung|North-Central !Kung]]''': Namibia, between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border, around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the [[Etosha pan|Etosha Pan]]:
::Tsintsabis
::Okongo
::Ovambo
::Mpunguvlei
::ǀʼAkhwe (Ekoka)
* '''[[Central !Kung]]''': The area around [[Grootfontein]], Namibia, west of the central [[Omatako River]] and south of the [[Ovambo River]]
* '''[[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Southeastern !Kung]]''': Botswana east of the [[Okavango Delta]], and northeast Namibia from near [[Windhoek]] to [[Rundu]], [[Gobabis]], and the [[Caprivi Strip]]:
::Tsumkwe
::Omatako
::Kameeldoring
::Epukiro.
[[ǂKx'ao-ǁ'ae|ǂKxʼauǁʼein]] was too poorly attested to classify, but has since been determined to be Southeastern.

Heine &amp; Honken (2010) classify 11 varieties into three branches:&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;
* '''Northern–Western !Xuun'''
::[[Sekele language|Northern !Xuun]]
:::Maligo (''!xuun, kúándò !xuun'' "Kwando !Xuun"; SE Angola)
:::ǃʼOǃKung (''!ʼo !uŋ'' "Forest !Xuun"; eastern C Angola)
::[[Ekoka !Kung|Western !Xuun]]
:::— (''!xūún, !ʼālè !xòān'' "Valley !Xuun"; Eenhana district, N Namibia)
:::ǀʼAkhwe (''!xūún, ǀʼākhòè !xòān'' "Kwanyama !Xuun"; Eenhana, N Namibia)
:::Tsintsabis (''!xūún''; Tsintsabis, Tsumeb district, N Namibia)
::Kavango !Xuun (''!xūún'', known as ''dom !xūún'' "River !Xuun" in Ekoka; Western Rundu district, N Namibia, &amp; Angola adjacent)
* '''[[Central !Kung|Central !Xuun]]'''
::Gaub (Tsumeb district, N Namibia)
::Neitsas (Grootfontein district, N Namibia)
* '''[[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Southeastern !Xuun]]'''
::Juǀʼhoan (''ju-|ʼhoan(-si)''; Tsumkwe district, N Namibiba, &amp; Bots adjacent)
::Dikundu (''!xun, ju-|ʼhoa(si)''; Dikundu, W Caprivi)
::[[ǂKx'ao-ǁ'ae|ǂKxʼauǁʼein]] (''ju-|ʼhoan(-si), !xun, ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn'' "Northern people"; Gobabis district, E Namibia)

==Protolanguage==
The ancestral language, Proto-Juu or Proto-!Xuun, had five places of click articulation: [[Dental click|Dental]], [[alveolar click|alveolar]], [[palatal click|palatal]], [[lateral click|alveolar lateral]], and [[retroflex click|retroflex]] ({{IPA|*ǃ˞}} or {{IPA|*‼}}). The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan, but remain in Central !Kung. In ǀʼAkhwe (Ekoka), the palatal click has become a [[alveolar click#"Fricated" alveolar clicks|fricated alveolar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|Miller|Namaseb|Sands|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|Holliday|Howcroft|Phillips|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul Malik Isami''' (1311-?) was a 14th-century Indian historian and court poet. He wrote in [[Persian language]], under the patronage of [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]], the founder of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]]. He is best known for ''Futuh-us-Salatin'' (c. 1350), a poetic history of the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of India]].

== Early life ==

Isami was born in 1311, possibly in [[Old Delhi|Delhi]]. His father's name was 'Izz ul-Din 'Isami.{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=79}} His ancestor Fakhr Malik Isami had migrated from [[Baghdad]] to India during the reign of [[Iltutmish]] (r. 1211–1236).{{sfn|Bhanwarlal Nathuram Luniya|1969|p=87}}

In 1327, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] ruler [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] decided to move his capital from Delhi to [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] in Deccan region. Several residents of Delhi, including Isami's family, were ordered to move to Daulatabad. His 90-year-old grandfather died during this journey.{{sfn|E. Sreedharan|2004|p=346}}

== In Bahman Shah's service ==

At Daulatabad, Isami was appalled with what he perceived as Tughluq's misdeeds and tyranny. At one point, he decided to migrate to Mecca, but he was determined to write a history of Muslim rule in India before leaving the country.{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=79}} He aspired to emulate the famous Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]], who wrote ''[[Shahnameh]]'', an epic poem outlining the history of Persia.{{sfn|E. Sreedharan|2004|p=346}}

Qazi Bahauddin of Daulatabad introduced him to [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]], who had rebelled against Tughluq.{{sfn|Agha Mahdi Husain|1963|p=vi}} Bahman Shah, who established the independent [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in the [[Deccan]] region, became Isami's patron.{{sfn|E. Sreedharan|2004|p=346}} Isami thus became the earliest [[panegyrist]] at the Bahmani court.{{sfn|Meenakshi Khanna|2007|p=133}}

Under the patronage of Bahman Shah, he started writing ''Futuh-us-Salatin'' in 1349. Isami claims to have composed its 12,000 verses in 5 months.{{sfn|Saiyid Abdul Qadir Husaini|1960|p=164}} According to him, he started writing the book on 10 December 1349, and completed it on 14 May 1350.{{sfn|Bhanwarlal Nathuram Luniya|1969|p=87}} Nothing is known about Isami's life after this point.{{sfn|Agha Mahdi Husain|1963|p=vi}}

== ''Futuh-us-Salatin'' ==

The ''Futuh-us-Salatin'' ("Gifts of the Sultans") is a history of Muslim rule in India until 1349-50. Isami also called it ''Shahnama-i Hind'' ("the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of India").{{sfn|Iqtidar Alam Khan|2008|p=79}} According to Isami, his sources included anecdotes, legends, and reports by his friends and acquaintances.{{sfn|E. Sreedharan|2004|p=346}} Unlike several earlier chronicles, the book's language is devoid of "rhetorical artifices and unpleasant exaggeration".{{sfn|Saiyid Abdul Qadir Husaini|1960|p=164}}

The book begins with an account of the conquests of the [[Ghaznavid]] ruler [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Ghazni]] (r. 998–1002) and the [[Ghurid]] ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor|Muhammad]] (r. 1173-1202). It then goes on to narrate the history of the Delhi Sultanate until 1349-50.{{sfn|E. Sreedharan|2004|p=346}} The book also describes the early years of the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate.

=== Historical reliability ===

''Futuh-us-Salatin'' is written in [[Mathnawi (poetic form)|masnavi]] (rhyming poem) style, and is not fully reliable for the purposes of history. It contains factual mistakes and omits several important events. In addition, Isami implies that the various historical events were [[predeterminism|pre-determined]] by [[divine will]] and [[destiny]].{{sfn|Tej Ram Sharma|2005|p=73}} He believed that the presence of spiritually powerful [[Sufi]] leaders affected the fortunes of a kingdom. For example, he attributes to the decline of the Delhi Sultanate to the death of the Sufi saint [[Nizamuddin Auliya]]. Similarly, he claims that the Deccan region prospered because [[Burhanuddin Gharib]] and his successor [[Zainuddin Shirazi]] lived in Daulatabad.{{sfn|Meenakshi Khanna|2007|p=133}}

Isami is highly critical of Muhammad bin Tughluq. On the other hand, he calls his patron Bahman Shah as the rightful [[caliph]].{{sfn|Carl W. Ernst|2003|p=59}} He claims that Tughluq forced the ''entire'' population of Delhi to move to Daulatabad, and that only 10% of the migrants survived the journey. Both these claims appear to be exaggerations.{{sfn|Carl W. Ernst|2003|p=112}} According to Isami, this unfortunate situation was a result of God's punishment to the corrupt Muslims.{{sfn|Carl W. Ernst|2003|p=113}}

Despite these defects, Isami's book is a valuable source of information about the political history and social life of 14th century India.{{sfn|Kanhaiya Lall Srivastava|1980|p=236}}

The '''Akhvakh language''' (also spelled ''Axvax, Akhwakh'') is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] from the [[Avar–Andic languages|Avar–Andic branch]]. Ethnologue lists 6500 speakers,&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=akv Ethnologue entry for Akhvakh, which also mentions its divergent dialects]&lt;/ref&gt; but Magomedova and Abulaeva (2007) list 20,000 speakers of the language.  Akhvakh has several dialects, though sources do not agree on the number.  Ethnologue lists [[Kaxib dialect|Kaxib]], [[Northern Akhvakh]] and [[Southern Akhvakh]] (which can be further subdivided into the [[Tlyanub dialect|Tlyanub]] and [[Tsegob dialect|Tsegob]] subdialects&lt;ref name="Redbook"&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/akhvakhs.shtml The peoples of the Red Book: Akhvakhs]&lt;/ref&gt;). Creissels (2010) lists Northern Akhvakh and three dialects of Southern Akhvakh (Cegob, Tljanub, and Ratlub). 

A few publications have been made in the Akhvakh language{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, but for the most part speakers of Akhvakh have adopted [[Avar language|Avar]] as their literary language.

As with [[Avar language|Avar]], there are competing analyses of the distinction transcribed in the table with the length sign {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ː}}}}. Length is part of the distinction, but so is articulatory strength, so they have been analyzed as [[fortis and lenis]].{{cn|date=October 2015}} The fortis affricates are long in the fricative part of the contour, e.g. {{IPA|[tsː]}} (tss), not in the stop part as in geminate affricates in languages such as Japanese and Italian {{IPA|[tːs]}} (tts). Laver (1994) analyzes e.g. {{IPA|t͡ɬː}} as a two-segment affricate&amp;ndash;fricative sequence {{IPA|/t͡ɬɬ/}} ({{IPA|/t&lt;sup&gt;ɬ&lt;/sup&gt;ɬ/}}).&lt;ref&gt;Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics'' p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Agreement classes===
Akhvakh has three agreement classes.  In the singular, these are human masculine, human feminine, and non-human. In the plural, there are only two—human plural and non-human plural.  Akhvakh verbs agree with the absolutive argument (subject of an intransitive or object of a transitive.)

Consider the following examples, which show the general principles.  In the first example, the intransitive verb 'run' shows feminine agreement because its subject, 'girl', is feminine.  In the second example, the transitive verb 'cook' shows neuter agreement because its object, 'meat', is neuter. (Creissels 2010:114)

{|
|-
|Jaše||q:'eɬ:-a||j-et-e||j-i:ni
|-
|girl||home-lative||fem-run-converb:fem||fem-go:imperfective
|-
|colspan='5'|'The girl ran home.'
|}

{|
|-
|Ak:'o-de||riɬ:'i||b-iž-e||q:'-e:ni.
|-
|wife-ergative||meat||neut-eat-converb:neut||eat-imperfective
|-
|colspan='5'|'The wife cooked the meat and ate it.'
|}

Note that in the second example, 'wife' is in the ergative case and appears to be the subject of both the verbs 'cook' and 'eat', but neither verb shows feminine agreement.

===Cases===
Akhvakh has an [[ergative-absolutive]] case-marking system. As the following examples (repeated from above) show, the transitive subject has the ergative case, while an intransitive subject has absolutive case.  Absolutive case is not overtly marked by a suffix, but the noun phrase with absolutive case controls agreement on the verb:

{|
|-
|Jaše||q:'eɬ:-a||j-et-e||j-i:ni
|-
|girl||home-lative||fem-run-converb:fem||fem-go:imperfective
|-
|colspan='5'|'The girl ran home.'
|}

{|
|-
|Ak:'o-de||riɬ:'i||b-iž-e||q:'-e:ni.
|-
|wife-ergative||meat||neut-eat-converb:neut||eat-imperfective
|-
|colspan='5'|'The wife cooked the meat and ate it.'
|}

In addition to the ergative and absolutive cases, Akhvakh has eighteen other cases, for a total of twenty cases (Creissels 2010:108-9).  The additional cases are
*dative
*genitive
*comitative
*purposive
*fifteen spatial cases, arrayed in five series of three.

==Biography==

Daughter of [[al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir]], the last [[Lakhmid]] king of [[Al-Hirah]] (r. 582&amp;ndash;c. 602 AD) and a [[Nestorian Christian]] [[Arab]], she was according to a number of sources demanded in marriage by [[Khosrow II]], king of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (r. 590-628) and ally of her father.

According to the ''Ḥarb Banī Shaybān maʻa Kisrá Ānūshirwān'' (whose historical reliability is questionable), [[Khosrow II]] (r. 590-628) demanded Hind in marriage from her father [[al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir]]. Thinking better of the arrangement, al-Nu'mān sent Hind to seek refuge among the Arabs, and was subsequently attacked and imprisoned by Khosrow. After failing to find sanctuary along the [[Ghassānids]] and other Arab tribes, Hind was granted sanctuary among the [[Banū Shaybān]] through the intercession of their princess [[al-Ḥujayjah]]. It was supposedly for this reason that the Banā Shaybān had to fight the [[Battle of Dhū-Qār]] in c. 609. She was then sent to marry [[Nuʻmān ibn al-Rayyān]], 'her only cousin to survive the Persian attack on the Kingdom of al-Ḥīrah', after which Khosrow granted him the throne of [[Al-Hirah]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), pp. 165-66, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Some poetry is attributed to Hind, making her (if the attributions are correct) a relatively rare example of a pre-Islamic female poet whose work survives.&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Alajmi, 'Pre-Islamic Poetry and Speech Act Theory: Al-A`sha, Bishr ibn Abi Khazim, and al-Ḥujayjah' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Indiana University, 2012), pp. 165-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6369">The royal [[Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander]] is an [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]] in [[Middle Bulgarian]], prepared and illustrated in 1355–1356 for [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. The manuscript is regarded as one of the most important manuscripts of medieval [[Bulgarian culture]].  The manuscript, now in the [[British Library]] (Add. MS 39627), contains the text of the Four Gospels illustrated with 366 [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s and consists of 286 [[parchment]] folios, 33 by 24.3 cm in size.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrova, Ekaterina, ''The Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander'', 1994, British Library, {{ISBN|0712303499}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bible translations into [[Bulgarian language#History|Modern Bulgarian]] date from the 1820s and were largely organised by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries. The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] initially preferring the continued use of [[Old Church Slavonic]].

The Archimandrite Theodosius, abbot of the [[Bistritsa Monastery]] in [[Romania]], translated the New Testament for the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], which was printed at [[St. Petersburg]] in 1823 .&lt;ref&gt;A Manual of Biblical Bibliography: Thomas Hartwell Horne T. Cadell, 1839 p 104&lt;/ref&gt; "It was begun by the Archimandrite Theodosius, with the sanction of Gregory, Patriarch of Constantinople.  ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ImB-PQAACAAJ St. Matthew's Gospel in Church Slavic and Bulgarian 1823] ) was published by the Russian Bible Society." This attempt to translate the Bible into Modern Bulgarian was characterized with poor grammatical style and was greatly influenced by the [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] version. The entire edition was sent to Saint Petersburg and is said to have been destroyed there. The BFBS had also contracted nationalist journalist [[Konstantin Fotinov]] who translated the New Testament but the BFBS did not approve it because "it was neither Slav[onic] or Bulgarian".&lt;ref&gt;Plamen K. Georgiev ''The Bulgarian political culture'' p32  2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent attempt to publish a Bulgarian translation of the [[New Testament]] occurred in 1828, as [[Petar Sapunov]] and his brother [[Father Serafim]] published a translation of the four gospels at the [[Bucharest]] metropolitan press in [[Wallachia]] (Romania). This translation was completed in the Eastern [[Bulgarian dialects|Bulgarian dialect]].

In 1835 Bulgarian monk [[Neofit Rilski]] started a new translation of the New Testament. The translation&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/novyzavietgospo00neofgoog A pdf file containing the translation of Neofit Rilski from 1839 (this particular copy was printed in 1859).]&lt;/ref&gt; was completed on April 18, 1838. The translation was done in the Bulgarian dialect from the area of Gorna Dzhumaya (present day [[Blagoevgrad]] in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]).In 1840 5,000 copies of the first complete translation of the New Testament were printed in [[Smyrna]] by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. A second edition which was printed in Smyrna in 1850 was an almost exact reprint of the 1840 edition. A third edition followed in 1853 with 15,000 copies. The fourth edition was published in 1857 in Bucharest, and for the first time civil characters type was used. In 1859, two more editions were published. In 1866, a new “pocket” edition with text revised by [[Elias Riggs]] and Dr. [[Albert Long]] was printed in Constantinople. The New Testament was revised and reprinted a total of nine times.

In the period from 1840 to 1860 the Eastern ([[Tarnovo]]) dialect was adopted as literary [[Bulgarian language]] and the [[Dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialect]], in which the New Testament had been translated, was widely rejected. By 1858 Neofit Rilski had finished large portion of the [[Old Testament]]. Riggs met with Neofit Rilski and discussed a possible revision of the Bulgarian New Testament to remove the Macedonian dialect elements. Neofit objected the revision, so Riggs took the translation and returned to Constantinople. In January 1859 Riggs invited the Bulgarian teacher Hristodul Kostovich to help him with the revision.

In 1862 Long and Riggs visited the noted [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] writer and poet [[Petko Rachov Slaveykov]] in [[Tryavna]]. Slaveykov agreed to help with the translation and began the work on the revising of Neofit’s New Testament at once. Long joined the revision of the New Testament into the Eastern dialect in 1863 and later assisted with the translation of the Old Testament. In June 1871, after more than 12&amp;nbsp;years of revision and translation, 36,000 copies of the complete Bible translation in Bulgarian were published in [[Constantinople]]. The translation came to be known as the Tsarigrad (Constantinople) edition.&lt;ref&gt;Marin V. Pundeff -Bulgaria in American perspective: political and cultural issues 1994 "In the absence of an Orthodox translation, the "Protestant" Bible, issued in various 18 forms in some 30000 copies before 1878, became, in the words of a leading Bulgarian clergyman, "widely disseminated among our Christians "&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to revise and publish the [[Bible]] in the Eastern dialect was the historical factor based on which the Modern Bulgarian language departed from the Macedonian dialect to adopt the Eastern/[[Thracian dialect]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, several organizations attempted to provide a new translation of the Bible in Bulgarian. In 1993 a [[Protestant]] New Testament was printed. A complete new Orthodox translation was published in 1995, followed by three new Protestant revisions of the Bulgarian Bible in the period of 2000–2001 by publishing houses of Veren (Faithful), Nov Chovek (New Man) and the Bible League.

[[Jáni Vasilčin]] published in 1998 the New Testament in [[Banat Bulgarian language]]. The [[Banat Bulgarians]] are a Catholic minority group in western [[Romania]] and northeastern [[Serbia]].

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have translated their [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]] into Bulgarian.

'''Bruu''' (also spelled '''Bru''', '''B'ru''', '''Baru''', '''Brou''') is a [[Mon–Khmer]] [[dialect continuum]] spoken by the [[Bru people]] of mainland Southeast Asia.

Sô and Khua are dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/mk-class.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
There are various local and dialect designations for Bru (Sidwell 2005:11).

*So ~ Sô
*Tri (So Tri, Chali)
*Van Kieu
*Leu ~ Leung (Kaleu)
*Galler
*Khua
*Katang (not the same as [[Kataang language|Kataang]])

==Distribution==
The distribution of the Bru language spreads north and northeast from [[Salavan Province|Salavan]], [[Laos]], through [[Savannakhet]], [[Khammouane]], and [[Bolikhamsai]], and over into neighboring [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]] (Sidwell 2005:11). In Vietnam, Brâu (Braò) is spoken in Đắk Mế, Bờ Y commune, [[Đắk Tô]] District, [[Kon Tum Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Lê Bá Thảo, Hoàng Ma, et. al; Viện hàn lâm khoa học xã hội Việt Nam - Viện dân tộc học. 2014. ''Các dân tộc ít người ở Việt Nam: các tỉnh phía nam''. Ha Noi: Nhà xuất bản khoa học xã hội. {{ISBN|978-604-90-2436-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Thailand has the following Western Bru dialects (Choo, et al. 2012).
*'''Bru Khok Sa-at'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.payap.ac.th/graduate/linguistics/theses/Jennifer_Engelkemier_Thesis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117034223/http://ic.payap.ac.th/graduate/linguistics/theses/Jennifer_Engelkemier_Thesis.pdf |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Phang Khon District]] and [[Phanna Nikhom District]], [[Sakon Nakhon Province]]
*'''Bru Woen Buek''' of Woen Buek (Wyn Buek), [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]] (more similar to Katang)
*'''Bru Dong Luang''' of [[Dong Luang District]], [[Mukdahan Province]]

The following Bru subgroups are found in [[Quảng Bình Province]] (Phan 1998).&lt;ref name="Phan1998"&gt;Phan Hữu Dật. 1998. "Về tên gọi các tộc người nói ngôn ngữ Môn-Miên ở miền tây tỉnh Quảng Bình." In ''Một số vấn đề về dân tộc học Việt Nam'', p.476-482. Hà Nội: Nhà xuất bản Đại Học Quốc Gia Hà Nội.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Vân Kiêu''': 5,500 persons in [[Lệ Thủy District]] and [[Vĩnh Linh District]] (in [[Quảng Trị Province]])
*'''Măng Coong''': 600 persons in [[Bố Trạch District]]
*'''Tri''': 300 persons in [[Bố Trạch District]]
*'''Khùa''': 1,000 persons in [[Tuyên Hóa District]]

Below is a comparative vocabulary of Vân Kiêu, Măng Coong, Tri, and Khùa from Phan (1998:479-480),&lt;ref name="Phan1998"/&gt; with words transcribed in [[Vietnamese orthography]].

[[Image:Bathroom category.jpg|right|thumb|The bathroom fittings category in [[Wal*Mart]]]]
'''Category management''' is a [[retailing]] and [[purchasing]] concept in which the range of products purchased by a business organization or sold by a [[retailer]] is broken down into discrete groups of similar or related products; these groups are known as product categories (examples of grocery categories might be: tinned fish, washing detergent, toothpastes). It is a systematic, disciplined approach to managing a product category as a [[strategic business unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/Pages/Glossary.aspx/#C |title=Industry Resources: Glossary |publisher=Nacsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "category management" was coined by [[Brian F. Harris]].&lt;ref name=n/a group=n/a&gt;{{cite book|last=Pradham|first=Swapna|title=Retailing Management 2E|year=2007|publisher=The McGraw Hill Companies|isbn=978-0-07-062020-9|pages=226–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Category management in a retail context==
Each category is run as a "mini business" (business unit) in its own right, with its own set of turnover and/or [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] targets and [[strategies]]. Introduction of Category Management in a business tends to alter the relationship between [[retailer]] and [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]: instead of the traditional adversarial relationship, the relationship moves to one of [[collaboration]], with exchange of information, sharing of data and joint business building.

The focus of all supplier negotiations is the effect on turnover of the category as whole, not just the sales of individual products.  Suppliers are expected, indeed in many cases mandated, to only suggest new product introductions, a new [[planogram]] or promotional activity if it is expected to have a beneficial effect on the turnover or profit of the total category and be beneficial to the shoppers of that category.

The concept originated in [[grocery]] (mass merchandising) retailing, and has since expanded to other retail sectors such as [[DIY]], [[cash and carry (wholesale)|cash and carry]], [[pharmacy]], and book retailing.&lt;ref name=Books&gt;''[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA169041.html Category Management in Book Retailing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of category management (retail)==
Category management lacks a single definition thus leading to some ambiguity even among industry professionals as to its exact function. Three comparative mainstream definitions are as follows:

''Category management is a process that involves managing product categories as business units and customizing them [on a store by store basis] to satisfy customer needs.'' (Nielsen)&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;''Nielsen Category Management - Positioning Your Organisation to Win, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

''The strategic management of product groups through trade partnerships which aims to maximize sales and profit by satisfying consumer and shopper needs'' (Institute of Grocery Distribution)&lt;ref name=IGD&gt;''[http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;tid=38&amp;folid=0&amp;cid=125 IGD definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211151421/http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;tid=38&amp;folid=0&amp;cid=125 |date=2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''.. marketing strategy in which a full line of products (instead of the individual products or brands) is managed as a strategic business unit (SBU).'' (Business Dictionary)&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;''[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/category-management.html Business Dictionary Definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nielsen definition, published in 1992, was a little ahead of its time in that customising product offerings on a store by store basis is logistically difficult and is now not considered a necessary part of category management; it is a concept now referred to as [[micromarketing]].  Nevertheless, most grocery retailers will segment stores at least by size, and select product assortments accordingly. [[Wal*Mart]]'s Store of the Community, implemented in North America, is one of the few examples of where product offerings are tailored right down to the specific store.&lt;ref name=Community&gt;''[http://walmart.nwanews.com/wm_story.php?storyid=35583&amp;section=shareholder Store of the Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212000356/http://walmart.nwanews.com/wm_story.php?storyid=35583&amp;section=shareholder |date=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for category management==
One key reason for the introduction of category management was the retailers' desire for suppliers to add value to their (i.e. the retailer's) business rather than just the supplier's own. For example, in a category containing brands A and B, the situation could arise such that every time brand A promoted its products, the sales of brand B would go down by the amount that brand A would increase, resulting in no net gain for the retailer. The introduction of category management imposed the condition that all actions undertaken, such as new [[Promotion (marketing)|promotions]], new products, re-vamped [[planogram]], introduction of [[point of sale]] [[advertising]] etc. were beneficial to the retailer and the shopper in the store.

A second reason was the realization that only a finite amount of profit could be milked from price negotiations and that there was more profit to be made in increasing the total level of sales.

A third reason was that the collaboration with the supplier meant that supplier's expertise about the market could be drawn upon, and also that a considerable amount of workload in developing the category could be delegated to the supplier.&lt;ref name=Rationale&gt;''[http://www.catmanplus.com/whatis.html Rationale for Category Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306003706/http://www.catmanplus.com/whatis.html |date=2008-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of a category==
The Nielsen definition of a 'category', used as the basic definition across the industry, is that the products should meet a similar consumer need, or that the products should be inter-related or substitutable.&lt;ref name=Category&gt;''[http://www.acnielsen.com/news/european/ie/2001/20010201.htm Nielsen Definition of a Category]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nielsen definition also includes a provision that products placed together in the same category should be logistically manageable in store (for example there may be issues in having room-temperature and chilled products together in the same category even though the initial two conditions are met).

However, this definition does not explain how the process often works in practical retailing situations, where [[demographic]] or marketing considerations take precedence.

==The category management 8-step process (retail)==
[[Image:8-step-process.png|right|thumb|The category management 8-step process]]
The industry standard model for category management in retail is the 8-step process, or 8-step cycle developed by the Partnering Group.&lt;ref name=Cycle&gt;''[http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;tid=38&amp;folid=0&amp;cid=125 The 8-step Category Management process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211151421/http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;tid=38&amp;folid=0&amp;cid=125 |date=2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight steps are shown in the adjacent diagram; they are :
# Define the category (i.e. what products are included/excluded).
# Define the role of the category within the retailer.
# Assess the current performance.
# Set objectives and targets for the category.
# Devise an overall Strategy.
# Devise specific tactics.
# Implementation.
# The eighth step is one of review which takes us back to step 1.

The 8-step process, whilst being very comprehensive and thorough has been criticized for being rather too unwieldy and time-consuming in today's fast-moving sales environment; in one survey only 9% of supplier companies stated they used the full 8-step process.&lt;ref name=Unwieldy&gt;''[http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;tid=38&amp;folid=0&amp;cid=125 9% of supplier companies admit to 8-step process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211151421/http://www.igd.com/index.asp?id=1&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=6&amp;tid=38&amp;folid=0&amp;cid=125 |date=2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current industry trend is for supplier companies to use the standard process as a basis to develop their own more streamlined processes, tailored to their own particular products &lt;ref name=Streamlined&gt;''[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/structuring-your-marketing-framework-successful-campaign-key-acanto Structuring Your Marketing Framework For A Successful Omnichannel Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

Market research company Nielsen has a similar process based on only 5 steps : reviewing the category, targeting consumers, planning merchandising, implementing strategy, evaluating results.

==Category captains==
It is commonplace for a particular supplier in a category to be nominated by the retailer as a category captain. The category captain will be expected to have the closest and most regular contact with the retailer and will also be expected to invest time, effort, and often financial assets into the strategic development of the category within the retailer. In return, the supplier will gain a more influential voice with the retailer. The category captain is often the supplier with the largest turnover in the category. Traditionally the job of category captain is given to a [[brand]] supplier, but in recent times the role has also gone to particularly switched-on [[private label]] suppliers.&lt;ref name=Captain&gt;''[http://www.catmanplus.com/whatis.html The role of Category Captain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306003706/http://www.catmanplus.com/whatis.html |date=2008-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In order to do the job effectively, the supplier may be granted access to a greater wealth of data-sharing, e.g. more access to an internal sales database such as [[Walmart]]'s [[Retail Link]].

In the UK, the [[Groceries Code Adjudicator]] found in her 2015-16 investigation into [[Tesco plc]] that some suppliers paid "large sums of money in exchange for category captaincy or participation in a price review". She found some evidence of benefits which suppliers derive from these arrangements but also recorded a concern, to be investigated further, as to whether the purpose of the Groceries Code was being circumvented by these payments.&lt;ref&gt;Groceries Code Adjudicator, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/494840/GCA_Tesco_plc_final_report_26012016_-_version_for_download.pdf Investigation into Tesco plc], published 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental concerns about category management==
Many governments have viewed increased collaboration between suppliers and retailers as a potential source of [[antitrust]] breaches, such as [[price fixing]]. For example the UK [[Competition Commission]]&lt;ref name=Competition&gt;''[http://www.competition-commission.org.uk Competition Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; has raised their issues on [[market distortion]] in principle.  They have also acted on milk price-fixing in Britain.&lt;ref name=Milk&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7132108.stm Milk Price Fixing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified category management==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
For [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP]]-based manufacturing industries, the predominant cost-saving methodology in category management (CM) involves the integration of market intelligence with leveraged spending (for a given category of product or service). In industries where asset operation and preservation bear more significance to the procurement process than do product manufacturing – such as in an [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] environment – demonstrable benefit can still be achieved with category management but is best approached with some manner of adjustment to CM’s usual processes for analysis and strategy development. The first challenge becomes incorporating analytical processes and value drivers that are largely indigenous to the MRP world in a manner that makes sense to an MRO environment.  The second (and no less important) challenge becomes avoiding a trap where the CM processes are perceived to be more important than their outcome – a scenario that can result in significant analytical delay, and even complete process paralysis.  An excellent example of an MRO environment warranting adjustment to classical category management is nuclear power generation in the United States, where the adjusted approach to category management has been coined "MCM" – standing for MRO-based Category Management or Modified Category Management.  Not only does electricity generation epitomize an MRO-driven environment, the nuclear energy source adds numerous dimensions of supply and procurement complexity – including federal and state regulatory compliance, nuclear industry standards compliance, nuclear-unique system and component design, and a tightly-audited (and very small) supply base, amongst others.  Due to the nature and quantity of discrete characteristics native to nuclear power generation, it can easily be argued that nuclear power generation, in and of itself, should be a distinct category of procurement within a category management project.  The fundamental adjustment made between the classical category management approach and the nuclear MCM approach is a shift from procurement strategies focused on leveraged spending to procurement strategies embracing nuclear value drivers, technology innovation, risk management, and strategic sourcing.

The '''Dowayo language''' (Doyayo) is a member of the [[Duru languages|Duru]] branch of [[Savanna languages]].

Blench (2004) considers the Sewe dialect to be a separate language, no more closely related to Dowayo than to Koma and Vere.

'''Edward Payson Evans''' (December 8, 1831 – March 6, 1917) was a United States scholar and linguist.

==Biography==
His father was a Welsh [[Presbyterian]] clergyman, who came to the United States with his wife around 1830. Edward P. Evans graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1854, and then taught at an academy in [[Hernando, Mississippi]], for one year. He then became a professor at [[Carroll University]] (then Carroll College) in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]].

From 1858 to 1862, he traveled abroad, and studied at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]].

On his return to the United States, he became professor of modern languages in the [[University of Michigan]]. In 1868, he married Elizabeth Edson Gibson. In 1870, Evans resigned his position at Michigan and went abroad again, where he gathered materials for a history of [[German literature]], and also made a specialty of oriental languages. He became a fixture at the Royal Library in Munich, and joined the staff of the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' in Munich in 1884.

When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, he returned to the United States, where he lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and [[New York City]].

==Elizabeth Evans==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">The [[Estonian language]] has six [[locative case]]s, descended from the [[Proto-Finnic locative system|locative cases of Proto-Finnic]]. They can be classified according to a three-way contrast of entering, residing in, and exiting a state, with two sets of cases: inner and outer. Though they are not traditionally considered as such, the [[essive case|essive]] and [[translative case|translative]] cases also can be considered locative, for a system of eight (out of fourteen) cases.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
!System
!Entering
!Residing in
!Exiting
|-
! Inner
| ''-sse''  "into" ([[illative case|illative]])
| ''-s'' "in" ([[inessive case|inessive]])
| ''-st'' "from (inside)" ([[elative case|elative]])
|-
! Outer
| ''-le'' "(on)to" ([[allative case|allative]])
| ''-l'' "on (top of) / at" ([[adessive case|adessive]])
| ''-lt'' "from (at/on)" ([[ablative case|ablative]])
|-
! State
| ''-ks'' "into [a state]" ([[translative case|translative]])
| ''-na''  "as" ([[essive case|essive]]) '''
| 
|}

The only Estonian semantic cases not included in this system are the [[terminative case|terminative]] (which even might be called locative), and the pair of [[abessive case|abessive]] and [[comitative case|comitative]].

For some nouns, there are two forms of the illative: the regular suffix ''-sse'' (e.g. ''keelesse''), added to the [[genitive case|genitive]] stem, and an alternative, short form, which is either consists of a different suffix (''keel'' &gt; ''keelde'') lengthening (e.g. ''maja'' &gt; ''majja'', ''[ko:l] &gt; [ko::li]''), and/or other change in the word.  The always regular ''-sse'' illative ending is a newer innovation, and can sometimes have a slightly different meaning than the old "short form" illative, the later having the concrete locative meaning (e.g.: ''tuppa'' 'into the room'), and the former being used in other structures that require the illative (''mis puutub toasse'' 'concerning the room...').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Laakso |first=Johanna |title=The Circum-Baltic Languages: Typology and Contact| chapter=The Finnic Languages |series=Studies in Language Companion Series | issn=0165-7763 | volume=44-45 |publisher=John Benjamins B.V. | editor-last =Dahl | editor-first =Östen | editor2-last = Koptjevskaja-Tamm | editor2-first =Maria |location=Amsterdam | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exquisite corpse drawing by Noah Ryan and Erica Parrott.JPG|thumb|An exquisite corpse drawing]]

'''Exquisite corpse''', also known as '''exquisite cadaver''' (from the original French term '''''{{Lang|fr|cadavre exquis}}'''''), is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. "The ''[[adjective]]'' ''[[noun]]'' ''[[adverb]]'' ''[[verb]]'' the ''adjective'' ''noun''." as in "The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.") or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.

==History==
This technique was invented by [[surrealism|surrealist]]s and is similar to an old [[parlour game]] called [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]] in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. Surrealism principal founder [[André Breton]] reported that it started in fun, but became playful and eventually enriching. Breton said the diversion started about 1925, but [[Pierre Reverdy]] wrote that it started much earlier, at least as early as 1918.&lt;ref name="Breton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.exquisitecorpse.com/definition/bretons_remembrances.html |title=Morgue |last=Reverdy |first=Pierre |date=March 1918 |publisher=Nord-Sud |accessdate=28 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107014444/http://www.exquisitecorpse.com/definition/Bretons_Remembrances.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is derived from a phrase that resulted when Surrealists first played the game, "{{Lang|fr|Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau.}}" ("The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine.")&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton|Breton, André]] (7 October 1948), ''{{Lang|fr|Le Cadavre Exquis: Son Exaltation}}'', exhibition catalogue, La Dragonne, Galerie Nina Dausset, Paris (October 7–30).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brotchie|first=Alastair|author2=Mel Gooding|title=Surrealist Games|publisher=[[Redstone Press]]|year=1991|location=London|pages=143–144|isbn=1-870003-21-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; André Breton writes that the game developed at the residence of friends in an old house of [[Montparnasse]] at 54 rue du Château (no longer existing). These artists started the movement [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Prévert]], [[Benjamin Péret]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], and [[André Breton]]. Other participants probably included [[Max Morise]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Man Ray]], [[Simone Collinet]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Georges Hugnet]], [[René Char]], and [[Paul Éluard|Paul]] and [[Nusch Éluard]].&lt;ref name="Breton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exquisitecorpse.com/definition/Bretons_Remembrances.html|title=Breton Remembers|last=Breton|first=André|date=7 October 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pusanweb.com/poetryplus/poetryplus16/corpse/exquisite.htm#exquisite|title=The Exquisite Corpse|year=2009|publisher=Poetry Plus|accessdate=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Miller]] often partook of the game to pass time in French cafés during the 1930s.

==Picture consequences==
[[File:Exquisite Corpse (6042257203).jpg|thumb|upright|An exquisite corpse drawing produced in four sections]]
In a variant now known as '''picture consequences''', instead of sentences, portions of a person were drawn.&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/great-works/cozens-alexander-a-blot-tigers-c177080-744402.html|title=Cozens, Alexander: ''A Blot: Tigers'' (c. 1770–80)|quote=about [[Alexander Cozens]]|accessdate=24 September 2008|date=13 April 2007|last=Lubbock|first=Tom|work=[[The Independent]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Farts-entertainment%2Fart-and-architecture%2Fgreat-works%2Fcozens-alexander-a-blot-tigers-c177080-744402.html&amp;date=2008-09-25|archivedate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the game was adapted to [[drawing]] and [[collage]], producing a result similar to children's books in which the pages were cut into thirds, the top third pages showing the head of a person or animal, the middle third the torso, and the bottom third the legs, with children having the ability to "mix and match" by turning pages.

In the context of parties, it can be run as a circle game in which a group of people cooperatively draw a person,&lt;ref name="teachingenglish" /&gt; taking about 20 minutes to play.&lt;ref name="rainy"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/rainy-days-survival-guide-451282.html

| date = 2007-06-01
| work = [[The Independent]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An image of a person is drawn in portions, with the paper folded after each portion so that later participants cannot see earlier portions.&lt;ref name="tattoo"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.britishcouncil.org/languageassistant-tattoos.htm#para1

| archivedate = 2008-09-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been recommended for use as a tool for teaching about [[tattoo]]s.&lt;ref name="tattoo" /&gt;
Picture consequences can be used to practice vocabulary and to encourage a class to work together.&lt;ref name="teachingenglish"&gt;{{cite web

| archivedate = 2008-09-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The game is also recommended as a "rainy day" game.&lt;ref name="rainy" /&gt; The point of the game is the surprise reveal at the end&lt;ref name="indep" /&gt; or for simple fun.&lt;ref name="bounford"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The person can be drawn in four steps: The head, the torso, the legs and the feet.&lt;ref name="rainy" /&gt; As a last step, a player may label the drawing, still unseen, with someone's name.&lt;ref name="bounford" /&gt;

The name "picture consequences" is also sometimes used to describe [[Telephone Pictionary]], a game in which players alternate writing descriptions and matching illustrations based on the previous step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Giant Book of Word Games: The Bumper Book of Ingenious and Enjoyable Games for all Occasions|isbn=1-86309-172-6|first=Peter|last=Newby|pages=42–43|publisher=The Book Company|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French''' ({{lang|fr|le français}} {{IPA-fr|lə fʁɑ̃sɛ||Fr-le_français-fr-ouest.ogg}} or {{lang|fr|la langue française}} {{IPA-fr|la lɑ̃ɡ fʁɑ̃sɛːz|}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]]. It descended from the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]], as did all Romance languages. French has evolved from [[Gallo-Romance]], the spoken Latin in [[Gaul]], and more specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other [[langues d'oïl]]—languages historically spoken in northern [[France]] and in southern [[Belgium]], which French ([[Francien]]) has largely supplanted. French was also [[substratum|influenced]] by native [[Celtic languages]] of Northern Roman Gaul like [[Gallia Belgica]] and by the ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) [[Frankish language]] of the post-Roman [[Franks|Frankish]] invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas expansion, there are numerous [[French-based creole languages]], most notably [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]]. A French-speaking person or nation may be referred to as '''Francophone'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in both English and French.

French is an [[official language]] in [[List of countries where French is an official language|29 countries]] across five different continents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countries_by_languages.htm|title=In which countries of the world is this language spoken...|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are members of the ''[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]'' (OIF), the community of 84 countries which share the official use or teaching of French.

As a result of French and Belgian [[colonialism]] from the 16th century onward, French was introduced to new territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Most second-language speakers reside in [[Francophone Africa]], in particular [[Gabon]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=2005_report&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2098821778 ''La Francophonie dans le monde 2006–2007''] published by the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]].

French is one of Haiti's two official languages. It is the principal language of writing, school instruction, and administrative use. It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses.

==History==
{{Main|History of French}}
French is a [[Romance language]] (meaning that it is descended primarily from [[Vulgar Latin]]) that evolved out of the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France. The language's early forms include Old French and Middle French.

=== Vulgar Latin in Gallia ===
{{see also|Gallo-Romance}}

Due to Roman rule, Latin was gradually adopted by the inhabitants of Gaul, and as the language was learned by the common people it developed a distinct local character, with grammatical differences from Latin as spoken elsewhere, some of which being attested on graffiti.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; This local variety evolved into the Gallo-Romance tongues, which include French and its closest relatives, such as [[Arpitan language|Arpitan]].

The [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] [[Gaulish language]] is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization.&lt;ref name=Helix&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|isbn=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7|quote=Le déclin du Gaulois et sa disparition ne s'expliquent pas seulement par des pratiques culturelles spécifiques: Lorsque les Romains conduits par César envahirent la Gaule, au 1er siecle avant J.-C., celle-ci romanisa de manière progressive et profonde.

=== Old French ===
{{Main|Old French}}
The beginning of French in Gaul was greatly influenced by Germanic invasions into the country. These invasions had the greatest impact on the northern part of the country and on the language there.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.eb.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/levels/collegiate/article/French-literature/109418|title=French Literature|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A language divide began to grow across the country. The population in the north spoke [[Langues d'oïl|langue d'oïl]] while the population in the south spoke [[langue d'oc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=academic.eb.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/levels/collegiate/article/French-literature/109418|title=French Literature|last=|first=|date=|website=Britannica Academic, Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langue d'oïl grew into what is known as Old French. The period of Old French spanned between the 8th and 14th centuries. Old French shared many characteristics with Latin. For example, Old French made use of all possible word orders just as Latin did.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lahousse|first=Karen|last2=Lamiroy|first2=Béatrice|date=2012|title=Word order in French, Spanish and Italian:A grammaticalization account|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/flin.2012.46.issue-2/flin.2012.014/flin.2012.014.xml|journal=Folia Linguistica|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|doi=10.1515/flin.2012.014|issn=1614-7308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle French ===
{{Main|Middle French}}
Within Old French many dialects emerged but the Francien dialect is one that not only continued but also thrived during the Middle French period (14th century–17th century).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Modern French grew out of this Francien dialect.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Grammatically, during the period of Middle French, noun declensions were lost and there began to be standardized rules.

During the 17th century, French replaced [[Latin]] as the most important language of diplomacy and international relations ([[lingua franca]]). It retained this role until approximately the middle of the 20th century, when it was [[International English|replaced by English]] as the United States became the dominant global power following the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="andaman.org"&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 Most Influential Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312042140/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm |date=12 March 2008 }} ''Top Languages''.

During the [[Grand Siècle]] (17th century), France, under the rule of powerful leaders such as [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], enjoyed a period of prosperity and prominence among European nations. Richelieu established the Académie française to protect the French language. By the early 1800s, Parisian French had become the primary language of the aristocracy in France.

Near the beginning of the 19th century, the [[French government]] began to pursue policies with the end goal of eradicating the many minority and regional languages ([[Patois]]) spoken in France. This began in 1794 with [[Henri Grégoire]]'s "''Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalise the use of the French language"''. When public education was made [[Compulsory education|compulsory]], only French was taught and the use of any other (Patois) language was punished. The goals of the [[French school system|Public School System]] were made especially clear to the French speaking teachers sent to teach students in regions such as [[Occitania]] and [[Brittany]]: "And remember, Gents: you were given your position in order to kill the Breton language" were instructions given from a French official to teachers in the French [[Departments of France|''department'']] of [[Finistère]] (western [[Brittany]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'Imposture.

Among the historic reformers of French language, such as [[Louis Maigret (grammarian)|Louis Maigret]], Marle M., Marcelin Berthelot, [[Philibert Monet]], [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]], [[Antoine Baudeau de Somaize|Somaize]], nowadays the most striking reform is proposed by [[Mickael Korvin]], a Franco-American linguist of Hungarian origin who wants to eliminate accents, silent letters, double letters and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/livre/les-accents-sont-ils-les-dictateurs-de-la-langue_1098075.html |title=Les accents, dictateurs de la langue? |publisher=L'Express |date= |accessdate=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant as a judicial language, French is one of the official languages of such major international and regional courts, tribunals, and dispute-settlement bodies as the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]], the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]], the [[Economic Community of West African States#The Community Court of Justice|Court of Justice for the Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] the [[International Criminal Court]] and the [[Appellate Body|World Trade Organization Appellate Body]].

In 1997, George Werber published, in ''Language Today'', a comprehensive academic study entitled "The World's 10 most influential languages".&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130507110651/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential languages], George Werber, 1997, ''Language Today'', retrieved on scribd.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Werber ranked French as, after English, the second most ''influential'' language of the world, ahead of Spanish.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt; His criteria were the numbers of native speakers, the number of secondary speakers (especially high for French among fellow [[world language]]s), the number of countries using the language and their respective populations, the economic power of the countries using the language, the number of major areas in which the language is used,  and the [[linguistic prestige]] associated with the mastery of the language (Werber highlighted that French in particular enjoys considerable linguistic prestige).&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt; In a 2008 reassessment of his article, Werber concluded that his findings were still correct since "the situation among the top ten remains unchanged."&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;

Knowledge of French is often considered to be a useful skill by business owners in the [[United Kingdom]]; a 2014 study found that 50% of British managers considered French to be a valuable asset for their business, thus ranking French as the most-sought after foreign language there, ahead of [[German language|German]] (49%) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (44%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-27948049 |title=Foreign languages 'shortfall' for business, CBI says |last=Burns |first=Judith |date=2014-06-22 |work=BBC News |access-date=2018-11-18 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIT economist Albert Saiz calculated a 2.3% premium for those who have French as a foreign language in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/03/language-study|title=Johnson: What is a foreign language worth?|last=Johnson|first=|date=9 December 2017|website=The Economist|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English-speaking [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Republic of Ireland]], French is the first foreign language taught and in number of pupils is far ahead of other languages. In the [[United States]], Spanish is the most commonly taught foreign language, though French is next.

The future of the French language is often discussed in the news. For example, in 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' documented an increase in the teaching of French in New York, especially in dual-language programs where only Spanish and Mandarin are now offered more than French as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/nyregion/a-push-for-french-in-new-york-schools-from-france.html |title=A Big Advocate of French in New York’s Schools: France |last=Semple |first=Kirk |date=30 January 2014 |work=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the linguist [[John McWhorter]] launched a frontal attack on the article on his blog at ''[[The New Republic]]''. He stressed that learning French in the United States is anchored in an outdated view of French as the most widely spoken language in [[Europe]] at a time when U.S. immigration from outside Europe was limited. McWhorter argued that young Americans should learn languages such as Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic or Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/116443/new-york-citys-french-dual-language-programs-are-mostly-pointless|title=Let's Stop Pretending That French Is an Important Language|work=New Republic|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a study published in March 2014 by ''[[Forbes]]'', the investment bank [[Natixis]] said that French could become the world's most spoken language by 2050. It noted that French is spreading in areas where the population is rapidly increasing, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/03/21/want-to-know-the-language-of-the-future-the-data-suggests-it-could-be-french/#53c033776d58|title= Want To Know The Language Of The Future?

==Phonology==
{{Main|French phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}
[[File:10-07-2013 - Mary Robinson juge « inacceptables » les violences faites aux femmes en RDC - VOA.ogg|thumb|Spoken French]]

Although there are many French regional accents, foreign learners normally use only one variety of the language.
* There are a maximum of 17 vowels in French, not all of which are used in every dialect: {{IPA|/a/, /ɑ/, /e/, /ɛ/, /ɛː/, /ə/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /y/, /u/, /œ/, /ø/,}} plus the nasalized vowels {{IPA|/ɑ̃/, /ɛ̃/, /ɔ̃/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}}. In France, the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, {{IPA|/ə/}}, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/œ̃/}} are present.
* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.
* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.
* Nasals: The velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').
* Fricatives: French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/ʃ/~/ʒ/}}. Notice that {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.
* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[ʁu]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', "wheel". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.
* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[ɥ]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/pɛj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', "pay", vs. {{IPA|/pɛi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', "country".

French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:
* final consonants: Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered "final" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).
** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or "link" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-à-terre''.
** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' → ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' → ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.
* [[elision (French)|elision]] or vowel dropping: Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled → ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' ("the man whom he saw") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' ("the man who saw him"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as "qu'il-a", while the second breaks as "qui-l'a". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.

==Writing system==

===Alphabet===
{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}

French is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in "ç".

There are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], "œ" and "æ", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed for "oe" and "ae" in formal and literary texts.

===Orthography===
{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}

French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as "debt"):
* Old French ''doit'' &gt; French ''doigt'' "finger" (Latin ''digitus'')
* Old French ''pie'' &gt; French ''pied'' "foot" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]

French is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one to one correlation from a phoneme to its related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber, tombai,'' and ''tombé'' all end with the /E/ phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|url=http://www-tandfonline-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/abs/10.1093/wsr/wsr003|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129–44|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''

As a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-à-terre''.

French writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''château'' pl. ''châteaux''.
* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.
* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.
* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzjɔ̃]}} and not {{IPA|[ilːyzjɔ̃]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' ("a news item" or "a piece of information") is pronounced {{IPA|[ynɛ̃fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' ("a nymphomaniac") is pronounced {{IPA|[ynːɛ̃fo]}}.
* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.
** Accents that affect pronunciation
*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''é'' (e.g., '''''é'''cole''—school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/ə/}}.
*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''è'' (e.g., ''él'''è'''ve''—pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/ə/}}.
*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''ê'' (e.g. ''for'''ê'''t''—forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and that an ''ô'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} for the letter ''â'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''forêt'', ''hospital'' became ''hôpital'', and ''hostel'' became ''hôtel''.
*** The [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''le tréma'') (e.g., ''na'''ï'''f''—naive, ''No'''ë'''l''—Christmas) as in English, specifies that this vowel is pronounced separately from the preceding one, not combined, and is not a [[schwa]].
*** The [[cedilla]] (''la cédille'') ''ç'' (e.g., ''gar'''ç'''on''—boy) means that the letter ''ç'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''ç'' is never found in front of front vowels.
** Accents with no pronunciation effect
*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''île'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')&lt;!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] --&gt;. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''dîtes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''dû'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).
*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''là'' and ''où'' ("there", "where") from the article ''la'' ("the" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' ("or"), respectively.

Some proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fonétik.fr writing system proposal].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex?

==Grammar==
{{Main|French grammar}}
French is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including
* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s
* only two [[grammatical gender]]s
* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s
* new [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] formed from auxiliaries

=== Nouns ===
Every French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a "enseignant" while a female teacher is a "enseignante." However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be "enseignants." A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be "enseignants." In many situations, and in the case of "enseignant," both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular "le professeur" or "la professeur(e)" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural "les professeurs" because "le," "la," and "les" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, "le dentiste" refers to a male dentist while "la dentiste" refers to a female dentist.

{{Main|French verbs}}

==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====
The French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (impératif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[Infinitive|infinitive mood]] (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe présent), and the [[past participle]] (participe passé).

===== Finite moods =====

====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======
The indicative mood makes use of eight different tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (présent), the [[simple past]] ([[passé composé]] and [[passé simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur antérieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (passé antérieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the passé composé is used while the passé simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older passé antérieur seen in literary works.

Within the indicative mood, the passé composé, plus-que-parfait, futur antérieur, and passé antérieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.

====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======
The subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (présent), simple past (passé composé), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).

Within the subjunctive mood, the passé composé and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.

==== Voice ====
French uses both the [[active voice]] and the [[passive voice]]. The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''être'' ("to be") and the past participle.

Example of the active voice:
* "Elle aime le chien." ''She loves the dog.''
* "Mark a conduit la voiture." ''Mark drove the car.''
Example of the passive voice:
* "Le chien est aimé par elle." ''The dog is loved by her.''
* "La voiture était conduite par Mark." ''The car was driven by Mark.''

==== Syntax ====

===== Word order =====
French declarative word order is [[subject–verb–object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like "Parlez-vous français?" when asking a question rather than just "Vous parlez français ?" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into "Do you speak French?" while the second one is literally just "You speak French?" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. "Parlez-vous français ?" may become "Est-ce que vous parlez français ?" French also uses [[Verb–object–subject|verb–object–subject (VOS)]] and [[Object–subject–verb|object–subject–verb (OSV)]] word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Vocabulary==
The majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a "popular" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:
* brother: ''[[wikt:frère|frère]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''
* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''
* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fidèle|fidèle]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''
* eye: ''[[wikt:œil|œil]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''

However, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:
* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''
* ''[[wikt:éteindre|éteindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''
* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''
* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''

There are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:
* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''
* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''

It can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.

More recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}&lt;/ref&gt; I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --&gt; to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules. The result is often two (or more) co-existing terms for describing the same phenomenon. {{Pie chart|caption=Root languages of [[loanwords]]&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Walter &amp; Walter 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;|other=|label1=[[English language|English]]|value1=25.10|color1=#69f|label2=[[Italian language|Italian]]|value2=16.83|color2=#30c|label3=[[Germanic languages]]|value3=13.10|color3=#06f|label4=[[Gallo-Romance languages]]|label5=[[Arabic]]|label6=[[German language|German]]|label7=[[Celtic languages]]|label8=[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|label9=[[Dutch language|Dutch]]|label10=[[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]]|label11=[[Native American languages]]|label12=Various Asian languages|label13=[[Afro-Asiatic languages]]|label14=[[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Baltic languages]]|label15=[[Basque language|Basque]]|label16=Other languages|color4=silver|color5=#0c9|color6=#093|color7=#030|color8=#399|color9=#006|color10=#9cf|color11=#3f0|color12=#9c0|color13=#000|color15=#360|color16=#fff|value4=11.45|value5=5.12|value6=3.91|value7=3.81|value8=3.81|value9=3.64|value10=2.67|value11=2.41|value12=2.12|value13=1.33|value14=1.31|value15=0.24|value16=3.43|color14=#60f}}

It is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical [[dictionary]] such as the ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' or ''Micro-Robert Plus'' (35,000 words) are of foreign origin (where [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] learned words are not seen as foreign). About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from [[English language|English]] and are fairly recent borrowings. The others are some 707 words from [[Italian language|Italian]], 550 from ancient [[Germanic languages]], 481 from other [[Gallo-Romance languages]], 215 from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], 164 from [[German language|German]], 160 from [[Celtic languages]], 159 from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 153 from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], 112 from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], 101 from [[Native American languages]], 89 from other [[Asian languages]], 56 from other [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], 55 from [[Slavic languages]] and [[Baltic languages]], 10 from [[Basque language|Basque]] and 144 (about 3%) from other languages.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

One study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin estimated that among the languages analyzed French has the greatest distance from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Story of Language |last=Pei |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Pei |year=1949 |isbn=03-9700-400-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexical similarity]] is 89% with Italian, 80% with Sardinian, 78% with Rhaeto-Romance, and 75% with Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MED&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Brincat|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita Ethnologue report for language code:ita (Italy)] – Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

===Numerals===
The French counting system is partially [[vigesimal]]: [[20 (number)|twenty]] (''{{lang|fr|vingt}}'') is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 80 to 99. The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally "four twenties", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally "sixty-fifteen". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the different counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences). This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in "fourscore and seven" (87), or "threescore and ten" (70).

In Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge, England | page = 110 | isbn = 0-521-09838-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Martin 1984"&gt;Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du français parlé en Vallée d'Aoste'', éd. Musumeci, [[Quart, Aosta Valley|Quart]], 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and the French used in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] are different in this respect. In the French spoken in these places, 70 and 90 are ''{{lang|fr|septante}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|nonante}}''. In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'' (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or ''{{lang|fr|huitante}}'' (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg). ''Octante'' had been used in [[Switzerland]] in the past, but is now considered archaic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langue-fr.net/spip.php?article202|title=Septante, octante (huitante), nonante|work=langue-fr.net|language=fr}}. See also the English Wikipedia article on [[Welsh language]], especially the section "Counting system" and its note on the influence of [[Celts|Celtic]] in the French counting system.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the [[Aosta Valley]] 80 is ''{{lang|fr|huitante}}''.&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Martin 1984" /&gt; In Belgium and in its former African colonies, however, ''quatre-vingts'' is universally used.

French, like most European languages, uses a space to separate thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Questions de langue: Nombres (écriture, lecture, accord) |publisher=[[Académie française]] |url=http://académie-française.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#57_strong-em-nombres-criture-lecture-accord-em-strong |access-date=15 November 2015 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101052809/http://xn--acadmie-franaise-npb1a.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#57_strong-em-nombres-criture-lecture-accord-em-strong |archive-date=1 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |quote=''Dans un souci de lisibilité, on sépare les milliers par une espace insécable dans les nombres exprimant une quantité&amp;nbsp;: ''1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;m'', ''342&amp;nbsp;234&amp;nbsp;euros'', ''1&amp;nbsp;234&amp;nbsp;°C'',&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;br /&gt;En revanche, dans les nombres ayant fonction de numérotage (pages, dates, articles de code), les chiffres ne sont jamais séparés&amp;nbsp;: ''page&amp;nbsp;1254 of the 1992 edition, article&amp;nbsp;1246 of the Civil Code.''&lt;br /&gt;La virgule (et non le point comme chez les anglo‑saxons) sépare la partie entière de la partie décimale&amp;nbsp;: ''π&amp;nbsp;vaut environ&amp;nbsp;3,14''&amp;nbsp;; ''14,5&amp;nbsp;est la moitié de&amp;nbsp;29''.'' |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The comma is used in French numbers as a decimal point, i.e. "2,5" instead of "2.5".

The '''Frisian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|iː|ʒ|ə|n}},&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɪ|ʒ|ə|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɪ|ʒ|i|ə|n}}) languages are a closely related group of [[Germanic languages]], spoken by about 500,000 [[Frisian people]], who live on the southern fringes of the [[North Sea]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]. The Frisian languages are the closest living language group to the [[Anglic languages]]; the two groups make up the [[Anglo-Frisian languages]] group. However, modern English and Frisian are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], nor are Frisian languages intelligible among themselves, due to independent linguistic innovations and foreign influences.

There are three different Frisian languages: [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], by far the most spoken of the three, is an official language in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Friesland]], where it is spoken on the mainland and on two of the [[West Frisian Islands]]: [[Terschelling]] and [[Schiermonnikoog]]. It is also spoken in four villages in the [[Westerkwartier]] of the neighbouring province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] is spoken in the northernmost [[Germany|German]] [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Nordfriesland (district)|Nordfriesland]] in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]: On the [[North Frisia]]n mainland, and on the [[North Frisian Islands]] of [[Sylt]], [[Föhr]], [[Amrum]], and the [[Halligen]]. It is also spoken on the islands of [[Heligoland]] and [[Düne]], in the [[North Sea]]. The third Frisian language, [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]], a variant of East Frisan, is only spoken in four villages in the [[Cloppenburg (district)|district of Cloppenburg]] in the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. The four villages of the [[Saterland|Saterland/Seelterlound]] lie just outside the borders of [[East Frisia]], where, apart from [[German language|German]], [[East Frisian Low Saxon]], which is not a Frisian language, but a variant of [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], is spoken.

Depending upon their location, the three Frisian languages have been heavily influenced by and bear similarities to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]]. Additional shared linguistic characteristics between the [[Great Yarmouth]] area and [[Friesland]] are likely to have resulted from the close trading relationship these areas maintained during the centuries-long [[Hanseatic League]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237534065_The_Position_of_Frisian_in_the_Germanic_Language_Area |chapter = The Position of Frisian in the Germanic Language Area|last = Gooskens|first = Charlotte|date = 2004| title = On the Boundaries of Phonology and Phonetics |editor-first = D.

==Division==
There are three varieties of Frisian: [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]], and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]]. Some linguists consider these three varieties, despite their [[mutual unintelligibility]], to be dialects of one single Frisian language, whereas others consider them to be three separate languages, as do their speakers. West Frisian is strongly influenced by Dutch, and, like Dutch, is described as being "between" English and German. The other Frisian languages, meanwhile, have been influenced by Low German and German. The North Frisian language especially is further segmented into several strongly diverse dialects. [[Stadsfries]] and [[West Frisian Dutch]] are not Frisian, but [[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialects influenced by West Frisian. Frisian is called ''Frysk'' in West Frisian, ''Fräisk'' in Saterland Frisian, and ''Frasch'', ''Fresk'', ''Freesk'', and ''Friisk'' in the dialects of North Frisian.

The situation in the Dutch province of Groningen and the German region of [[East Frisia]] is more complex: The local [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] dialects of [[Gronings]] and [[East Frisian Low Saxon]] are a mixture of Frisian and Low Saxon dialects; it is believed that Frisian was spoken there at one time, only to have been gradually replaced by Low Saxon. This local language is now, in turn, being replaced by standard Dutch and German.

===Speakers===
Most Frisian speakers live in the [[Netherlands]], primarily in the province of [[Friesland]], since 1997 officially using its West Frisian name of Fryslân, where the number of native speakers is about 400,000,&lt;ref name="Extra"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Other Languages of Europe: Demographic, Sociolinguistic, and Educational Perspectives|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hvmy_skUPNYC|publisher = Multilingual Matters|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9781853595097|first = Guus|last = Extra|first2 = Durk|last2 = Gorter}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about 75% of the inhabitants of Friesland.&lt;ref name=Bremmer&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Old Frisian: History, Grammar, Reader, Glossary|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uWYsSOp6g58C|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 9027232555|language = en|first = Rolf Hendrik|last = Bremmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of native Dutch speakers in the province are learning Frisian as a second language.

In [[Germany]], there are about 2,000&lt;ref&gt;"Gegenwärtige Schätzungen schwanken zwischen 1.500 und 2.500." Marron C. Fort: Das Saterfriesische. In: Horst Haider Munske, Nils Århammar: Handbuch des Friesischen – Handbook of Frisian Studies. Niemayer (Tübingen 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; speakers of Saterland Frisian in the [[Saterland]] region of [[Lower Saxony]]; the Saterland's marshy fringe areas have long protected Saterland Frisian speech there from pressure by the surrounding [[Low German]] and [[German language|standard German]],{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} but Saterland Frisian still remains seriously endangered because of its exclusion to agrarian community and its lack of a sizable and educated community to help preserve and spread the language.&lt;ref name=Bremmer /&gt;

In the [[North Frisia]] (''Nordfriesland'') region of the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], there were 10,000 North Frisian speakers in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Although many of these live on the mainland, most are found on the islands, notably [[Sylt]], [[Föhr]], [[Amrum]], and [[Heligoland]]. The local corresponding North Frisian dialects are still in use.

As a regional language in the Netherlands, West Frisian is only spoken by a certain demographic, specifically rural, lower-income people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Frisian language use and ethnic identity: International Journal of the Sociology of Language|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ijsl.1987.issue-64/ijsl.1987.64.9/ijsl.1987.64.9.xml|website = www.degruyter.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with the Dutch speaking upper-class.

West Frisian-Dutch bilinguals are split into two categories: Speakers who had Dutch as their first language tended to maintain the Dutch system of homophony between plural and linking suffixes when speaking West Frisian, by using the West Frisian plural as a linking morpheme. Speakers who had West Frisian as their first language often maintained the West Frisian system of no homophony when speaking West Frisian.

Speakers of the many Frisian dialects may also be found in the United States and Canada.

Saterland and North Frisian&lt;ref&gt;''[[w:de:s:Friesisch-Gesetz|Gesetz zur Förderung des Friesischen im öffentlichen Raum]]'' - [[w:de:s:Hauptseite|Wikisource]] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; are officially recognised and protected as [[minority language]]s in Germany, and West Frisian is one of the two official languages in the Netherlands, the other being [[Dutch language|Dutch]].
[[ISO 639-1]] code &lt;code&gt;fy&lt;/code&gt; and [[ISO 639-2]] code &lt;code&gt;fry&lt;/code&gt; were assigned to "Frisian", but that was changed in November 2005 to "[[West Frisian language|Western Frisian]]". According to the ISO 639 Registration Authority the "previous usage of [this] code has been for Western Frisian, although [the] language name was 'Frisian'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niso.org/international/SC4/N585.pdf |format=PDF |title=Registration Authority Report 2004-2005 |accessdate=2007-11-23 |author=Christian Galinski |author2=Rebecca Guenther |author3=Håvard Hjulstad |pages=4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020020306/http://www.niso.org/international/SC4/N585.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[ISO 639]] code &lt;code&gt;stq&lt;/code&gt; is used for the [[Saterland Frisian language]], a variety of Eastern Frisian (not to be confused with [[East Frisian Low Saxon]], a [[West Low German]] dialect). The new ISO 639 code &lt;code&gt;frr&lt;/code&gt; is used for the [[North Frisian language]] variants spoken in parts of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].

The [http://language-diversity.eu/en/knowledge/regions-of-europe/die-westfriesen-in-den-niederlanden/ Ried fan de Fryske Beweging] is an organization which works for the preservation of the West Frisian language and culture in the Dutch province of [[Friesland]]. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20160125181924/https://www.fryske-akademy.nl/en/thusside/ Fryske Academy] also plays a large role, since its foundation in 1938, to conduct research on Frisian language, history, and society, including attempts at forming a larger dictionary.&lt;ref name="Extra"/&gt; Recent attempts have allowed Frisian be used somewhat more  in some of the domains of education, media and public administration.&lt;ref name="Fishman"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Can Threatened Languages be Saved?: Reversing Language Shift, Revisited : a 21st Century Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oScUXmAkRXIC|publisher = Multilingual Matters|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9781853594922|first = Joshua A.|last = Fishman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] and most dialects of North Frisian are seriously [[endangered language|endangered]]&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Brenzinger, ''Language Diversity Endangered'', Mouton de Gruter, The Hague: 222&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is considered as vulnerable to being endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Atlas of languages in danger {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|url = http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/atlas-of-languages-in-danger/|website = www.unesco.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, for all advances in integrating Frisian in daily life, there is still a lack of education and media awareness of the Frisian language, perhaps reflecting its rural origins and its lack of prestige&lt;ref name="Deumert"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Germanic Standardizations: Past to Present|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NVw9AAAAQBAJ|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|date = 2003-10-27|isbn = 9789027296306|first = Ana|last = Deumert|first2 = Wim|last2 = Vandenbussche}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in a sociological sense it is considered more a dialect than a standard language, even though linguistically it is a separate language.&lt;ref name="Deumert"/&gt;

For [[L2 speakers]], both the quality and amount of time Frisian is taught in the classroom is low, concluding that Frisian lessons do not contribute meaningfully to the linguistic and cultural development of the students.&lt;ref name="Extra"/&gt; Moreover, Frisian runs the risk of dissolving into Dutch, especially in [[Friesland]], where both languages are used.&lt;ref name="Fishman"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Brokmerbrief.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Old Frisian]] text from 1345.]]

===Old Frisian===
{{Main|Old Frisian}}
In the [[Early Middle Ages]] the Frisian lands stretched from the area around [[Bruges]], in what is now [[Belgium]], to the river [[Weser]], in northern [[Germany]]. At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern [[North Sea]] coast. Today this region is sometimes referred to as Great Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage, even though in most places the Frisian languages have been lost.

Frisian is the language most closely related to [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]], but after at least five hundred years of being subject to the influence of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], modern Frisian in some aspects bears a greater similarity to Dutch than to English; one must also take into account the centuries-long drift of English away from Frisian. Thus the two languages have become less mutually intelligible over time, partly due to the marks which Dutch and [[Low German]] have left on Frisian, and partly due to the vast influence some languages (in particular [[Norman French]]) have had on English throughout the centuries.

[[Old Frisian]],&lt;ref name=Bremmer /&gt; however, was very similar to [[Old English language|Old English]]. Historically, both English and Frisian are marked by the loss of the Germanic nasal in words like ''us'' (''ús''; ''uns'' in German), ''soft'' (''sêft''; ''sanft'') or ''goose'' (''goes''; ''Gans''): see [[Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law]]. Also, when followed by some vowels, the Germanic ''k'' softened to a ''ch'' sound; for example, the Frisian for ''cheese'' and ''church'' is ''tsiis'' and ''tsjerke'', whereas in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is ''kaas'' and ''kerk'', and in High German the respective words are ''Käse'' and ''Kirche''. Contrarily, this did not happen for ''chin'' and ''choose'', which are ''kin'' and ''kieze''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gooskens |first1=Charlotte |last2=Heeringa |first2= Wilbert |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charlotte_Gooskens/publication/237534065_The_Position_of_Frisian_in_the_Germanic_Language_Area/links/00463528e89b97127d000000.pdf |title=The Position of Frisian in the Germanic Language Area |date=May 2012 |journal=Researchgate |accessdate=25 August 2017 |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dicts.info/dictionary.php?k1=1&amp;k2=178 |title=English to Frisian dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One rhyme demonstrates the palpable similarity between Frisian and English: "Butter, bread and green cheese is good English and good Frisian," which is pronounced more or less the same in both languages (West Frisian: "Bûter, brea en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk.") &lt;ref&gt;The History of English: A Linguistic Introduction. Scott Shay, Wardja Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-615-16817-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-615-16817-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major difference between Old Frisian and modern Frisian is that in the Old Frisian period (c.1150-c.1550) [[Declension|grammatical cases]] still existed. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legalistic writings. Although the earliest definite written examples of Frisian are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of [[runic]] inscriptions from the region which are probably older and possibly in the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually do not amount to more than single- or few-word inscriptions, and cannot be said to constitute [[literature]] as such. The transition from the Old Frisian to the Middle Frisian period (c.1550-c.1820) in the 16th century is based on the fairly abrupt halt in the use of Frisian as a written language.

===Middle West Frisian===
{{Main|Middle Frisian}}
Up until the 15th century Frisian was a language widely spoken and written, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of [[Friesland]] (Fryslân), in 1498, by Duke Albert of Saxony, who replaced West Frisian as the language of government with Dutch.

Afterwards this practice was continued under the [[Habsburg]] rulers of the Netherlands (the German Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his son, the Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]), and even when the Netherlands became independent, in 1585, West Frisian did not regain its former status. The reason for this was the rise of [[County of Holland|Holland]] as the dominant part of the Netherlands, and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.

In this period the great Frisian poet [[Gysbert Japiks]] (1603–66), a schoolteacher and [[Cantus|cantor]] from the city of [[Bolsward]], who largely fathered modern West Frisian literature and orthography, was really an exception to the rule.

His example was not followed until the 19th century, when entire generations of West Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer [[Vowel breaking|breaking]] system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of Southwest Frisian. Therefore, the Modern West Frisian period is considered to have begun at this point in time, around 1820.

=== Modern West Frisian ===
The revival of the West Frisian Language comes from the poet [[Gysbert Japiks]], who had begun to write in the language as a way to show that it was possible, and created a collective West Frisian identity and West Frisian standard of writing through his poetry.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Later on, [[Johannes Hilarides]] would build off Gysbert Japik's work by building on West Frisian orthography, particularly on its pronunciation; he also, unlike Japiks, set a standard of the West Frisian language that focused more heavily on how the common people used it as an everyday language.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Perhaps the most important figure in the spreading of the West Frisian language was [[J. H. Halbertsma]] (1789&amp;ndash;1869), who translated many works into the West Frisian language, such as the New Testament &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He had however, like Hilarides, focused mostly on the vernacular of the West Frisian language, where he focused on translating texts, plays and songs for the lower and middle classes in order to teach and expand the West Frisian language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Standardization: Studies from the Germanic languages|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FdU5AAAAQBAJ|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|date = 2002-12-31|isbn = 9789027283672|first = Andrew R.|last = Linn|first2 = Nicola|last2 = McLelland}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had begun the effort to continuously preserve the West Frisian language, which continues unto this day. It was however not until the first half of the 20th century that the West Frisian revival movement began to gain strength, not only through its language, but also through its culture and history, supporting singing and acting in West Frisian in order to facilitate West Frisian speaking.&lt;ref name="Deumert"/&gt;

It was not until 1960 that Dutch began to dominate West Frisian in Friesland; with many non-Frisian immigrants into Friesland, the language gradually began to diminish, and only survives now due to the constant effort of scholars and organisations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The province of Friesland rather than the language itself has become in recent years a more important part of West Frisian identity, so the language has become less important for cultural preservation purposes.&lt;ref name="Yngve"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hard-Science Linguistics|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fe3XWwbtN7MC|publisher = A&amp;C Black|date = 2006-11-25|isbn = 9780826492395|language = en|first = Victor|last = Yngve|first2 = Zdzislaw|last2 = Wasik}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially written West Frisian that seems to have trouble surviving, with only 30% of the West Frisian population competent in it;&lt;ref name="Yngve"/&gt; it had disappeared in the 16th century and continues to be barely taught today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Standardization: Studies from the Germanic Languages|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mmGKmKU1mU4C|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 9027247471|language = en|first = Andrew Robert|last = Linn|first2 = Nicola|last2 = McLelland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family tree==
Frisian languages belong to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages]], the most widespread language family in Europe and the world. Its closest living genealogical relatives are the [[Anglic languages]], i.e. [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]]; the two groups make up the [[Anglo-Frisian languages]] group.

'''Gay-for-pay''' describes male or female actors, pornographic stars, or [[prostitution|sex workers]] who identify as [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] but who are paid to act or perform as [[homosexuality|homosexual]] professionally. The term has also applied to other professions and even companies trying to appeal to a gay demographic.&lt;ref name="Blazin Squad, gay 4 pay?"&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=James|title=Blazin Squad, gay 4 pay? |publisher=Pink News |date=September 19, 2006 |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-2514.html |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klixxx Home: Gay Webmaster Resources"&gt;{{cite web  |last=Palmer  |first=Brandon  |title=Gay Webmaster Resources: Gay 4 Pay |work=klixxx.com|date=September 19, 2006 |url=http://www.klixxx.com/gay/gay4pay.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070608053700/http://www.klixxx.com/gay/gay4pay.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma of being gay or labeled as such has steadily eroded since the [[Stonewall riots]] began the modern American [[gay rights]] movement in 1969. Through the 1990s, mainstream movie and television actors have been more willing to portray homosexuality, as the threat of any backlash against their careers has lessened and society's acceptance of gay and lesbian people has increased.&lt;ref name="pewreport"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World 2003|url=http://pewglobal.org/2003/06/03/views-of-a-changing-world-2003/  |date=June 3, 2003 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=2007-07-11}}[http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2003/06/Views-Of-A-Changing-World-2003.pdf Full report] (126 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[gay pornography]] industry, which uses amateurs as well as professional actors, the term ''gay-for-pay'' refers to actors who identify as straight but who engage in same-sex [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] for money or sexual gain. Some actors who are actually gay or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] will be marketed as straight to appeal to the "allure of the unattainable", because straight men (or those newly [[coming out]]) are [[Virginity|virgin]]s to [[men who have sex with men|sex with other men]]; scholar [[Camille Paglia]] declared that "Seduction of straight studs is a highly erotic motif in gay porn"&lt;ref&gt;"No Law in the Arena: A Pagan Theory of Sexuality", in Paglia's ''Vamps and Tramps'' (1994, Vintage {{ISBN|0679751203}}), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropologist [[William Leap]] has similarly written, "as in most gay male settings, the young, the muscular, and the unfamiliar are more sought."&lt;ref name="Leap1999"&gt;William L. Leap. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YXUP4JmJo_0C&amp;pg=PA62 Public Sex/Gay Space]''. Columbia University Press; 1999 [cited December 30, 2011]. {{ISBN|978-0-231-10691-7}}. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=April 2011}}

==Pornography==
In gay pornographic movies, actors who identify as straight, but who perform explicit sexual acts with other males, do not face the same stigma as their mainstream acting counterparts and indeed can rise quickly to being featured porn actors.  These actors often play the "[[Top (sex)|top]]" roles but this is not always the case, such as with [[Kristen Bjorn]] and some [[Bel Ami (adult film company)|Bel Ami]] models. In some cases, a straight porn actor will shift between gay and straight porn to expand opportunities to work. 

Because some gay men consider heterosexual men to be objects of fantasy, some gay porn producers have almost certainly described some actors as heterosexual to increase sales and publicity for their product.&lt;ref name="Proven Strait: Movie Review"&gt;{{cite journal

 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many gay or bisexual men who star in gay porn films may wish to be identified publicly as heterosexual for personal or professional reasons.&lt;ref name="Skoch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/commerce/100323/gay-porn-prague?page=full |title=Gay-4-Pay in Prague |work=GlobalPost.com |first=Iva R. |last=Skoch |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some straight actors{{who|date=December 2011}} have started acting in gay porn only to be accused{{by whom|date=December 2011}} of being gay while others' first step was to strictly do solo masturbation or muscle exhibition scenes.&lt;ref name="Fabscout"&gt;{{cite journal

Many times a "top" actor will then be sought as a bottom and the debut is often treated as a notable event or even its own release.&lt;ref name="Andrew Justice"&gt;{{cite journal

===Motivation===
Male pornographic actors are commonly paid more for homosexual work than heterosexual.  There are also more opportunities to become a "star" in gay porn than in straight porn, where the attention is on female performers.

==Sex workers==
{{Main article|Male prostitution}}
In the [[sex worker]] industry, the term may also be applied to straight and bisexual people of either gender (including "[[male escort]]s") who have sexual contact or scenes with a client or another sex worker of the same gender.  Although sexual contact is often involved, sex scenes or solo scenes (like masturbating to climax) or even a [[BDSM]] scene for the client's stimulation can take place.  Sexual arousal without direct sexual contact may also occur in such niche trade like muscle worship.  As in porn work, a gay identity is not necessary to make money from gay clients and consumers.

==Go-go dancers==
[[Go-go dancing]] originated in the 1960s and was eventually appropriated by [[burlesque]] and [[striptease]] establishments, which in turn became known as "go-go bars" but many [[gay club]]s had male go-go dancers (called ''go-go boys'') during the period 1965–1968.  After that, few gay clubs had go-go dancers until a resurgence in the late 1980s when go-go dancing again became fashionable (and has remained so ever since). "Go-go dancers" that perform at night clubs, special parties, [[circuit parties]] or [[rave]] dances in colorful bright costumes (which may include battery operated lights), with fire sticks, or with a snake can also be called ''performance art dancers'' or ''box dancers''. Large [[circuit parties]] and gay clubs often have very attractive go-go boys of all sexualities who will allow patrons to touch and rub them but only for [[gratuity|tips]]. This is typical in Thai venues, such as in [[Sunee Plaza]], Pattaya.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some criticize the practice of employing straight dancers to perform erotically for gay audiences when gay performers are available.&lt;ref name="Hillary and Condi and Dykes"&gt;{{cite web

==Film and television==
{{Main|Cultural appropriation#Gender and sexuality}}
The gay community has expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters, a practice also nicknamed "gay for pay" in the acting industry. This occurs in films such as ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me By Your Name]]'' (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' ([[Heath Ledger]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]), ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'' (starring [[Tom Hanks]]), ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (starring [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (with [[Sean Penn]] playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist-political leader [[Harvey Milk]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.them.us/story/call-me-by-your-name-gay-for-pay-oscar-bait |title=Latest Gay-for-Pay Oscar Bait: Dear Hollywood, Let queer people tell our own damn stories. |last=Kirst |first=Seamus |date=6 December 2017 |website=www.them.us |publisher=Them|access-date= |quote=One need not look far to see that Hollywood often fails to provide both representation of, and employment to, members of marginalized communities. Movements like #OscarsSoWhite, and continued pushback against cisgender actors playing trans roles, have been increasingly covered in media the past few years. Yet the Gay for Pay Problem has not had the same attention, at least in the recent past, as other ways that Hollywood is willing to tell stories from marginalized groups without hiring marginalized people}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In film and TV, "pinkface" is the use of straight actors to play LGB roles or characters. Anna King of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' likens "pinkface" to [[blackface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/brno-reignites-the-pinkface-debate |title=Brno reignites the pinkface debate: As gay-themed films Brno and Humpday hit theaters, TONY weighs in on the drama behind the comedy. |last=King |first=Anna |date=7 July 2009 |website=www.timeout.com |publisher=Timeout |access-date=1 August 2018 |quote=Brno—in which a straight Sacha Baron Cohen plays a flamingly gay Austrian fashion reporter—is the latest film to be accused of making fun of the queer community, drawing the accusation of being pinkface.

It carries the same pejorative connotations but applies to straight actors taking on gay roles. Blackface has long gone the way of anti-miscegenation laws, yet Prop 8 is still with us. Is being gay the new black?}} &lt;/ref&gt; The LGB community raised concerns about the film ''[[Brüno]]'', in which a straight actor ([[Sacha Baron Cohen]]) plays the role of a gay man to "...mak[e] fun of the queer community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/brno-reignites-the-pinkface-debate |title=Brno reignites the pinkface debate: As gay-themed films Brno and Humpday hit theaters, TONY weighs in on the drama behind the comedy. |last=King |first=Anna |date=7 July 2009 |website=www.timeout.com |publisher=Timeout |access-date=1 August 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Lim states that the depictions of gays in mainstream film typically include the "gay joke" (in which LGB people are depicted to create humor); depicting gay men pejoratively as a "daisy, a fairy, a nonce, a pansy, a swish" or showing lesbian woman as "butch"; and to create a [[moral panic|homosexual panic]] that plays on heterosexual people's fears of experiencing sexual advances from LGB people (the "most notorious of all gay-panic movies, [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'' (1980)" links gay men to homicide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/07/on_the_offensive.html |title=On the Offensive: After Brüno, Hollywood depictions of gays may never be the same.

Pinkface in television advertising has also been compared to blackface; similarly to the way 19th century blackface performances created and affirmed a hierarchical system that presented certain identities as "preferred and privileged", with pinkface ads, LGBT people are portrayed to create "humorous stigmatization" which is "insidious", as "like blackface, pinkface advertisements create a culture that posits the identities of GLBT persons [to a mainly non-GLBT audience] as inferior, inappropriate and ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;Farr, Daniel and Guenther, Gretchen.

Tanfer Emin Tunc, Annessa Ann Babic.

Gary Nunn of ''[[The Guardian]]'', noting that he grew up as a closeted and confused boy, said that while he understands gay people wanting to "redress the balance" of "gay actors hav[ing] been told by Hollywood to stay in the closet if they ever want to play a straight role" and straight white men having more power and influence and access to better jobs than other people, "to demand that only gay actors play gay roles is not the way to correct an inequality." He believes that "in a world where gay actors are still denied straight roles, it'll just lead to typecasting of gay actors - the very thing they're wanting to escape. Gay actors want a diversity of roles just like straight actors do."&lt;ref name="Nunn"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gary|last=Nunn|title=Outrage at Disney casting Jack Whitehall to play a gay character is misguided|date=August 15, 2018|accessdate=August 31, 2018||publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/15/outrage-at-disney-casting-jack-whitehall-to-play-a-gay-character-is-misguided}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Straight-for-pay==
A term that is derivative of "gay-for-pay" is the partly tongue-in-cheek term "straight-for-pay", which describes gay men who have sex with women for pay. The term was coined to describe the film ''[[Shifting Gears: A Bisexual Transmission]]'', due to gay porn stars [[Cameron Marshall]] and Blake Riley being featured in heterosexual scenes. Other notable examples of gay porn stars going "straight-for-pay" are [[Steven Daigle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manhuntdaily.com/steven-daigle-goes-straight-for-pay/ |title=STEVEN DAIGLE GOES STRAIGHT-FOR-PAY |publisher=[[Manhunt.net]] |accessdate=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arpad Miklos]], the latter of whom received a great deal of criticism for his scene on the site Straight Guys for Gay Eyes (SG4GE). SG4GE's company principal Jake Cruise defended the scene, stating that it was a "winning idea" to portray a "masculine gay man exploring straight sex" because "I’ve always loved to push boundaries and press buttons with my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayporntimes.com/hardnews/2009/08/10/arpad-miklos-goes-straight-for-pay-for-jake-cruise/ |title=Arpad Miklos Goes ‘Straight for Pay’ for Jake Cruise |publisher=Gay Porn Times |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/111450/arpad-miklos-goes-straight-for-pay-for-jake-cruise |title=Arpad Miklos Goes 'Straight for Pay' for Jake Cruise |publisher=Xbiz.com |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August of 2018, the gay male pornographic website [[Men.com]] released its first scene featuring [[Bisexual pornography|MMF bisexual porn]] titled "The Challenge". Arad Winwin, the star of the scene and a self-identified gay man, faced backlash from fans for acting in the scene, with some fans accusing him of being [[Heterosexuality|straight]] or of having "[[Sexual orientation change efforts|converted]]" to heterosexual or bisexual. Winwin told the gay website ''Str8UpGayPorn'' that “I’m a gay man...This was only a job, and it was nothing more. Nothing personal. I was working, and it was like any other scene I’ve done.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menofporn.typepad.com/menofporn/2018/07/first-bisexual-scene-at-men-is-with-arad-winwin-daxx-carter.html |title=First bisexual scene at Men is with Arad Winwin, Daxx Carter &amp; Silvia Saige (tip @ Tchelo) |publisher=MenofPorn.com |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intomore.com/culture/men-com-users-upset-with-bisexual-video-featuring-a-woman-because-of-course |title=Men.com Users Upset With Bisexual Video Featuring a Woman Because of Course |publisher=Intomore.com |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://str8upgayporn.com/arad-winwin-bisexual-porn/ |title=Exclusive—Arad Winwin Responds To Criticism Of Bisexual Scene And Questions About His Sexuality: “I’m A Gay Man, And This Was Only A Job” |publisher=str8upgayporn.com |accessdate=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9137">The [[Riemann hypothesis]] is one of the most important [[conjecture]]s in [[mathematics]]. It is a statement about the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. Various geometrical and arithmetical objects can be described by so-called '''global [[L-function|''L''-function]]s''', which are formally similar to the Riemann zeta-function. One can then ask the same question about the zeros of these ''L''-functions, yielding various generalizations of the Riemann hypothesis. Many mathematicians believe these '''generalizations of the Riemann hypothesis''' to be true. The only cases of these conjectures which have been proven occur in the [[algebraic function field]] case (not the number field case).

Global ''L''-functions can be associated to [[elliptic curve]]s, [[number field]]s (in which case they are called '''[[Dedekind zeta-function]]s'''), [[Maass form]]s, and [[Dirichlet character]]s (in which case they are called [[Dirichlet L-series|Dirichlet L-function]]s). When the Riemann hypothesis is formulated for Dedekind zeta-functions, it is known as the '''extended Riemann hypothesis''' (ERH) and when it is formulated for Dirichlet ''L''-functions, it is known as the '''generalized Riemann hypothesis''' (GRH). These two statements will be discussed in more detail below. (Many mathematicians use the label ''generalized Riemann hypothesis'' to cover the extension of the Riemann hypothesis to all global ''L''-functions, 
not just the special case of Dirichlet ''L''-functions.)

== Generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH) ==
The generalized Riemann hypothesis (for Dirichlet ''L''-functions) was probably formulated for the first time by [[Adolf Piltz]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the original Riemann hypothesis, it has far reaching consequences about the distribution of [[prime number]]s.

The formal statement of the hypothesis follows. A [[Dirichlet character]] is a [[multiplicative function|completely multiplicative]] [[arithmetic function]] ''χ'' such that there exists a positive integer ''k'' with {{nowrap|1=''χ''(''n'' + ''k'') = ''χ''(''n'')}} for all ''n'' and {{nowrap|1=''χ''(''n'') = 0}} whenever {{nowrap|gcd(''n'', ''k'') &gt; 1}}. If such a character is given, we define the corresponding '''Dirichlet ''L''-function''' by
:&lt;math&gt;
L(\chi,s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}
&lt;/math&gt;

for every [[complex number]] ''s'' such that {{nowrap|Re ''s'' &gt; 1}}. By [[analytic continuation]], this function can be extended to a [[meromorphic function]] defined on the whole complex plane. The generalized Riemann hypothesis asserts that, for every Dirichlet character ''χ'' and every complex number ''s'' with {{nowrap|1=''L''(''χ'', ''s'') = 0}}, if ''s'' is not negative real number, then the real part of ''s'' is 1/2.

The case {{nowrap|1=''χ''(''n'') = 1}} for all ''n'' yields the ordinary Riemann hypothesis.

=== Consequences of GRH ===
[[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] states that if ''a'' and ''d'' are [[coprime]] [[natural number]]s, then the [[arithmetic progression]] ''a'', {{nowrap|''a'' + ''d''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' + 2''d''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' + 3''d''}}, ... contains [[Infinite set|infinitely many]] prime numbers. Let {{nowrap|π(''x'', ''a'', ''d'')}} denote the number of prime numbers in this progression which are less than or equal to ''x''. If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then for every coprime ''a'' and ''d'' and for every {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}},
:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x,a,d) = \frac{1}{\varphi(d)} \int_2^x \frac{1}{\ln t}\,dt + O(x^{1/2+\varepsilon})\quad\mbox{ as } \ x\to\infty,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''φ''(''d'') is [[Euler's totient function]] and ''O'' is the [[Big O notation]]. This is a considerable strengthening of the [[prime number theorem]].

If GRH is true, then every proper subgroup of the multiplicative group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times&lt;/math&gt; omits a number less than {{nowrap|2(ln ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as well as a number coprime to ''n'' less than {{nowrap|3(ln ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bach |first=Eric |year=1990 |title=Explicit bounds for primality testing and related problems |journal=[[Mathematics of Computation]] |volume=55 |issue=191 |pages=355–380 |doi=10.2307/2008811 |jstor=2008811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times&lt;/math&gt; is generated by a set of numbers less than {{nowrap|2(ln ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is often used in proofs, and it has many consequences, for example (assuming GRH):
*The [[Miller–Rabin primality test]] is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. (A polynomial-time primality test which does not require GRH, the [[AKS primality test]], was published in 2002.)
*The [[Shanks–Tonelli algorithm]] is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.
*The Ivanyos–Karpinski–Saxena deterministic algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gabor|last1=Ivanyos|last2=Karpinski|first2=Marek|first3=Nitin|last3=Saxena|title=Schemes for Deterministic Polynomial Factoring|journal=Proc. ISAAC|year=2009|pages=191–198|doi=10.1145/1576702.1576730|isbn=9781605586090|arxiv=0804.1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; for factoring polynomials over finite fields with prime constant-smooth degrees is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.

If GRH is true, then for every prime ''p'' there exists a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root mod ''p'']] (a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo ''p'') that is less than &lt;math&gt;O((\ln p)^6).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Victor |last=Shoup |title=Searching for primitive roots in finite fields |journal=Mathematics of Computation |volume=58 |issue=197 |year=1992 |pages=369–380 |doi= 10.2307/2153041|jstor=2153041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goldbach's weak conjecture]] also follows from the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The yet to be verified proof of [[Harald Helfgott]] of this conjecture verifies the GRH for several thousand small characters up to a certain imaginary part to obtain sufficient bounds that prove the conjecture for all integers above 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;, integers below which have already been verified by brute force.&lt;ref&gt;p5. {{cite arXiv|last=Helfgott|first=Harald|eprint=1305.2897|title=Major arcs for Goldbach's theorem|class=math.NT|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the truth of the GRH, the estimate of the character sum in the [[Character sum|Pólya–Vinogradov inequality]] can be improved to &lt;math&gt;O\left(\sqrt{q}\log\log q\right)&lt;/math&gt;, ''q'' being the modulus of the character.

== Extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH) ==

Suppose ''K'' is a [[number field]] (a finite-dimensional [[field extension]] of the [[rational number|rationals]] '''Q''') with [[algebraic number|ring of integers]] O&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; (this ring is the [[integral closure]] of the [[integer]]s '''Z''' in ''K''). If ''a'' is an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of O&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;, other than the zero ideal, we denote its [[ideal norm|norm]] by ''Na''. The '''[[Dedekind zeta-function]]''' of ''K'' is then defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
\zeta_K(s) = \sum_a \frac{1}{(Na)^s}
&lt;/math&gt;
for every complex number ''s'' with real part &gt; 1. The sum extends over all non-zero ideals ''a'' of O&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Dedekind zeta-function satisfies a functional equation and can be extended by [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane. The resulting function encodes important information about the number field ''K''. The extended Riemann hypothesis asserts that for every number field ''K'' and every complex number ''s'' with ζ&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') = 0: if the real part of ''s'' is between 0 and 1, then it is in fact 1/2.

The ordinary Riemann hypothesis follows from the extended one if one takes the number field to be '''Q''', with ring of integers '''Z'''.

The ERH implies an effective version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.C.|last1=Lagarias|first2=A.M.|last2=Odlyzko|title=Effective Versions of the Chebotarev Theorem|journal=Algebraic Number Fields|year=1977|pages=409–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Chebotarev density theorem]]: if ''L''/''K'' is a finite Galois extension with Galois group ''G'', and ''C'' a union of conjugacy classes of ''G'', the number of [[Ramification (mathematics)#In algebraic number theory|unramified primes]] of ''K'' of norm below ''x'' with Frobenius conjugacy class in ''C'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|C|}{|G|}\Bigl(\mathrm{li}(x)+O\bigl(\sqrt x(n\log x+\log|\Delta|)\bigr)\Bigr),&lt;/math&gt;
where the constant implied in the big-O notation is absolute, ''n'' is the degree of ''L'' over '''Q''', and Δ its discriminant.

{{more citations needed|date=March 2012}}
'''Francis George Fisher'''  ("FGF") (1909–1970) was a [[Welsh language]] dramatist and theatrical producer, born in [[Bargoed]], [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=SqFmT-n9NcKctwe_sJ3-DQ&amp;id=iIMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=George+Fisher+Y+Lleoedd+Pell&amp;q=Y+Lleoedd+Pell#search_anchor] {{clarify|date=March 2012}}  ("dramatist, was born at Bargoed, Glam., and educated at University College, Cardiff. ... He published three one-act plays, Y Lleoedd Pell, Y Blaidd-Ddyn and Awena, all of which are undated, and a verse play...")&lt;/ref&gt;

As a dramatist he is best known for ''{{lang|cy|Y Lleoedd Pell}}'', ''{{lang|cy|Y Blaidd-Ddyn}}'' and ''Awena'', as well as for the verse drama ''{{lang|cy|Y Ferch a'r Dewin}}'' (1958).

==Biography==
Born in [[Bargoed]], Glamorgan, Francis George Fisher was educated at Lewis' School, [[Pengam]], and at [[University College, Cardiff]], where he captained the University swimming team before graduating in Mathematics in 1930. For a short period he was a teacher in a missionary college on the [[Ghana|Gold Coast]] in West Africa; then in 1932 a mathematics teacher at [[Llangefni]] Grammar School, latterly Llangefni County Comprehensive, becoming deputy headmaster until his sudden death.

George Fisher (he preferred his middle name) began writing in English, publishing his first novel, ''One Has Been Honest'', at the age of 21 before his graduation. He wrote many poems and stories, published in ''The Adelphi'' and ''The Twentieth Century'' during the 1930s, before turning to drama. His play ''The Disinherited'' was performed in [[Swansea]]'s Little Theatre in July 1939.

Fisher served in the Navy during World War II as a Lieutenant and, while he was in Iceland, he learned Welsh from [[A. S. D. Smith|Caradar]]'s booklet ''Welsh Made Easy''. From that time, he was intent on writing plays in Welsh, mastering '[[cynghanedd]]'. He wrote at least five short plays between 1945 and 1952 and three long plays: ''Catrin'' (first prize in the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] at [[Dolgellau]], 1949), ''{{lang|cy|Y Ferch a'r Dewin}}'' ("The girl and the wizard") (which shared first prize in the National Eisteddfod at [[Rhyl]], 1953) and ''{{lang|cy|Merch yw Medusa}}'' ("Medusa is a girl"), 1951.

He also translated Andre Obey's play, ''Noa'' (1951). He produced thirty plays, twenty of these in Welsh, including all his own works and the memorably great productions of the plays of [[Saunders Lewis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} He became a member of the [[Welsh Arts Council]] Drama Committee and was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for services to Welsh Theatre in 1958.

His most important contribution was to ensure that {{lang|cy|Cymdeithas Ddrama Llangefni|italic=no}} (Llangefni dramatic society) had a permanent home, with the opening of Theatr Fach in Pencraig, [[Llangefni]], on 3 May 1955.&lt;ref&gt;'The rapid advance of Theatr Fach Llangefni to a leading role came through purposefully aiming at a higher level than just satisfying a creative urge latent in most communities'. ''Western Mail''; 20 September 1960&lt;/ref&gt; He was made director of the theatre and realised his vision of an amateur theatre, regularly presenting plays of truly professional standard in Welsh and English. Theatr Fach celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 2005 and this is his monument.

Fisher died at his house in [[Llangefni]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y35IAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=George+Fisher+1970+welsh&amp;dq=George+Fisher+1970+welsh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sKBmT6q_IsO4tweKiOX9DQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA ("George Fisher died in 1970, at his house in Llangefni, Anglesey (Ynys Mon). )]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Fisher's contribution to the theatre in Wales has been described as vital. Most surviving works and papers are retained in the [[National Library of Wales]], Aberystwyth, in the archives departments in the [[Bangor University|University of Wales, Bangor]], and with the archivist in Llangefni.

[[Image:Su shi-calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|194px|An excerpt from ''The Cold Food Observance'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|寒食帖}}) by [[Song Dynasty]] scholar [[Su Shi]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|蘇軾}}). The calligraphy is read in columns from top to bottom, from right to left.]]
Many '''East Asian scripts''' can be written '''horizontally or vertically'''. [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] and [[Hangul|Korean]] scripts can be oriented in either direction, as they consist mainly of disconnected logographic or syllabic units, each occupying a square block of space, thus allowing for flexibility for which direction texts can be written, be it horizontally from left-to-right, horizontally from right-to-left, vertically from top-to-bottom, and even vertically from bottom-to-top. 

Horizontal writing is known in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as '''hengpai''' ({{zh|t=橫排|s=横排|p=héngpái|l=horizontal alignment}}), in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as '''yokogaki''' ({{lang|ja|横書き}}, "horizontal writing", also ''yokogumi'', {{lang|ja|横組み}}), and in [[Korean language|Korean]] as '''garosseugi''' ({{lang|ko|가로쓰기}}) or ''hoengseo'' ({{lang|ko|횡서}}; {{lang|ko|橫書}}).

Vertical writing is known respectively as '''zongpai''' ({{zh|t=縱排|s=纵排|p=zōngpái|l=vertical alignment}}), '''tategaki''' ({{lang|ja|縦書き}}, "vertical writing", also ''tategumi'', {{lang|ja|縦組み}}), or '''serosseugi''' ({{lang|ko|세로쓰기}}) or ''jongseo'' ({{lang|ko|종서}}; {{lang|ko|縱書}}).

Traditionally, [[Chinese written language|Chinese]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], and [[Korean writing system|Korean]] are written vertically in columns going from top to bottom and ordered from right to left, with each new column starting to the left of the preceding one. The [[stroke order]] and stroke direction of Chinese characters (''hanzi'' in Chinese, ''[[kanji]]'' in Japanese, ''[[hanja]]'' in Korean), Japanese [[kana]], and Korean [[Hangul]] all facilitate writing in this manner. In addition, writing in vertical columns from right to left facilitated writing with a brush in the right hand while continually unrolling the sheet of paper or scroll with the left.  Since the nineteenth century, it has become increasingly common for these languages to be written horizontally, from left to right, with successive rows going from top to bottom, under the influence of [[European language]]s such as English, although vertical writing is still frequently used in   [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]], [[Macau]], [[Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].

==Differences between horizontal and vertical writing==
Chinese characters, Japanese kana, and Korean hangul can be written horizontally or vertically. There are some small differences in [[orthography]]. In horizontal writing it is more common to use [[Hindu-Arabic numerals|Arabic numerals]], whereas [[Chinese numerals]] are more common in vertical text.

In these scripts, the positions of [[punctuation]] marks, for example the relative position of commas and full stops (periods), differ between horizontal and vertical writing. Punctuation such as the parentheses, quotation marks, book title marks (Chinese), ellipsis mark, dash, wavy dash (Japanese), proper noun mark (Chinese), wavy book title mark (Chinese), emphasis mark, and ''[[chōon]]'' mark (Japanese) are all rotated 90 degrees when switching between horizontal and vertical text.

Where a text is written in horizontal format, pages are read in the same order as English books, with the binding at the left and pages progressing to the right.  Vertical books are printed the other way round, with the binding at the right, and pages progressing to the left.

[[Ruby characters]], like ''[[furigana]]'' in Japanese which provides a phonetic guide for unusual or difficult-to-read characters, follow the direction of the main text. Example in Japanese, with [[furigana]] in green:

{|
|-
|
{| 
|-
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:2em" | {{lang|ja|漢}}
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; color:green" | {{lang|ja|か&lt;br&gt;ん}}
|-
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:2em" | {{lang|ja|字}}
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; color:green" | {{lang|ja|じ}}
|}
| style="padding:0 1.5em" | or ||
{| 
|-
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; color:green; text-align:center" | {{lang|ja|かん}}
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:0.8em; color:green; text-align:center" | {{lang|ja|じ}}
|-
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:2em" | {{lang|ja|漢}}
| style="line-height:1em; font-size:2em" | {{lang|ja|字}}
|}
|}

However, ''[[zhuyin]]'' in Taiwanese Chinese is usually written vertically regardless of the direction of the main text.

Inserted text in the Roman alphabet is usually written horizontally, or turned sideways when it appears in vertical text, with the base of the characters on the left.

===Right-to-left horizontal writing===
Historically, vertical writing was the standard system, and horizontal writing was only used where a sign had to fit in a constrained space, such as over the gate of a temple or the signboard of a shop. This horizontal writing is in fact a special case of vertical writing in which each column contains just one character.

Therefore, before the end of [[World War II]] in Japan, those signs were read right to left.

Today, the left-to-right direction is dominant in all three languages for horizontal writing: this is due partly to the influence of English and other Western languages to make it easier to read when the two languages are found together (for example, on signs at an airport or train station), and partly to the increased use of computerized typesetting and word processing software, most of which does not directly support right-to-left layout of East Asian languages. However, right-to-left horizontal writing is still seen in these scripts, in such places as signs, on the right-hand side of vehicles, and on the right-hand side of stands selling food at festivals. It is also used to simulate archaic writing, for example in reconstructions of old [[Japan]] for tourists, and it is still found in the captions and titles of some newspapers.

==History==

=== Chinese ===
[[Image:Bamboo book - unfolded - UCR.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An unfolded Chinese [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo book]] featuring text written vertically along the strips of bamboo.]]
The first{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} printed Chinese text in horizontal alignment was [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]]'s "Dictionary of the Chinese language", published in 1815–1823 in [[Macau]].

The earliest widely known Chinese publication using horizontal alignment was the magazine ''Science'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|科學}}). Its first issue in January 1915 explained the (then) unusual format:

:{{lang|zh-Hant|本雜誌印法，旁行上左，並用西文句讀點之，以便插寫算術及物理化學諸程式，非故好新奇，讀者諒之。}}
:''This magazine is printed so that it goes sideways from the top left, and is marked with Western punctuation. This is to make the insertion of mathematical, physical and chemical formulae convenient, not for the sake of novelty-hunting. We ask our readers to excuse us.''

In the subsequent decades, the occurrence of words in a Western script (predominantly English) became increasingly frequent, and readers began to appreciate the unwieldiness of rotating the paper at each occurrence for vertically set texts. This accelerated acceptance of horizontal writing.

[[File:VM 5485 China Post Office car at Zhengzhou Train Station.jpg|thumb|Text on the sides of China Post vehicles runs from the front of the car to the rear, i.e. from left to right on the vehicle's left side, and from right to left on its right side. English text on the right side is also in reverse order. This arrangement is common on tour buses in China as well.]]
With the proliferation of horizontal text, both horizontal and vertical came to be used concurrently. Proponents of horizontal text argued that vertical text in right-to-left columns was smudged easily when written, and moreover demanded greater movement from the eyes when read. Vertical text proponents considered horizontal text to be a break from established tradition.

After the success of the [[Chinese Civil War|communist revolution]] in 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] decided to use horizontal writing. All newspapers in [[China]] changed from vertical to horizontal alignment on January 1, 1956. In publications, text is run horizontally although book titles on spines and some newspaper headlines remain vertical for convenience. Inscriptions of signs on most state organs are still vertical.

In [[Singapore]], vertical writing has also become rare. In [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and among older [[overseas Chinese]] communities, horizontal writing has been gradually adopted since the 1990s. By the early 2000s, most newspapers in these areas had switched to left-to-right horizontal writing, either entirely or in a combination of vertical text with horizontal left-to-right headings.

=== Japanese ===
[[Image:Nintendo 1889.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Meiji-era offices of [[Nintendo]], with its sign written right-to-left (''migi yokogaki'').]]
Horizontal text came into Japanese in the [[Meiji era]], when the Japanese began to print Western language dictionaries. Initially they printed the dictionaries in a mixture of horizontal Western and vertical Japanese text, which meant readers had to rotate the book ninety degrees to read the Western text. Because this was unwieldy, the idea of ''yokogaki'' came to be accepted. One of the first publications to partially use ''yokogaki'' was a German to Japanese dictionary ({{lang|ja|袖珍挿図独和辞書}}, ''Shūchinsōzu Dokuwa Jisho'', "pocket illustrated German to Japanese dictionary") published in 1885 (Meiji 18).

At the beginning of the change to horizontal alignment in Meiji era Japan, there was a short-lived form called ''migi yokogaki'' ({{lang|ja|右横書き}}, literally "right horizontal writing"), in contrast to ''hidari yokogaki'', ({{lang|ja|左横書き}}, literally "left horizontal writing"), the current standard. This resembled the right-to-left horizontal writing style of languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] with line breaks on the left. It was probably based on the traditional single-row right-to-left writing. This form was widely used for pre-WWII advertisements and official documents (like banknotes), but has not survived outside of old-fashioned signboards.

Vertical writing is still commonly used in Japan in novels, newspapers and magazines including the prolific manga comic book genre, while horizontal writing is used more often in other media, especially those containing English language references.

===Korean===
[[Image:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]] Eonhae'' uses right-to-left vertical writing. It uses [[hanja]] and small [[hangul]] for [[Ruby character|ruby lettering]] placed to the bottom-right.]]
Traditionally, Korean writing has been vertical, with columns running right to left.

In 1988, [[The Hankyoreh]] became the first Korean newspaper to use horizontal writing, and after 1990, all other major newspapers followed suit.  Today, major Korean newspapers hardly ever run text vertically.

==Usage ==

===Calligraphy===
{{see also|Chinese calligraphy|Japanese calligraphy|Korean calligraphy}}
In East Asian calligraphy, vertical writing remains the dominant direction.

===Comics===
Japanese comics, also known as [[manga]], tend to use vertical direction for text. Manga frames tend to flow in right-to-left horizontal direction. Frames in [[Yonkoma|yonkoma manga]] tend to flow in a vertical direction. Page ordering is the same as books that use vertical direction: from right to left. Frames that are chronologically before or after each other use less spacing in between as a visual cue.

Most manga text (dialog and narration) is written vertically, which dictates the vertical shapes of the speech bubbles. Some, however, such as ''[[w:ja:Levius -レビウス-|Levius]]'', are aimed at the international market and strive to optimize for translation and localization, therefore make use of horizontal text and speech bubbles. Some authors, such as [[Kenshi Hirokane]], use Japanese text arranged horizontally to imply that a character is actually speaking in a foreign language, like English for example.

In some cases, horizontal writing in text bubbles may be used to indicate that a [[translation convention]] is in use – for example, that a character is actually speaking in English instead of Japanese.

Some publishers that translate manga into European languages may choose to keep the original page order (a notable example is ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'' magazine), while other publishers may reverse the page flow with use of mirrored pages.

===By modern countries===
==== Japanese and Traditional Chinese ====
Both horizontal and vertical writing are used in [[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and [[Taiwan]]. Traditional Chinese is also used in [[Mainland China]] in a few limited contexts, such as some books on ancient literature, or as an aesthetic choice for some signs on shops, temples, etc. In those contexts, both horizontal and vertical writing are used as well.

[[File:Hebei Wen'an jin fasheng dizhen - Beijing you zhengan.png|thumb|right|250px|Example of a newspaper article written vertically in Traditional Chinese with a left-to-right horizontal headline.  Note the rotation of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]] and [[Arabic numerals]] when written with the vertical text.]]
Vertical writing is commonly used for novels, newspapers, [[manga|comics]], and many other forms of writing. Because it goes downwards, vertical writing is invariably used on the spines of books.  Some newspapers combine the two forms, using the vertical format for most articles but including some written horizontally, especially for [[headline]]s. [[Musical notation]] for some Japanese instruments such as the [[shakuhachi]] is written vertically.

Horizontal writing is easier for some purposes; academic texts are sometimes written this way since they often include words and phrases in other languages, which are more easily incorporated horizontally. [[Science|Scientific]] and [[Mathematics|mathematical]] texts are nearly always written horizontally, since in vertical writing equations must be turned sideways, making them more difficult to read.

Similarly, English language textbooks, which contain many English words, are usually printed in horizontal writing. This is not a fixed rule, however, and it is also common to see English words printed sideways in vertical writing texts.

Computer text is usually presented in horizontal format; see [[Japanese language and computers]].

Business cards in Japan ([[meishi]]) are often printed vertically in Japanese on one side, and horizontally in English on the other. Postcards and handwritten letters may be arranged horizontally or vertically, but the more formal the letter the more likely it is to be written vertically. Envelope addresses are usually vertical, with the recipient's address on the right and the recipient's name in the exact centre of the envelope. See also [[Japanese etiquette]].

==== Simplified Chinese ====
[[Image:Commuting to Work.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The slogans on [[Tiananmen]] ("''Long live the People's Republic of China''" and "''Long live the unity of the people of the world''") are written in Simplified Chinese from left to right.]]
[[File:Bottom to top Chinese character reading order, Guangdong S27 Expressway.JPG|thumb|Highway markings are read from bottom to top. The right lane reads {{lang|zh-Hans|慢车道}} for "slow lane" while the middle lane reads {{lang|zh-Hans|快车道}} for "fast lane".]]
In [[mainland China]], where the [[Simplified Chinese]] orthographical reform has been adopted, vertical writing is now comparatively rare, more so in print than in writing and signage. Most publications are now printed in horizontal alignment, like English. Horizontal writing is written left to right in the vast majority of cases, with a few exceptions such as bilingual dictionaries of Chinese and right-to-left scripts like Arabic, in which case Chinese may follow the right-to-left alignment. Right-to-left writing direction can also often be seen on the right side of tourist buses, as it is customary to have the text run (on both sides of the vehicle) from the front of the bus to its rear.

Vertical alignment is generally used for artistic or aesthetic purposes (e.g. on logos and book covers), in scholarly works on Classical Chinese literature, or when space constraints demand it (e.g. on the spines of books and in labelling diagrams). Naturally, vertical text is also used on signs that are longer than they are wide; such signs are the norm at the entrances of schools, government offices and police stations. Calligraphy – in Simplified or Traditional Chinese – is invariably written vertically. Additionally, vertical text may still be encountered on some [[business card]]s and personal letters in China.

Since 2012, street markings are written vertically, but unorthodoxically from bottom to top. This is so that the characters are read from nearest to furthest from the drivers' perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnrb.hinews.cn/html/2012-08/11/content_512291.htm|title=警方：竖排从下往上是新国标|date=2012-08-11|last=Gu|first=Yue (古月)|work=Hainan Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korean====
[[File:SMRT-Dongdaemun-Station-Hangul-Vertical.jpg|thumb|Signage in the [[Dongdaemun History &amp; Culture Park Station|Dongdaemun History and Culture Park]] [[Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation|SMRT]] station in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. The Korean texts were written vertically. The sign "{{lang|ko|동대문역사문화공원}}" requires two columns (lines), which run from right to left.]]
In modern [[Korea]], vertical writing is uncommon. Modern Korean is usually written in left-to-right horizontally. Vertical writing is used when the writing space is long vertically and narrow horizontally.  For example, titles on the spines of books are usually written vertically. When a foreign language film is subtitled into Korean, the subtitles are sometimes written vertically at the right side of the screen.

In the Standard language ({{lang|ko|표준어}}; {{lang|ko|標準語}}) of [[South Korea]], punctuation marks are used differently in horizontal and vertical writing. Western punctuation marks are used in horizontal writing and the Japanese/Eastern-style punctuation marks are used in vertical writing. However, vertical writing using Western punctuation marks is sometimes found.

==Vertical writing in computing==

=== Computers ===
Early computer installations were designed only to support left-to-right horizontal writing based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. Today, most computer programs do not fully support the vertical writing system; however, most advanced word processing and publication software which target the East Asian region support the vertical writing system either fully or to a limited extent.

Even though vertical text display is generally not well supported, composing vertical text for print has been made possible. For example, on Asian editions of Windows, Asian fonts are also available in a vertical version, with font names prefixed by "@".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siao2.com/2005/08/04/447759.aspx|title=Let's get vertical|last=Kaplan|first=Michael S.|date=2005-08-04|publisher=MSDN Blogs|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can compose and edit the document as normal horizontal text. When complete, changing the text font to a vertical font converts the document to vertical orientation for printing purposes. Additionally, [[OpenType]] also has &lt;code&gt;valt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vhal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vkna&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vkrn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vpal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vrt2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vrtr&lt;/code&gt; "feature tags" to define glyphs that can be transformed or adjusted within vertical text, they can be enabled or disabled in [[CSS3]] using &lt;code&gt;font-feature-settings&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings|title=font-feature-settings - CSS|publisher=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text and layout on World Wide Web===
Since the late 1990s, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) has been drafting [http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-i18n-format-19990127/ Cascading Style Sheets properties] to enable display on the Web of the various languages of the world according to their heritage text directions. Their [http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-writing-modes-20110901/ latest efforts in 2011] show some revisions to the previous format for the Writing Mode property which provides for vertical layout and text display. The format "writing-mode:tb-rl" has been revised as "writing-mode: vertical-rl" in CSS, but the former syntax was preserved as a part of SVG 1.1 specification.

Among Web browsers, [[Internet Explorer]] is the first one that has been supporting vertical text and layout coded in HTML. Starting with [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250415(v=vs.85).aspx IE 5.5] in 2000, Microsoft has enabled the writing mode property as a "[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531187(v=vs.85).aspx Microsoft extension to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)]". [[Google Chrome]] (since 8.0), [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (since 5.1), [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] (since 15.0) has support the &lt;code&gt;-webkit-writing-mode&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;ref name="MDN_writing-mode"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode|title=writing-mode - CSS |publisher= [[Mozilla Developer Network]]|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozilla Firefox]] got support for unprefixed &lt;code&gt;writing-mode&lt;/code&gt; property in version 38.0, later enabled by default in version 41.0.&lt;ref name="MDN_writing-mode" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/38|title=Firefox 38 for developers |publisher= [[Mozilla Developer Network]]|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/41|title=Firefox 41 for developers |publisher= [[Mozilla Developer Network]]|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederic Remington - The Parley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|333px|[[Frederic Remington]]: ''The Parley'']]
The word "'''How'''" or "'''Howgh'''" is a word used as a greeting, or particle in the sense of ''I have spoken'', in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages, and in their popular representations. It is a part of popular depictions of Native Americans in various novels, e.g. those of [[James Fenimore Cooper]] or [[Karl May]].

== Background ==
[[Image:Jean de Brébeuf uncropped.jpg|thumb|Jean de Brébeuf, 1627(?)]]

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) uses [{{IPA|haːʊ̯}}] ("how") for the spelling, and claims [[Jean de Brébeuf]] had described the use of the term as an interjection of approval with the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] (Hurons). De Brébeuf described individual speakers using ''Condayauendi Ierhayde cha nonhwicwahachen'' to signify the end of their speaking, which was answered by the community with a long "Hooow".&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Brébeuf ''Jesuit Relation 10'', 1636, see Wolfgang Hochbruck "I have spoken"  p.36, and J. Axtell, The Indian People of Eastern America, Oxford 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Longman Webster&lt;ref&gt;Longman Webster English college dictionary. Harlow: Longman, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; describes ''Howgh'' as a greeting of the [[Sioux]]; giving "Háu kola" (''Hallo friend'') as a [[Lakota Sioux]] greeting. However, it would be the only Lakota term using a [[diphthong]] and is probably of external origin.&lt;ref name="rood96"&gt;Rood, David S., and Taylor, Allan R. (1996). [http://lakxotaiyapi.freecyberzone.com/sk1.htm Sketch of Lakhota, a Siouan Language, Part I]. Handbook of North American Indians, Band 17 (Languages), p. 440–482.&lt;/ref&gt; Dakota and Omaha Sioux use slightly different versions. [[Francis Parkman]], in his book [[The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life|''The Oregon Trail'']] gives a first-person account of three weeks spent hunting [[American bison|buffalo]], with a band of [[Oglala Sioux]], in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;see I have spoken, Hochbruck p.153&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions their use of "How". Today, neither the Hurons nor the Lakota use the term, as by 1900 "Good morning" was the preferred greeting.&lt;ref&gt;The Conservative (Nebraska City, Neb.) 18. August 1898, Seite 3, von Laurence Laughlin, [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96080161/1898-08-18/ed-1/seq-3/ The Indians at Omaha],&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[Karl May]] uses Howgh&lt;ref&gt;Der Wortschatz Karl Mays, von Joachim Dietze, Georg Olms Verlag Hildesheim, 1999, {{ISBN|3487105357}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Schweizerdeutsch]] closing particle "Ha gschlosse", which is used by the speaker to indicate they are done speaking.&lt;ref name="ph"&gt;Handbuch der Phraseologie, Harald Burger, Annelies Häcki Buhofer, Ambros Sialm, Brigit Eriksson, Verlag Walter de Gruyter, 1982, {{ISBN|3110080028}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the term expresses a strict [[Parliamentary procedure|Rule of Order]], and a longing for consensus.&lt;ref name="ph"/&gt;

"Howgh", "Uff!", [[Manitou]] and Lakota "Hoka Hey" have had a major influence on the [[popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries]]. ''Howgh'' gained popularity as symbols of Native Americans through Cooper's and Parkman's books. By 1917 it was so stereotypically  accepted that it found its way into US World War I propaganda depicting Native American soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;''American Indians in World War I: At home and at war'', Thomas A. Britten, Verlag UNM Press, 1999,  {{ISBN|0826320902}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{"|(Wilhelm II) killum papoose und killum squaw, so Jo Fixum will find this Kaiser and stickum bayonet clear through. Ugh!}}By 1953 it was so completely accepted that in Walt Disney's [[Peter Pan]] movie, the song "[[What Made the Red Man Red?]]" uses "How" and "Ugh" with the strong assumption that the contemporary audience would understand them as standard Native American speech.

''Howgh'' found some applications in German songs depicting Native Americans, as in "Indianer" by [[Nena (band)|Nena]] (lyrics by [[Carlo Karges]]) and [[Gus Backus]] "Da sprach der alte Häuptling der Indianer" (the old Indian chieftain spoke, covered e.g. by [[Wildecker Herzbuben]] and [[Wirtschaftswunder]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Njmovwl4bU&amp;hd=1 Youtube, see 0.51]&lt;/ref&gt;). It was even part of the social media parodies of German minister of finance [[Peer Steinbrück]]'s use of Western movie metaphors against Swiss tax policy 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung online, 18. 3. 2009, Gerd Zitzelsberger:[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/447/462067/text/ Nervöse Indianer im Steuerreservat], Steinbrück: Streit mit Schweiz, Im Kampf gegen das Bankgeheimnis verärgert Finanzminister Peer Steinbrück die Schweizer mit "Wildwest-Rhetorik",&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://moritzleuenberger.blueblog.ch/p114.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Steadman was irritated by the usage of what he viewed as a stereotypical phrase, and closed with  "Reader gettum sick? Have-um enough?"&lt;ref&gt;Steadman p.71, in I have spoken'', Wolfgang Hochbruck p.&amp;nbsp;153&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26572">'''Implicate order''' and '''explicate order''' are [[Ontology|ontological]] concepts for [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] coined by [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[David Bohm]] during the early 1980s. They are used to describe two different frameworks for understanding the same phenomenon or aspect of reality. In particular, the concepts were developed in order to explain the bizarre behavior of [[subatomic particle]]s – behavior difficult to explain by quantum physics.

In his book ''[[Wholeness and the Implicate Order]]'', Bohm uses these notions to describe how the same phenomenon might look different, or might be characterized by different principal factors, in different contexts such as at different scales.&lt;ref name="wholeness"&gt;David Bohm: ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order'', Routledge, 1980 ({{ISBN|0-203-99515-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The implicate (also referred to as the "enfolded") order is seen as a deeper and more fundamental order of reality.  In contrast, the explicate or "unfolded" order include the abstractions that humans normally perceive.  As he writes:

:In the enfolded [or implicate] order, [[space]] and [[time]] are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements.  Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order.  These ordinary notions in fact appear in what is called the "explicate" or "unfolded" order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders ({{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=xv}}).

== Overview ==
The notion of implicate and explicate orders emphasizes the primacy of structure and process over individual objects. The latter are seen as mere approximations of an underlying process. In this approach, quantum particles and other objects are understood to have only a limited degree of stability and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;P. Pylkkänen, B. J. Hiley, I. Pättiniemi: ''Bohm's approach and Individuality'', [https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4772v3 arXiv:1405.4772v3], version 3 of 28 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm believes that the weirdness of the behavior of quantum particles is caused by unobserved forces, maintaining that space and time might actually be derived from an even deeper level of objective reality. In the words of [[F. David Peat]], Bohm considers that what we take for reality are "surface phenomena, explicate forms that have temporarily unfolded out of an underlying implicate order". That is, the implicate order is the ground from which reality [[emergence|emerges]].&lt;ref name="Carvallo2013"&gt;F. David Peat, ''Non-locality in nature and cognition'', pp.&amp;nbsp;297–311. In: {{cite book|author=M.E. Carvallo|title=Nature, Cognition and System II: Current Systems-Scientific Research on Natural and Cognitive Systems Volume 2: On Complementarity and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgPoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA304|date=7 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-011-2779-0|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The implicate order as an algebra ===
David Bohm, his co-worker [[Basil Hiley]], and other physicists of [[Birkbeck College]] worked toward a model of quantum physics in which the implicate order is represented in the form of an appropriate [[algebra]] or other [[Pregeometry (physics)|pregeometry]]. They considered [[spacetime]] itself as part of an explicate order that is connected to an implicate order that they called ''pre-space.'' The [[spacetime manifold]] and the properties of [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[Nonlocal Aharonov–Bohm effect|nonlocality]] all arise from an order in such pre-space. A. M. Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various [[Algebra representation|representations]] of this algebra.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. M. Frescura, B. J. Hiley: [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/P12FrescandHiley3.pdf Algebras, quantum theory and pre-space], pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4 (published in Revista Brasileira de Fisica, Volume Especial, Julho 1984, Os 70 anos de Mario Schonberg, pp. 49–86)&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also:'' [[Basil Hiley#Implicate orders, pre-space and algebraic structures|Work by Bohm and Hiley on implicate orders, pre-space and algebraic structures]].)

In analogy to [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s notion of  'actual occasion'&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Whitehead, &lt;i&gt;Process and Reality&lt;/i&gt;, Corrected Edition, ed. D. Griffin and D. Sherburne (New York: Macmillan, 1978), pp. 18 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;,Bohm considered the notion of ''moment''–a moment being a not entirely localizable event, with events being allowed to overlap&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm: ''Time, the implicate order, and pre-space,'' In: David R. Griffin: ''Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time'', State University of New York Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-88706-113-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;177–208, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXWKzPFgv_wC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183]&lt;/ref&gt; and being connected in an over-all implicate order:&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm: ''Time, the implicate order, and pre-space'', In: David R. Griffin: ''Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time'', State University of New York Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-88706-113-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;177–208, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXWKzPFgv_wC&amp;pg=PA189 p. 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{"| I propose that each moment of time is a projection from the total implicate order. The term ''projection'' is a particularly happy choice here, not only because its common meaning is suitable for what is needed, but also because its mathematical meaning as a projection operation, ''P'', is just what is required for working out these notions in terms of the quantum theory. }}

Bohm emphasized the primary role of the implicate order's structure:&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm: ''Time, the implicate order, and pre-space'', In: David R. Griffin: ''Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time'', State University of New York Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-88706-113-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;177–208, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXWKzPFgv_wC&amp;pg=PA192 pp. 192–193]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{"| My attitude is that the mathematics of the quantum theory deals ''primarily'' with the structure of the implicate pre-space and with how an explicate order of space and time emerges from it, rather than with movements of physical entities, such as particles and fields. (This is a kind of extension of what is done in general relativity, which deals primarily with geometry and only secondarily with the entities that are described within this geometry.) }}

=== The explicate order and quantum entanglement ===
Central to Bohm's schema are correlations between [[observable]]s of entities which seem separated by great distances in the explicate order (such as a particular electron here on earth and an [[alpha particle]] in one of the stars in the [[Abell 1835 IR1916|Abell 1835 galaxy]], the farthest galaxy from Earth known to humans), manifestations of the implicate order. Within quantum theory there is [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] of such objects.

This view of order necessarily departs from any notion which entails signalling, and therefore causality. The correlation of observables does not imply a causal influence, and in Bohm's schema the latter represents 'relatively' independent events in space-time; and therefore explicate order.

=== A common grounding for consciousness and matter ===
[[Image:Hersenen.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl H. Pribram]]'s research suggests that memories may not be localized in specific regions of brains]]

The implicate order represents the proposal of a general [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] concept in terms of which it is claimed that [[matter]] and [[consciousness]] might both be understood, in the sense that it is proposed that both matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment.  For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in space-time.  In the case of consciousness, Bohm pointed toward evidence presented by [[Karl H. Pribram|Karl Pribram]] that [[memories]] may be enfolded within every region of the [[brain]] rather than being localized (for example in particular regions of the brain, cells, or atoms).

Bohm went on to say: &lt;blockquote&gt;As in our discussion of matter in general, it is now necessary to go into the question of how in consciousness the explicate order is what is manifest ... the manifest content of consciousness is based essentially on memory, which is what allows such content to be held in a fairly constant form.  Of course, to make possible such constancy it is also necessary that this content be organized, not only through relatively fixed association but also with the aid of the rules of logic, and of our basic categories of space, time, causality, universality, etc. ... there will be a strong background of recurrent, stable, and separable features, against which the transitory and changing aspects of the unbroken flow of experience will be seen as fleeting impressions that tend to be arranged and ordered mainly in terms of the vast totality of the relatively static and fragmented content of [memories].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bohm also claimed that "as with consciousness, each moment has a certain explicate order, and in addition it enfolds all the others, though in its own way.  So the relationship of each moment in the whole to all the others is implied by its total content: the way in which it 'holds' all the others enfolded within it". Bohm characterises consciousness as a process in which at each moment, content that was previously implicate is presently explicate, and content which was previously explicate has become implicate.

&lt;blockquote&gt;One may indeed say that our memory is a special case of the process described above, for all that is recorded is held enfolded within the brain cells and these are part of matter in general.  The recurrence and stability of our own memory as a relatively independent sub-totality is thus brought about as part of the very same process that sustains the recurrence and stability in the manifest order of matter in general.  It follows, then, that the explicate and manifest order of consciousness is not ultimately distinct from that of matter in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Analogies ==

=== Ink droplet analogy ===
Bohm also used the term ''unfoldment'' to characterise processes in which the explicate order becomes relevant (or "relevated").  Bohm likens unfoldment also to the decoding of a television [[signal processing|signal]] to produce a sensible [[image]] on a [[Television|screen]].  The signal, screen, and television electronics in this analogy represent the implicate order while the image produced represents the explicate order.  He also uses an example in which an ink droplet can be introduced into a highly [[viscous]] [[Chemical substance|substance]] (such as [[glycerine]]), and the substance rotated very slowly such that there is negligible [[diffusion]] of the substance.  In this example, the droplet becomes a thread which, in turn, eventually becomes invisible.  However, by rotating the substance in the reverse direction, the droplet can essentially reform.  When it is invisible, according to Bohm, the order of the ink droplet as a pattern can be said to be ''implicate'' within the substance.

In another analogy, Bohm asks us to consider a pattern produced by making small cuts in a folded piece of paper and then, literally, unfolding it.  Widely separated elements of the pattern are, in actuality, produced by the same original cut in the folded piece of paper.  Here the cuts in the folded paper represent the implicate order and the unfolded pattern represents the explicate order.

=== Holograms and implicate order ===
{{see also|Holographic principle|Holographic paradigm}}
[[Image:Holography-reconstruct.png|thumb|250px|right|In a holographic reconstruction, each region of a photographic plate contains the whole image]]

Bohm employed the [[hologram]] as a means of characterising implicate order, noting that each [[region]] of a [[photographic]] plate in which a hologram is observable contains within it the whole three-dimensional image, which can be viewed from a range of perspectives. That is, each region contains a whole and undivided image.  In Bohm’s words:

&lt;blockquote&gt; There is the germ of a new notion of order here. This order is not to be understood solely in terms of a regular arrangement of objects (e.g., in rows) or as a regular arrangement of events (e.g. in a series).  Rather, a total order is contained, in some implicit sense, in each region of space and time.  Now, the word 'implicit' is based on the verb 'to implicate'. This means 'to fold inward' ... so we may be led to explore the notion that in some sense each region contains a total structure 'enfolded' within it".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bohm noted that although the hologram conveys undivided wholeness, it is nevertheless static.

In this view of order, laws represent invariant relationships between explicate entities and structures, and thus Bohm maintained that in physics, the explicate order generally reveals itself within well-constructed experimental contexts as, for example, in the sensibly observable results of instruments. With respect to implicate order, however, Bohm  asked us to consider the possibility instead "that physical law should refer primarily to an order of undivided wholeness of the content of description similar to that indicated by the hologram rather than to an order of analysis of such content into separate parts ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implicate order in art ===
In the work ''[[Science, Order, and Creativity]]'' (Bohm and Peat, 1987), examples of implicate orders in science are laid out, as well as implicate orders which relate to painting, poetry and music.

Bohm and Peat emphasize the role of orders of varying complexity, which influence the perception of a work of art as a whole. They note that implicate orders are accessible to human [[experience]]. They refer for instance to earlier notes which reverberate when listening to music, or various resonances of words and images which are perceived when reading or hearing poetry.

[[Christopher Alexander]] discussed his work in person with Bohm, and pointed out connections among his work and Bohm's notion of an implicate order in ''[[The Nature of Order]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Alexander: ''[[The Nature of Order]], Book 4 – The Luminous Ground: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe'', Center for Environmental Structure, {{ISBN|978-0-9726529-4-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CIHB3_1tLMC&amp;pg=PA336 Footnotes 19 and 20 on p. 336], cited on [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CIHB3_1tLMC&amp;pg=PA323 p. 323]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohm features as a fictional character in the novel ''The Wave'' by British author [[Lochlan Bloom]]. The novel includes multiple narratives and explores many of the concepts of Bohm’s work on implicate and explicate orders.&lt;ref name="Shortlist"&gt;{{Cite|url= http://www.theshortstory.co.uk/the-short-story-interview-lochlan-bloom/|title=The Short Story Interview: Lochlan Bloom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to some generally prevailing views ==
In proposing this new notion of order, [[David Bohm|Bohm]] explicitly challenged a number of tenets that he believed are fundamental to much scientific work:

# that phenomena are reducible to [[fundamental particles]] and [[Law (principle)|laws]] describing the [[behaviour]] of particles, or more generally to any static (i.e., unchanging) [[entities]], whether separate events in [[space-time]], [[quantum states]], or static entities of some other nature;
# related to (1), that human knowledge is ''most fundamentally'' concerned with [[mathematical]] prediction of [[statistical]] aggregates of particles;
# that an analysis or description of any aspect of [[reality]] (e.g., quantum theory, the speed of light) can be unlimited in its [[Field of study|domain]] of relevance;
# that the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], or its extension to a [[curvilinear]] system, is the deepest conception of underlying order as a basis for analysis and description of the world;
# that there is ultimately a sustainable ''distinction'' between reality and [[thought]], and that there is a corresponding distinction between the [[observation|observer]] and observed in an [[experiment]] or any other situation (other than a distinction between relatively separate entities valid in the sense of explicate order); and
# that it is, in [[principle]], possible to formulate a final notion concerning the nature of reality, i.e., a [[Theory of Everything]].

[[Image:Hydrogen.svg|thumb|220px|right|A hydrogen atom and its constituent particles: an example of an over-simplified way of looking at a small collection of posited building blocks of the universe]]

Bohm’s proposals have at times been dismissed largely on the basis of such tenets.
His [[paradigm]] is generally opposed to [[reductionism]], and some view it as a form of [[ontological]] [[holism]].  On this, Bohm noted of prevailing views among physicists that "the world is assumed to be constituted of a set of separately existent, indivisible, and unchangeable 'elementary particles', which are the fundamental 'building blocks' of the entire universe ... there seems to be an unshakable faith among physicists that either such particles, or some other kind yet to be discovered, will eventually make possible a complete and coherent explanation of everything" ({{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=173}}).

In Bohm’s conception of order, primacy is given to the undivided whole, and the implicate order inherent within the whole, rather than to parts of the whole, such as particles, quantum states, and continua.  This whole encompasses all things, [[structures]], abstractions, and processes, including processes that result in (relatively) stable structures as well as those that involve a metamorphosis of structures or things.  In this view, parts may be [[entities]] normally regarded as [[physics|physical]], such as [[atoms]] or [[subatomic particle]]s, but they may also be [[abstraction|abstract]] entities, such as quantum states.  Whatever their nature and character, according to Bohm, these parts are considered in terms of the whole, and in such terms, they constitute relatively separate and independent "sub-totalities."  The implication of the view is, therefore, that nothing is ''fundamentally'' separate or independent.

{{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=11}}, said: "The new form of insight can perhaps best be called Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement.  This view implies that flow is in some sense prior to that of the ‘things’ that can be seen to form and dissolve in this flow."  According to Bohm, a vivid image of this sense of analysis of the whole is afforded by [[vortex]] structures in a flowing [[stream]].  Such vortices can be relatively stable [[patterns]] within a continuous flow, but such an analysis does not imply that the flow patterns have any sharp division, or that they are literally separate and independently existent entities; rather, they are most fundamentally undivided.  Thus, according to Bohm’s view, the whole is in continuous [[flux]], and hence is referred to as the [[holomovement]] (movement of the whole).

=== Quantum theory and relativity theory ===
A key motivation for Bohm in proposing a new notion of order was the [[List of unsolved problems in physics#Quantum gravity|well-known incompatibility]] of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] with [[relativity theory]].  {{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=xv}}  summarised the state of affairs he perceived to exist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...in relativity, movement is continuous, causally determinate and well defined, while in quantum mechanics it is discontinuous, not causally determinate and not well-defined.  Each theory is committed to its own notions of essentially static and fragmentary modes of existence (relativity to that of separate events connectible by [[Wiktionary:signal|signals]], and quantum mechanics to a well-defined quantum state).  One thus sees that a new kind of theory is needed which drops these basic commitments and at most recovers some essential features of the older theories as abstract forms derived from a deeper reality in which what prevails is unbroken wholeness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bohm maintained that relativity and quantum theories are in basic [[contradiction]] in these essential respects, and that a new concept of order should begin with that toward which both theories point: undivided wholeness.  This should not be taken to mean that he advocated such powerful theories be discarded.  He argued that each was relevant in a certain context—i.e., a set of interrelated conditions within the explicate order—rather than having unlimited scope, and that apparent contradictions stem from attempts to overgeneralize by superposing the theories on one another, implying greater generality or broader relevance than is ultimately warranted.  Thus, {{harvnb|Bohm|1980|pp=156–167}}  argued: "... in sufficiently broad contexts such analytic descriptions cease to be adequate ... 'the law of the whole' will generally include the possibility of describing the 'loosening' of aspects from each other, so that they will be relatively autonomous in limited contexts ... however, any form of relative [[Wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] (and [[Wikt:heteronomy|heteronomy]]) is ultimately limited by [[holonomy]], so that in a broad enough context such forms are seen to be merely aspects, relevated in the holomovement, rather than disjoint and separately existent things in interaction."

=== Hidden variable theory ===
Before developing his ''implicit order'' approach, Bohm had proposed a [[hidden variable theory|hidden variable]] theory of quantum physics (see [[Bohm interpretation]]). According to Bohm, a key motivation for doing so had been purely to show the [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] of such theories.  On this, {{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=81}} said, "... it should be kept in mind that before this proposal was made there had existed the widespread impression that no conception of any hidden variable at all, not even if it were abstract and hypothetical, could possibly be consistent with the quantum theory."  {{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=110}} also claimed that "the demonstration of the possibility of theories of hidden variables may serve in a more general philosophical sense to remind us of the unreliability of conclusions based on the assumption of the complete universality of certain features of a given theory, however general their domain of validity seems to be."  Another aspect of Bohm's motivation had been to point out a confusion he perceived to exist in quantum theory.  On the dominant approaches in quantum theory, he said: "...we wish merely to point out that this whole line of approach re-establishes at the abstract level of statistical potentialities the same kind of analysis into separate and autonomous components in interaction that is denied at the more concrete level of individual objects" ({{harvnb|Bohm|1980|p=174}}).

==Career milestones==
In the 1950s, inspired by a reading of ''Marinero en tierra'' by [[Rafael Alberti]], Albi began to write poetry for the first time in earnest.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt; He began publishing the ''Cuadernos literarios'' journal and his [[literary critique]] appeared in ''Verbo y Cuadernos literarios'', a review which he founded in 1954.&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt; Albi began writing under the [[pseudonym]], "Diez Claves" or "Ten Keys" while employing [[surrealistic]] [[introversion]] terms.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt; He is also noted for his collaboration with [[Joan Fuster]] in anthologizing the work of [[Ángel Crespo]], [[Paul Éluard]], and the Spanish surrealists.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt;

==Awards==
As a poet Albi was popular both with critics and the general public, and received a number of awards. In 1957, he received his first significant honor from the [[Generalitat Valenciana]], [there was not Generalitat Valenciana in 1957, this must be an error] the "premio Valencia de Literatura" (Valencia Literature Prize), for ''Vida de un hombre''.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt; In 1958, he won the "premio [[Gabriel Miró]]" (Gabriel Miró Award) for ''El silencio de Dios''.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt;

In 1977, Albi received a second "premio Valencia" for ''Odisea 77''.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt; In 1978, he was awarded the "premio Miguel Ángel de Argumosa" (Miguel Ángel de Argumosa Prize)for ''Elegía atlántica''.&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt;

In 2002, Albi received his third "premio Valencia de Literatura".&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt;&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt; Moreover, he served as honorary president of the Asociación Valenciana de Escritores y Críticos Literarios (CLAVE - Critics of Literary Writers Association Valencia).&lt;ref name=elmundo060810/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais060610/&gt;&lt;ref name=abces060810/&gt;

==Final years and death==
Albi maintained interest in [[Oliva|Oliva, Spain]] as that was his [[Motherland#Motherland|motherland]] and the [[Sea side resort]] of [[Xàbia]].&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt;

Albi died at his home in [[Jávea]] on 7 June 2010.&lt;ref name=lasprovincias060910/&gt;

The '''Koreanic languages''' are a [[language family]] consisting of the modern [[Korean language]] together with extinct ancient relatives closer to it than to any other proposed links.

The [[Jeju language]] of [[Jeju Island]], considered by some as a dialect of modern Korean, is distinct enough to be considered a language in its own right by other authorities. Some consider that rather than being a language isolate, Korean forms a small language family, together with Jeju.

==External relationships==
Among extant languages, Korean is considered by most linguists to be a [[language isolate]] and by some as part of the widely rejected [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family or the [[Dravido-Korean languages]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of the Korean Language|last=Kim|first=Chin-Wu|publisher=Center for Korean Studies, University of Hawai'i|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alexander Vovin]] (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alexander|last=Vovin|contribution=Korean as a Paleosiberian Language|url=https://www.academia.edu/18764127/Korean_as_a_Paleosiberian_Language_English_version_of_%EC%9B%90%EC%8B%9C%EC%8B%9C%EB%B2%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%84_%EC%96%B8%EC%96%B4%EB%A1%9C%EC%84%9C%EC%9D%98_%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4_|access-date=2016-11-06|title=알타이할시리즈 2|year=2015|ISBN=978-8-955-56053-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Koreanic shares some [[linguistic typology|typological]] features with the four [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] language groups (e.g. lack of phonemic [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops, verb [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], earlier [[ergativity]]), and suggests that it actually has more in common with "Paleosiberian" (which is a geographical and areal grouping rather a genetic one) than with the putative [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] group.

Koreanic also has some loanwords from Paleosiberian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin, Alexander. 2003. ‘Etymological notes on some Paleosiberian and Tungusic loanwords in Korean’, in Proceedings for Korean Language and Culture 5/6: 57-60, St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Vovin notes that Koreanic has some [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] loanwords, but is not genetically related to Tungusic.

The unclassified [[Khitan language]] has many similar Korean vocabulary that are not found in Mongolian or Tungusic languages, This suggests a strong Korean presence or that Khitan was in fact a Koreanic or para-Koreanic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vovin|first=Alexander|date=June 2017|title=Koreanic loanwords in Khitan and their importance in the decipherment of the latter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1556/062.2017.70.2.4|journal=Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae|volume=70|issue=2|pages=207–215|doi=10.1556/062.2017.70.2.4|issn=0001-6446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The periodization of the historical stages of Korean is as follows:
*Before 1st century: Proto-Korean
*1st to 10th century: Old Korean
*10th to 16th century: Middle Korean
*17th century to present: Modern Korean

===Ancient Koreanic languages===
{{further information|Buyeo languages|Old Korean}}
Several ancient languages of the Korean peninsula—[[Silla language|Silla]], [[Buyeo language|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]], [[Dongye]], [[Okjeo]], [[Baekje language|Baekje]], [[Gojoseon]] and [[Ye-Maek language|Ye-Maek]]—may have been ancestral to, related to, or part of [[Old Korean]]. Two branches are sometimes posited, [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]] and Han.&lt;ref&gt;Young Kyun Oh, 2005. ''Old Chinese and Old Sino-Korean''&lt;/ref&gt;

*Goguryeo (Koguryoic) [extinct]: [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]], [[Baekje language|Baekje]]
*Han: [[Silla language|Silla]] → [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Jeju language|Jeju]]

In ancient times, Koreanic languages, then established in southern Manchuria and the northern Korean peninsula, expanded southward to the central and southern Korean peninsula, displacing the [[Japonic languages]] spoken there and possibly causing the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi migrations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellwood|first1=Peter|title=The Global Prehistory of Human Migration|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden|isbn=9781118970591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vovin|first1=Alexander|title=From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean|journal=Korean Linguistics|date=2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=222–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Moon|last2=Ramsey|first2=S.

===Modern Koreanic languages===
{{further information|Korean dialects|Jeju language}}
Modern Korean is traditionally considered a single language. However, [[Jeju dialect|Jeju]] (Cheju) is sometimes classified as a distinct language, for example in the UNESCO atlas on endangered languages. If that is accepted, there are two modern Koreanic languages, Jeju and Korean proper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]], 1996. ''Manchuria: an ethnic history''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Languages in ''Star Wars''}}
{{Original research|date=October 2007}}

[[File:Star-Wars-aurek-besh-alphabet-chart.svg|thumb|320px|The Aurebesh alphabet is the primary [[constructed script]] seen throughout the franchise.|alt=The letters and punctuation of a constructed alphabet seen in Star Wars]]
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[science fiction]] universe, created by [[George Lucas]], features dialogue that is not spoken in [[natural language]]s. The [[lingua franca]] of the franchise, for which the language the works are dubbed or written stand in, is Galactic Basic. Characters often speak languages other than Basic, notably ''Shyriiwook'' spoken by [[Chewbacca]], droidspeak spoken by [[R2-D2]] and [[BB-8]], and Huttese spoken by [[Jabba the Hutt]].

The fictional languages were approached as [[sound design]] and developed largely by [[Ben Burtt]], sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogy of films. He created alien dialogue out of the sounds of primarily non-English languages, such as [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], [[Haya language|Haya]], and [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]]. This methodology was also used in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' by [[Sara Forsberg]]. Lucas also insisted that written text throughout the films look as dissimilar from the [[English alphabet]] as possible, and [[Constructed script|constructed alphabets]] were developed.

The languages constructed for the films were criticized as not being true [[constructed language]]s, instead relying on creating the simple impression of a fully developed language. The usage of heavily accented English for alien characters was also criticized as contributing to the suggestion of racial stereotypes.

== Development ==
Language development was approached as [[sound design]] and was handled by [[Ben Burtt]], sound designer for both the original and prequel trilogies. He created the alien dialogue out of existing non-English language phrases and their sounds, such as [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] for [[Greedo]] in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film and [[Haya language|Haya]] for the character [[Nien Nunb]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-languages-of-star-wars-the-force-awakens-1452892741|title=The Languages of ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Zimmer|date=January 15, 2016|website=Word on the Street|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|access-date=July 25, 2016}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used English, as in the original Star Wars where he synthesized originally English dialogue from a [[Western (genre)|Western]] film until it sounded alien.&lt;ref name="BanthaTracks17"&gt;{{cite magazine |author= Ken Rowand |publisher=Official Star Wars Fan Club |title= Interview: Ben Burtt |magazine= Bantha Tracks|issue=17|page= 2|date= August 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burtt said of the process: "It usually meant doing some research and finding an existing language or several languages which were exotic and interesting, something that our audience — 99 percent of them — would never understand."&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katzoff|first1=Tami|title='Return Of The Jedi' Turns 30: Secrets Of Ewok Language Revealed!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1708006/star-wars-return-jedi-ewok-language-secrets/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=July 26, 2016|date=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This methodology to create the sound of [[alien language]]s was carried into production of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''. Director [[J. J. Abrams]] asked [[Sara Forsberg]], who lacked a professional background in linguistics but created the [[viral video]] series "What Languages Sound Like to Foreigners" on [[YouTube]], to develop alien dialogue spoken by Indonesian actor [[Yayan Ruhian]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; Forsberg was asked to listen to "Euro-Asian languages", and she drew from [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi languages|Hindi]], and other Asian languages&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/star-wars-sara-maria-forsberg-language-1201663521/|title=‘Star Wars’: YouTube Star Creates New Language For Aliens|last=Rizzo|first=Carita|date=December 16, 2015|website=|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|access-date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], Ruhian's [[First language|native language]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; She also listened to languages she did not understand to better structure the words and sentences to sound believable.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

During production of the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that written text throughout the films look as dissimilar from the [[English alphabet]] as possible and strongly opposed English-looking characters in screens and signage. In developing typefaces for use in [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|''Episode II – Attack of the Clones'']], including Mandalorian and Geonosian scripts, graphic artist Philip Metschan created alphabets that did not have twenty-six letters like the English alphabet.&lt;ref name="Metschan" /&gt;

== Galactic Basic {{anchor|Basic}} ==
Galactic Basic, often simply Basic, is the [[lingua franca]] of the ''Star Wars'' universe, for which the language in which the works are dubbed or written acts as a stand-in.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheNation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechTimes" /&gt;

=== Accents ===
Lucas intended to balance [[American English|American accents]] and [[British English|British accents]] between the heroes and villains of the original film so that each side had each. He also strove to keep accents "very neutral", noting [[Alec Guinness]]'s and [[Peter Cushing]]'s [[Mid-Atlantic English|mid-Atlantic accents]] and his guidance to [[Anthony Daniels]] to speak in an American accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scanlon|first1=Paul|title=George Lucas: The Wizard of Star Wars|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/george-lucas-the-wizard-of-star-wars-19770825|publisher=''[[The Rolling Stone]]''|date=August 25, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In critical commentary on [[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|''Episode I – The Phantom Menace'']], Patricia Williams of ''[[The Nation]]'' felt there was a correlation between accent and social class, noting that [[Jedi]] speak with "crisp British accents" while the women of [[Naboo]] and white slaves such as [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]] and [[Shmi Skywalker]] "speak with the brusque, determined innocence of middle-class Americans".&lt;ref name="TheNation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/racial-ventriloquism/|title=Racial Ventriloquism|last=Williams|first=Patricia J.|date=June 17, 1999|website=|publisher=''[[The Nation]]''|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To decide on the sound of [[Nute Gunray]], a [[Neimoidian]] character portrayed by [[Silas Carson]], Lucas and [[Rick McCallum]] listened to actors from different countries reading Carson's lines. Eventually, they chose a heavily [[Thai language|Thai]]-accented English, and Carson rerecorded the dialogue to mimic the Thai actor's accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020530/indexp4.html |title=Silas Carson: Hero with a Thousand Faces |last=Chernoff |first=Scott |date=May 30, 2002 |website= |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103130737/http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/f20020530/indexp4.html |archive-date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=July 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunray's accent was described by critics to be "Hollywood [[Orient]]al" that contributed to criticism of Gunray as an Asian stereotype.&lt;ref name="TheNation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/26/entertainment/ca-40965|title=A Galaxy Far, Far Off Racial Mark?|last=Harrison|first=Eric|date=May 26, 1999|website=|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/990712/archive_001413.htm|title=Fu Manchu on Naboo|last=Leo|first=John|date=July 4, 1999|website=|publisher=''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011082808/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/990712/archive_001413.htm |archive-date=October 11, 2008|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Watto]]'s accent was similarly criticized as lending to [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab]] connotations.&lt;ref name="TheNation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USNews" /&gt;

{{Quote box

}}[[Yoda]] characteristically speaks a non-standard [[syntax]] of Basic, primarily constructing sentences in [[Object–subject–verb|object-subject-verb]] word order rare in natural languages. This sentence construction is cited as a "clever device for making him seem very alien" and characterizes his dialogue as "vaguely riddle-like, which adds to his mystique". This tendency is noted to be written for an English-speaking audience; the word order is retained in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] subtitles, where it is grammatical but unusual and emphatic, and Yoda's dialogue is in [[subject–object–verb]] word order in [[Czech language|Czech]] dubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/hmmmmm/420798/|title=An Unusual Way of Speaking, Yoda Has|last=LaFrance|first=Adrienne|date=December 18, 2015|website=|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Aurekbesh}} Aurebesh ===
Aurebesh is a [[writing system]] used to represent spoken Galactic Basic and is the most commonly seen form of [[written language]] in the ''Star Wars'' franchise.&lt;ref name="TechTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/111268/20151127/google-translate-s-star-wars-easter-egg-adds-support-aurebesh.htm|title=Google Translate’s 'Star Wars' Easter Egg Adds Support For Aurebesh|last=|first=|date=November 27, 2015|website=|publisher=''Tech Times''|access-date=|last1=McKalin|first1=Vamien|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/25/googles-latest-star-wars-easter-egg-is-aurebesh-support-in-google-translate/|title=Google’s latest Star Wars easter egg is Aurebesh support in Google Translate|last=|first=|date=November 25, 2015|website=|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|access-date=July 28, 2016|last1=Novet|first1=Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabet was based on shapes designed by [[Joe Johnston]] for the original trilogy, which are briefly featured in screen displays in ''Return of the Jedi''. Johnston's design, called ''Star Wars 76'', was created into a [[font]] and again used in ''Attack of the Clones'' by Metschan, who incorporated the font alongside the later Aurebesh version used in the spin-off products.&lt;ref name="Metschan" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, Stephen Crane, art director at [[West End Games]], became intrigued with the shapes as they appeared on the [[Death Star]]. He sought to develop them into an alphabet to be used in West End Games' licensed ''Star Wars'' products, primarily to allow players to render their characters' names, and received permission from [[Lucasfilm]] to do so as long as it was  presented as one of many alphabets in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy, not the sole and exclusive alphabet. After copying the letters from screenshots by hand, he standardized the letters based on shapes similar to the [[Eurostile]] font. He named and assigned a value to each letter, and derived the name "Aurebesh" from the names of the first two letters: aurek and besh. Once Crane completed the alphabet, Lucasfilm requested a copy to distribute to other licensees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echostation.com/features/aurebesh.htm|title=Aurebesh Soup|last=Crane|first=Stephen|date=October 21, 2000|website=|publisher=EchoStation.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429204741/http://www.echostation.com/features/aurebesh.htm|archive-date=April 29, 2011|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the December 2015 release of ''The Force Awakens'', [[Google Translate]] added a feature to render text into Aurebesh in November 2015.&lt;ref name="TechTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureBeat" /&gt;

==Other languages==

=== Droidspeak ===
Droidspeak is a language consisting of beeps and other synthesized sounds used by some [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]] characters, such as [[R2-D2]] and [[BB-8]].&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; Burtt created R2-D2's dialogue in the original ''Star War''s with an [[ARP 2600]] [[analog synthesizer]] and by processing his own vocalizations via other effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Ben Burtt]]|title=Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope [[audio commentary]]|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Force Awakens'', BB-8's dialogue was created by manipulating the voices of [[Bill Hader]] and [[Ben Schwartz]] with a [[Talk box|talkbox]] running through a sound effects application on an [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitfix.com/motion-captured/wait-a-minute-who-played-the-voice-of-bb-8-in-star-wars-the-force-awakens |title=Wait a minute... who played the voice of BB-8 in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''? |publisher=[[HitFix]] |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |authorlink=Drew McWeeny |date=December 15, 2015 |accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although droidspeak is generally unintelligible to the viewing audience, it appears to be understood by characters such as [[Luke Skywalker]].

===Ewokese===
The [[Ewok]]s of the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] speak a "primitive dialect" of one of the more than six million other forms of communication that [[C-3PO]] is familiar with.  Ben Burtt, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''’s sound designer, created the Ewok language.

On the commentary track for the DVD of ''Return of the Jedi'', Burtt identified the language that he heard in the BBC documentary as [[Kalmyk Oirat]], a tongue spoken by the isolated nomadic [[Kalmyks]]. He describes how, after some research, he identified an 80-year-old Kalmyk [[refugee]]. He recorded her telling folk stories in her native language, and then used the recordings as a basis for sounds that became the Ewok language and were performed by voice actors who imitated the old woman's voice in different styles. For the scene in which C-3PO speaks Ewokese, actor [[Anthony Daniels]] worked with Burtt and invented words, based on the Kalmyk recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Burtt, DVD commentary on ''The Return of the Jedi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcia Calkovsky of Lethbridge University maintains that Tibetan language contributed to Ewok speech ''along'' with Kalmyk, starting the story from attempts to use language samples of Native Americans and later turning to nine Tibetan women living in San Francisco area, as well as one Kalmyk woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Canadian Anthropology Society|title=Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUMWR1U7EVEC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1991|publisher=Canadian Anthropology Society|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the choice of these languages is referenced to Burtt's 1989 telephone interview, and many of the used Tibetan phrases translated. The initial prayer Ewoks address to C-3PO is actually the beginning part of Tibetan Buddhist prayer for the benefit of all sentient beings, or so called [[brahmavihara|''brahmavihāra''s or ''apramāṇa''s]], but also there is a second (out of four) part of the [[refuge (Buddhism)|refuge prayer]]. People of the [[Tibetan diaspora]] were puzzled as many of the phrases they could make out did not correlate to events on screen.

=== Greedo's dialogue ===
In the original ''Star Wars'' film, [[Greedo]] speaks an unspecified alien language, which is understood by [[Han Solo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Mark Allen|date=May 2008|title=Linguistic Moments in the Movies|url=http://linguisticanthropology.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/May-2007.-Volume-48.-Issue-5.-Linguistic-Moments-in-the-Movies-Mark-Allen-Peterson-p.-67.pdf|journal=Anthropology News|publisher=Society for Linguistic Anthropology|volume=49|issue=5|pages=67|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=|accessdate=July 26, 2016|DOI=10.1525/an.2008.49.5.67.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Mannheim described Greedo as speaking "morphologically well-formed" phrases of [[Southern Quechua]], though the sentence is ultimately meaningless. Allen Sonnefrank, a Quechua speaker and [[linguistic anthropology]] student at [[University of California, Berkeley]], claimed [[Lucasfilm]] contacted him to record Quecha dialogue for the film. Because he was told the dialogue was to be played backward for the film, Sonnefrank refused to record the dialogue, feeling it to be a "potentially exploitative move best made by one whose first language was Quechua, if at all".&lt;ref name="LinguistsInHollywood"/&gt;

===Huttese===
[[File:Jabba's alphabet.jpg|thumb|"Jabba's alphabet" from a ''Star Wars''-themed [[Pizza Hut]] box.]]

Another [[lingua franca]] in the ''Star Wars'' Universe that is spoken by many groups and species is [[Hutt (Star Wars)#Huttese language|Huttese]], spoken on [[Nal Hutta]], [[Nar Shaddaa]], [[Tatooine]] and other worlds in and around the Hutt Space (this is the name of the zone, in the galactic West, which is illegally controlled by the Hutts and, in the ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, covers the dominions of the former Hutt Empire). It is spoken in the films by both non-humans ([[Jabba the Hutt]], [[Watto]], [[List of Star Wars characters#S|Sebulba]] and others) and humans. In fact, the whole [[Max Rebo Band]] communicates and sings in Huttese.  Its phonology is said to be based on the [[Quechuan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segreda|first=Ricardo|title=V!VA Travel Guides: Peru|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3eK1nVLHgMC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2009|publisher=Viva Publishing Network|isbn=978-0-9791264-3-7|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Huttese alphabets are featured through the franchise (most notably Boonta alphabet and Nal Huttese), but the one considered "canonical" by fans is the one found on promotional [[Pizza Hut]] [[pizza]] boxes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.completewermosguide.com/huttese.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jawaese and Jawa trade language===
The [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Jawa|Jawas]], also found on Tatooine, speak in a high-pitched, squeaky voice. To speak to others of their species along with the voice they emit a smell showing their emotions. When trading droids and dealing with non-Jawas they speak without the smell because many consider the smell "foul". A famous exclamation in Jawaese is "Utinni!", as screamed by a Jawa to the others in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', shortly after blasting R2-D2.

=== Mando'a {{anchor|Mandalorian}} ===

=== Sith ===
The Sith language, intended to be spoken by [[Sith]] characters, was created by Ben Grossblatt for the ''Book of Sith'', published in February 2012. Development on the language and accompanying writing system began in November 2010. Grossblatt sought to create a pronounceable language that was not "cartoonish" and "would conform to the patterns of principles of {{Sic|[human]}} language. He felt that it needed to "feel martial and mystical" and be a "suitable, aesthetically-pleasing vehicle for communication". He characterized the sound of the language as "tough—but not barbarous" and as "convey[ing] a kind of confident, elegant cruelty". To achieve "formal, quasi-military" and "imposing, undeniable" qualities, he preferred [[closed syllable]]s, creating brisk and choppy words, and constructed the language as [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]].&lt;ref name="SWITraviss2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Grossblatt|first=Ben|date=June 2012|title=Speak Like a Sith|url=|magazine=[[Star Wars Insider]]|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=134|pages=40–43|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shyriiwook {{anchor|Wookieespeak}} ===
Shyriiwook, also known as Wookieespeak,&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; is a language consisting largely of roars and growls spoken by [[Wookiee]] characters, notably [[Chewbacca]]. Non-Wookiee characters are capable of understanding Shyriiwook, such as Chewbacca's friend [[Han Solo]].&lt;ref name="LinguistsInHollywood"/&gt; Chewbacca's dialogue was created from recordings of [[walrus]]es, [[camel]]s, bears, and [[badger]]s from Burtt's personal sound library. One of the most prominent elements was an [[American black bear]] living in the [[Happy Hollow Park &amp; Zoo]] in [[San Jose, California]]. These sounds were [[audio mixing|mixed]] in different ratios to create different roars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Wars: Databank &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Chewbacca|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/?id=bts|accessdate=July 26, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201002846/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/?id=bts |archivedate=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tusken Raiders===
The [[Tusken Raiders]] of [[Tatooine]], according to the video game ''Knights of the Old Republic'', speak a language of their own; it is difficult for non-Tuskens to understand this language. In the game, a droid named [[HK-47]] assists the player in communicating with the Tusken Raiders. In the novelizations Junior Jedi Knights and New Jedi Order series, it is revealed that Jedi Knight Tahiri Veila was raised by the Tusken Raiders after they captured her in a raid. Generally, they utter roars and battle cries when seen in public.

=== Ubese ===
Ubese is a language heard in ''Return of the Jedi'' during a scene where a disguised [[Princess Leia]] bargains with Jabba the Hutt through translator C-3PO. Leia repeats the same Ubese phrase three times, translated differently in subtitles and by C-3PO each time. [[David J. Peterson]], linguist and creator of constructed languages, cited his attempt as a young fan to reconcile this apparent impossibility as an example of how even casual fans may notice errors in fictional constructed languages.{{Sfn|Peterson|2015|p=3-6}} He characterized Ubese as a "sketch" of a language rather than a fully developed language and categorized it as a "fake language" intended to "give the impression of a real language in some context without actually being a real language".{{Sfn|Peterson|2015|p=19}} Ultimately, he criticized Ubese as "poorly constructed and not worthy of serious consideration".{{Sfn|Peterson|2015|pp=6}}

== Critical commentary ==
[[Ben Zimmer]] labeled the method of language construction in ''Star Wars'' "a far cry" from that of constructed languages like [[Klingon language|Klingon]], [[Na'vi language|Na'vi]], and [[Dothraki language|Dothraki]],&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; and he described the use of language as "never amount[ing] to more than a sonic [[pastiche]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06FOB-onlanguage-t.html|title=Skxawng!|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Zimmer|date=December 4, 2009|website=On Language|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linguistic anthropology|Linguistic anthropologist]] Jim Wilce summarized analyses of language in ''Star Wars'' conducted through the Society for Linguistic Anthropology's [[electronic mailing list]]. David Samuels described the approach to language as instrumental and compared the films to a [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] convention, in which "there are no untranslatable phrases, and everyone can understand everyone else", and pointed out that the "idea that the Force is something that would be understood differently in the context of different grammars is never broached". Hal Schiffmann made five observations about language in ''Star Wars'': all humans speak English and no other real-world language, there is "mutual [[passive bilingual]]ism" in which characters speaking different languages understand one another, non-human creatures may have their own languages but are translated by C-3PO, certain non-English vocalizations serve to confuse or amuse the audience rather than serve as language, even non-English speaking characters are expected to understand English. Zimmer supported Schiffmann's claim that untranslated alien languages are not representations of real languages by pointing to the film's script, which describes the language of the Jawas as "a queer, unintelligible language" and that of the Tusken Raiders as "a coarse, barbaric language". Wilce also pointed out discussion on the usage of real non-English to create the "[[Other (philosophy)|Otherness]]" of characters such as Jabba the Hutt, Greedo, and the Ewoks.&lt;ref name="LinguistsInHollywood"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilce |first=Jim |date= October 1999|title= Linguists in Hollywood |journal= Anthropology News |publisher= Society for Linguistic Anthropology |volume=40

'''Lattice masts''', or '''cage masts''', are a type of observation [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] common on major warships in the early 20th century. They are a type of [[hyperboloid structure]], whose weight-saving design was invented by the Russian engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]]. They were used most prominently on American [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s and [[armored cruiser]]s of the [[World War I]] era.

In the [[age of sail]] masts were required to support the sails, and lookouts were posted on them; with the advent of engine-powered warships masts were retained and used for observation and to spot [[fall of shot]]. The purpose of the lattice structure was to make the posts less vulnerable to shells from enemy ships, and to better absorb the shock caused by firing heavy guns, isolating the delicate fire control equipment ([[rangefinder]]s, etc.) mounted on the mast tops. However, the masts were found to be easily damaged by the inclement weather experienced at sea by naval ships during typhoons and hurricanes:  the {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|6}}{{'}}s mast was bent right down to the deck by such a storm in 1918. As the caliber and range of ships' guns increased, heavier rangefinders were required.  Additionally, the guns and powerful engines created shock and vibrations. Lattice masts were phased out in favor of more rigid [[tripod mast]]s.

==Use in the United States Navy==
The {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship}}s were the first class of American battleships to feature lattice masts,&lt;ref&gt;Hore, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; which were to become a standard fixture on all American battleships, and many cruiser classes.&lt;ref&gt;Hore, pp. 56&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; Older vessels, including the first modern American battleship, {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|2}}, were modernized with lattice masts during the period.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1918, the lattice mast of the battleship {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|6}} collapsed in a severe storm; the heavy seas put excessive stress on the mast and the weight of the fire control equipment caused the mast to fail at the narrowest point. The incident spurred an investigation by the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]], which found that the collapse was in part due to the fact that the mast had been lengthened, with a new section spliced in where the mast broke. In addition, fragments from a recent explosion in one of the ship's {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} guns had damaged the mast, and the damage had not been adequately repaired. Nevertheless, the investigation also found that the mast aboard the battleship  {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|2}} also showed signs of buckling. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy repeatedly found evidence of structural problems in the masts, in large part due to the corrosive effects of funnel gases.&lt;ref name=F177&gt;Friedman, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the ''Michigan'' incident, US Navy officers were also gaining experience with British tripod masts for the first time while serving with the [[Grand Fleet]] during World War I. Unlike lattice masts, the heavier tripods did not suffer from vibration when steaming at high speed, and they were not as susceptible to shock from gunfire,&lt;ref name=F177/&gt; which caused the lattice masts to whip from the concussion.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

All American battleships, up to the {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|0}} battleships were equipped with lattice masts, although in the 1920s to 1930s, the older battleships had their lattice masts replaced with more modern tripod masts, concomitant with the addition of larger, much heavier fire-control director tops.&lt;ref&gt;Hore, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The newer {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|5}} classes retained their original lattice masts, of heavier construction than those on earlier ships, at the start of [[World War II]].

==Use in other navies==
Only four battleships were completed with lattice masts for other navies. The two {{sclass-|Andrei Pervozvanny|battleship}}s of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] had lattice masts until they were replaced with conventional masts in the beginning of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Morison and Polmar, p. 172.: Quote:"The only foreign ships to have them were the U.S.-built Argentinian ''[[ARA Rivadavia|Rivadavia]]'' and ''[[ARA Moreno|Moreno]]'' and the Russian ''Andrei Pervozvanny'' and ''Imperator Pavel I''."&lt;/ref&gt; The two United States-built {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship}}s of the [[Argentine Navy]], [[ARA Rivadavia]] and [[ARA Moreno]], had lattice masts. They were the only dreadnought-type battleships built for export by the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Hore, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Two other battleships, the US pre-dreadnoughts ''[[USS Mississippi (BB-23) |Mississippi]]'' and ''[[USS Idaho (BB-24)|Idaho]]'' were sold to Greece in 1914; they retained their lattice masts until their sinking by the Germans in 1941.

Some navies considered lattice masts for their ships. Following their experience with the ''Andrei Pervozvanny''s, the Russians initially designed the four {{sclass-|Gangut|battleship}}s with lattice masts, but constructed with pole ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hythe, pp. 351-352 (Plates 57-58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melnikov, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Imperial Navy]] designed its first [[battlecruiser]], {{SMS|Von der Tann}}, with lattice masts, but she was instead completed with pole masts.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fortifications==
A lattice fire-control mast was installed on [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Fort Drum]], a fort built by the United States to guard the entrance of [[Manila Bay]]. The mast directed the fire of the fort's 14-inch main batteries.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Colloquially, the '''linguistics wars''' were a protracted academic dispute in American [[generative linguistics]], stemming from a falling-out between [[Noam Chomsky]] and some of his early students and colleagues, which took place mostly in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Overview==
The debate began when linguists such as [[Paul Postal]], [[John Robert Ross|"Haj" Ross]], [[George Lakoff]], and [[James McCawley]]—self-dubbed the "[[four horsemen of the Apocalypse]]"—proposed an alternative theory of [[generative semantics]], which essentially flipped [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory on its head by focusing on [[semantics]] rather than [[grammar]] as the basis of Chomsky's concept of [[deep structure]]. While [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and other [[generative grammar]]ians argued that meaning was derived from the underlying order of the words being used, the [[generative semantics|generative semanticists]] cited the meaning of the words as giving rise to their order.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Randy Allen|title=The Linguistics Wars|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195098341|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, [[generative semantics]] spawned an alternative linguistic paradigm, known as [[cognitive linguistics]], which attempts to correlate the understanding of language with the concepts of [[cognitive psychology]], such as memory, perception and categorization. While generative semanticists operate on the premise that the mind has a unique and independent module for [[language acquisition]], cognitive linguists deny this. Instead, they assert that the processing of linguistic phenomena is informed by conceptual deep structures and&amp;mdash;more significantly&amp;mdash;that the cognitive abilities used to process this data are similar to those used in other non-linguistic tasks.

== Book ==
''The Linguistics Wars'' is the title of a 1993 book by Randy Allen Harris on the topic ({{ISBN|9780195098341}}).

It touches on the issues of the dispute involving Chomsky and other significant individuals ([[George Lakoff|Lakoff]], [[Paul Postal|Postal]], etc.) and also highlights how certain theories evolved and which of their important features have influenced modern-day linguistic theories.

'''Lomavren''' ({{lang-hy|Լոմավրեն}} ''{{transl|hy|ISO|lomavren}}'') is a nearly extinct [[mixed language]], spoken by the [[Lom people]], that arose from [[language contact]] between a language related to [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Domari language|Domari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iranica.com/articles/gypsy-ii |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100935/https://www.iranica.com/articles/gypsy-ii |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }} Encyclopedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Armenian language]].

==Names==
The language is also known as ''(Armenian) Bosa/Bosha''.

==Linguistic features==
It lacks grammatical gender and has 7 [[grammatical case]]s; its grammar is closely related to that of the Erzerum dialect of Armenian, with the vocabulary being almost exclusively [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]].

'''Lower Sorbian''' ({{lang|dsb|dolnoserbšćina}}) is a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[minority language]] spoken in eastern [[Germany]] in the historical province of [[Lower Lusatia]], today part of [[Brandenburg]]. It is one of the two literary [[Sorbian languages]], the other being [[Upper Sorbian]].

Lower Sorbian is spoken in and around the city of [[Cottbus]] in [[Brandenburg]]. Signs in this region are usually bilingual, and Cottbus has a ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' where one language of instruction is Lower Sorbian. It is a heavily [[endangered language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Moseley|editor-first=Christopher|title=Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger|date=2010|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|location=Paris|isbn=978-92-3-104096-2|edition=3rd|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most native speakers are in the oldest generation today.

==Phonology==
[[File:Bilinguale Straßenbeschilderung Cottbus.jpg|thumb|Bilingual road sign in [[Cottbus]], Germany]]
The phonology of Lower Sorbian has been greatly influenced by [[language contact|contact]] with [[German language|German]], especially in Cottbus and larger towns. For example, German-influenced pronunciation tends to have a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} instead of the alveolar trill {{IPA|[r]}}. In villages and rural areas German influence is less marked, and the pronunciation is more "typically Slavic".

* {{IPA|/t͡ʃ, ʃ, ʒ/}} have been variously transcribed with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|t͡ʃ, ʃ, ʒ}}}}{{sfnp|Hannusch|1988}}{{sfnp|Stone|2002}} and {{angle bracket|{{IPA|t͡ʂ, ʂ, ʐ}}}}.{{sfnp|Zygis|2003}} Their actual phonetic realization is flat postalveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t͡ʂ|t͡ʃ˖}}, {{IPA link|ʂ|ʃ˖}}, {{IPA link|ʐ|ʒ˖}}]}}&lt;ref&gt;This transcription follows {{Harvcoltxt|Laver|1994|pp=251–252}}. Other scholars may transcribe these sounds differently.&lt;/ref&gt; in all of the Lower Sorbian-speaking area. This is unlike in standard Upper Sorbian, where these are [[Palato-alveolar consonant|palato-alveolar]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t͡ʃ}}, {{IPA link|ʃ}}, {{IPA link|ʒ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Zygis|2003|pp=180–181, 190–191}}{{sfnp|Šewc-Schuster|1984|pp=40–41}}

====Final devoicing and assimilation====
Lower Sorbian has both [[final devoicing]] and regressive [[phonation|voicing]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]:{{sfnp|Hannusch|1998|p=12}} 
*''dub'' {{IPA|/dub/}} "oak" is pronounced {{IPA|[dup]}}
*''susedka'' {{IPA|/ˈsusedka/}} "(female) neighbor" is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈsusetka]}}
*''licba'' {{IPA|/ˈlit͡sba/}} "number" is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈlʲid͡zba]}}

*''šćit'' {{IPA|/ʃt͡ɕit/}} "protection" is pronounced {{IPA|[ɕt͡ɕit]}}

===Vowels===
The vowel inventory of Lower Sorbian is exactly the same as that of Upper Sorbian.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=600}} It is also very similar to the vowel inventory of [[Slovene language|Slovene]].

* {{IPA|/i/}} is retracted to {{IPA|[ɨ]}}{{fix|text=is it really {{IPA|[ɨ]}}? It is {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in Upper Sorbian.|date=April 2015}} after hard consonants.
* {{IPA|/e, o/}} are diphthongized to {{IPA|[i̯ɛ, u̯ɔ]}} in slow speech.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=600}}
* The {{IPA|/e–ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/o–ɔ/}} distinctions are weakened or lost in unstressed syllables.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|pp=606–607}}
* {{IPA|/a/}} is phonetically central {{IPAblink|ä}}.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=600}}

===Stress===
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in Lower Sorbian normally falls on the first [[syllable]] of the word:{{sfnp|Hannusch|1998|p=14}}
*''Łužyca'' {{IPA|[ˈwuʒɨt͡sa]}} "[[Lusatia]]"
*''pśijaśel'' {{IPA|[ˈpɕijaɕɛl]}} "friend"
*''Chóśebuz'' {{IPA|[ˈxɨɕɛbus]}} "[[Cottbus]]"

In [[loanword]]s, stress may fall on any of the last three syllables:{{sfnp|Hannusch|1998|p=14}}
*''internat'' {{IPA|[intɛrˈnat]}} "boarding school"
*''kontrola'' {{IPA|[kɔnˈtrɔla]}} "control"
*''september'' {{IPA|[sɛpˈtɛmbɛr]}} "September"
*''policija'' {{IPA|[pɔˈlʲit͡sija]}} "police"
*''organizacija'' {{IPA|[ɔrɡanʲiˈzat͡sija]}} "organization"

Most one-syllable prepositions attract the stress to themselves when they precede a noun or pronoun of one or two syllables:{{sfnp|Hannusch|1998|p=14}}
*''na dwórje'' {{IPA|[ˈna dwɨrʲɛ]}} "on the courtyard"
*''pśi mnjo'' {{IPA|[ˈpɕi mnʲɔ]}} "near me"
*''do města'' {{IPA|[ˈdɔ mʲɛsta]}} "into the city" (note that the {{IPA|[iɪ̯]}} of ''město'' {{IPA|[ˈmʲiɪ̯stɔ]}} becomes {{IPA|[ɛ]}} when unstressed)

However, nouns of three or more syllables retain their stress:
*''pśed wucabnikom'' {{IPA|[pɕɛd ˈut͡sabnʲikɔm]}} "in front of the teacher"
*''na drogowanju'' {{IPA|[na ˈdrɔɡowanʲu]}} "on a journey"

==Orthography==
The [[Sorbian alphabet]] is based on the [[Latin script]] but uses [[diacritic]]s such as [[acute accent]] and [[caron]].

==Sample==
Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Lower Sorbian:

''Wšykne luźe su lichotne roźone a jadnake po dostojnosći a pšawach. Woni maju rozym a wědobnosć a maju ze sobu w duchu bratšojstwa wobchadaś. ''

(All people are born free and equal in their dignity and rights. They are given reason and conscience and they shall create their relationships to one another according to the spirit of brotherhood.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sorbian.htm Omniglot]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[language variety|variety]] of the [[Moselle Franconian]] language, Luxembourgish has similarities with other varieties of Moselle Franconian and the wider group of [[West Germanic languages]]. However, the status of Luxembourgish as an official language in Luxembourg and the existence there of a regulatory body,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpll.lu/pdf/loi_2004.pdf Law establishing the Conseil Permanent de la Langue Luxembourgeoise (CPLL)]&lt;/ref&gt; has removed Luxembourgish, at least in part, from the domain of [[Standard German]], its traditional ''[[Abstand_and_ausbau_languages#Roofing|Dachsprache]]''.

==Language family==
Luxembourgish belongs to the [[West Central German]] group of [[High German languages]] and is the primary example of a [[Moselle Franconian]] language.

==Usage==
Luxembourgish is the [[national language]] of Luxembourg and one of three administrative languages, alongside [[French language|French]] and [[Standard German|German]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html ''Mémorial A'' no. 16 (27 February 1984), pp. 196–7:  "Loi du 24 février 1984 sur le régime des langues".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Luxemburger Lexikon - Das Großherzogtum von A-Z|last=Hausemer|first=Georges|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Luxembourg, 50.9% of citizens can speak Luxembourgish. Luxembourgish is also spoken in the [[Arelerland]] region of [[Belgium]] (part of the [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Province of Luxembourg]]) and in small parts of [[Lorraine (région)|Lorraine]] in [[France]]. 

In the [[Germany|German]] [[Eifel]] and Hunsrück regions, similar local [[Moselle Franconian]] dialects of German are spoken. The language is also spoken by a few descendants of Luxembourg immigrants in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Additionally, in the [[Germany|German]] [[Eifel]] and Hunsrück regions, similar local [[Moselle Franconian]] dialects of German are spoken. Other [[Moselle Franconian dialects]] are spoken by ethnic Germans long settled in [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]] (Siebenbürgen).

Moselle Franconian dialects outside the Luxembourg state border tend to have far fewer French loan words, and these mostly remain from the French Revolution.

===Varieties===
There are several distinct dialect forms of Luxembourgish including Areler (from [[Arlon]]), Eechternoacher ([[Echternach]]), Kliärrwer ([[Clervaux]]), Miseler ([[Moselle (river)|Moselle]]), Stater ([[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]), Veiner ([[Vianden]]), Minetter (Southern Luxembourg) and Weelzer ([[Wiltz]]). Further small vocabulary differences may be seen even between small villages.

Increasing mobility of the population and the dissemination of the language through mass media such as radio and television are leading to a gradual standardisation towards a "Standard Luxembourgish" through the process of [[Koiné language|koineization]].&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014"&gt;[http://www.ulrichammon.de/resources/Stellung_der_deutschen_Sprache.pdf Ammon, Ulrich - Die Stellung der deutschen Sprache in der Welt (de Gruyter Mouton)]; {{ISBN|978-3-11-019298-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrounding languages===
There is no distinct geographic boundary between the use of Luxembourgish and the use of other closely related High German dialects (for example [[Lorraine Franconian]]); it instead forms a [[dialect continuum]] of gradual change.

Spoken Luxembourgish is relatively hard to understand for speakers of German who are generally not familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects (or at least other [[West Central German]] dialects). However, they can usually read the language to some degree. For those Germans familiar with Moselle Franconian dialects, it is relatively easy to understand and speak Luxembourgish as far as the everyday vocabulary is concerned.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014"/&gt; However, the large number of French loanwords in Luxembourgish may hamper communication about certain topics, or with certain speakers (who use many French loanwords).

There is no [[Mutual intelligibility|intelligibility]] between Luxembourgish and French or any of the Romance dialects spoken in the adjacent parts of Belgium and France.&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014"/&gt;

[[Erna Hennicot-Schoepges]], President of the [[Christian Social People's Party]] of [[Luxembourg]] 1995–2003, was active in promoting the language beyond Luxembourg's borders.

==Written Luxembourgish==

===Standardisation===
A number of proposals for standardising the [[orthography]] of Luxembourgish can be documented, going back to the middle of the 19th century. There was no officially recognised system, however, until the adoption of the "OLO" (''ofizjel lezebuurjer ortografi'') on 5 June 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1946/0400709/index.html ''Mémorial A'' no. 40 (7 September 1946), pp. 637–41: "Arrêté ministériel du 5 juin 1946 portant fixation d'un système officiel d'orthographe luxembourgeois"]&lt;/ref&gt; This orthography provided a system for speakers of all varieties of Luxembourgish to transcribe words the way they pronounced them, rather than imposing a single, standard spelling for the words of the language. The rules explicitly rejected certain elements of German orthography (e.g., the use of "[[ä]]" and "[[ö]]",&lt;ref&gt;"Et get kèèn '''ä''' geshriven. […] Et get kèèn '''ö''' geshriven." (p. 639)&lt;/ref&gt; the capitalisation of nouns). Similarly, new principles were adopted for the spelling of French loanwords.
* fiireje, rééjelen, shwèzt, veinejer (cf. German ''{{wiktde|vorigen}}'', ''{{wiktde|Regeln}}'', ''{{wiktde|schwätzt}}'', ''{{wiktde|weniger}}'')
* bültê, âprê, Shaarel, ssistém (cf. French ''{{wiktfr|bulletin}}'', ''{{wiktfr|emprunt}}'', ''{{wiktfr|Charles}}'', ''{{wiktfr|système}}'')
This proposed orthography, so different from existing "foreign" standards that people were already familiar with, did not enjoy widespread approval.

A more successful standard eventually emerged from the work of the committee of specialists charged with the task of creating the ''Luxemburger Wörterbuch'', published in 5 volumes between 1950 and 1977. The orthographic conventions adopted in this decades-long project, set out in Bruch (1955), provided the basis of the standard orthography that became official on 10 October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''Mémorial B'' no. 68 (16 November 1976), pp. 1365–90: "Arrêté ministériel du 10 octobre 1975 portant réforme du système officiel d'orthographe luxembourgeoise".&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications to this standard were proposed by the ''[[Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise]]'' and adopted officially in the spelling reform of 30 July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1999/1121108/index.html ''Mémorial A'' no. 112 (11 August 1999), pp. 2040–8: "Règlement grand-ducal du 30 juillet 1999 portant réforme du système officiel d'orthographe luxembourgeoise".]&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed explanation of current practice for Luxembourgish can be found in Schanen &amp; Lulling (2003).

===Alphabet===
{{see also|Luxembourgish Braille}}
The Luxembourgish alphabet consists of the [[Latin script|26 Latin letters]] plus three letters with diacritics: "é", "ä", and "ë". In [[loanwords]] from French and Standard German, other diacritics are usually preserved:
* French: ''Boîte'', ''Enquête'', ''Piqûre'', etc.
* German: ''blöd'', ''Bühn'' (but German ''Bühne''), etc.

===Eifeler Regel===
{{Main article|Eifeler Regel}}

Like many other varieties of Western High German, Luxembourgish has a rule of final ''n''-deletion in certain contexts. The effects of this rule (known as the "Eifel Rule") are indicated in writing, and therefore must be taken into account when spelling words and morphemes ending in {{angbr|n}} or {{angbr|nn}}. For example:
* ''wa'''nn''' ech ginn'' "when I go", but ''wa mer ginn'' "when we go"
* ''fënnefa'''n'''drësseg'' "thirty-five", but ''fënnefavéierzeg'' "forty-five".

==Grammar==

===Nominal syntax===
Luxembourgish has three [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and has three [[grammatical case|cases]] (nominative, accusative, and dative). These are marked morphologically on [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] and [[pronoun]]s. As in German, there is no morphological gender distinction in the plural.
&lt;!--Luxembourgish demonstrates three [[grammatical genders]] - masculine, feminine and neuter. As in German this corresponds where possible to biological gender, but may be affected by suffixes. Where there is no biological gender, the grammatical gender of a word is largely arbitrary, although may again be determined by suffixes.--&gt;

The forms of the articles and of some selected determiners are given below:

As seen above, Luxembourgish has plural forms of ''en'' ("a, an"), namely ''eng'' in the nominative/accusative and ''engen'' in the dative. They are not used as indefinite articles, which—as in German and English—do not exist in the plural, but they do occur in the compound pronouns ''wéi en'' ("what, which") and ''sou en'' ("such"). For example: ''wéi eng Saachen'' ("what things"); ''sou eng Saachen'' ("such things"). Moreover, they are used before numbers to express an estimation: ''eng 30.000 Spectateuren'' ("some 30,000 spectators").

Distinct nominative forms survive in a few nominal phrases such as ''der Däiwel'' ("the devil") and ''eiser Herrgott'' ("our Lord"). Rare examples of the genitive are also found: ''Enn des Mounts'' ("end of the month"), ''Ufanks der Woch'' ("at the beginning of the week"). The functions of the genitive are normally expressed using a combination of the dative and a possessive determiner: e.g. ''dem Mann säi Buch'' (lit. "to the man his book", i.e. "the man's book"). This is known as a [[His genitive|periphrastic genitive]], and is a phenomenon also commonly seen in dialectal and colloquial German, and in Dutch.

The forms of the personal pronouns are given in the following table (unstressed forms appear in parentheses):

|-
! 3pl
| colspan="2" align="center" | '''si''' (se) || '''hinnen''' (en)
|}

The 2pl form is also used as a polite singular (like French ''vous'', see [[T-V distinction]]); the forms are capitalised in writing:
:''Wéi hues '''du''' de Concert fonnt?'' ("How did you [informal sg.] like the concert?")
:''Wéi hutt '''dir''' de Concert fonnt?'' ("How did you [informal pl.] like the concert?")
:''Wéi hutt '''Dir''' de Concert fonnt?''  ("How did you [formal sg. or pl.] like the concert?")

Like most varieties of colloquial German, but even more invariably, Luxembourgish uses definite articles with personal names. They are obligatory and not to be translated:
:'''''De''' Serge ass an der Kichen.'' ("Serge is in the kitchen.")

A feature Luxembourgish shares with only some western dialects of German is that women and girls are most often referred to with forms of the ''neuter'' pronoun ''hatt'':
:Dat ass d'Nathalie. '''Hatt''' ass midd, well '''et''' vill a '''sengem''' Gaart geschafft huet. ("That's Nathalie. She is tired because she has worked a lot in her garden.")

===Adjectives===
Luxembourgish morphology distinguishes two types of adjective: [[attributive]] and [[predicative expression|predicative]]. [[predicative (adjectival or nominal)|Predicative adjectives]] appear with verbs like ''sinn'' ("to be"), and receive no extra ending:
* De Mann ass grouss. (''masculine'', "The man is tall.")
* D'Fra ass grouss. (''feminine'', "The woman is tall.")
* D'Meedchen ass grouss. (''neuter'', "The girl is tall.")
* D'Kanner si grouss. (''plural'', "The children are tall.")

Attributive adjectives are placed before the noun they describe, and change their ending according to the grammatical gender, number, and case:
* de grouss'''e''' Mann (''masculine'')
* déi grouss Fra (''feminine'')
* dat grouss'''t''' Meedchen (''neuter'')
* déi grouss Kanner (''plural'')

Curiously, the definite article changes with the use of an attributive adjective: feminine ''d'' goes to ''déi'' (or ''di''), neuter ''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' goes to ''dat'', and plural ''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' changes to ''déi''.

The [[comparative]] in Luxembourgish is formed analytically, i.e. the adjective itself is not altered (compare the use of -''er'' in German and English; ''tall'' → ''taller'', ''klein'' → ''kleiner''). Instead it is formed using the adverb ''méi'': e.g. ''schéin'' → ''méi schéin''
* Lëtzebuerg ass méi schéi wéi Esch. ("Luxembourg is prettier than Esch.")

The [[superlative]] involves a synthetic form consisting of the adjective and the suffix ''-st'': e.g. ''schéin'' → ''schéin'''st''' '' (compare German ''schönst'', English ''prettiest''). Attributive modification requires the emphatic definite article and the inflected superlative adjective:
* '''dee''' schéinst'''e''' Mann ("the most handsome man")
* '''déi''' schéinst Fra ("the prettiest woman")

Predicative modification uses either the same adjectival structure or the adverbial structure ''am''+ -''sten'': e.g. ''schéin'' → ''am schéinsten'':
* Lëtzebuerg ass dee schéinsten / deen allerschéinsten / am schéinsten. ("Luxembourg is the most beautiful (of all).")

Some common adjectives have exceptional comparative and superlative forms:
* gutt, besser, am beschten ("good, better, best")
* vill, méi, am meeschten ("much, more, most")
* wéineg, manner, am mannsten ("few, fewer, fewest")

Several other adjectives also have comparative forms. However, these are not commonly used as normal comparatives, but in special senses:
* al ("old") → ''eeler'' Leit ("elderly people"), but: ''méi al'' Leit ("older people, people older than X")
* fréi ("early") → de ''fréiere'' President ("the former president"), but: e ''méi fréien'' Termin ("an earlier appointment")
* laang ("long") → viru ''längerer'' Zäit ("some time ago"), but: eng ''méi laang'' Zäit ("a longer period of time")

===Word order===
Luxembourgish exhibits "verb second" word order in clauses. More specifically, Luxembourgish is a [[V2 word order|V2]]-[[SOV language]], like German and Dutch. In other words, we find the following finite clausal structures:
* the finite verb in second position in declarative clauses and ''wh''-questions
::Ech '''kafen''' en Hutt. Muer '''kafen''' ech en Hutt. (lit. "I buy a hat. Tomorrow buy I a hat.)
::Wat '''kafen''' ech haut? (lit. "What buy I today?")
* the finite verb in first position in yes/no questions and finite imperatives
::'''Bass''' de midd? ("Are you tired?")
::'''Gëff''' mer deng Hand! ("Give me your hand!")
* the finite verb in final position in subordinate clauses
::Du weess, datt ech midd '''sinn'''. (lit. "You know, that I tired am.")

Non-finite verbs (infinitives and participles) generally appear in final position:
* compound past tenses
::Ech hunn en Hutt '''kaf'''. (lit. "I have a hat bought.")
* infinitival complements
::Du solls net esou vill Kaffi '''drénken'''. (lit. "You should not so much coffee drink.")
* infinitival clauses (e.g., used as imperatives)
::Nëmme Lëtzebuergesch '''schwätzen'''! (lit. "Only Luxembourgish speak!")

These rules interact so that in subordinate clauses, the finite verb and any non-finite verbs must all cluster at the end. Luxembourgish allows different word orders in these cases:
::Hie freet, ob ech '''komme kann'''. (cf. German ''Er fragt, ob ich kommen kann.'')
::Hie freet, ob ech '''ka kommen'''. (cf. Dutch ''Hij vraagt of ik kan komen.'')
This is also the case when two non-finite verb forms occur together:
::Ech hunn net '''kënne kommen'''. (cf. Dutch ''Ik heb niet kunnen komen.'')
::Ech hunn net '''komme kënnen'''. (cf. German ''Ich habe nicht kommen können.'')

Luxembourgish (like Dutch and German) allows prepositional phrases to appear after the verb cluster in subordinate clauses:
::alles, wat Der ëmmer wollt wëssen '''iwwer Lëtzebuerg'''
::(lit. "everything what you always wanted know about Luxembourg")

==Vocabulary==
Luxembourgish has borrowed many French words. For example, the name for a bus driver is ''Buschauffeur'' (also [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Swiss German]]), which would be ''Busfahrer'' in German and ''chauffeur de bus'' in French.

Some words are different from Standard German but have equivalents in German dialects. An example is ''Gromperen'' (potatoes – German: ''Kartoffeln''). Other words are exclusive to Luxembourgish.

===Neologisms===
[[Neologisms]] in Luxembourgish include both entirely new words, and the attachment of new meanings to old words in everyday speech. The most recent neologisms come from the English language in the fields of [[telecommunication]]s, [[computer science]], and the [[Internet]].

Recent neologisms in Luxembourgish include:&lt;ref&gt;Lulling, Jérôme. (2002) ''La créativité lexicale en luxembourgeois,'' Doctoral thesis, Université Paul Valéry Montpellier III&lt;/ref&gt;
* direct loans from English: ''Browser'', ''Spam'', ''CD'', ''Fitness'', ''Come-back'', ''Terminal'', ''Hip'', ''Cool'', ''Tip-top''
* also found in German: ''Sichmaschinn'' (search engine, German: ''Suchmaschine''), ''schwaarzt Lach'' (black hole, German: ''Schwarzes Loch''), ''Handy'' (mobile phone), ''Websäit'' (webpage, German: ''Webseite'')
* native Luxembourgish
** ''déck'' as an emphatic like ''ganz'' and ''voll'', e.g. ''Dëse Kuch ass déck gutt!'' ("This cake is really good!")
** recent expressions, used mainly by teenagers: ''oh mëllen!'' ("oh crazy"), ''en décke gelénkt'' ("you've been tricked") or ''cassé'' (French for "(you've been) owned")

==Academic projects==
Between 2000 and 2002, Luxembourgish linguist [[Jérôme Lulling]] compiled a lexical database of 125,000 word forms as the basis for the very first Luxembourgish [[spellchecker]] (Projet C.ORT.IN.A).

The LaF (''Lëtzebuergesch als Friemsprooch'' – Luxembourgish as a Foreign Language) is a set of four language proficiency certifications for Luxembourgish and follows the [[Association of Language Testers in Europe|ALTE]] framework of language examination standards. The tests are administered by the Institut National des Langues Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="laf_insl"&gt;[http://www.insl.lu/Francais/page3/p3frame.htm Institut national des langues – INL – Passer un examen à l'INL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508061725/http://www.insl.lu/Francais/page3/p3frame.htm |date=8 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Centre for Luxembourg Studies" at the [[University of Sheffield]] was founded in 1995 on the initiative of Professor Gerald Newton. It is supported by the government of Luxembourg which funds an [[Financial endowment#Endowed professorships|endowed chair]] in Luxembourg Studies at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Centre for Luxembourg Studies|url=http://shef.ac.uk/luxembourg-studies|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first class of students to study the language outside of the country as undergraduate students began their studies at the 'Centre for Luxembourg Studies' at Sheffield in the academic year 2011–2012.

'''Marja-Liisa Orvokki Vartio''' (née '''Sairanen''', 1955-1966 Haavikko; 11 September 1924 [[Sääminki]], [[Finland]]  – 17 June 1966 [[Savonlinna]], Finland) was a Finnish poet and prose writer. Her writing career was short but influential. She was one of the leading modernist writers in Finland.&lt;ref name="HUM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://375humanistia.helsinki.fi/en/humanists/marja-liisa-vartio |title=Marja-Liisa Vartio |last= Sjöblom |first=Tom |date= |website=375 humanists |publisher=University of Helsinki |access-date=23 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied art history and modern literature in University of Helsinki. She married an art dealer in 1945 and was introduced into Helsinki’s writing and artistic circles. Her first collection s of poetry were published in 1952. In 1955 she married writer [[Paavo Haavikko]]. Around that time she started to write prose.&lt;ref name="HUM2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://375humanistia.helsinki.fi/en/marja-liisa-vartio/reshaping-finnish-prose |title=Reshaping Finnish Prose |last= Sjöblom |first=Tom |date= |website=375 humanists |publisher=University of Helsinki |access-date=23 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vartio published nine works of prose and poetry. Her works describe how the world changed in the twentieth century and the influence of this on human beings, especially on women. In her poetry she used folk literature as an inspiration.  One of her novels, ''Hänen olivat linnut'' (The Parson’s Widow) was published after her death. It tells about an old woman and her maid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.schwob-books.eu/author/90/marja-liisa-vartio |title=Marja-Liisa Vartio |website=Schwob |access-date=23 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel is considered Vartio's most central work.&lt;ref name="HUM2"/&gt;

'''Nylonkong''', a contraction of New York–London–Hong Kong, is a neologism coined to link [[New York City]], [[London]] and [[Hong Kong]] as the [[Ecumenopolis|eperopolis]] of the [[Americas]], [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|Euro-Africa]], and [[Asia-Pacific]] that first appeared in the magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''A Tale Of Three Cities''，'''Time''', 17-1-2008&lt;/ref&gt; The article suggests that the cities share similarities, especially in being globalised financial and cultural centres, and are the most remarkable cities in the 21st century. The article elicited a strong positive response in Hong Kong but remains little known in the other two cities.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Nylonkong, from ''NY'' ([[New York City]]), ''Lon'' ([[London]]), and Kong ([[Hong Kong]]) first appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article ''A Tale of Three Cities'' in 2008.

According to ''Time'', these cities share similarities in cultural and economic establishments. They are influential in cultural industries, including [[art auctions]], [[movies]], and [[pop songs]]. In addition, the cities are top international [[financial center|financial centre]]s located in different [[time zones]]. ''Time'' further described the cites as the three most remarkable international cities in the 21st century, and one could better understand the world through understanding Nylonkong. [[Financial Development Index]] ranks Hong Kong, USA, and UK as the first to third places of the table, accordingly.

An extended range of responses was observed in media and academia after the term was coined, such as in the [[Mingpao Daily]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpfinance.com/htm/Finance/20080130/News/ek1_ek1a2.htm ''《時代》創 「紐倫港」 香港紐約倫敦齊名(The Times invented Nylonkong as Hong Kong, New York, and London share the fame)'']，'''Mingpao Daily'''， 30-1-2008&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first quoted in academia by [[Yin Pak Andrew Lau]] in the Liberal Studies Youth Summit on Basic Law,&lt;ref&gt;[https://2db8697d-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/annualquiz/file/ExecutiveSummaryforBasicLaw.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cplCoWwFtDakBmOQK8Q2NxS8pJokP_x6MMCBwyqaMo-AHPF_oswmnZJRGECyTfQnOAiv83DhqNev059erFxuAtrbtyWr5GjaGK7iKQEocEUXZdGQSGXQnk2zSm6JluNwXzG7auSrBrpGrWXBVv3rBjvLdvJtNAskZkq46yb5X-g0OGGzEk41q_ZJ7kAJnk76ZKjnyM-JXUdwb9IdZTetyK8Gs1MQAibqzFmUGJAmjbg386ToJw%3D&amp;attredirects=0 ''Liberal Studies Youth Summit on Basic Law'']，'''Hong Kong Annual Quiz'''， 15-3-2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sing Tao Daily]] suggested that the term is a profound sign of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;''Approaching Nylonkong; Showing Globalization 登陸紐倫港 活現全球化'', Education, '''Sing Tao Daily'''， 9-3-2008&lt;/ref&gt; The influence is substantial and long-lasting, and has imposed a constant check on the achievement of the three financial hubs. In 2016, [[Lam Hang-chi]], an economist, for example, suggested that Nylonkong would fade out if the financial hubs were not constantly competitive.&lt;ref&gt;''Hong Kong Economic Journal'',12-4-2016&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2016, [[Tai Kung Pao]] suggested that Hong Kong should not compare itself with New York and London, as the Asian financial center is politically and socially autonomous when compared to the other two, which were only cities; the passage further argues that the autonomous entity of Hong Kong requires more diversified economic development like other [[Four Asian Tigers]] economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.takungpao.com.hk/finance/text/2016/1003/28294.html |title=Fāzhǎn cānzhào lúndūn niǔyuē?

In popular culture, the term has also influenced the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], being the locations of both the three [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]] in ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' and [[Erik Killmonger|Erik Killmonger's]] war dogs in ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]].

The '''Paderborn method for language teaching''', also known as the '''Paderborn method''' or '''Paderborn model''' is a method for teaching foreign languages, originally conceived for children's education. It consists in first teaching a simple language ([[Esperanto]]), then two years later teaching a second language. Many studies confirmed that learning a complete and easy [[propaedeutics|propaedeutical language]] helps in later learning a more difficult one with no lost time, indeed with gain of it.

The effectiveness of this method was empirically noticed in different studies of the last century.&lt;ref name = bollettinoUfficiale&gt;[http://jespako.blogspot.com/2011/11/repost-international-language-known-as.html Official bulletin of Italian Ministry for Public Education, 122nd year, Rome, May 25 - June 1, 1995, No. 21-22]. Contains a large number of studies and experiments ([http://parracomumangi.altervista.org/BollettinoUfficiale.pdf original in Italian])&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. [[Helmar Frank]], of the [[University of Paderborn]]'s Institute of Pedagogic Cybernetics, scientifically proved the method's efficacy; his study gave the name to this method.

==History of the method==
Many adults who learned Esperanto had noticed that they could better understand the grammar of their own mother tongue and foreign languages — thanks to having come to know this simple, [[constructed language|planned language]] with its transparent [[Esperanto grammar|grammar]] — and started to think that such a language could have propaedeutical value in language teaching.

=== Other experiments===
This consideration led to many independent experiments being done in Hungary, Great Britain and other countries. Some of the most significant were:
*'''1918-1921''' - Female middle school in Bishop Auckland (GB). Esperanto taught as propaedeutical language for French and German&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra FISCHER, Languages by way of Esperanto; ''Eksperimento farita en Bishop Auckland (GB) en la jaroj 1918-1921'' in ''Internacia Pedagogia Revuo'', 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1934-1935''' - Public high school in [[New York City|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen S. EATON, "An Experiment in Language Learning", in ''Modern Language Journal'', Volume 19, Issue 1, pages 1–4, October 1934&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''' 1947-1951''' - Provincial grammar school in Sheffield (GB),&lt;ref&gt;J. H. HALLORAN (teacher of pedagogy at University of Sheffield), "A four-year experiment in Esperanto as an introduction to French", in ''British Journal of Educational Psychology'', vol. 22, no. 3, 1952 (Nov.), pp. 200-204.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on help received by less intelligent students
*'''1948-1965''' - Egerton Park School, Denton (Manchester, GB).&lt;ref&gt;Report: Norman WILLIAMS (didactical director) ''Report on the teaching of Esperanto from 1948 to 1965.'' - It concluded that a child can learn as much in six months of Esperanto study as in about 3-4 years of French study. The conclusion was that if all children would learn Esperanto during the first 6-12 months in a 4-5 year course of French, they would gain a lot of time without losing anything.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1958-1963''' - Somero (Finland), Esperanto used as propaedeutical language for German&lt;ref&gt;J. VILKKI, V. SETÄLÄ, ''La eksperimenta instruado de Esperanto en la geknaba mezgrada lernejo de Somero (Suomio)''; V. SETÄLÄ, ''Vizito al la eksperimenta lernejo en Somero, Finnlando''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1971-1974''',&lt;ref&gt;Marta KOVÁCS, ''Internacia Didaktika Eksperimento Kvinlanda''; Johano INGUSZ, ''Instruspertoj en esperantfakaj klasoj (en Hungario)''&lt;/ref&gt; 1975-1977&lt;ref&gt;Helmut SONNABEND, ''Esperanto, lerneja eksperimento''&lt;/ref&gt; - The [[International League of Esperanto Teachers]] (ILEI), encouraged by previous studies, coordinated international studies, the first in Hungary and the second in Belgium, France, Greece, West Germany and the Netherlands. In 1977 the students met in an educational week, where they learnt about various topics in Esperanto.
*'''Late 1970s to early 1980s''' - Paderborn experiment (more details below). Experimental observation of two different groups of students focused on the differences in learning of the two groups.&lt;ref name = paderborn&gt;

*'''1983-1988''' - After Paderborn other experiments compared two different groups of students — for example, in the primary school "Rocca", in San Salvatore di Cogorno (Italy) — with similar results.&lt;ref&gt;Report: Elisabetta FORMAGGIO (Chiavari, Italia), ''Lerneja eksperimento pri lernfacileco kaj transfero en la fremdlingvoinstruado''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiment in University of Paderborn===
Under the supervision of [[Helmar Frank]], a professor at the Institute of Cybernetics of Paderborn, two groups of pupils (A and B), both with German as mother tongue, were created in a primary school.&lt;ref name = paderborn/&gt; The aim was to prove the propaedeutical value of Esperanto for learning English (and in general, any other foreign language).

Group A started to learn English from the third year of study, while group B in the same year started to learn Esperanto (160 hours); group B also started to learn English after two years (i.e., in the fifth year of study). Although group B studied English two years less than group A did, by the seventh year the two groups reached the same level in English, while in the eighth year of school the English level of group B was more advanced than that of group A.

The following table summarizes the Paderborn experiment:
{| class="wikitable"
| Year of study
| Group '''A'''
| Group '''B'''
| English knowledge

|-
| 3
| ENGLISH
| ESPERANTO
| '''A''' reaches a basic level of English, while '''B''' does not know it at all

|-
| 4
| ENGLISH
| ESPERANTO
| '''A''' reaches a basic level of English, while '''B''' does not know it at all

|-
| 5
| ENGLISH

| '''A''' continues to learn English while '''B''' starts to learn it

|-
| 6
| ENGLISH
| ENGLISH
| '''A''' continues to learn English, while '''B''' quickly improves in it

|-
| 7
| ENGLISH
| ENGLISH
| The level of English of '''A''' and '''B''' is the same

|-
| 8
| ENGLISH
| ENGLISH
| '''B''' exceeds '''A''' in English skills, even if '''B''' learnt it for 2 years less
|}

The study demonstrated not only that group B gained linguistic skills with English, but also that group members could use two languages instead of only one. Because all the pupils had a Germanic language (German) as their mother tongue, the help they got from Esperanto was not a result of its greater similarity to English than to German. In addition to cultural gains, the saving of time and resources resulted in an educational saving as well.

==Hypotheses==
{{see also|Psychopedagogy|Esperanto grammar}}
There could be many reasons why this method works, notice also that in the following only Esperanto is mentioned, because this method uses it, but it is likely that another very easy [[planned language]] with similar features could be employed instead.

#Esperanto is extremely regular and transparent. For example, to make the plural form of a word the ending -j is used, and this rule has no exceptions (as, for example, the English ''tooth–teeth'' or the Italian ''ginocchio–ginocchia''). Verbs, adverbs, nouns, and adjectives are marked by a particular ending (e.g., all adjectives end with -a and all nouns with -o); so the difference between these parts of speech is passively learned by the student. When they start learning another language, it is then easier to explain to them what an adjective and a noun is. In addition, Esperanto is an [[agglutinative language]], and this involves the student in active use of the lexicon.
#Teaching this language, that is the ''whole'' grammar of a language in a short time, one helps the students to make a comparison between their mother tongue and Esperanto. This comparison can be used consciously or unconsciously when learning a more complex language. This can be compared to observing a model engine for students who need to learn how a complex engine works (and in addition, Esperanto is a completely working language, not just a simplified language model).
#The grammar is minimal, so children can start using it actively (in speaking and writing) pretty soon. This allows them to keep their initial enthusiasm that is usually lost after the first encounter with a foreign language that needs to be studied for many years before being able to express mere basic sentences. This would give them self-confidence, and when a new language study is started, it is seen as something easily achievable as it was for Esperanto.
#On the other side, a failure in learning a foreign language or the difficulties experienced during the first impact with it (as any other subject) can traumatize the student and reduce their self-confidence in their own language skills. It is possible to create simple sentences since the very first lessons of Esperanto, avoiding this trauma.
#The sooner one can use the language, the sooner the language can be used in meeting foreign people and this stimulates the interest of the student in other cultures and other languages.

Other hypotheses are discussed by [[Claude Piron]] in some of his articles.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://claudepiron.free.fr/articles http://claudepiron.free.fr/articles]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' then scroll down to ''Esperanto'' (articles about Esperanto) then, if desired, further down by language ''(articles about Esperanto in: English, Nederlands &lt;nowiki&gt;[Dutch]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Italiano &lt;nowiki&gt;[Italian]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, etc.)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rotuman''', also referred to as ''Rotunan'', ''Rutuman'' or ''Fäeag Rotuma'', is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] spoken by the indigenous people of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island group of [[Rotuma]], an island with a [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]]-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of [[Fiji]] in 1881. Classification of Rotuman is difficult due to the large number of [[loan word]]s from [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and [[Tongan language|Tongan]], as a result of much cultural exchange over the history of the Pacific. Linguist [[Andrew Pawley]] groups the language with the [[West Fijian languages]] in a West Fijian – Rotuman branch of the Central Pacific sub-group of [[Oceanic languages]].

The Rotuman language has sparked much interest with [[Linguistics|linguists]] because the language uses [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] to invert the ultimate vowel in a word with the immediately preceding consonant, resulting in a vowel system characterized by [[I-mutation|umlaut]], vowel shortening or extending and [[diphthong]]isation.

Unlike its Pacific neighbours, Rotuman is typically considered an [[subject–verb–object|AVO]] (agent–verb–object) language.

Rotuman has no phonemic vowel length and is underlyingly a language of open syllables.  Thus, only consonant + vowel syllables exist in the underlying syllable structure, although phonological processes provide for more variation.  A minimal word constraint that disallows words of less than two moras also alters this underlying representation. Except for words from non-lexical categories, a word like {{IPA|/ka/}} ('tomorrow') is realized as {{IPA|[kaa]}}.  That constraint applies before word compounding (including [[reduplication]] as well): {{IPA|/fu/}} ('[[coral reef]]') + {{IPA|/liʔu/}} ('deep sea') → {{IPA|[fuuˈliʔu]}} ('deep sea pool').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|1994|pp=497–499}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vowels are also lengthened when both final and stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-high vowels are raised when they are followed by a syllable with a high vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|1994|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}} → {{IPA|[e]}}
* {{IPA|/a/}} → {{IPA|[ɔ]}}
* {{IPA|/ɔ/}} → {{IPA|[o]}}

Generally speaking, when {{IPA|/a/}} is followed by {{IPA|/ɛ/}} within a metrical [[foot (prosody)|foot]], it is fronted to {{IPA|[æ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Saito|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of Rotuman morphonology is what could be called the "incomplete" and "complete" phases although they have also been referred to as "long" and "short" forms, "primary" and "secondary" forms, "absolute" and "construct" cases, and "proper and original" and "altered or construct" forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete phase applies to semantically-definite or specific terms.  Otherwise, in normal conversation (excluding song, poetry and chant), the incomplete phase applies to all but the last morpheme of a word and all but the last word of a phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|1994|pp=492–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can lead to syllable-final consonants in the language, which has an underlying all-open syllable system.
* |{{IPA|mafa}}| ('eyes') + |{{IPA|huhu}}| ('take off') → {{IPA|/mafhuhu/}} → {{IPA|[mɔfhuh]}} ('minutely') &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|1994|p=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above table (C indicates any consonant) shows that metathesis and deletion are important parts of incomplete phase formation. The final vowel and the immediately-preceding consonant metathesize from V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;CV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;#, to V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C# where V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is any underlying penultimate vowel, V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is any underlying ultimate vowel, C is any consonant, and # is the word, phrase, or morpheme boundary.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=179–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After metathesis, "V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is deleted if V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not further back than V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and if V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not lower than V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" or if the two vowels are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further processes of elision result in coalescence or spreading of features: back vowels are [[i-mutation|fronted]] before front vowels of equal or greater [[vowel height|height]] ({{IPA|/ɛ/}} and/or {{IPA|/i/}} affect {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and just {{IPA|/i/}} affects {{IPA|/u/}}) before the latter are deleted.
* {{IPA|/u/}} → {{IPA|[y]}}
* {{IPA|[o]}} → {{IPA|[ø~œ]}}

In addition, the {{IPA|/a/}} → {{IPA|[æ]}} rule takes effect again, now outside of the moraic foot, and can occur with a following {{IPA|/i/}} and both {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. Also, {{IPA|/a/}} becomes {{IPA|[ɔ]}} ''after'' a syllable with a high vowel ({{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|1994|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; When V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is higher than V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is devocalized to the corresponding [[semivowel]]; {{IPA|[j]}} for [[front vowel]]s and {{IPA|[w]}} for [[back vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word stress is associated with left-dominant bimoraic feet. The penultimate mora of nonderived words carries the stress.  LOther than the nominalizing suffix |{{IPA|-ŋa}}| and the causative suffix |{{IPA|-ʔaki}}|, stress is assigned before additional morphemes are affixed&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|1994|pp=493–497}}&lt;/ref&gt; and before incomplete phase morphonology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Upon missionary contact, various orthographies abounded on the island of Rotuma. The [[France|French]] [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] devised an orthography based on their own alphabet, and the primarily-English [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Methodist]] preachers developed their own orthography to write in Rotuman. The prevalent one used today is one from the Australian Methodist Reverend C. M. Churchward, whose knowledge of linguistics devised the [[Tongan language|Tongan]] orthography as well. Here is the alphabet, as it appears in Churchward's seminal work, "Rotuman Grammar and Dictionary":
* '''a''' – {{IPA|/a/}}
:*'''ȧ''' or '''ä''' – {{IPA|/a/}}
:*'''ạ''' – {{IPA|/ɔ/}}
* '''e''' – {{IPA|/e/}}
* '''f''' – {{IPA|/f/}}
* '''g''' – {{IPA|/ŋ/}}
* '''h''' – {{IPA|/h/}}
* '''i''' – {{IPA|/i/}}
* '''j''' – {{IPA|/tʃ/}}
* '''k''' – {{IPA|/k/}}
* '''l''' – {{IPA|/l/}}
* '''m''' – {{IPA|/m/}}
* '''n''' – {{IPA|/n/}}
* '''o''' – {{IPA|/ɔ/}}
:*'''ö''' – {{IPA|/ø/}}
* '''p''' – {{IPA|/p/}}
* '''s''' – {{IPA|/s/}}
* '''t''' – {{IPA|/t/}}
* '''u''' – {{IPA|/u/}}
:*'''ü''' – {{IPA|/y/}}
* '''v''' – {{IPA|/v/}}
* '''{{okina}}''' – {{IPA|/ʔ/}} the glottal stop

For the variations to the vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''i'', Churchward's dictionary treats these letters as if no variation between the species occurred within the base letter: the word ''päega'', meaning ''seat'', appears before ''pạri'' meaning ''[[banana]]'', which, in turn, appears before ''pau'', meaning very much.

In addition, there are instances of all original vowels above appearing with a macron, indicating
that they are longer, although vowel length is arguably a phonological process.

Because Churchward's alphabet was created before a sufficient analysis of Rotuman phonology, it is not purely [[phonemic alphabet|phonemic]]. George Milner&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Milner|1971|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a more phonemic spelling without diacritics, which incorporates the understanding of vowel allophony as having to do with metathesis (see above)

This is the Rotuman language version of the [[Lord's Prayer|Lord's prayer]], as found in the translation of the [[Bible]] published in 1975 ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 6:9–13) [https://web.archive.org/web/20000108060729/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-rotuman.html]. It is written using the diacritics of Churchward's orthography:

'''Singularitarianism''' is a [[Social movement|movement]] defined by the belief that a [[technological singularity]]—the creation of [[superintelligence]]—will likely happen in the medium future, and that deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the singularity benefits [[human]]s.&lt;ref name="time immortal" /&gt;

Singularitarians are distinguished from other [[futurist]]s who speculate on a technological singularity by their belief that the singularity is not only possible, but desirable if guided prudently. Accordingly, they might sometimes dedicate their lives to acting in ways they believe will contribute to its rapid yet safe realization.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kurzweil | first = Raymond | title = [[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] | publisher = Viking Adult| year = 2005 | isbn = 0-670-03384-7| oclc = 224517172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine describes the worldview of Singularitarians by saying that "even though it sounds like science fiction, it isn't, no more than a weather forecast is science fiction. It's not a fringe idea; it's a serious hypothesis about the future of life on Earth. There's an intellectual gag reflex that kicks in anytime you try to swallow an idea that involves super-intelligent immortal cyborgs, but... while the Singularity appears to be, on the face of it, preposterous, it's an idea that rewards sober, careful evaluation."&lt;ref name="time immortal"&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2048299,00.html  "2045: The Year Man Becomes Immortal"] Time Magazine, February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term "Singularitarian" was originally defined by [[Extropianism|Extropian]] thinker Mark Plus (Mark Potts) in 1991 to mean "one who believes the concept of a Singularity".{{cn|date=October 2018}} This term has since been redefined to mean "Singularity activist" or "friend of the Singularity"; that is, one who acts so as to bring about the singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Extropy Institute |url=http://www.extropy.org/neologo.htm#s |title=Neologisms of Extropy |publisher=Extropy.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Singularitarianism can also be thought of as an orientation or an outlook that prefers the enhancement of human intelligence as a specific [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] goal instead of focusing on specific technologies such as A.I.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyborg Selves: A Theological Anthropology of the Posthuman|last=Thweatt-Bates|first=Jeanine|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409421412|location=Oxon|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also definitions that identify a singularitarian as an activist or a friend of the concept of singularity, that is, one who acts so as to bring about a singularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co|year=2010|isbn=9780715640159|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources described it as a [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] that advocates deliberate action to bring about and steer the development of a superintelligence that will lead to a theoretical future point that emerges during a time of accelerated change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/tpwiki/Singularitarianism|title=Singularitarianism {{!}} Technoprogressive Wiki|website=ieet.org|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inventor and futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]], author of the 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]]'', defines a Singularitarian as someone "who understands the Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own life"{{cn|date=September 2018}} and estimates [[The Singularity Is Near#2045: The Singularity|the singularity will occur around 2045]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005" /&gt;

==History==
In 1993, [[mathematician]], [[computer scientist]], and [[science fiction]] author [[Vernor Vinge]] hypothesized that the moment might come when technology will allow "creation of entities with greater than human intelligence"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era], by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge.&lt;/ref&gt; and used the term "the Singularity" to describe this moment.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"/&gt; He suggested that the singularity may pose an [[existential risk]] for humanity, and that it could happen through one of four means:

1. The development of computers that are "awake" and superhumanly intelligent. 

2. Large computer networks (and their associated users) may "wake up" as a superhumanly intelligent entity.

3. Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent.

4. Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era], by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Singularitarianism coalesced into a coherent ideology in 2000 when [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] wrote ''The Singularitarian Principles'',&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky1"&gt;[http://www.yudkowsky.net/obsolete/principles.html Singularitarian Principles]"&lt;/ref&gt; in which he stated that a Singularitarian believes that the singularity is a secular, non-mystical event which is possible and beneficial to the world and is worked towards by its adherents.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky1"/&gt; Yudkowsky's conceptualization of singularity offered a broad definition developed to be inclusive of various interpretations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists such as Michael Anissimov who argued for a strict definition, one that refers only to the advocacy of the development of posthuman (greater than human) intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In June 2000 Yudkowsky, with the support of [[Internet entrepreneur]]s Brian Atkins and Sabine Atkins, founded the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] to work towards the creation of self-improving [[Friendly artificial intelligence|Friendly AI]]. MIRI's writings argue for the idea that an AI with the ability to improve upon its own design ([[Intelligence explosion|Seed AI]]) would rapidly lead to [[superintelligence]]. These Singularitarians believe that reaching the singularity swiftly and safely is the best possible way to minimize net [[existential risk]].

Many people believe a technological singularity is possible without adopting Singularitarianism as a moral philosophy. Although the exact numbers are hard to quantify, Singularitarianism is a small movement, which includes [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]]. Inventor and futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]], who predicts that the [[The Singularity Is Near#2045: The Singularity|Singularity will occur circa 2045]], greatly contributed to popularizing Singularitarianism with his 2005 book ''[[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology ]]''.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt;

{{quote|What, then, is the Singularity? It's a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed. Although neither utopian or dystopian, this epoch will transform the concepts we rely on to give meaning to our lives, from our business models to the cycle of human life, including death itself. Understanding the Singularity will alter our perspective on the significance of our past and the ramifications for our future. To truly understand it inherently changes one's view of life in general and one's particular life. I regard someone who understands the Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own life as a "singularitarian."&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"/&gt;}}

With the support of [[NASA]], [[Google]] and a broad range of [[technology forecasting|technology forecasters]] and [[technocapitalism|technocapitalists]], the [[Singularity University]] opened in June 2009 at the [[NASA Research Park]] in [[Silicon Valley]] with the goal of preparing the next generation of leaders to address the challenges of [[accelerating change]].

In July 2009, many prominent Singularitarians participated in a conference organized by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) to discuss the potential impact of [[robot]]s and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard (i.e., [[cybernetic revolt]]). They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They warned that some [[computer viruses]] can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence". They asserted that self-awareness as depicted in [[science fiction]] is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By John Markoff, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts and academics have questioned the use of [[military robot|robots for military combat]], especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the AAAI has commissioned a study to look at this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
There are several objections to Kurzweil's singularitarianism and these even include criticisms from optimists within the A.I. field. For instance, [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argued that Kurweil's predicted achievement of human-level A.I. by 2045 is not viable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science|last=Margolis|first=Eric|last2=Samuels|first2=Richard|last3=Stitch|first3=Stephen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780195309799|location=Oxford|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Gordon Moore]], who is credited for introducing the [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]] that predicated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/science/artificial-intelligence-when-is-the-singularity.html|title=When Is the Singularity?

{{quote|Let's face it. The singularity is a religious rather than a scientific vision. The science-fiction writer Ken MacLeod has dubbed it ”the rapture for nerds,” an allusion to the end-time, when Jesus whisks the faithful to heaven and leaves us sinners behind. Such yearning for transcendence, whether spiritual or technological, is all too understandable. Both as individuals and as a species, we face deadly serious problems, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation, overpopulation, poverty, famine, [[environmental degradation]], [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]], and [[AIDS]]. Engineers and scientists should be helping us face the world's problems and find solutions to them, rather than indulging in escapist, pseudoscientific fantasies like the singularity.&lt;ref name="Horgan 2008"&gt;{{cite paper | last = Horgan | first = John | authorlink = John Horgan (American journalist) | title = The Consciousness Conundrum | year = 2008 | url = http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/imaging/the-consciousness-conundrum/0 | accessdate = 2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kurzweil rejects this categorization, stating that his predictions about the singularity are driven by the data that increases in computational technology have been exponential in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324504704578412581386515510 Will Google's Ray Kurzweil Live Forever?], [[Wall Street Journal]] interview, April 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that critics who challenge his view mistakenly take an intuitive linear view of technological advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyber-Humans: Our Future with Machines|last=Barfield|first=Woodrow|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319250489|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Roy Albert Neale''' (born 9 January 1958) is a British philosopher and specialist in the [[philosophy of language]] who has written extensively about meaning, information, interpretation, and communication, and more generally about issues at the intersection of philosophy and linguistics. Neale is currently Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics and holder of the John H. Kornblith Family Chair in the Philosophy of Science and Values at the Graduate Center, [[City University of New York]] (CUNY).
 
==Education and career==
Neale completed his B. Phil in Linguistics at [[University College London]] working with linguist [[Deirdre Wilson]]. He completed his PhD in Philosophy at [[Stanford University]] with philosopher [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] as his dissertation advisor. 

Prior to joining the CUNY faculty, Neale held positions at [[Princeton University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], and [[Rutgers University]]. 

He is one of the world's leading authorities on [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Descriptions]], on the philosophies of [[Paul Grice]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], and on the intricacies of formal arguments in logic known as [[slingshot argument|slingshots]]. His best known writings are the books ''Descriptions'' (1990) and ''Facing Facts'' (2001), and the articles "Meaning, Grammar, and Indeterminacy" (1987), "Paul Grice and the Philosophy of Language" (1992), "Term  limits" (1993), "No Plagiarism Here!" (2001).

Philosophers of language who have written their PhD dissertations under Neale's supervision include Pierre Baumann ([[University of Puerto Rico]]), [[Herman Cappelen]] ([[University of Oslo]]), Josh Dever ([[University of Texas, Austin]]), Eli Dresner ([[Tel Aviv University]]), Daniel Harris ([[CUNY]]), Angel Pinillos ([[Arizona State University]]), and Elmar Unnsteinsson ([[University College Dublin]]).

==Philosophical work==

Neale's writings are primarily in the philosophy of language, construed broadly enough to intersect with [[generative linguistics]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]], [[philosophical logic]], and [[formal logic]]. A [[Philosophical realism|realist]] (rather than a [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]]) position on [[truth]] runs through his work, although he appears to be agnostic about the explanatory value of appeals to individual facts in philosophical talk about truth. 

Traditional accounts of interpretation are marred, Neale claims, by (1) a failure to engage correctly with the [[epistemological|epistemic]] asymmetry of the situations in which producers and consumers of language find themselves; (2) a consequent failure to distinguish adequately the metaphysical question of what determines what a speaker (or writer) means on a given occasion from the epistemological question of how that particular meaning is identified; (3) a failure to appreciate the severity of constraints on the formation of linguistic intentions; (4) failures to appreciate pervasive forms of underdeterminaton (such as those examined by pragmatists and [[relevance theory|relevance theorists]]); (5) failures to recognise that genuine indeterminacy of the sort associated with what speakers (and writers) ''imply'' incomplete descriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions MIT Press, 1993. (Originally published 1990.) {{ISBN|0-262-64031-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This, That, and the Other. In Descriptions and Beyond. Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 68–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Century Later". 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and on a [[slingshot argument]] originally used by [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref&gt;Facing Facts Oxford University Press, 2002. (Originally published 2001.) {{ISBN|0-19-924715-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neale is an ''[[Intentionality|intentionalist]]'' and a ''[[Pragmatism|pragmatist]]'' about the interpretation of speech and writing, and to this extent his work is rooted firmly in the [[Paul Grice|Gricean]] tradition. While probably a [[W. V. Quine|Quinean]] in his attitude towards indeterminacy in the realm of meaning, Neale is a [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] and a [[Jerry Fodor|Fodorian]] in his stance on what they ''say'' (for example, when they use incomplete definite descriptions); (6) inappropriate reliance on formal notions of context deriving from indexical logics, (7) unwarranted faith in transcendent notions of "what is said", "what is implied" and "what is referred to"; and [[metaphysics]], [[Judicial interpretation|theory of legal interpretation]], and [[literary theory]]. Philosophical problems about interpretation, context, information content, structure, and representation form the nexus of Neale's work. He has vigorously defended Russell's [[Theory of Descriptions]], descriptive theories of [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], Paul Grice's intention-based theory of meaning, and a general approach to meaning and interpretation he calls "linguistic pragmatism". His most influential work to date has been on the underdetermination and indeterminacy associated with uses of so-called attitude towards syntax and mental representation. Aspects of syntactic theory (8) a quite general overestimation of the role traditional compositional semantics can play in explanations of how humans use language to represent the world and communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Linguistic Pragmatism. Oxford University Press. Forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

Neale also wrote an influential defense of [[Saul Kripke]] in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' against charges that Kripke's new theory of reference had plagiarized work by [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/6546412/Neale_Kripke&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylometry is often used to attribute [[authorship]] to [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] or disputed documents. It has legal as well as academic and literary applications, ranging from the question of the [[Shakespeare attribution studies|authorship of Shakespeare's works]] to [[forensic linguistics]].

==History==
Stylometry grew out of earlier techniques of analyzing texts for evidence of authenticity, author identity, and other questions.

The modern practice of the discipline received major impetus from the study of authorship problems in English Renaissance drama. Researchers and readers observed that some playwrights of the era had distinctive patterns of language preferences, and attempted to use those patterns to identify authors in uncertain or collaborative works. Early efforts were not always successful: in 1901, one researcher attempted to use [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] preference for "'em", the contractional form of "them", as a marker to distinguish between Fletcher and [[Philip Massinger]] in their collaborations—but he mistakenly employed an edition of Massinger's works in which the editor had expanded all instances of "'em" to "them".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Schoenbaum]], ''Internal evidence and Elizabethan dramatic authorship; an essay in literary history and method,'' p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basics of stylometry were set out by Polish philosopher [[Wincenty Lutosławski]] in ''Principes de stylométrie'' (1890). Lutosławski used this method to build a chronology of [[Plato's Dialogues]].

The development of computers and their capacities for analyzing large quantities of data enhanced this type of effort by orders of magnitude. The great capacity of computers for data analysis, however, did not guarantee quality output. In the early 1960s, Rev. A. Q. Morton produced a computer analysis of the fourteen Epistles of the New Testament attributed to St. Paul, which showed that six different authors had written that body of work. A check of his method, applied to the works of [[James Joyce]], gave the result that ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Joyce's multi-perspective, multi-style masterpiece, was written by five separate individuals, none of whom apparently had any part in the crafting of Joyce's first novel, ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Schoenbaum]], ''Internal evidence and Elizabethan dramatic authorship; an essay in literary history and method,'' p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, however, and with practice, researchers and scholars have refined their approaches and methods, to yield better results. One notable early success was the resolution of disputed authorship in twelve of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book 
 |author1=F. Mosteller  |author2=D. Wallace
 |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Inference and Disputed Authorship: The Federalist
 | location = [[Reading, MA]]
 | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]
 | year = 1964
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While questions of initial assumptions and methodology still arise (and, perhaps, always will), few now dispute the basic premise that linguistic analysis of written texts can produce valuable information and insight. (Indeed, this was apparent even before the advent of computers: the successful application of a textual/linguistic approach to the Fletcher canon by [[Cyrus Hoy]] and others yielded clear results in the late 1950s and early '60s.)

Applications of stylometry include literary studies, historical studies, social studies, gender studies, and many forensic cases and studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Book|last=Chaski|first=Carole|author-link=Carole Chaski|title=Author Identification in the Forensic Setting|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199572120.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199572120-e-36|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law|language=en|pages=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199572120|location=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199572120.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WechtRago2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIjLBQAAQBAJ|title=Forensic Science and Law: Investigative Applications in Criminal, Civil and Family Justice|author1=Chaski|first=Carole|date=22 December 2005|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=978-1-4200-5811-6|editor-last=Wecht|editor-first=Cyril H.|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Rago|editor-first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be applied to [[code stylometry|computer code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/16/identifying_anonymous_programmers/|title=FYI: AI tools can unmask anonymous coders from their binary executables|last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 16, 2018|work=The Register|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

Modern stylometry draws heavily on the aid of [[computers]] for [[statistical analysis]], [[artificial intelligence]] and access to the growing [[Text corpus|corpus]] of texts available via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="sigirws"&gt; [[Shlomo Argamon|Argamon, Shlomo]], [[Jussi Karlgren]], and [[James G.

== Notable cases ==
Stylometry has been used in a number of high-profile cases. Matthew Jockers used stylometric techniques to analyse the [[Book of Mormon]], concluding that [[Sidney Rigdon]], and not [[Joseph Smith]], was its author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jockers|first=M. L.|last2=Witten|first2=D. M.|last3=Criddle|first3=C. S.|date=2008-09-29|title=Reassessing authorship of the Book of Mormon using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification|url=https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/23/4/465/1039019|journal=Literary and Linguistic Computing|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=465–491|doi=10.1093/llc/fqn040|issn=0268-1145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, a critique by Schaalje et al. of the above paper by Jockers et al. was published in Literary and Linguistic Computing (now Digital Scholarship in the Humanities), showing the Jockers et al. application (using a closed set of candidate authors, rather than an open one) of nearest shrunken centroid (NSC) classification to be misguided. The closed-set method leads to nonsensical results when applied to other authorship attribution problems, as the Schaalje et al. paper shows. Schaalje and colleagues produced results from an open-set NSC method showing that Sidney Rigdon was a very unlikely author—a result that comports with documented history that Rigdon and Smith did not even know each other in 1829 or early 1830, when the Book of Mormon was dictated and published, making it manifestly impossible for Rigdon to have been the author.

==Academic venues and events==

Stylometric methods are discussed in several academic fields, mostly as a tangential field of application as with machine learning, natural language processing, and lexicography.
===Forensic linguistics===
The [[International Association of Forensic Linguists]] (IAFL) organises the [[Biennial Conference of the International Association of Forensic Linguists]] (13th edition in 2016 in [[Porto]]) and publishes ''[[The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law]]'' with [[forensic stylistics]] as one of its central topics.

===AAAI===
The [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) has hosted several events on subjective and stylistic analysis of text.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yan Qu]], [[James Shanahan]], and [[Janyce Wiebe]]. "Exploring attitude and affect in text: Theories and applications." AAAI Spring Symposium Technical report SS-04-07. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jussi Karlgren]], [[Björn Gambäck]], and [[Pentti Kanerva]]. "Acquiring (and Using) Linguistic (and World) Knowledge for Information Access." (2002). AAAI Spring Symposium. Technical report SS-02-09. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shlomo Argamon]], [[Shlomo Dubnov]], and [[Julie Jupp]]. "Style and Meaning in Language, Art, Music, and Design" (2004). AAAI Fall Symposium. Technical report FS-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PAN===
PAN workshops (originally, plagiarism analysis, authorship identification, and near-duplicate detection, later more generally workshop on uncovering plagiarism, authorship, and social software misuse)  organised since 2007 mainly in conjunction with information access conferences such as ACM [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval|SIGIR]], [[Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation|FIRE]], and [[Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum|CLEF]]. PAN formulates shared challenge tasks for plagiarism detection,&lt;ref&gt;Potthast, Martin, Benno Stein, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, and Paolo Rosso. "An evaluation framework for plagiarism detection."

In CLEF (Notebook Papers/LABs/Workshops). 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and other related text analysis tasks, many of which hinge on stylometry.

==Case studies of interest==
# Around 1370 to 1070 BC, as recorded in the [[Book of Judges]], one tribe identified members of another tribe in order to kill them by asking them to say the word ''[[Shibboleth]]'' which in the dialect of the intended victims sounded like "sibboleth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Judges|12:5–6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# In 1439, [[Lorenzo Valla]] showed that the [[Donation of Constantine]] was a [[forgery]], an argument based partly on a comparison of the [[Latin]] with that used in authentic 4th-century documents.
# In 1952, the Swedish bishop [[Dick Helander]] was elected bishop of [[Strängnäs]]. The campaign was competitive and Helander was accused of writing a series of a hundred-some anonymous libelous letters about other candidates to the electorate of the bishopric of Strängnäs. Helander was first convicted of writing the letters and lost his position as bishop but later partially exonerated. The letters were studied using a number of stylometric measures (and also typewriter characteristics) and the various court cases and further examinations, many contracted by Helander himself during the years up to his death in 1978 discussed stylometric methodology and its value as evidence in some detail.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;Text processing text analysis and generation – text typology and attribution.

# In 2017, a group of linguists, computer scientists, and scholars analysed the authoship of [[Elena Ferrante]].  Based on a corpus created at [[University of Padua]] containing 150 novels written by 40 authors, they analyzed Ferrante's style based on seven of her novels.  They were able to compare her writing style with 39 other novelists using, for example, stylo.&lt;ref name="styloR"/&gt;  The conclusion was the same for all of them:  [[Domenico Starnone]] is the secret hand behind Elena Ferrante.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Savoy.

# In 2018, [[Mark Glickman]], senior lecturer in statistics at Harvard University worked with Ryan Song, a former statistics student at Harvard, and Jason Brown, a professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, applied stylometry to find that, most likely, [[The Beatles]]' song "[[In My Life]]" was composed by John Lennon, but with a 50% chance that Paul McCartney wrote the middle eighth.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Reuell. "You say John, I say Paul. But what does stylometry say?". https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/09/harvard-statistician-examines-beatles-mystery/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data and methods==
Since stylometry has both descriptive use cases, used to characterise the content of a collection, and identificatory use cases, e.g. identifying authors or categories of texts, the methods used to analyse the data and features above range from those built to classify items into sets or to distribute items in a space of feature variation. Most methods are statistical in nature, such as [[cluster analysis]] and [[discriminant analysis]], are typically based on [[philological]] data and features, and are fruitful application domains for modern [[machine learning]] approaches. 

Whereas in the past, stylometry emphasized the rarest or most striking elements of a text, contemporary techniques can isolate identifying patterns even in common parts of speech. Most systems are based on lexical statistics, i.e. using the frequencies of words and terms in the text to characterise the text (or its author). In this context, unlike in [[information retrieval]], the observed occurrence patterns of the [[Most common words in English|most common words]] are more interesting than the topical terms which are less frequent.&lt;ref name="biber"&gt;[[Douglas Biber|Biber, Douglas]]. Variation across speech and writing. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karlgrencutting"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karlgren|first1=Jussi|author-link1=Jussi Karlgren|last2=Cutting|first2=Douglass|author-link2=Doug Cutting|title=Recognizing Text Genres with Simple Metrics Using Discriminant Analysis|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary stylometric method is the [[writer invariant]]: a property held in common by all texts, or at least all texts long enough to admit of analysis yielding statistically significant results, written by a given author. An example of a writer invariant is frequency of [[function word]]s used by the writer.

In one such method, the text is analyzed to find the 50 most common words. The text is then broken into 5,000 word chunks and each of the chunks is analyzed to find the frequency of those 50 words in that chunk. This generates a unique 50-number identifier for each chunk. These numbers place each chunk of text into a point in a 50-dimensional space. This 50-dimensional space is flattened into a plane using [[principal components analysis]] (PCA). This results in a display of points that correspond to an author's style. If two literary works are placed on the same plane, the resulting pattern may show if both works were by the same author or different authors.

===Neural networks===
[[Neural network]]s, a special case of statistical machine learning methods, have been used to analyze authorship of texts. Text of undisputed authorship are used to train the neural network through processes such as [[backpropagation]], where training error is calculated and used to update the process to increase accuracy. Through a process akin to non-linear regression, the network gains the ability to generalize its recognition ability to new texts to which it has not yet been exposed, classifying them to a stated degree of confidence. Such techniques were applied to the long-standing claims of collaboration of [[Shakespeare]] with his contemporaries Fletcher and [[Christopher Marlowe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/4/203.abstract] ''Neural Computation in Stylometry I: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Fletcher'' Matthews RAJ &amp; Merriam TVN ''Lit Linguist Computing'' (1993) '''8''' (4): 203–209.
doi: 10.1093/llc/8.4.203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/1/1.abstract]''Neural Computation in Stylometry II: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Marlowe'' Merriam TVN &amp; Matthews RAJ ''Lit Linguist Computing'' (1994) 9 (1): 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the view, based on more conventional scholarship, that such collaboration had indeed taken place. 
 
A 1999 study showed that a neural network program reached 70% accuracy in determining authorship of poems it had not yet analyzed. This study from Vrije Universiteit examined identification of poems by three Dutch authors using only letter sequences such as "den".&lt;ref name="oxfordjournalsllc"&gt;{{cite web|author=JF HoornZ|author2=SL Frank|author3=W Kowalczyk|author4=F van der Ham |url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/3/311.abstract |title=Neural network identification of poets using letter sequences |publisher=Llc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study used [[deep belief network]]s (DBN) for authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication (CA).&lt;ref name="BROC2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brocardo | first1 = ML | last2 = Traore | first2 = I | last3 = Woungang | first3 = I | last4 = Obaidat | first4 = MS | year = 2017 | title = Authorship verification using deep belief network systems | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3259/full | journal = Int J Commun Syst. | volume =  30| issue = | page =  e3259| doi = 10.1002/dac.3259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with this method of analysis is that the network can become biased based on its training set, possibly selecting authors the network has more often analyzed.&lt;ref name="oxfordjournalsllc"/&gt;

===Genetic algorithms===
The [[genetic algorithm]] is another machine learning technique used in stylometry. This involves a method that starts out with a set of rules. An example rule might be, "If ''but'' appears more than 1.7 times in every thousand words, then the text is author X". The program is presented with text and uses the rules to determine authorship. The rules are tested against a set of known texts and each rule is given a fitness score. The 50 rules with the lowest scores are thrown out. The remaining 50 rules are given small changes and 50 new rules are introduced. This is repeated until the evolved rules correctly attribute the texts.

===Rare pairs===
One method for identifying style is called "rare pairs", and relies upon individual habits of [[collocation]]. The use of certain words may, for a particular author, idiosyncratically entail the use of other, predictable words.

==Authorship attribution in instant messaging==
The diffusion of Internet has shifted the authorship attribution attention towards online texts (web pages, blogs, etc.) electronic messages (e-mails, tweets, posts, etc.), and other types of written information that are far shorter than an average book, much less formal and more diverse in terms of expressive elements such as colors, layout, fonts, graphics, emoticons, etc. Efforts to take into account such aspects at the level of both structure and syntax were reported in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mining e-Mail Content for Author Identification Forensics|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/604264.604272|journal = SIGMOD Rec.|date = 2001-12-01|issn = 0163-5808|pages = 55–64|volume = 30|issue = 4|doi = 10.1145/604264.604272|first = O.|last = de Vel|first2 = A.|last2 = Anderson|first3 = M.|last3 = Corney|first4 = G.|last4 = Mohay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, content-specific and idiosyncratic cues (e.g., topic models and grammar checking tools) were introduced to unveil deliberate stylistic choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Automatically Profiling the Author of an Anonymous Text|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1461928.1461959|journal = Commun.

Standard stylometric features have been employed to categorize the content of a chat over [[instant messaging]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Classification of Instant Messaging Communications for Forensics Analysis – TechRepublic|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/classification-of-instant-messaging-communications-for-forensics-analysis/|website = TechRepublic|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the behavior of the participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can online behavior unveil deceivers? – an exploratory investigation of deception in instant messaging|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1265079&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications&amp;sortType%253Dasc_p_Sequence%2526filter%253DAND(p_IS_Number%253A28293)%2526rowsPerPage%253D75|journal = Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004|date = 2004-01-01|pages = 9 pp.–|doi = 10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265079|first = L.|last = Zhou|first2 = Dongsong|last2 = Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; but attempts of identifying chat participants are still few and early. Furthermore, the similarity between spoken conversations and chat interactions has been neglected while being a key difference between chat data and any other type of written information.

The '''symbol grounding problem''' is related to the problem of how [[word]]s  ([[symbol]]s) get their [[Meaning (psychology)|meanings]], and hence to the problem of what meaning itself really is. The problem of meaning is in turn related to the problem of [[consciousness]], or how it is that [[mental state]]s are meaningful.

==Background==

===Referents===
[[Gottlob Frege]] distinguished a referent (the thing that a word refers to) and the word's meaning. This is most clearly illustrated using the proper names of concrete individuals, but it is also true of names of kinds of things and of abstract properties: (1) "Tony Blair", (2) "the prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", and (3) "Cherie Blair's husband" all have the same referent, but not the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Although this article draws in places upon Frege's view of semantics,  it is very anti-Fregean in stance. Frege was a fierce critic of psychological accounts that attempt to explain meaning in terms of mental states.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the meaning of a (referring) word is the rule or features that one must use in order to successfully pick out its referent. In that respect, (2) and (3) come closer to wearing their meanings on their sleeves, because they are explicitly stating a rule for picking out their referents: "Find whoever was prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", or "find whoever is Cherie's current husband". But that does not settle the matter, because there's still the problem of the meaning of the components of that rule ("UK," "during", "current", "PM", "Cherie", "husband"), and how to pick ''them'' out.

The phrase "Tony Blair" (or better still, just "Tony") does not have this recursive component problem, because it points straight to its referent, but how? If the meaning is the rule for picking out the referent, what is that rule, when we come down to non-decomposable components like proper names of individuals (or names of ''kinds'', as in "an unmarried man" is a "bachelor")?

===Referential process===

Humans are able to pick out the intended referents of words{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, such as "Tony Blair" or "bachelor," but this process need not be explicit.  It is probably an unreasonable expectation to know the explicit [[Philosophical Investigations#Rules|rule]] for picking out the intended referents{{why|date=October 2016}}.

So if we take a word's meaning to be the means of picking out its referent, then meanings are in our brains. That is meaning in the ''narrow'' sense. If we use "meaning" in a ''wider'' sense, then we may want to say that meanings include both the referents themselves and the means of picking them out. So if a word (say, "Tony-Blair") is located inside an entity (e.g., oneself) that can use the word and pick out its referent, then the word's wide meaning consists of both the means that that entity uses to pick out its referent, and the referent itself: a wide causal nexus between (1) a head, (2) a word inside it, (3) an object outside it, and (4) whatever "processing" is required in order to successfully connect the inner word to the outer object.

But what if the "entity" in which a word is located is not a head but a piece of paper (or a computer screen)? What is its meaning then? Surely all the (referring) words on this screen, for example, have meanings, just as they have referents.

In the 19th century, the semiotician [[Charles Saunders Peirce]] suggested what some think is a similar model: according to his triadic sign model, meaning requires (1) an interpreter, (2) a sign or representamen, (3) an object, and is (4) the virtual product of an endless regress and progress called [[Semiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles S. The philosophy of Peirce: selected writings. New York: AMS Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have interpreted Peirce as addressing the problem of grounding, feelings, and intentionality for the understanding of semiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Semeiosis and Intentionality T. L. Short Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Vol. 17, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 197-223&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Peirce's theory of signs has been rediscovered by an increasing number of artificial intelligence researchers in the context of symbol grounding problem.&lt;ref&gt;C.S.

=== Grounding process ===

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

There would be no connection at all between written symbols and any intended referents if there were no minds mediating those intentions, via their own internal means of picking out those intended referents.

So the meaning of a word on a page is "ungrounded."&lt;ref&gt;Or, "imputed" as read below the dotted baseline of the [[triangle of reference]] since 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor would looking it up in a dictionary help: If one tried to look up the meaning of a word one did not understand in a [[dictionary]] of a language one did not already understand, one would just cycle endlessly from one meaningless definition to another. One's search for meaning would be ungrounded.

In contrast, the meaning of the words in one's head—those words one ''does'' understand—are "grounded"{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. That mental grounding of the meanings of words mediates between the words on any external page one reads (and understands) and the external objects to which those words refer.&lt;ref&gt;This is the [[causal theory of reference|causal]], [[contextual theory of reference]] that [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] &amp; [[I. A. Richards|Richards]] packed in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[semantic externalism]] as claimed in "The Meaning of 'Meaning'" of ''Mind, Language and Reality'' (1975) by [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] who argues: "Meanings just ain't in the head." Now he and [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] seem to favor [[anti-realism]] in favor of [[intuitionism]], [[psychologism]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] and [[contextualism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for symbol grounding===

Another symbol system is [[natural language]] (Fodor 1975). On paper or in a computer, language, too, is just a formal symbol system, manipulable by rules based on the arbitrary shapes of words. But in the brain, meaningless strings of squiggles become meaningful thoughts. Harnad has suggested two properties that might be required to make this difference:

*capacity to pick referents
*consciousness

====Capacity to pick out referents====
One property that static paper or, usually, even a dynamic computer lack that the brain possesses is the capacity to pick out symbols' referents. This is what we were discussing earlier, and it is what the hitherto undefined term "grounding" refers to. A symbol system alone, whether static or dynamic, cannot have this capacity (any more than a book can), because picking out referents is not just a computational (implementation-independent) property; it is a dynamical (implementation-dependent) property.

To be grounded, the symbol system would have to be augmented with nonsymbolic, sensorimotor capacities—the capacity to interact autonomously with that world of objects, events, actions, properties and states that its symbols are systematically interpretable (by us) as referring to. It would have to be able to pick out the referents of its symbols, and its sensorimotor interactions with the world would have to fit coherently with the symbols' interpretations.

The symbols, in other words, need to be connected directly to (i.e., grounded in) their referents; the connection must not be dependent only on the connections made by the brains of external interpreters like us. Just the symbol system alone, without this capacity for direct grounding, is not a viable candidate for being whatever it is that is really going on in our brains when we think meaningful thoughts (Cangelosi &amp; Harnad 2001).

Meaning as the ability to recognize instances (of objects) or perform actions is specifically treated in the paradigm called "Procedural Semantics", described in a number of papers including "Procedural Semantics" by Philip N.  Johnson-Laird &lt;ref&gt;Philip N.  Johnson-Laird  "Procedural Semantics" (Cognition, 5  (1977) 189; see http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/mindsandmachines/Papers/procedural.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded by William A. Woods in "Meaning and Links".&lt;ref&gt;William A. Woods. "Meaning and Links" (AI Magazine Volume 28 Number 4 (2007); see http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2069/2056)&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief summary in Woods' paper reads: "The idea of procedural semantics is that the semantics of natural language sentences can be characterized in a formalism whose meanings are defined by abstract procedures that a computer (or a person) can either execute or reason about. In this theory the meaning of a noun is a procedure for recognizing or generating instances, the meaning of a proposition is a procedure for determining if it is true or false, and the meaning of an action is the ability to do the action or to tell if it has been done."

====Consciousness====
The necessity of groundedness, in other words, takes us from the level of the pen-pal [[Turing test]], which is purely symbolic (computational), to the robotic Turing test, which is hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor (Harnad 2000, 2007). Meaning is grounded in the robotic capacity to detect, categorize, identify, and act upon the things that words and sentences refer to (see entries for [[Affordance]] and for [[Categorical perception]]). On the other hand, if the symbols (words and sentences) refer to the very bits of '0' and '1', directly connected to their electronic implementations, which a (any?) computer system can readily manipulate (thus detect, categorize, identify and act upon), then even non-robotic computer systems could be said to be "sensorimotor" and hence able to "ground" symbols in this narrow domain. 

To categorize is to do the right thing with the right ''kind'' of thing. The categorizer must be able to detect the sensorimotor features of the members of the category that reliably distinguish them from the nonmembers. These feature-detectors must either be inborn or learned. The learning can be based on trial and error induction, guided by feedback from the consequences of correct and incorrect categorization; or, in our own linguistic species, the learning can also be based on verbal descriptions or definitions. The description or definition of a new category, however, can only convey the category and ground its name if the words in the definition are themselves already grounded category names (Blondin-Massé et al. 2008). So ultimately grounding has to be sensorimotor, to avoid infinite regress (Harnad 2005).

But if groundedness is a necessary condition for meaning, is it a sufficient one? Not necessarily, for it is possible that even a robot that could pass the Turing test, "living" amongst the rest of us indistinguishably for a lifetime, would fail to have in its head what Searle has in his: It could be a [[Philosophical zombie|zombie]], with no one home, feeling feelings, meaning meanings (Harnad 1995). However, it is possible that different interpreters (including different intelligent species of animals) would have different mechanisms for producing meaning in their systems, thus one cannot require that a system different from a human "experiences" meaning in the same way that a human does, and vice-versa. 

Harnad thus points at consciousness as a second property. The problem of discovering the causal mechanism for successfully picking out the referent of a category name can in principle be solved by cognitive science. But the problem of explaining how consciousness could play an "independent" role in doing so is probably insoluble, except on pain of [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Perhaps symbol grounding (i.e., robotic TT capacity) is enough to ensure that conscious meaning is present, but then again, perhaps not. In either case, there is no way we can hope to be any the wiser—and that is Turing's methodological point (Harnad 2001b, 2003, 2006).

==Formulation==
To answer this question we have to formulate the symbol grounding problem itself [http://cogprints.org/3106/ (Harnad 1990)]:

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

==Functionalism==

There is a school of thought according to which the computer is more like the brain—or rather, the brain is more like the computer: According to this view (called "[[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]]", a variety of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]), the future theory explaining how the brain picks out its referents (the theory that cognitive neuroscience may eventually arrive at) will be a purely computational one (Pylyshyn 1984). A computational theory is a theory at the software level. It is essentially a computer algorithm: a set of rules for manipulating symbols. And the algorithm is "implementation-independent." That means that whatever it is that an algorithm is doing, it will do the same thing no matter what hardware it is executed on. The physical details of the [[dynamical system]] implementing the computation are irrelevant to the computation itself, which is purely formal; any hardware that can run the computation will do, and all physical implementations of that particular computer algorithm are equivalent, computationally.

A computer can execute any computation. Hence once computationalism finds a proper computer algorithm, one that our brain could be running when there is meaning transpiring in our heads, meaning will be transpiring in that computer too, when it implements that algorithm.

How would we know that we have a proper computer algorithm? It would have to be able to pass the [[Turing test]]. That means it would have to be capable of corresponding with any human being as a pen-pal, for a lifetime, without ever being in any way distinguishable from a real human pen-pal.

==Searle's Chinese room argument==
{{main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] formulated the "[[Chinese room]] argument" in order to disprove computationalism{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. The Chinese room argument is based on a thought experiment: in it, Searle stated that if the Turing test were conducted in Chinese, then he himself, Searle (who does not understand Chinese), could execute a program that implements the same algorithm that the computer was using without knowing what any of the words he was manipulating meant. 

At first glance, it would seem that if there's no meaning going on inside Searle's head when he is implementing that program, then there's no meaning going on inside the computer when it is the one implementing the algorithm either, computation being implementation-independent. But on a closer look, for a person to execute the same program that a computer would, at very least it would  have to have access to a similar bank of memory that the computer has (most likely externally stored). This means that the new computational system that executes the same algorithm is no longer just Searle's original head, but that plus the memory bank (and possibly other devices). 
In particular, this additional memory could store a digital representation of the intended referent of different words (like images, sounds, even video sequences), that the algorithm would use as a model of, and to derive features assotiated with, the intended referent. The "meaning" then is not to be searched in just Searle's original brain, but in the overall system needed to process the algorithm. (Just like when Searle is reading English words, the meaning is not to be located in isolated logical processing areas of the brain, but probably in the overall brain, likely including specific long-term memory areas). 
Thus, Searle's not perceiving any meaning in his head alone when simulating the work of a computer, does not imply lack of meaning in the overall system, and thus in the actual computer system passing an advanced Turing test.

=== Implications ===
How does Searle know that there is no meaning going on in his head when he is executing such a Turing-test-passing program? Exactly the same way he knows whether there is or is not meaning going on inside his head under any other conditions: He ''understands'' the words of English, whereas the Chinese symbols that he is manipulating according to the algorithm's rules mean nothing whatsoever to him (and there is no one else in his head for them to mean anything to). However, the complete system that is manipulating those Chinese symbols - which is not just Searle's brain, as explained in the previous section - may have the ability to extract meaning from those symbols, in the sense of being able to use  internal (memory) models of the intended referents, pick out the intended referents of those symbols, and generally identifying and using their features appropriately.

Note that in pointing out that the Chinese words would be meaningless to him under those conditions, Searle has appealed to consciousness. Otherwise one could argue that there ''would'' be meaning going on in Searle's  head under those conditions, but that Searle himself would simply not be conscious of it. That is called the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/#4.1 "Systems Reply"] to Searle's Chinese Room Argument, and Searle [http://cogprints.org/4023/ rejects] the Systems Reply as being merely a reiteration, in the face of negative evidence, of the very thesis (computationalism) that is on trial in his thought-experiment: "Are words in a running computation like the ungrounded words on a page, meaningless without the mediation of brains, or are they like the grounded words in brains?"

In this either/or question, the (still undefined) word "ungrounded" has implicitly relied on the difference between inert words on a page and consciously meaningful words in our heads. And Searle is asserting that under these conditions (the Chinese Turing test), the words in his head would not be consciously meaningful, hence they would still be as ungrounded as the inert words on a page.

So if Searle is right, that (1) both the words on a page and those in any running computer program (including a Turing-test-passing computer program) are meaningless in and of themselves, and hence that (2) whatever it is that the brain is doing to generate meaning can't be just implementation-independent computation, then what ''is'' the brain doing to generate meaning [http://cogprints.org/4023/ (Harnad 2001a)]?

==Brentano's notion of intentionality==
"[[Intentionality]]" has been called the "mark of the mental" because of some observations by the philosopher [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] to the effect that mental states always have an inherent, intended (mental) object or content toward which they are "directed": One sees something, wants something, believes something, desires something, understands something, means something etc., and that object is always something that one has ''in mind''. Having a mental object is part of having anything in mind. Hence it is the mark of the mental. There are no "free-floating" mental states that do not also have a mental object. Even hallucinations and imaginings have an object, and even feeling depressed feels like something. Nor is the object the "external" physical object, when there is one. One may see a real chair, but the "intentional" object of one's "intentional state" is the mental chair one has in mind. (Yet another term for intentionality has been "aboutness" or "representationality": thoughts are always ''about'' something; they are (mental) "representations" ''of''  something; but that something is what it is that the thinker has in mind, not whatever external object may or may not correspond to it.)

If this all sounds like skating over the surface of a problem rather than a real break-through, then the foregoing description has had its intended effect: No, the problem of intentionality is not the symbol grounding problem; nor is grounding symbols the solution to the problem of intentionality. The symbols inside an autonomous dynamical symbol system that is able to pass the robotic Turing test are grounded, in that, unlike in the case of an ungrounded symbol system, they do not depend on the mediation of the mind of an external interpreter to connect them to the external objects that they are interpretable (by the interpreter) as being "about"; the connection is autonomous, direct, and unmediated. But ''grounding is not meaning''. Grounding is an input/output performance function. Grounding connects the sensory inputs from external objects to internal symbols and states occurring within an autonomous sensorimotor system, guiding the system's resulting processing and output.

Meaning, in contrast, is something mental. But to try to put a halt to the name-game of proliferating nonexplanatory synonyms for the mind/body problem without solving it (or, worse, implying that there is more than one mind/body problem), let us cite just one more thing that requires no further explication: ''feeling''. The only thing that distinguishes an internal state that merely has grounding from one that has meaning is that it ''feels like something'' to be in the meaning state, whereas it does not feel like anything to be in the merely grounded functional state. Grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter. And that is the real source of Brentano's vexed peekaboo relation between "intentionality" and its internal "intentional object":  All mental states, in addition to being the functional states of an autonomous dynamical system, are also feeling states: Feelings are not merely "functed," as all other physical states are; feelings are also felt.

Hence feeling ([[sentience]]) is the real mark of the mental. But the symbol grounding problem is not the same as the mind/body problem, let alone a solution to it. The mind/body problem is actually the feeling/function problem: Symbol-grounding touches only its functional component.  This does not detract from the importance of the symbol grounding problem, but just reflects that it is a keystone piece to the bigger puzzle called the mind.

The neuroscientist [[Antonio Damasio]] investigates this marking function of feelings and emotions in his [[Somatic marker hypothesis]]. Damasio adds the notion of biologic [[homeostasis]] to this discussion, presenting it as an automated bodily regulation process providing intentionality to a mind via emotions. Homeostasis is the mechanism that keeps all bodily processes in healthy balance. All of our actions and perceptions will be automatically "evaluated" by our body hardware according to their contribution to homeostasis. This gives us an implicit orientation on how to survive. Such bodily or somatic evaluations can come to our mind in the form of conscious and non-conscious feelings ("gut feelings") and lead our decision-making process. The meaning of a word can be roughly conceptualized as the sum of its associations and their expected contribution to homeostasis, where associations are reconstructions of sensomotor perceptions that appeared in contiguity with the word. Yet, the Somatic marker hypothesis is still hotly debated and critics claim that it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. The recurrent question that the Somatic marker hypothesis does not address remains: how and why does homeostasis (as in any [[servomechanism]] such as a thermostat and furnace) become ''felt'' homeostasis?

[[File:CompletePlainWords5thImpresson1958.jpg|Cover of original version of ''The Complete Plain Words'' (fifth impression, 1958)|thumb]]

'''''The Complete Plain Words''''', titled simply '''''Plain Words''''' in its 2014 revision, is a [[style guide]] written by [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]], published in 1954. It has never been out of print. It comprises expanded and revised versions of two pamphlets that he wrote at the request of [[HM Treasury]], ''Plain Words'' (1948) and ''ABC of Plain Words'' (1951). The aim of the book is to help officials in their use of English as a tool of their trade. To keep the work relevant for readers in subsequent decades it has been revised by [[Bruce Fraser (civil servant)|Sir Bruce Fraser]] in 1973, by [[Sidney Greenbaum]] and Janet Whitcut in 1986, and by the original author's great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers in 2014.

All the editions until that of 2014 were published by [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office|Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO)]]. The most recent is issued by an imprint of [[Penguin Books]].

==Background==
The association of wordiness with bureaucracy has a long history. In the 14th century [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], a prominent civil servant as well as a poet, urged the use of straightforward writing.{{#tag:ref|In ''[[The House of Fame]]'' (c. 1380) Chaucer wrote:
:Have I not preved thus simply,
:Withouten any subtiltee
:Of speche, or gret prolixitee
:Of termes of philosophye,

[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45027/45027-h/45027-h.htm ''The House of Fame''], lines 854–864&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Reviewing ''Plain Words'' in 1948, ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' quoted the French revolutionary [[Martial Joseph Armand Herman|Martial Herman]] writing in 1794:
{{quote|The nonsensical jargon of the old Ministries must be replaced by a simple style, clear and yet concise, free from expressions of servility, from obsequious formulae, stand-offishness, pedantry, or any suggestion that there is an authority superior to that of reason, or of the order established by law.

The British civil service of the 19th and early 20th centuries had a reputation for pomposity and long-windedness in its written communications. In ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' in the mid-1850s, [[Charles Dickens]] caricatured officialdom as the "Circumlocution Office", where for even the most urgent matter nothing could be done without "half a score of boards, half a bushel of minutes, several sacks of official memoranda, and a family-vault full of ungrammatical correspondence."&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s the term "officialese" was in use, defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as, "The formal and typically verbose language considered characteristic of officials or official documents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/130657?redirectedFrom=officialese#eid "officialese"], Oxford English Dictionary, retrieved 5 April 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ernest-Gowers-1920.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ernest Gowers]] in 1920]]
[[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]], a senior civil servant, was among those who wished to see officialese replaced by normal English. In 1929 he remarked in a speech about the civil service, "It is said{{nbsp}}... that we revel in jargon and obscurity".&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in Gowers (2014), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, with the role of government greatly expanded, official communications proliferated, and in Gowers's{{#tag:ref|Gowers was not dogmatic about the possessive form of names such as his that end in "s", but he described the form "Jones's room" as "the most favoured practice" as opposed to "Jones' room".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In her biography of Gowers, his granddaughter Ann Scott uses the form "Gowers' room"; in the extensive biographical sketch that prefaces the 2014 edition of ''Plain Words'', his great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers uses "Gowers's room".&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''passim'' and Gowers (2014), pp. vii–xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1973 revised edition came out, Bruce Fraser was criticised for referring to "Gowers' work", rather than "Gowers's work". To an amateur grammarian who objected, he replied, "No one can deny that what you say is entirely logical and sensible",&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Michael, "Harris harries the 'S'-droppers", ''The Guardian'', 3 August 1973, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; but he retained the shorter form in reprints of the edition, and it was preserved in the Greenbaum and Whitcut edition of 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1973), p. iii; and Gowers (1986), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} view were full of "mistiness and grandiloquence". He called for a new style of official writing, friendly in tone and easy to understand.&lt;ref name=gxii&gt;Gowers (2014), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; His views came to the notice of the head of the civil service, [[Edward Bridges, 1st Baron Bridges|Sir Edward Bridges]], permanent secretary to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. After Gowers retired from the civil service at the end of the war,{{#tag:ref|Gowers's public service career continued as chairman of several [[Royal Commission]]s and other bodies until 1953, and on the board of the National Hospitals for Nervous Diseases until 1957.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U55846 "Gowers, Sir Ernest Arthur"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, retrieved 5 April 2014 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Bridges asked him to write a short pamphlet on good writing, for the benefit of the new generation of officials.&lt;ref name=gxii/&gt; Bridges called on his senior colleagues throughout the civil service to cooperate; some had already made efforts in the same cause, including the [[Inland Revenue]], whose advice to staff included "one golden rule to bear in mind always: that we should try to put ourselves in the position of our correspondent, to imagine his feelings as he writes his letters, and to gauge his reaction as he receives ours."&lt;ref name=timespw&gt;"Plain Words", ''The Times'', 15 April 1948, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This use of "he" to indicate readers of both sexes was customary at the time, and was used in the original ''Plain Words'' and its successors until the 1986 revision.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five years after the first ''Plain Words'', David Hunt, reviewing the 1973 edition, wrote, "No writer of English at any level, from the most elaborate to the most utilitarian, can fail to derive profit from this book. He could [profit] for example, by studying Sir Bruce's instructions on how to arrange his thoughts before starting to write."&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;|group= n}}

Government departments sent Gowers many examples of officialese so extreme as to be amusing; a small committee of senior officials formed to help him and comment on his proposals. The colleague on whom Gowers most relied was [[Llewelyn Wyn Griffith]] of the Inland Revenue, whose contribution Gowers acknowledged in the prefaces to ''Plain Words'' and its two successors.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1954), p. iv&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Plain Words'', 1948==
The result of Gowers's work was ''Plain Words'', a 94-page booklet. It was judged successful by the civil service, and the Treasury considered that it should be made publicly available. Had Gowers written it as part of his duties while still a civil servant it would have automatically been [[Crown Copyright]], but as he had not begun it until after his retirement he owned the rights. The Treasury offered a flat fee of £500, but he successfully held out for a royalty on every copy sold.&lt;ref name=gxii/&gt; The government publisher, [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office|His Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO), issued the booklet for sale in April 1948. It was priced at two shillings (10 pence in British decimal currency); between April and Christmas 1948 it sold more than 150,000 copies and had to be reprinted seven times.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers responded favourably. ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', praised the book and engaged in a little mock-officialese of its own: "It deserves to be a 'best seller' (or perhaps we should say that in all the circumstances it may reasonably be anticipated that it will be found to evoke a relatively considerable demand on the part of the general public)."&lt;ref&gt;"Plain Speaking", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 May 1948, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' devoted a [[Editorial|leader]] to the work, and concluded, "for all its cool urbanity ''Plain Words'' is written with missionary zeal".&lt;ref name=timespw/&gt; ''The Manchester Guardian'' considered that by commissioning ''Plain Words'' from Gowers "the Treasury has put us all in its debt."&lt;ref name=mgpw/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' commented, "The Stationery Office must have enjoyed publishing this book. It is great fun to read".&lt;ref&gt;"What Do You Mean", ''The Economist'', 24 April 1948, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally Gowers's humour misled literal-minded reviewers. ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', [[Harold Nicolson]] and the grammarian [[George Henry Vallins|G H Vallins]] objected to the conspicuously un-plain words of Gowers's opening sentences:&lt;ref&gt;Vallins, p. 149; and Gowers (2014), p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The purpose of this book is to help officials in their use of written English. To some of them this may seem a work of supererogation, calculated only to place an unnecessary burden on a body of people already overburdened.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1948), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;|}}
When revising the text in preparation for ''The Complete Plain Words'', Gowers abandoned the joke,{{#tag:ref|If indeed it was a joke: the text was read by Gowers's advisory colleagues, all keen on plain English, but Rebecca Gowers suggests that the use of the phrase was an oversight.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and rewrote the second sentence as, "I suspect that this project may be received by many of them without any marked enthusiasm or gratitude."&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1954), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A substantive objection by Vallins to "the cult of 'plain English'" was his view that verbose phrases lose important nuances when reduced to plain words. He gave as an example "evacuated to alternative accommodation", which in his opinion has overtones that Gowers's "taken to other houses" lacks.&lt;ref&gt;Vallins, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==''ABC of Plain Words'', 1951==
[[File:ABC-plain-words.jpg|thumb|upright]]
The Treasury invited Gowers to build on the success of ''Plain Words'' by producing a second volume of advice on good, clear writing. As with its predecessor, he "had many helpers to thank", including Griffith and other civil service colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew on the works of well-known writers on English usage, including [[Henry Watson Fowler|H W Fowler]], [[A.P. Herbert|A P Herbert]] and [[Eric Partridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; ''The ABC of Plain Words'' had 160 pages, and was priced at three shillings (15p).&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), front cover ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Gowers explained the purpose of the new book in his preface, "We must have something that can be kept on the desk and consulted on points of difficulty as they arise. ''Plain Words'' is of little use for that: it has not even an index".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; The new work consisted of articles, mostly brief, on points of vocabulary, grammar, construction, punctuation and style, set out in alphabetical order, beginning with "Abstract words" and ending with "Write". The former was one of the longer entries, explaining the dangers of overuse of abstract words, and recommending concrete terms where possible. Thus, "Was this the realisation of an anticipated liability?" would be better as, "Did you expect to have to do this?"&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The entry on "Write" was an example of one of the short articles on particular words; it pointed out that "I wrote to you about it" needs the "to" but "I wrote you a letter" does not.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Gowers and his successors revised their advice as usage changed over the years. Two consecutive entries in ''The ABC'' illustrate how some comments have become dated and others have not: Gowers warned in 1951 that the word "backlog" meaning "arrears" would be unintelligible to British readers, and in the next entry he advised that the construction "on a {{space}}... basis" should be avoided. The latter remains a frequent feature of loose writing and all the editions of the ''Plain Words'' books retain and expand Gowers's advice, whereas within three years of writing ''The ABC'', Gowers noted in ''The Complete Plain Words'' that "backlog" was rapidly and usefully establishing itself in British usage.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1954), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the Treasury nor HMSO expected the second book to rival the popularity of its predecessor, but it sold nearly 80,000 copies in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt; Gowers was nevertheless not wholly happy with it. He thought the A–Z layout had two disadvantages. The first was that it gave the wrong impression that all the topics were of equal importance; the second was that the people most in need of advice would not think to look up the relevant entry: "There is no reason why anyone addicted to abstract nouns, unconscious of any offence, should ever be prompted to read that article; nor can I think of any other title for it that would be more likely to throw it in his way."&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1951), p. iv&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Complete Plain Words'', 1954==
By 1954 both books were still selling well. Almost 300,000 copies of ''Plain Words'' and more than 130,000 of ''The ABC'' had been sold.&lt;ref name=mgcpw&gt;"Plain Words", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 22 September 1954, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury, HMSO and Gowers agreed that the obvious and best course would be to combine the two booklets into a single volume.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; This Gowers did, with help from his colleagues, as before; he made many revisions as a result of "the many correspondents from all parts of the English-speaking world who have been good enough … to send me suggestions, criticisms and specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1954), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; An example of his revisions is in the entry on "bottleneck", of which in 1951 he had written four brief sentences warning against overuse: in 1954 he felt it necessary to write 270 words, so ubiquitous had the term become.&lt;ref name=bn&gt;Gowers (1954), pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|Among the more extreme uses of the word noted by Gowers in 1954 were "drastic bottleneck", the "vicious circle of interdependent bottlenecks" and the "worldwide bottleneck".&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; In the 2014 edition Rebecca Gowers points out that misuse of the word has not completely vanished, citing a recent use of "the single biggest bottleneck in the economy".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} (By the time of the 1973 revision the fad for the word had declined, and Fraser's entry is very much shorter.)&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1973), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Complete Plain Words'' contained 226 pages, including seven pages of index. It was a hardback, in green cloth binding with dust-jacket, in HMSO's preferred size, used for the two earlier Plain Words books, 8.4in x 5.25in (21.3&amp;nbsp;cm x 13.3&amp;nbsp;cm). It was published in September 1954 at what ''The Manchester Guardian'' called the remarkably cheap price of five shillings (25p).&lt;ref name=mgcpw/&gt; {{#tag:ref|Using the [[Retail Price Index]], five shillings in 1954 equates to £5.62 in 2011 terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?year_source=1954&amp;amount=0.25&amp;year_result=2013 "Relative worth of £0 5s 0d from 1954"], MeasuringWorth, retrieved 6 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 edition of ''Plain Words'' was published at £14.99.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), dust-jacket&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} ''The Times Literary Supplement'' greeted the publication: "It may be hoped that in this more durable form the book's good influence will continue to spread: Civil Servants have not been alone in profiting from it in the past, nor should they be in the future."&lt;ref&gt;"Philology", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 31 December 1954, p. 858&lt;/ref&gt; The book has remained in print, in its original and revised editions, ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Gowers's prologue and epilogue there is a Digression on Legal English followed by chapters on The Elements, Correctness, Avoiding the Superfluous Word, Choosing the Familiar Word, Choosing the Precise Word, The Handling of Words, and Punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1954), pp. v and vi&lt;/ref&gt;

==1973 revision by Bruce Fraser==
The 1954 text was reprinted seven times during Gowers's lifetime, and he made a number of amendments in the various impressions.&lt;ref name=fraseriii&gt;Gowers (1973), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; Changing times in the 1960s meant that a substantial revision was needed if the book was to continue to fulfil its purpose. Gowers, fully occupied for a decade in making the first revision of Fowler's ''[[Modern English Usage]]'', was unable to carry out the task; he died in 1966, a few months after the publication of the revised Fowler. Another retired senior civil servant, [[Bruce Fraser (civil servant)|Bruce Fraser]], was asked to revise ''The Complete Plain Words''.&lt;ref name=fraseriii/&gt; The new edition, 250 pages long, was published by HMSO at £1, in hardback with black cloth binding and dust-jacket, in the same format as the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1973), dust-jacket ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser preserved Gowers's structure, and added three new chapters, the most important of which was titled "Some recent trends"; it covered the increasing prevalence of informality, and the influences of America, science, technology, economics, business, and personnel management. The final sections of the chapter were on "vogue words" and "modish writing".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1973), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser noted that though Gowers had said approvingly in 1954 that the use of the [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] was dying out, it was now, under the influence of American writing, making an unwelcome reappearance in English usage.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;

Reviewing the new edition in ''The Times Literary Supplement'', [[David Hunt (diplomat)|David Hunt]] commented of Fraser, "his wit, perhaps a little drier and more Scottish, is equally acute, diverting and instructive".&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;Hunt, David. "The Corridors of Gowers", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 22 June 1973, p. 719&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Times'', [[Dennis Potter]] said that the book remained "the happiest thing to come out of the Treasury". He praised Fraser for replacing Gowers's dated examples of officialese with modern specimens and updating the text to reflect current trends, but concluded:
{{quote|The core of the book remains Gowers, but I do not think Fraser, for all his desire to be faithful, has been able to keep the urbane, untroubled, effortless grace which made the original so instantly attractive. And, to be fair, the times have made this all but impossible.{{space}}... ''The Complete Plain Words'' in any new version cannot possibly have the same impact as Gowers first had when he reminded administrators that they could best express themselves in a clean and economical prose. But this version, which battles with later jargon and more subtle temptations, a version less sure of the nature of its readership or the mood of the nation, is an honourable and certainly a useful guide.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Dennis. "Where English is now at", ''The Times'', 5 April 1973, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The Fraser edition was reprinted in hardback three times between 1973 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1973) fourth impression, p. ii&lt;/ref&gt; Penguin published a paperback version in the UK in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-plain-words/oclc/780718977?referer=br&amp;ht=edition "The Complete Plain Words"], WorldCat, retrieved 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in the US in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-plain-words/oclc/2386478?referer=br&amp;ht=edition "The Complete Plain Words"], WorldCat, retrieved 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==1986 revision by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut==
The third edition was commissioned not by the Treasury but by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, to mark its bicentenary. The revision was made not by an experienced public servant but by an academic and a lexicographer, [[Sidney Greenbaum]], Quain Professor of English Language and Literature at [[University College, London]] and Janet Whitcut, formerly senior research editor of the [[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English|Longman Dictionary]]. They chose to revise Fraser's 1973 version rather than starting from Gowers's original. Having two authors made it necessary to abandon Gowers's frequent use of the first person; Fraser had retained it, stating "...the reader may take it that 'I' means either 'Gowers agreed with by Fraser' or 'Fraser, confident that Gowers would agree with him'".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1973, p. vi)&lt;/ref&gt; With joint authors for the new edition, this could not be sustained, and the change from first person to impersonal removed some of the book's previous character.&lt;ref name=gxvii/&gt; An example is in the section on punctuation, where Gowers wrote, "The author of the style-book of the Oxford University Press{{space}}... says 'If you take hyphens seriously you will surely go mad'. I have no intention of taking hyphens seriously." In the new edition the second sentence read, "You should not take hyphens seriously".&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1986), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Gowers objects that this approach "systematically depersonalise[s] the writing".&lt;ref name=gxvii&gt;Gowers (2014), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The new edition, in the same format as its two predecessors, is in blue cloth, with dust-jacket, and has 298 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1986), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; A paperback version was issued by Penguin Books in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-plain-words/oclc/16862081&amp;referer=brief_results "The Complete Plain Words"], WorldCat, retrieved 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and an American hardback edition was published in 1988 by [[David R. Godine, Publisher|Godine Publishing]], Boston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-plain-words/oclc/17201388&amp;referer=brief_results "The Complete Plain Words"], WorldCat, retrieved 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 revision by Rebecca Gowers==
The last direct link between ''Plain Words'' and the public service was broken in 1996, when HMSO was dismembered under governmental [[privatisation]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Valerie. "Stationery Office sold for £54m in cut-price deal", ''The Times'', 12 September 1996, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 edition of the book was published by Particular Books, an imprint of [[Penguin Books]]. It was printed on lower-weight paper and in a smaller format than its predecessors. The reviser was Rebecca Gowers, Ernest's great-granddaughter, a novelist and author of a non-fiction book about a Victorian murder. She begins the new edition with a twenty-page preface that includes a biographical sketch of Ernest Gowers and a history of the revisions after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), pp. vii–xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the three earlier revisers, Rebecca Gowers generally avoids merging her own comments with the original text. Her practice is to retain Ernest Gowers's remarks and append updated observations in a separate note. An example is the entry on the use of the noun "issue". The original words were:
{{quote|This word has a very wide range of proper meanings as a noun, and should not be made to do any more work – the work, for instance of ''subject'', ''topic'', ''consideration'' and ''dispute''.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (1954) p. 113; and Gowers (2014), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;}}
To which the reviser has added:
{{quote|''Note'': The workload of ''issue'' has grown enormously since Gowers wrote this, not least because it now also doubles up on the job done by ''problem''. Thus a government department these days might release a disastrous consultation paper in terms of issues to do with interoperability issues, even as a Minister has personal issues that threaten to become an issue in the press, causing the Prime Minister to have a major issue with the Minister. In short, Gowers's warning went unheeded, and ''issue'' is being made to labour harder than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Fraser, Greenbaum and Whitcut remained broadly faithful to Gowers's original structure and chapter headings, with some minor changes, Rebecca Gowers reverts to the original almost exclusively. The modernisations she introduces, such as the consideration of [[gender-neutral language]], are incorporated into the chapters of the 1954 book.&lt;ref&gt;Gowers (2014), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''There are known knowns'''" is a phrase from a response [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] gave to a question at a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[News conference|news briefing]] on February 12, 2002 about the lack of [[evidence]] linking the government of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] with the supply of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to [[terrorist groups]].&lt;ref name="defense.gov-transcript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636 |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen.

Rumsfeld stated:
{{quote|Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.&lt;ref name="defense.gov-transcript"/&gt;}}

The statement became the subject of much commentary, including a [[The Unknown Known|documentary]] by [[Academy Award]]–winning [[film director]] [[Errol Morris]].&lt;ref name="GirardGirard2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Girard|first1=John|last2=Girard|first2=JoAnn|title=A Leader's Guide to Knowledge Management: Drawing on the Past to Enhance Future Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqnTceVAjsUC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=February 10, 2014|date=June 1, 2009 |publisher=Business Expert Press|isbn=9781606490198|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Rumsfeld's statement brought much fame and public attention to the concepts of known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns, but national security and intelligence professionals have long used an analysis technique referred to as the [[Johari window]]. The idea of unknown unknowns was created in 1955 by two American [[psychologist]]s, Joseph Luft (1916–2014) and Harrington Ingham (1916–1995) in their development of the Johari window. They used it as a technique to help people better understand their relationship with themselves as well as others.

The term was also commonly used inside [[NASA]]. Rumsfeld himself cited [[NASA administrator]] [[William Robert Graham|William Graham]] in his memoir; he wrote that he had first heard "a variant of the phrase" from Graham when they served together on the [[Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States]] during the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsfeld|first1=Donald|title=Known and Unknown: A Memoir|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=9781101502495|page=xiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wIcpxMOjD4C&amp;pg=PT15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk Borne, an [[astrophysicist]] who was employed as a [[data scientist]] at [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] at the time, noted in an April 2013 TED talk that he had used the phrase "unknown unknowns" in a talk to personnel at the Homeland Security Transition Planning Office a few days prior to Rumsfeld's remarks, and speculated that the term may have percolated up to Rumsfeld and other high-ranking officials in the defense department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Data, Small World: Kirk Borne at TEDxGeorgeMasonU|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr02fMBfuRA|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns" are often used in [[project management]] and [[strategic planning]]&lt;ref&gt;https://hbr.org/1997/11/strategy-under-uncertainty&lt;/ref&gt; circles.

Known unknowns refers to "risks you are aware of, such as cancelled flights...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Identifying-risks/80780/95069-4.html|title = Project Management Fundamentals|date = December 14, 2011|accessdate = October 17, 2015|website = Lynda.com|publisher = Lynda.com/LinkedIN|last = Biafore|first = Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unknown unknowns are risks that come from situations that are so unexpected that they would not be considered. "For example, prior to the invention of the personal computer, manufacturers of typewriters probably didn't foresee the risks to their business".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Identifying-risks/80780/95069-4.html|title = Product Management Fundamentals|date = December 14, 2011|accessdate = October 17, 2015|website = Lynda.com|publisher = Lynda.com/LinkedIN|last = Biafore|first = Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary usage is largely consistent with the earliest known usages. For example, the term was used in evidence given to the British Columbia Royal Commission of Inquiry into Uranium Mining in 1979:

{{quote|Site conditions always pose unknowns, or uncertainties, which may become known during construction or operation to the detriment of the facility and possibly lead to damage of the environment or endanger public health and safety. The risk posed by unknowns is somewhat dependent on the nature of the unknown relative to past experience. This has led me classify unknowns into one of the following two types: 1. known unknowns (expected or foreseeable conditions), which can be reasonably anticipated but not quantified based on past experience as exemplified by case histories (in Appendix A and 2). Unknown unknowns (unexpected or unforeseeable conditions), which pose a potentially greater risk simply because they cannot be anticipated based on past experience or investigation.

—

Known unknowns result from phenomena which are recognized, but poorly understood. On the other hand, unknown unknowns are phenomena which cannot be expected because there has been no prior experience or theoretical basis for expecting the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/PublicationsCatalogue/Papers/Pages/1980-7.aspx &lt;!-- this maybe the document, see page 2 subtitle 'Phase V Waste Disposal' but seems not to cite actual 'Statement' --&gt; |title= Statement of Evidence of E.

The term also appeared in a 1982 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article on the [[aerospace industry]], which cites the example of [[metal fatigue]], the cause of crashes in [[de Havilland Comet]] [[airliner]]s in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Newhouse |first= J. |date= June 14, 1982 |title= A reporter at large: a sporty game; 1-betting the company |work= New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1982/06/14/a-sporty-game-i-betting-the-company |pages= 48–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

While the remarks initially led to some ridicule towards the Bush administration in general and Rumsfeld in particular, over time the consensus regarding it has shifted over the years and it now enjoys some level of respect. For example, Rumsfeld's defenders have included [[Canadians|Canadian]] columnist [[Mark Steyn]], who called it "in fact a brilliant distillation of quite a complex matter",&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |author=Steyn, Mark |authorlink=Mark Steyn |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3599959/Rummy-speaks-the-truth-not-gobbledygook.html |title=Rummy speaks the truth, not gobbledygook |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=December 9, 2003 |accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian economist and [[blog]]ger [[John Quiggin]], who wrote, "Although the language may be tortured, the basic point is both valid and important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Quiggin, John |authorlink=John Quiggin |url=http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2004/02/10/in-defense-of-rumsfeld/ |title=In Defense of Rumsfeld |date=February 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalytic philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] says that beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know: "If Rumsfeld thinks that the main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the 'unknown unknowns', that is, the threats from Saddam whose nature we cannot even suspect, then the Abu Ghraib scandal shows that the main dangers lie in the "unknown knowns"—the disavowed beliefs, suppositions and obscene practices we pretend not to know about, even though they form the background of our public values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lacan.com/zizekrumsfeld.htm |title=What Rumsfeld Doesn't Know That He Knows About Abu Ghraib |accessdate=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologists Daase and Kessler (2007) agree with a basic point of Rumsfeld in stating that the [[framing (sociology)|cognitive frame]] for political practice may be determined by the relationship between ''what we know, what we do not know, what we cannot know'', but Rumsfeld left out ''what we do not like to know''.&lt;ref name=kauk&gt;Knowns and Unknowns in the 'War on Terror': Uncertainty and the Political Construction of Danger, Christopher Daase and Oliver Kessler, Security Dialogue, December 2007; vol. 38, 4: pp. 411–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has been used in multiple books to discuss [[risk assessment]].&lt;ref name="GirardGirard2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeveLuetchford2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neve|first1=Geert de|last2=Luetchford|first2=Peter|title=Hidden Hands in the Market: Ethnographies of Fair Trade, Ethical Consumption, and Corporate Social Responsibility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1iYFfhhm8cC&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=February 10, 2014|year=2008|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781848550582|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld named his autobiography ''[[Known and Unknown: A Memoir]]''. In an "Author's Note" at the start of the book, he expressly acknowledged the source of his memoir's title and mentioned a few examples of his statement's prominence, including this Wikipedia article.&lt;ref name="Rumsfeld2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsfeld|first1=Donald|title=Known and Unknown: A Memoir|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=9781101502495|page=xiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wIcpxMOjD4C&amp;pg=PT14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Unknown Known]]'' is the title of [[Errol Morris]]'s 2013 biographical documentary about Rumsfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott|title=Not Giving an Inch in a Battle of Wits and Words; Deciphering Donald H.

==Analytical sciences==
The term "known unknowns" has been applied to the identification of chemical substances using analytical chemistry approaches, specifically mass spectrometry. In many cases, an unknown to an investigator that is detected in an experiment is actually known in the chemical literature, a reference database, or an internet resource. These types of compounds are termed "known unknowns". The term was originally coined by Little et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Little | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Cleven | first2 = C.D. | last3 = Brown | first3 = S.D. | year = 2011 | title = Identification of "Known Unknowns" utilizing accurate mass data and chemical abstracts service databases | url = | journal = J.

[[File:Looking into Love Canal.jpg|thumb|Urban prairie at [[Love Canal]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]]]]
'''Urban prairie''' is a term to describe vacant urban land that has reverted to [[urban open space|green space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlLyr7hX25IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=9780805092295&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgoNqBn4rYAhXLUd8KHVoQAFYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=9780805092295&amp;f=false|page=9|title=Detroit City Is the Place to Be: The Afterlife of an American Metropolis|first=Mark|last=Binelli|access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous structures occupying the urban lots have been demolished, leaving patchy areas of green space that are usually untended and unmanaged. Sometimes, however, the prairie spaces are intentionally created to facilitate amenities, such as [[green belt]]s, community gardens and wildlife reserve habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Graybill, Jessica K. "Rust-to-Resilience: Local Responses to Urban Vulnerabilities in Utica, New York." In Dooling, Sarah &amp; Simon, Greg, eds. (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0gGCBkLAUC&amp;pg=PA176 '
'Cities, Nature and Development: The Policies and Production of Urban Vulnerabilities''], p. 176. Ashgate Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[File:Urban prairie Detroit 1.jpg|thumb|Large gaps emerge in some [[Decline of Detroit|Detroit]] neighborhoods as abandoned houses are demolished.]]
Urban prairies can result from several factors. The value of aging buildings may fall too low to provide financial incentives for their owners to maintain them. Vacant properties may have resulted from [[deurbanization]] or crime, or may have been seized by local government as a response to unpaid [[property taxes]]. Since vacant structures can pose health and safety threats (such as [[fire hazard]]s), or be used as a location for [[criminal activity]], cities often demolish them.

Sometimes areas are cleared of buildings as part of a revitalization plan with the intention of redeveloping the land. In flood-prone areas, government agencies may purchase developed lots and then demolish the structures to improve drainage during floods. Some neighborhoods near major industrial or environmental clean-up sites are acquired and leveled to create a buffer zone and minimize the risks associated with pollution or industrial accidents. Such areas may become nothing more than fields of overgrown vegetation, which then provide [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for wildlife. Sometimes it is possible for residents of the city to fill up the unplanned empty space with urban parks or community gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, John (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xu4Cb3Dh-GEC&amp;pg=PA24 ''Reimagining Detroit: Opportunities for Redefining an American City''], p. 24. Wayne State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Urban prairie is sometimes planned by the government or non-profit groups for [[community gardens]] and [[conservation movement|conservation]], to restore or reintroduce a wildlife habitat, help the environment, and educate people about the prairie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2001/08/40.htm Missouri Conservation News]&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit, Michigan is one particular city that has many urban prairies.

In the case of the city of [[Christchurch]] in New Zealand, earthquake damage from the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|2011 earthquake]] caused the underground water table to raise and leak significantly in places, preventing reconstruction of damaged buildings. Many former residential areas in eastern Christchurch suburbs have been purchased by the government and demolished, as the soft soil causes the houses to shift and pose significant danger to the inhabitants. It is unknown if many of the waterlogged areas of Christchurch will ever fully recover.

Urban prairies may be established to lower the burden of mowing and related upkeep by the governmental entity that is overseeing it, letting [[Weed|weeds]] develop.

'''Voice portals''' are the voice equivalent of [[web portal]]s, giving access to information through spoken commands and voice responses. Ideally a voice portal could be an access point for any type of information, services, or transactions found on the [[Internet]]. Common uses include movie time listings and stock trading.
In telecommunications circles, voice portals may be referred to as [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) systems, but this term also includes [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] services.
With the emergence of conversational assistants such as Apple's [[Siri]], [[Amazon Alexa]], [[Google Assistant]], Microsoft [[Cortana]], and Samsung's [[Bixby (virtual assistant)|Bixby]], Voice Portals can now be accessed through mobile devices and Far Field voice smart speakers such as the [[Amazon Echo]] and [[Google Home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witlingo.com/voicefirstportal/|title=Launch your Voice First Portal – WITLINGO|website=www.witlingo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Voice portals have no dependency on the access device; even low end mobile handsets can access the service. Voice portals talk to users in their local language and there is reduced customer learning required for using voice services compared to Internet/SMS based services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wired-Speech-Activates-Human-Computer-Relationship/dp/0262640651/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503452525&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=Clifford+nass|title=Wired for Speech: How Voice Activates and Advances the Human-Computer Relationship|last=Nass|first=Clifford|last2=Brave|first2=Scott|date=2007-02-23|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262640657|location=Cambridge Mass.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complex search query that otherwise would take multiple widgets (drop down, check box, text box filling), can easily and effortlessly be formulated by anyone who can speak without needing to be familiar with any visual interfaces.  For instance, one can say, "Find me an eyeliner, not too thick, dark brown, from Estee Lauder MAC, that's below thirty dollars" or "What is the closest liquor store from here and what time do they close?"

==Limitations==
Voice is the most natural communication medium, but the information that can be provided is limited compared to visual media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Tap-Usability/dp/1492196517|title=Don't Make Me Tap!: A Common Sense Approach to Voice Usability|last=Bouzid|first=Dr Ahmed|last2=Ma|first2=Dr Weiye|date=2013-08-27|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781492196518|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, most Internet users try a search term, scan results, then adjust the search term to eliminate irrelevant results.  They may take two or three quick iterations to get a list that they are confident will contain what they are looking for.  The equivalent approach is not practical when results are spoken, as it would take far too long. In this case, a [[multimodal interaction]] would be preferable to a voice-only interface.

==Trends==
Live-agent and Internet-based voice portals are converging, and the range of information they can provide is expanding.

Live-agent portals are introducing greater automation through speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, in many cases providing fully automated service, while automated Internet-based portals are adding operator fallback in premium services. The live-agent portals, which used to rely entirely on pre-structured databases holding specific types of information are expanding into more free-form Internet access, while the Internet-based portals are adding pre-structured content to improve automation of the more common types of request.{{example needed|date=December 2010}}

Speech technology is starting to introduce [[Artificial Intelligence]] concepts that make it practical
to recognise a much broader range of utterances, learning from experience.  This promises to make it practical to greatly improve speaker recognition rates and expand the range of information that can be provided by a voice portal.

==Technology Providers==
A number of web-based companies are dedicated to providing voice-based access to Internet information to consumers.
[[Quack.com]] launched its service in March 2000 and has since obtained the first overall voiceportal patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6510417.html|title=System and method for voice access to internet-based information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.google.com/patents?id=Z1kOAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=Steven+Woods|title=System and method for voice access to internet-based information
 |accessdate=2008-03-13|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Quack.com]] was acquired by [[AOL]] in 2000 and relaunched as AOL By Phone later that year. [[Tellme Networks]] was acquired by [[Microsoft]] in 2007.
[[Nuance Communications|Nuance]], the dominant provider of speech recognition and text-to-speech technology, is starting to deliver voice portal solutions. Other companies in this space include [[TelSurf Networks]], [[FonGenie]], Apptera and Call Genie.

Apart from public voice portal services, a number of technology companies, including [[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Avaya]], and [[Cisco]], offer commercial enterprise-grade voice portal products to be used by companies to serve their clients. [[Avaya]] also has a carrier-grade portfolio.

A '''windrow''' is a row of cut (mown) [[hay]] or small grain crop. It is allowed to dry before being baled, combined, or rolled.  For hay, the windrow is often formed by a [[hay rake]], which rakes hay that has been cut by a [[mower|mowing]] machine or by [[scythe]] into a row, or it may naturally form as the hay is mown. For small grain crops which are to be harvested, the windrow is formed by a [[swather]] which both cuts the crop and forms the windrow. 

By analogy, the term may also be applied to a row of any other material such as snow, earth or materials for collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/20/W0172000.html The American Heritage- Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.] at Bartleby.com Accessed 2 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Snow windrows are created by [[Snowplow|snow plow]]s when clearing roads of snow; where this blocks driveways the windrow may require removal.  Snow windrowed to the centre of the street can be removed by a [[snow blower]] and truck. In preparing a pond or lake for [[ice cutting]], the snow on top of the ice, which slows freezing, may be scraped off and windrowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* Earth windrows may be formed by [[grader]]s when grading earthworks or dirt roads&lt;br&gt;
* Leaf windrows may be required for municipal collection.&lt;br&gt;
* [[Fossil]] windrows are a grouping of fossils that have been deposited together as a result of turbulence or wave action in a marine or freshwater environment. Fossils of similar shape and size are commonly found grouped or sorted together as a result of separation based on weight and shape.&lt;br&gt; 
* [[Seaweed]] windrows form on sea or lake surfaces because of cylindrical [[Langmuir circulation]] just under the surface caused by wind action.

[[Windrow composting]] is a large scale [[vermicompost]]ing system where garden and other biodegradable waste is shredded, mixed and windrowed for composting.&lt;br&gt;
