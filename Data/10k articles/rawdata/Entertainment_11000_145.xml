}}
'''''5 Card Stud''''' is a 1968 [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Mystery film|mystery]] film directed by [[Henry Hathaway]] and starring [[Dean Martin]] and [[Robert Mitchum]]. The script, based on a novel by Ray Gaulden, was written by [[Marguerite Roberts]], who also wrote the screenplay of ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' for Hathaway the following year.

==Plot==
In 1880, a gambler in the small town of Rincon, 100 miles from [[Denver]], Colorado is caught cheating at a [[five-card stud]] poker game. The players, led by the volatile Nick Evers, take the cheating gambler to hang him. One of the players, Van Morgan, tries to prevent the others from administering frontier justice, but is unable to stop the man's [[lynching]]. Morgan leaves town, but later returns when he hears that a couple of the other players from that ill-fated game have become victims of grisly murders.

The town has a new resident, a stern and somewhat edgy [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt .45]]-carrying [[Baptists|Baptist]] preacher named Reverend Rudd. As more members of the lynch mob are killed off one by one, it becomes clear that someone is taking revenge, and it is up to Morgan to solve the mystery. Finally, only he is left. He discovers the identity of the killer just in time.

==Cast==
*[[Dean Martin]] as Van Morgan
*[[Robert Mitchum]] as The Rev. Jonathan Rudd
*[[Inger Stevens]] as Lily Langford
*[[Roddy McDowall]] as Nick Evers
*[[Katherine Justice]] as Nora Evers
*[[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] as U.S. Marshal Al Dana
*Ruth Springford as Mama Malone
*[[Yaphet Kotto]] as Little George
*[[Denver Pyle]] as Sig Evers
*Bill Fletcher as Joe Hurley
*[[Whit Bissell]] as Dr. Cooper
*[[Ted de Corsia]] as Eldon Bates
*[[Don Collier]] as Rowan
*[[Roy Jenson]] as Mace Jones

==Production notes==
The song led by Rudd at his first service in Rincon is "Mercy's Call," a late-19th-century Baptist hymn written by [[William H. Doane|W.H. Doane]].

This film marked one of the last appearances of [[Inger Stevens]], and the second time Mitchum played an unorthodox preacher (the first being 1955's ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]''). This film brought together director Henry Hathaway and Dean Martin for a second time. The first was the 1965 film ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]''. Martin plays a gunslinger and performs the title song.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="697">'''Abbia''' is an [[Africa]]n [[game of chance]] from [[Cameroon]]'s [[Beti-Pahuin|Beti]] people.  The game is played using [[nutshell]]s, or the fruit of a very poisonous tree with wood carving carvings on them. Gambling chips made from stone are exchanged during the process.
The game was played by men who sat in a circle around a plate-shaped woven basket and placed their carved stones in the basket.
This involves undecorated discs, sa, cut from the peel of the calabash, the outer shell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4832">'''''Adolf''''' is a [[monodrama]] written by British [[actor]] and [[playwright]] [[Pip Utton]] in 1997 (originally performed by him and directed by [[Guy Masterson]]), and in its latest form, first produced in 2002.  In reviewing Hitler's inner world, the play carries several anti-[[Fascism]] undertones.&lt;ref name='bbc_adolf'&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/stage/2003/11/adolf.shtml BBC - Berkshire Stage - Adolf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has had considerable success internationally; it has been performed in [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Estonia]], [[Singapore]], [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name='utton_page'&gt;[http://www.pip-utton.com/putton/adolf.htm Pip Utton as Adolf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072205/http://www.pip-utton.com/putton/adolf.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkpot.com/theatre/05reviews/0305,adol,ni.html FLYING INKPOT THEATRE REVIEW: Adolf by Pip Utton Theatre Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184619/http://www.inkpot.com/theatre/05reviews/0305%2Cadol%2Cni.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A performance was also given in [[Finland]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estemb.fi/eng/events/aid-368 Estemb in Helsinki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The play is customarily performed by a single actor playing all the roles.  The only major role is that of [[Adolf Hitler]].

Set in the Hitler's underground ''[[Führerbunker]]'' in 1945 and designed to be played using minimal resources, the [[stage prop|props]] of the play are limited to three: a [[Flag of Nazi Germany|banner of German Nazi party]] hung vertically in the background, a table in centre stage left, and a wooden chair.  Promotional material often features photographs of the actor, dressed like Hitler, standing in front of the flag.

Roughly the first half of the play is spent on an overview of Hitler's political ideas, extensively citing ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.  The quotations are, to a significant extent, chosen for their obvious outrageousness, in expectation that a modern watcher wouldn't find it hard to disagree with them.  The rest of the play is dedicated to demonstrating that even half a century after Hitler's death, his "poisoned utopias" and "warped logic"—the "spirit of Hitler"—live on in modern societies.  A number of theatre critics&lt;ref name='list_of_reviews_atrib'&gt;[http://www.theatretoursinternational.com/PastShows/PSDomestic/PSAD.htm Past Shows Domestic: ADOLF - Pip Utton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070924025410/http://www.theatretoursinternational.com/PastShows/PSDomestic/PSAD.htm |date=September 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have found this turnaround a defining and deeply moving aspect of the play.

Adolf is structured to lull us first into believing we are on the “right” side vis-a-vis Hitler. Once we are feeling comfortable, it unsettles us by worming its way into our minds to tease out prejudices we hold consciously or unconsciously against people of other religions, regions, caste, colour or sexual orientation, whose elimination [[by hook or by crook]] would assure us, we believe, of our utopias.}}

== Facts ==
In 2003, the United States Congress passed and President [[George W. Bush]] signed [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|a law]] providing federal government funds to private groups to help fight [[AIDS]] and other diseases all over the world, through the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID). However, one of the conditions imposed by the law on grant recipients was a requirement, known as the [[anti-prostitution pledge]], to have "a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|author = [[Adam Liptak|Liptak, Adam]] |title = Justices Say U.S. Cannot Impose Antiprostitution Condition on AIDS Grants|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/us/court-finds-aids-programs-rules-violate-free-speech.html|accessdate = 25 June 2013|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many AIDS agencies preferred to remain neutral on prostitution so as not to alienate the sex workers they work with to reduce HIV rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mientka, Matthew |title=US Supreme Court Divides On Free Speech Rights Of Health Groups

[[DKT International#History|DKT International]] filed a lawsuit in Washington, DC but the challenge to the law was defeated on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ACLU and Public Health Groups Urge Appeals Court to Reject Bush Global AIDS Gag |url=https://www.aclu.org/hiv/gen/27760prs20061221.html |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alliance for Open Society International]] and [[Pathfinder International]] filed another suit in 2005. In 2008, [[InterAction (organization)|InterAction]], and [[Global Health Council|the Global Health Council]] joined the suit against the provision in a federal court in [[New York City]], arguing that the requirement to promote a specific message violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s protection of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[John Roberts|Roberts, John]] |title=AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT v.

== Decision ==
In November 2012, the Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari filed by USAID, the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], and the [[Center for Disease Control]]. In a 6-2 decision, the court ruled in a majority written by [[Chief Justice John Roberts]] that the government cannot force a private organization to publicly profess a viewpoint that mirrors the government's view but is not held by the organization itself. Such a requirement would be considered a form of "leveraging" and violated the First Amendment protection of free speech. Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] jointly filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the majority's ruling would prevent government funding for specific ideological programs.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;

'''Andy Gross''' (born '''Andrew Gross''' on May 10, 1968) is an American former professional [[racquetball]] player, now a touring comedian, ventriloquist, magician, and illusionist.  He is known for his television and film appearances, and for his live touring show called ''Andy Gross's MindBoggling Variety Show''.

==Life and career==
Gross was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to Marshall and Joan Gross, where he attended Parkway Central High School.  At 15, Gross became the youngest professional racquetball player in the history of the sport, winning a record number of Southern California tournaments in the years leading up to his retirement at the age of 26.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Following his athletic career, Gross established himself as an entertainer, creating a live act that combines comedy, ventriloquism, and magic.  His talent as a ventriloquist has been put to use in television series such as ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ''Las Vegas,'' as well as in the sci-fi Web series ''After Judgment''.

Since 2000, Gross has toured the United States with his ''MindBoggling Variety Show,'' which combines his comedy, magic, and ventriloquism with large-scale stage illusions.  Among the more notable [[ventriloquist's dummy]] characters in the stage act is Steve, The Customer Service Guy, a soft puppet who dispenses computer repair support by telephone.

[[File:Steve-ventriloquist-dummy.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Andy Gross performing with Steve, The Customer Service Guy]]

In 2013, Gross created a video depicting a unique spin on the classic cut-in-half illusion that he dubs the "Split Man" trick,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmQh5b6lZ28  Magician cut in half prank]&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it appear as though the entertainer has been severed in two but is still able to walk about.  The video, shot guerrilla-style in various public places in which unsuspecting passersby are jarred by the sudden appearance of his 'Split Man,' premiered on the Web before being showcased on a variety of national platforms such as [[The Huffington Post]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/19/man-cut-in-half-illusion-prank_n_3625182.html  Huff Post Comedy: Man Cut In Half Illusion Prank Terrifies Everyone]&lt;/ref&gt; [[FOX]], [[CNN]], [[AOL]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Google]], and [[Showbiz Tonight with A.J. Hammer]].

Gross owns a sizeable and significant collection of ventriloquist dummies and memorabilia, which frequently supplies props for television, film, and stage productions.  Additionally, since 1997, he has designed a line of toys, prank novelties, and magic tricks for [http://lamagictoy.com/ LA Magic &amp; Toy] that are sold in toy and gift stores globally, having won the Top 10 Duracell Kids Choice Award for one of his designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selectcomedy.com/index.php/Learn-more-about-the-entertainers-we-work-with/andy-gross-bio.html| Andy Gross | Meet the Comedian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004119/http://www.selectcomedy.com/index.php/Learn-more-about-the-entertainers-we-work-with/andy-gross-bio.html |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August 2018, Andy Gross sparked controversy at Purdue University. Andy Gross was asked to perform at Purdue's orientation closing ceremony for the class of 2022. First, he made a joke about being sexually aroused by a female college student's close proximity to him. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/08/19/purdue-students-walk-out-andy-gross-offensive-comedy-set-during-orientation/1038097002/]&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Gross decided to longer perform on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2018/08/21/purdue-walkout-comedian-apologizes-defends-act/1049945002/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some are criticizing Purdue for placing the blame on Mr. Gross instead of taking some of the blame. These critics say that Purdue paid him to do his act, and Mr. Gross did what he was paid to do. If Purdue claims not to know his act, then the critics respond that Purdue was negligent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/08/20/andy-gross-purdue-walkout-boiler-gold-rush/1042029002/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Are We Done Yet?''''' is a 2007 American [[family film|family]] [[comedy film]] starring [[Ice Cube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schager|first=Nick|title=Are We Done Yet?|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/are-we-done-yet/2798|work=Slant Magazine|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is a loose remake of the 1948 [[Cary Grant]] comedy ''[[Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House]]'' and a sequel to the 2005 comedy ''[[Are We There Yet? (film)|Are We There Yet?]]'' The film was directed by [[Steve Carr]] from a screenplay by Hank Nelken. It was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[RKO Pictures]] and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film was shot on location in [[Tsawwassen]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but is set in [[Newberg, Oregon]], United States.

==Plot==
Following the events of ''[[Are We There Yet? (film)|Are We There Yet?]]'', Nick Persons ([[Ice Cube]]) has married Suzanne ([[Nia Long]]) and moved her, Kevin ([[Philip Daniel Bolden]]), and Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) into his apartment, also purchasing a 2007 [[Cadillac Escalade]] (after he accidentally blew up his [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV in the previous film by leaving the lighter unattended inside). He has also sold his sports memorabilia store to his best friend, Marty (played by [[Jay Mohr]] in the first film). The family has also got a [[Berger Picard]] and named it Coco. While getting ready for an interview with [[Magic Johnson]] to launch a sports magazine, Suzanne tells Nick that she is pregnant and they later find out that there will be twins. 

For more space, Suzanne and Nick go check out a house in the suburbs. They meet Chuck Mitchell Jr. ([[John C. McGinley]]), the resident real-estate agent/contractor there, and after some talking, Nick decides to take the house. The family then packs up their things and moves into the house, with Lindsey and Kevin (mostly the former) being against it. However, as it turns out, Nick failed to get the house inspected first, and they soon find a mold infestation, and Nick becomes angry with Chuck as while trying to resolve the mold issue, he discovers even more problems with the house, and almost destroys it trying to fix them all. Meanwhile, Lindsey sneaks out to go to a party with one of the teenage workers who is Chuck's friend, and when Nick finds out, he grounds her. He finally decides to fire Chuck, which causes all those working on the house to quit out of loyalty to Chuck, and Suzanne to take the kids and move into the guest house, with the parting shot, "You're the one tearing this family apart, Nick!" After taking some time to think, Nick decides to fix the house on his own and also to apologize to Chuck, especially when he was told that Chuck lost his wife a few years previously. Chuck responds by bringing his friends back to help.

When Suzanne goes into labor with the hospital half an hour away, Nick, Kevin and Lindsey have to deliver the babies. Chuck tries to get there, but his truck breaks down and he is forced to power walk down to the house. While she's still in labor, Nick gets a call from Magic. After Suzanne gives birth to twin boys, the movie ends six months later with a big barbecue in their backyard at which Nick debuts his new magazine titled ''Are We Done Yet?'', based on his experience building the house.

'''''Atari Vault''''' is a collection of one hundred video games that [[Atari]] had produced for [[arcade cabinet]]s and its [[Atari 2600]] home console system, dating from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The collection was developed by [[Code Mystics]], who had helmed similar collections of Atari games to other platforms, to work on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] via the [[Steam (software)|Steam client]]. The games, where possible, have been updated to include modern-day features such as local and online multiplayer and online leaderboards.

Code Mystics handled the port, previously having developed the ''[[Atari Greatest Hits]]'' series for the [[Nintendo DS]], a similar collection of games updated for a modern system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/01/22/atari-bringing-more-than-100-classics-to-steam-in-new-vault-collection.aspx | title = Atari Bringing More Than 100 Classics To Steam In New Vault Collection | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = January 22, 2016 | accessdate = January 22, 2016 | first = Jeff | last = Cork }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Atari Vault'', they have worked to ensure that the games in this title would be considered the definitive modern versions, according to developer Matthew Labunka. They spent time to obtain fine details on the look and presentation, such as getting digital imagery of the arcade cabinet art to present alongside the game screen.&lt;ref name="wired pax"/&gt; The updated versions will be running the original games' [[ROM image]], wrapped into an emulator made in the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity 5]] game engine.&lt;ref name="wired pax"/&gt; In addition to original settings that were normally available to arcade players, the player can access options that were limited to the arcade cabinet operator, such as difficulty and length of a single play session.&lt;ref name="wired pax"/&gt; Art and related materials are also available for each game for the player to review.&lt;ref name="wired pax"/&gt;

Where possible, the games have been updated to include both local and online multiplayer, and games use Steam-based score leaderboards. The games have been tuned to use the [[Steam controller]], enabling precise controls for the games, particularly for games that used [[trackball]] input devices, like ''Centipede''.&lt;ref name="wired announced"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2016/01/atari-vault-steam/ | title = Steam's Atari Vault Package Brings Back 100 Classic Games | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = January 21, 2016 | accessdate = January 22, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Code Mystics worked with [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] to fine-tune controller profiles for various games before release.&lt;ref name="wired pax"/&gt;

'''''Baldur's Gate''''' is a fantasy [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[BioWare]] and published in 1998 by [[Interplay Entertainment]]. It is the first game in the [[Baldur's Gate (series)|''Baldur's Gate'' series]] and takes place in the [[Forgotten Realms]], a [[high fantasy]] [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign settings|campaign setting]], using a modified version of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''AD&amp;D'') [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|2nd edition]] rules. It was the first game to use the [[BioWare#Technology|Infinity Engine]] for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the [[Icewind Dale (series)|''Icewind Dale'' series]], as well as other licensed ''D&amp;D'' campaign worlds such as ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their [[player character|own creation]] who finds themselves travelling across the [[Sword Coast]] alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.

The game received critical acclaim following its release and was credited for revitalising computer role-playing games. Its success led to an [[expansion pack]] entitled ''[[Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast|Tales of the Sword Coast]]'', as well as spawning a sequel entitled ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'', which later received its own expansion called ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal|Throne of Bhaal]]''. An enhanced version of the Infinity Engine was later created as part of [[Beamdog]]'s [[Video game remake|remake]], entitled ''[[Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition]]'', the first new release in the franchise in nearly nine years.&lt;ref name="announcement"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Duchal palace sarevok speaks BGI.png|right|thumb|A screenshot of ''Baldur's Gate'', showcasing the user interface designed by [[BioWare]] in order to provide relative ease in playing the game, with the UI template used in other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, such as ''Icewind Dale''. The game also relies heavily on plot and dialogue as driving factors behind how it conveys the main story.]]

Players conduct the game from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] [[isometric perspective|isometric]] third-person perspective, creating a character for each playthrough who then travels across pre-rendered location, taking on quests, recruiting companions to aid them, and combating enemies, while working towards completing the game's main story. Control is done through a user interface that allows a player to move characters and give them actions to undertake, review information on on-going quests and the statistics of characters in their party, manage their inventories, organize the formation of the party, though the screen does not need to be centered on the characters being controlled and can be moved around with the mouse and keyboard, the latter also capable of accessing various player options through keyboard shortcuts. All of the gameplay mechanics were coded to conform to the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition|''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition]] role-playing rules, with game automatically computing the rule intricacies, including tracking statistics and dice rolling.&lt;ref name=schoffel&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20497495.html |author= Schoffel, Julian |title= RPG Revival |work=[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]] |date= April 1, 1998 |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}{{Subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tresca2010&gt;{{citation |first1= Michael J. |last1=Tresca |title= The Evolution of Fantasy Role-Playing Games |publisher=McFarland |year=2010 |isbn= 078645895X |page=144 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8H8bzqj6S4sC&amp;pg=PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the game is conducted in real-time, some elements of the ruleset used in the coding were modified to allow it to feature a [[pausable real-time]] mode, allowing players to pause the game at any time and prepare what actions a character do, including the ability to set the game to automatically pause at preset points in combat.&lt;ref name=schoffel/&gt;&lt;ref name="jharris"&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last= Harris |publisher=Gamasutra |title= Baldur's Gate (series) |work=Game Design Essentials: 20 RPGs |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=10 |accessdate= October 5, 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109154652/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=10 |archivedate= November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; A new playthrough requires the player to either [[Character creation|create]] a new player character (PC), or import one they exported from a previous playthrough. Every new character requires the player to determine what their name, gender, [[race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|race]], [[class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|class]], and [[alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|alignment]] are, and what [[ability score]]s and weapon proficiencies they have, with thieves requiring points be allocated between their thieving skills, and spellcasters having a few spells set up for them - those using priest spells have them available for use from the start, while those using wizard spells add them to their spellbook and have one primed for use at the start of a new game.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0EB096C2EDF69DCD.html |title= Adventure Lives up to Hype |work= [[The Herald News]] |location= Joliet, Illinois |date= March 14, 1999 |accessdate= November 17, 2012}}{{subscription|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; New PCs can be [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Multi-classing|multi-class]], but must adhere to the restrictions that come from this, in accordance to the 2nd edition rules; a character who is both a cleric and a fighter, may only use weapons of the former class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |url= http://clankiller.com/games/bg/dualclass/ |publisher= clankiller.com |title= Baldur's Gate Dual-Classing Guide |accessdate= March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's main story is divided up into eight parts - a prologue and seven chapters - with each requiring the player to complete a specific task in order to complete it; while free exploration of the game's world map is allowed from the outset upon completing the prologue, some areas are not accessible until the player has advanced to a specific chapter.&lt;ref name=schoffel/&gt; With the exception of imported characters, all PCs begin off as weak characters from the start, but eventually grow stronger as the player explores the game's world, completing both the major quests and the game's large variety of [[side quest]]s,&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; killing hostile enemies, earning [[experience point]]s to level up their character, finding new spells to use and new pieces of equipment to wear, and recruiting a variety of companions, each with different classes and skills, to aid them in their travels. A PC may have up to five companions travelling with them in their party, with the player free to decide who to recruit and who to dismiss from the party.&lt;ref name=schoffel/&gt; Upon reaching the experience threshold for their current level, defined by their class, both the PC and companions can [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level up]], increasing their hits and occasionally improving their weapon proficiencies, with thieves provided additional points to distribute between their skills, and spellcasters gaining access to additional spell slots, sometimes gaining access to new ones for higher levels of magic. All characters are limited to a maximum number of 89,000 experience points in the game, with characters who multi-class being also affected by this cap - an elf who uses two classes may only earn half the cap in each, with experience divided equally between the two classes, while a human who dual-classed after earning a third of the cap in their base class, may only earn the other two thirds in their second class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |title=Planet Baldur's Gate: Experience Point Tables |publisher=IGN |url=http://www.planetbaldursgate.com/bg/character/classes/tables/xp.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010125083500/http://www.planetbaldursgate.com/bg/character/classes/tables/xp.shtml |archive-date=January 25, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main user interface consists of three action bars surrounding the main screen. The first bar consisting of buttons to the various options players can use, including a map of the party's location and the world, the journal that logs all details of notable events and all on-going and completed quests, character records for each member of the party, the inventories for each character, spellbooks containing all spells available for spellcasters, a time display that also acts as the pause mechanism when clicked, and the various game options. The second bar consists of the portraits of each character currently in the party, detailing their hit points, their order, and any positive and negative effects they are experiencing, with the portrait switching from colour to greyscale when the character has died. The third bar provides specific actions depending on the number of characters being controlled by the player; if one is selected, the player has the ability to switch between the weapons they are using, use any spells and items set up for quick use, and utilises a character's special abilities or those of certain pieces of equipment, but if more than one is selected, the bar displays options for conversing with or attacking NPCs, regardless of being friendly, neutral or hostile, stop what is being done, and change their formation to those available in the game.

The inventory system used in ''Baldur's Gate'' follows the conventions of the "[[Paper doll (gaming)|paper doll]]" mechanics, in that each character can equip items depending on what type they are - weapons, ammo, armour, helmet, necklace, rings, belt, cloak, feet, and usable. The number of items a character can both equip and carry is affected by their weight limit, which is determined by their Strength ability score; going over this limit will encumber the character causing them to move slowly or prevent them moving altogether, until they remove items from their inventory. The system notably indicates what equipment a character can not use as defined by their class, which also determine how many weapon slots they have available for weapons; by default, all character have two weapon slots along with an off-hand slot for shields and weapons, but some classes allow character to one or two extra weapon slots to use. In addition, characters may equip three stacks of ammo for ranged weapons (bows, crossbows and slings), and use three different types of usable items (potions, scrolls and wands). Items can be examined in the inventory, though most enchanted items require identification before their properties are known, while any cursed equipment can't be removed unless through magic or visiting a temple. Any potions found can be used without being set up for quick use, while mages can learn spells from scrolls that they do not have knowledge of and have room for in their spellbook; unlike priest classes, who have access to all the spells of each level magic upon acquiring a slot in that level, mages need to learn spells from scrolls found in their travels or bought from shops, but can learn those of higher levels that they do not have spell slots for, though higher game difficulties incur the possibility of failing to learn a new spell. In addition, any spells set to a spell slot cannot be used until the spellcaster rests first to "memorise" it.

Dialogue is an important aspect of the game, which relies heavily on it. Conversation can be initiated by players selecting a member of the party and clicking on a friendly or neutral NPC, though some conversation are initiated automatically when characters come close to them, and while most conversations are mainly text-based, some include spoken dialogue. Most conversation include a list of responses that a character can use, some that can provide information on certain topics, lead to quests, or access services, while others can influence a situation, such as provoking a fight, or finding another way to solve a problem.&lt;ref name=carr_burn06/&gt; Certain NPCs offer services that character can use when talking with them, including shops where characters can buy and sell items and get unknown enchanted items identified, inns where the party can rest in safety and recover lost hit points and memorise spells, and temples where characters can pay for healing services, such as resurrecting a dead party member.

Other features that affect gameplay include:

* The ability to customise their PC after creation, albeit with some restrictions.
* The ability to change the primary and minor colours used by each character.
* The ability to switch on/off the game's AI, and change what AI script a character uses ; one script might dictate they proceed to engage an enemy when spotted, while another might dictate they keep their eye out for traps.
* Most locations are hidden when first visited but are revealed as the character moves around them. A [[Fog of war#Simulations and games|fog of war]] effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them.
* A reputation system that tracks the moral actions of the PC and affects how they are perceived, changing if they resolve a problem or commit a crime in the view of witnesses. Higher reputations cause shops to decrease prices, while lower reputations cause shops to increase prices. Lower reputations may also lead to the character being attacked when in town. Companions are also affected by reputation, with evil companions leaving the party, even attacking it, if it is high, and good and neutral companions leaving when it is low. Some side quests also require a minimum reputation to begin. Certain NPCs may also react negatively or positively depending on their alignment and the player's reputation. 
* The ability to keep track of in-game time through the changes in lighting and the activity that is occurring. Characters become fatigued after spending a full in-game day, especially after travelling long distances between world map locations, and must rest to recover, either in an inn or camping out in the countryside/within a dungeon.
* Characters can be ambushed when camping out or travel long distances between world map locations.&lt;ref name=rollings_adams03/&gt;
* Players can play either in single-player mode, or in multiplayer mode. The latter allows up to six players to work together online with their own created characters.

===Setting===

''Baldur's Gate'' takes place in the fictional world of [[Ed Greenwood]]'s ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting, during the year of 1368DR in the midst of an apparent iron shortage, where items made with iron inexplicably rot and break.&lt;ref name=schoffel/&gt; Focusing upon the western shoreline of [[Faerûn]], the game is set within a stretch of the region known as the [[Sword Coast]], which contains a multitude of ecologies and terrains, including mountains, forests, plains, cities, and ruins, with the story encompassing both the city of [[Baldur's Gate (city)|Baldur's Gate]], the largest and most affluent city in the region, and the lands south of it, including the Cloud Peaks, the Wood of Sharp Teeth, the Cloakwood forest, the town of Beregost and the village of Nashkel, and the fortress citadel of [[Candlekeep]].&lt;ref name=oppegaard&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23425063.html |author= Oppegaard, Brett |title= Baldur's Gate Gets Even Better |work=[[The Columbian]] |date= September 26, 1999 |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}{{subscription|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the region, a variety of organisations from the ''Forgotten Realms'' setting also feature as part of the game's main story, including the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Red Wizard]]s of [[Thay (Forgotten Realms)|Thay]], [[The Iron Throne (Forgotten Realms)|The Iron Throne]], the [[Flaming Fist]], [[The Chill (Baldur's Gate)|The Chill]], The Black Talons, and the [[Harpers (Forgotten Realms)|Harpers]].

===Story===
The player plays as the young and orphaned ward of the mage Gorion. The two live in the ancient library fortress of Candlekeep. Abruptly, the Ward finds themselves ordered by Gorion to prepare to leave the citadel together during the night with no explanation. On the night of leaving Candlekeep, a mysterious armoured figure and his cohort ambushes the pair and orders Gorion to hand over the Ward. Gorion refuses, and dies in the ensuing battle, while ensuring that his Ward can escape. In the morning, the Ward encounters Imoen, a childhood friend and an orphan like them who lived in Candlekeep,&lt;ref name=carr_burn06/&gt; who had followed them in secret. With no safe hiding place available, Candlekeep no longer accessible to them without Gorion's influence to circumvent its admission fee, and the city of Baldur's Gate currently closed off to outsiders due to bandit raids, the Ward resolves to investigate the cause of the region's Iron Crisis.

Travelling to the mines of Nashkel, the main source of the region's iron, the Ward's party discovers that the mine's ore is being contaminated by a group of [[Kobold (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|kobolds]] led by a half-orc, and that they and the bandits plaguing the region are being controlled by an organization known as the Iron Throne, a merchant outfit operating out of Baldur's Gate. After sabotaging a mine operated by the Iron Throne in the Cloakwood that would presumably give them total control over the region's iron, the Ward's party head into the newly reopened Baldur's Gate. Venturing to the Throne's headquarters, the group learns that proof of the organization's involvement with the Iron Crisis was taken by one of the regional leaders when they and the rest of the leadership headed to Candlekeep for an important meeting. Revealing their findings to Duke Eltan, the leader of the [[Flaming Fist]], the group receive a rare and valuable book, which would allow them access into Candlekeep, in order to spy on the meeting. During their investigations in the citadel's library, the Ward discovers a prophecy written by the ancient seer Alaundo, foretelling how the offspring created during the [[Time of Troubles (Forgotten Realms)|Times of Trouble]] by the dead god [[Bhaal (Forgotten Realms)|Bhaal]], the Lord of Murder, will sow chaos until only one remains to become the new Lord of Murder. The Ward then finds a letter from Gorion revealing that the Ward is among the offspring of Bhaal, known as [[Bhaalspawn]]. During their stay at Candlekeep, the Ward's party is imprisoned for the murders of the Iron Throne leaders, regardless of whether they did so or not, until they can be transported to Baldur's Gate to be executed. Tethoril, a prominent keeper in Candlekeep, visits the party and reveals that a suspicious character the party met earlier, [[Sarevok|Koveras]], is really the foster son of one of the now dead Iron Throne leaders. His name is Sarevok, the one responsible for Gorion's murder, and also wishes to kill the Ward.

Believing the Ward to be innocent, Tethoril transports the party into the catacombs beneath the fortress, where the party battles their way through [[Doppelgänger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|doppelgängers]] taking on the form of people the Ward knew in Candlekeep. Returning to Baldur's Gate, the Ward's party find themselves accused of causing the Iron Crisis on the orders of the [[List of Forgotten Realms nations#Amn|Kingdom of Amn]], assassinating one of the city's Grand Dukes, and poisoning Duke Eltan. Forced to stay hidden from the Flaming Fist, the party discovers that the Iron Throne orchestrated the Iron Crisis to gain control of iron through their mine in the Cloakwood, while using doppelgängers to weaken other merchant outfits, ensuring that they would have a monopoly on iron. With tensions rising between Baldur's Gate and Amn, the organization hoped to sell the stockpiled iron to the city at exorbitant prices. Afterward, they aimed to de-escalate tensions between Baldur's Gate and Amn.

The party also discovers that Sarevok, having uncovered that he was a Bhaalspawn, hoped to fuel distrust between Baldur's Gate and Amn by making each think the other was responsible for creating the crisis, and cause them to go to war. Sarevok believed that the resulting carnage would be enough to allow him to become the new Lord of Murder. Due to the Ward's similar background, he hired assassins to kill them. Sarevok remained loyal to his father until the Iron Throne's meeting in Candlekeep threatened his plans, which led Sarevok to eliminate him and the other regional leaders of the Iron Throne before taking over the outfit and transferring their stores of iron to the city in order to be seen as a savior. He was also responsible for the poisoning of Duke Eltan and the assassination of one of the four Grand Dukes.

The Ward's party gain entry to the Duchal Palace, where the coronation of Sarevok as a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate would be held, and present evidence of his schemes. Exposed, Sarevok flees into an ancient underground ruin beneath Baldur's Gate, with the Ward and the party following after. The Ward confronts Sarevok within an ancient temple to Bhaal, and defeats him, saving the Sword Coast and ending their brother's schemes. In the final ending cinematic, Sarevok's tainted soul departs his body and travels deep underground to a large circular chamber of alcoves, and destroys a statue of himself contained in one of the alcoves, whereupon it is revealed that the other alcoves each contain a statue of a Bhaalspawn that exists in Faerûn.

==Development==
''Baldur's Gate'' was developed by Canadian game developer BioWare, a company founded by practicing physicians [[Ray Muzyka]] and  [[Greg Zeschuk]]. The game was initially titled ''Forgotten Realms''.&lt;ref name="NGen25"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=NG Alphas: Forgotten Realms|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|pages=113–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muzyka, "Our head programmer has actually read every one of the [Forgotten Realms] books - everything, every single one of the short stories and the paperbacks. He made a point of it. He really want to immerse himself."&lt;ref name="NGen25"/&gt; The game required 90 man-years of development, which was spent simultaneously creating the game's content and the BioWare Infinity Engine.&lt;ref name=muzyka20010502/&gt; The primary script engine for the game (used mainly as a debugging tool) was [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].&lt;ref name=gutschmidt2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tofer|first=Cameron|title=Re: lua and Baldur's gate|url=http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/1999-08/msg00056.html|website=lua-users mailing list archive}}&lt;!-- author is one of bioware lead programmers, so it's a RS on a subject --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[DirectDraw]] was used for the graphics.&lt;ref name="NGen25"/&gt;

''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'' was a major influence on ''Baldur's Gate'', particularly its design philosophy of having more than one possible method to achieve each goal.&lt;ref name="NGen25"/&gt;

Unusually for the time, the graphics were not [[Tile-based video game|built from tiles]]; each background was individually rendered, which greatly extended the amount of time needed to create the game.&lt;ref name="NGen25"/&gt; At the time that the game was shipped, none of the sixty-member team had previously participated in the release of a video game.&lt;ref name=carless2010816/&gt; The time pressure to complete the game led to the use of simple areas and game design.&lt;ref name=muzyka20010502/&gt; Ray Muzyka said that the team held a "passion and a love of the art," and they developed a "collaborative design spirit." He believes that the game was successful because of the collaboration with Interplay.&lt;ref name=carless2010816/&gt;

''Baldur's Gate'' was released on November 30, 1998, and was published by Black Isle Studios, an internal division of Interplay.&lt;ref name=muzyka20010502/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[IGN]] |url= http://uk.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-2/pc-13437 |title= Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn Review |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baldur's Gate'' received positive reviews from virtually every major computer gaming publication that reviewed it. At the time of the game's release, ''[[PC Gamer]] US'' said that ''Baldur's Gate'' "reigns supreme over every RPG currently available, and sets new standards for those to come."&lt;ref name=pcgus/&gt; ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'' called it "clearly the best ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (AD&amp;D) game ever to grace a PC screen".&lt;ref name=computer-shopper&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54299108.html |author= Ryan, Michael E. |title= Baldur's Gate: Better Gate Than Never |work= [[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]] |date= May 1, 1999 |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}{{subscription|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Maximum PC]]'' magazine compared the gameplay to ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'', but noted its more extensive selection of features and options. The pixel-based characters were panned, but the reviewer stated that "the gloriously rendered backgrounds make up for that shortcoming." The main criticism was of the problems with the [[path finding]] [[algorithm]] for [[non-player character]]s. Despite this, the game was deemed an "instant classic" because of the amount of customization allowed, the "fluid story lines", and the replayability.&lt;ref name=maxpc/&gt; The reviewer from ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' felt that the "basic buzz was positive" surrounding the development of the game. The "actual results are a mixed bag, but there's real promise for the future" thanks to the inclusion of the Infinity Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= [[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] |url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=593 |title= Baldur's Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IGN, ''Baldur's Gate'' did much to revive the [[role-playing video game]] genre.&lt;ref name="IGN profile"&gt;{{cite web |title= Baldur's Gate (PC) |url= http://uk.pc.ign.com/objects/009/009942.html|work= [[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Harris of Gamasutra wrote that it "rescued computer D&amp;D from the wastebasket."&lt;ref name="jharris" /&gt; According to [[GameSpy]], "''Baldur's Gate'' was a triumph [that] single-handedly revived the [computer role-playing game] and almost made gamers forgive Interplay for ''[[Descent to Undermountain]]''".&lt;ref name="rauschIV"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rausch |first=Allen |date= August 18, 2004 |url= http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/540/540115p3.html |title=A History of ''D&amp;D'' Video Games - Part IV |publisher= Game Spy |accessdate= November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN ranked ''Baldur's Gate'' No. 5 on their list of "The Top 11 Dungeons &amp; Dragons Games of All Time" in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/05/the-top-11-dungeons-dragons-games-of-all-time|title=The Top 11 Dungeons &amp; Dragons Games of All-Time|last=Johnson|first=Leif|date=2014-02-05|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Baldur's Gate'' was the first game in the [[Baldur's Gate (series)|''Baldur's Gate'' series]]. It was followed by the [[expansion pack]] ''[[Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast|Tales of the Sword Coast]]'' (1999), then the sequel ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' (2000) and its expansion pack ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal|Throne of Bhaal]]'' (2001). As of 2006, total sales for all releases in the series was almost five million copies.&lt;ref name=plunkett2009/&gt; The series set the standard for other games using [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|AD&amp;D]] rules, especially those developed by [[BioWare]] and [[Black Isle Studios]]: ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' (1999), ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' (2000), and ''[[Icewind Dale II]]'' (2002). The novel ''Baldur's Gate'' (1999) by [[Philip Athans]] was based on the game.

''Baldur's Gate'' was re-released along with its expansion in 2000 as ''Baldur's Gate Double Pack'', and again in 2002 as a three CD collection entitled ''Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga''. In 2002, the game and its expansion were released along with ''[[Icewind Dale]]'', ''[[Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter]]'' and ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' as the ''Black Isle Compilation''. In 2004, it was re-released, this time along with ''Icewind Dale II'', in ''Part Two'' of the compilation. [[Atari]] published the ''Baldur's Gate 4 in 1 Boxset'' including all four games on a combination of DVDs and CDs.{{when|date=June 2018}}

'''Bugg''' is a common dance style in [[Sweden]] and is very popular on the dancefloors, when  [[dansband]]s play. Bugg is a four-step dance and performed at different paces (120–180 BPM). Bugg is a [[partner dance]] and follows certain basic rules, but is essentially improvised, with the woman following the man's lead. [[Acrobatics|Acrobatic]] moves are not allowed on national or international dancecompetitions. Swedish Bugg belongs to the [[swing dance]] family and closely resembles [[Modern Jive]].

Bugg is both a very popular [[social dance]] as well as a [[competitive dance]] in [[Sweden]]. It also has the most [[competitor]]s and practitioners within the [[Swedish Dancesport Federation]].

There is also a variant called [[double bugg]] that is usually performed by one man and two women, but other combinations of three dancers may appear.

==Short history==
Swedish Bugg is a totally Swedish phenomenon and is also a variant of the early [[Lindy Hop]] ([[Jitterbug]]), which came to Sweden in the mid-1940s. In films from a famous dance place called [[Nalen]] in [[Stockholm]], one can see the Swedish style of [[Lindy Hop]] ([[Jitterbug]]) in which the Swedish Bugg has its origins. This dance style was then developed to the modern style we see today, danced in dance places throughout Sweden and now beginning to spread around the globe. This style has of course various dialects and variants, but the bases are more or less equal throughout the country.

When the [[dance competition]]s began in Sweden during the mid 70s, there was only one class for all participants, namely ''Free style''. This was then in 1983 divided into two different dance styles, ''Social bugg'' and ''Free style''. In 1984 this was changed again. A new style was created. These two new styles were then called ''Free style'' and Rock for a long period.

Later on these two dancestyles more or less was developed toward one single Bugg style and into what one can see today. Yet with different dialects and variants throughout the country, but without the acrobatic elements. The Swedish Bugg was from now on practised with great enthusiasm by many dancers and in all ages, from all of Sweden. Today, the Swedish Bugg is one of the most popular social dances in Swedish [[danceclub]]s (ext link: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130325181539/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaDanssportforbundet/KONTAKT/DistriktochForeningar/ swedish dance clubs]. It can also provide a gateway into other dance styles.

The '''Central Board of Film Censors''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|'''پاکستان مرکزی فلمی سینسر'''}}}}, ''Pakistan Markazi Filmi Sensor'', abbreviated as '''CBFC''') is a [[film censorship]] board and [[Motion picture content rating system|rating system]] body under the [[Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage (Pakistan)|Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting]] for the [[Government of Pakistan]]. It is tasked with regulating the public screening of films under the provisions of the ''Motion Picture Ordinance, 1979''. The head offices are located in [[Islamabad]], while two regional offices are located in [[Karachi]] and [[Lahore]].

==Function==
The ''Motion Pictures Ordinance, 1979'' focuses upon a broad policy framework and administrative procedures for the certification of films for public screening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/pk/pk047en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The film censorship code covers wide aspects of "morals and ethnics" which lays down the guiding principles for [[Cinema of Pakistan|cinema]] in Pakistan. Strict policy has been adopted to ensure that no scene or dialogue in a film is passed which is considered "derogatory to the accepted moral standards of the society". Certifications is refused if, in the opinion of the board, the film or any part thereof:
#ridicules, disparages or attacks Islam or any religious sect, caste and creed.
#questions the integrity, security or defense of Pakistan or hurts national sentiments.
#undermines public order, decency or morality, which includes vulgar dialogues, songs, or gestures.
#glorifies vice or crime or amounts to incitement of a criminal offense.

Any film refused certification may appeal within thirty days of the date of refusal.

==Certification==

* '''U rating'''
Any film with ''U certification'' is fit for unrestricted public screening and without the need for parental guidance. These films contain little violence, no sexual scenes and no abusive language.

* '''A rating'''
Any film with ''A certification'' is restricted to adults or needs parental guidance for viewing. These films contain significant violence, sexual scenes and abusive language and can include controversial adult themes considered unsuitable for young viewers.

"'''Counterfeit'''" is a song by the American [[nu metal]] band [[Limp Bizkit]] from their debut album ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]'' (1997). Notable for showcasing guitarist [[Wes Borland]]'s experimental playing style, the song was written by Borland, [[DJ Lethal]], [[Fred Durst]], [[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]] and [[Sam Rivers (bassist)|Sam Rivers]] as a response to local bands that copied Limp Bizkit's style.

The song was released as the album's first [[single (music)|single]] in 1997, prior to the album's release. "Counterfeit" was the subject of controversy when [[Interscope Records]] paid a Portland radio station to play the song fifty times as a paid advertising, sparking [[payola]] accusations and criticism of the band and label. In 1999, the song was reissued as another single under the title "Counterfeit Countdown". It also appears on multiple compilations.

The song originated from the band's frustrations at the fact that other bands were copying Limp Bizkit's style.&lt;ref name=Devenish&gt;{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Borland, "They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, 'Oh, let's get baggy pants and dress like kind of [[hip hop|hip-hoppy]] and, you know, play [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rapping|rap]].' [...] five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were trying to sound like us. It was ridiculous. That's where the song 'Counterfeit' came from."&lt;ref name=Devenish/&gt;

On the recorded version, Borland played without a [[guitar pick]], performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions.&lt;ref name=Devenish/&gt; Borland's playing featured octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound.&lt;ref name=HurwitzRiley&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Tobias |authorlink1= |last2=Riley |first2=Glenn |title=7-String Guitar |date=June 1, 2002 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |isbn=0-7390-2807-3 |pages=30–2 |chapter=Rhythm guitar riffs in the style of Wes Borland }}&lt;/ref&gt; Borland also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes and hypnotic, droning [[Lick (music)|licks]] to create a disorienting effect.&lt;ref name=HurwitzRiley/&gt;

== Release ==

"Counterfeit" was released as a single in 1997 after to the release of ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]'', and was the first single released from the album. It featured the album versions of the songs "Counterfeit" and "Nobody Loves Me", and a shorter edit of "Counterfeit" intended for radio airplay.&lt;ref name=Allmusic1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/counterfeit-nobody-loves-me-r313395 |title=Counterfeit/Nobody Loves Me |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second single of the song was released in 1999 under the title "Counterfeit Countdown", containing three remixes and the album and radio edits of the song.&lt;ref name=Allmusic2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/counterfit-countdown-r431800 |title=Counterfeit Countdown |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band filmed a [[music video]] for the song depicting a teenage boy with [[bleach]]ed hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black [[tar]]-like substance. He puts on a [[fly]] mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated into some sort of human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.

[[Interscope Records]] proposed to the band that the label pay [[USD|$]]5,000 to guarantee that Portland radio station [[KXL-FM|KUFO-FM]] play the song "Counterfeit" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope.&lt;ref name=Devenish51&gt;{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=51–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MTVJuly1998&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431305/limp-bizkit-pays-counterfeit-play.jhtml |title=Limp Bizkit Pays For 'Counterfeit' Play |author= |date=July 1, 1998 |work= |publisher=[[MTV News]] |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as "[[payola]]".&lt;ref name=Devenish51/&gt;&lt;ref name=MTVJuly1998/&gt; The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a "brilliant marketing move".&lt;ref name=Devenish51/&gt; Durst stated, "It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing."&lt;ref name=Devenish51/&gt;

The two singles released for the song were not well received by critics. [[Allmusic]] gave the 1997 single two out of five stars.&lt;ref name=Allmusic1/&gt; The 1999 reissue, similarly, was also not well received, receiving the same rating from the website as the previous single.&lt;ref name=Allmusic2/&gt; Reviewing the 1999 "Lethal Dose Extreme Guitar Mix" by DJ Lethal, Allmusic writer Bradley Torreano criticized DJ Lethal's decision to remove the original music in favor of a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] beat, writing, "[it makes] Durst's shaky lyrics sound that much worse [...] [DJ Lethal] only keeps a little of the original chugging guitar."&lt;ref name=Torreano&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/new-old-songs-r563643/review |title=''New Old Songs'' - Limp Bizkit |author=Torreano, Bradley |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cover art ==
The cover art for the ''Counterfeit Countdown'' single was produced by Christopher Karl Salat "BeZerk" and M. Figueroa "GONZO247" of the Aerosol Warfare graffiti crew from Houston, Texas. The sculpture was created by "BeZerk" using spray paint cans, clock parts, colored tape and white/red audio chords. The piece is entitled "Aerosol Warfare 2" (US Copyright: VA0001131224) and was displayed by Christopher in many art galleries all over the U.S. before appearing on the single used to promote Limp Bizkit’s song "Counterfeit". The photograph of the sculpture used on the single was taken by "GONZO247" at the “Worship Center”, in Houston’s downtown metropolitan area. Aerosol Warfare was also an underground video documentary about hip hop culture that circulated the underground during the 90's golden age of hip hop. The video kept up with current underground subjects such as; MC/Beatbox battles, graffiti marathons, graffiti artist interviews, breakdancing, and the new styles of the current graffiti movement. Aerosol Warfare is still active in the Arts scene in Houston, Texas.

==Plot==
Ahana ([[Bipasha Basu]]) opens a hotel in Glendale, [[Himachal Pradesh]]. During the day of the opening party, she meets Kunal Anand ([[Imran Abbas (actor)|Imran Abbas]]), a novelist, and they become attracted to each other. When a couple and the hotel cook are killed by an unknown creature, Kunal decides to help Ahana. Romance grows between Ahana and Kunal and they consummate their relationship. After a few peaceful days, the creature strikes again and wreaks havoc in the hotel; Ahana finds herself facing off against a ten-feet long creature with the legs and tail of a dinosaur, and the body and head of a human. Professor Sadanand ([[Mukul Dev]]) scares off the creature with a burning log.

The next morning, the injured guests and hotel staff get evicted by police. The professor explains that the creature is a Brahmarakshas, a man-eating mutant which is the result of [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]], the Hindu god of creation, cursing demons to become such creatures with no salvation, eternally condemned to roam on earth and suffer. Brahmarakshasas still lurk in dense forests of India, but their sightings are as relevant as sightings of [[UFOs]]. He suggests Ahana and Kunal to leave if they wish to stay alive. Ahana refuses to leave the hotel, determined to fight back.

Ahana, Kunal and the professor are joined in the fight by two cops, Inspector Rana ([[Deepraj Rana]]) and Inspector Chaubey ([[Bikramjeet Kanwarpal]]), but the Brahmarakshasa kills Chaubey. They learn that a [[Sarpanch]] filed a report of a Brahmarakshasa sighting a few years back and go to meet him. He tells them that decades ago, a hunter killed a Brahmarakshasa, and the only person who can help them now is Dr. Moga, the son of the late hunter. Kunal and Ahana set for [[Shimla]] to meet the doctor. On the way, Kunal reveals his true identity as Karan Malhotra, the chairman of the builder group that compelled Ahana's father to commit suicide. He tells her that he felt guilty and wanted to apologize. Heartbroken, Ahana breaks up with Karan.

Dr. Moga explains that Brahmarakshasa can be killed by a weapon dipped in the temple pond of the [[Brahma Temple, Pushkar|Brahma Temple in Pushkar]] but is effective only if dipped into the pond on night of [[Kartik Purnima]].Since [[Kartik Purnima]] is many days away, Dr. Moga gives Ahana an old rifle with which his father had killed a Brahmarakshasa. Ahana, the professor, and Rana enter the den of the Brahmarakshasa; Rana and the professor are killed by the beast, and when it tries to attack Ahana, Karan saves her. With Karan's help, Ahana manages to kill the creature with the last bullet in the rifle.

A few days later, the hotel is ready to be reopened. Ahana forgives Karan and they rekindle their relationship.

==Reception==
The trailer of the movie was released in July 2014. [[Koimoi]] called it "a half baked trailer that relies solely on 3D".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mohar Basu |url=http://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-popular/creature-trailer-review-a-half-baked-trailer-that-expects-3d-to-do-the-magic/ |title=Creature Trailer Review: A Half Baked Trailer That Expects 3D To Do The Magic |publisher=Koimoi.com |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vinayak Chakravorty of ''[[India Today]]'' has given 2 stars to the movie stating that it suffered from budget constraints, "serves little intrigue and banks on the sporadic jolts courtesy loud music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=India Today |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/creature-3d-bipasha-vikram-bhatt-movie-review/1/382652.html |title=Movie review: Creature 3D is absolute enjoyment|publisher=India Today |date= |accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anupama Chopra  said, "This is the type of film in which the human beings are so annoying that you are actually rooting for the creature that kills them. In fact, the creature had more personality than all of them put together. In an effective opening sequence, Vikram introduces him to us by only showing us isolated parts; his talons, monstrous eyes, powerful tail. I think this Creature should have demanded a better script."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/reviews/moview-review-by-anupama-chopra-bipasha-basu-s-creature-3d-is-foolish/article1-1263546.aspx#sthash.ahkBKloH.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box-office==
''India Today'' reports that the film had a budget of Rs.18 crore with an additional Rs.7 crore spent on a marketing campaign.&lt;ref name ="IT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bipasha Basu's Creature 3D recovers cost, making profit|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/creature-3d-starring-bipasha-basu-recovers-cost-making-profit/1/383142.html|work=India Today|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koimoi reported the film opened on 1400 screens, with an average occupancy.&lt;ref name="koimoiopen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koimoi.com/box-office/creature-3d-opening-day-occupancy-report/|title=Creature 3D: Opening Day Occupancy Report|date=12 September 2014|work=[[Koimoi]]|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film returned the financials but did not make a big impact making it just a hit.

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">{{About|a rule applicable to U.S. broadcast licensees with respect to political candidates|rules on matters of public controversy|Fairness Doctrine|the former cable-news show|Equal Time (TV program)}}

The '''equal-time rule''' specifies that U.S. [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcast stations must provide an equivalent opportunity to any opposing [[politics|political]] candidates who request it. This means, for example, that if a station gives a given amount of time to a candidate in prime time, it must do the same for another candidate who requests it, at the same price if applicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Philip |title=Media Law for Producers |date=Feb 11, 2013 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781136046025 |page=340 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5vcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340 |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule originated in §18 of the Radio Act of 1927; it was later superseded by the [[Communications Act of 1934]]. A related provision, in §315(b), requires that broadcasters offer time to candidates at the same rate as their "most favored advertiser".

The equal-time rule was created because the FCC was concerned that broadcast stations could easily manipulate the outcome of elections by presenting just one point of view, and excluding other candidates. The equal-time rule should not be confused with the now-defunct [[Fairness Doctrine]], which dealt with presenting balanced points of view on matters of public importance.

There are four exceptions to the equal-time rule. If the airing was within a documentary, bona fide news interview, scheduled newscast or an on-the-spot news event, the equal-time rule does not apply. Since 1983, political debates not hosted by the media station are considered "news events," and as a result, are not subject to the rule. Consequently, these debates may include only major-party candidates without having to offer air time to minor-party or independent candidates. [[Talk show]]s and other regular news programming from syndicators, such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', are also declared exempt from the rule by the FCC on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/anderson-cooper-talk-show-269175|title=Anderson Cooper's Talk Show Is a News Program, FCC Rules; The government regulators have determined talk show qualifies as news and is thus exempt from obligations to giving political candidates equal air time.|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|date=2 December 2011|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equal-time rule was temporarily suspended by Congress in 1960 in order to permit the Kennedy-Nixon debates to take place.&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza D. 1960:LBJ vs. JFK vs. Nixon. Union Square Press 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zapple Doctrine]] was similar to the equal-time rule, but applied to different political campaign participants. The equal-time rule applies to the political candidate only. The Zapple Doctrine had the same purpose and requirements of equivalent coverage opportunity as the equal-time rule, but its scope included the candidate's spokesman and supporters, not the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Decides that it will No Longer Enforce the Zapple Doctrine – Killing the Last Remnant of the Fairness Doctrine|url=http://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2014/05/articles/fcc-decides-that-it-will-no-longer-enforce-the-zapple-doctrine-killing-the-last-remnant-of-the-fairness-doctrine/|website=Broadcast Law Blog|publisher=wbklaw|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Exotic Erotic Ball''' (often referred to as '''The Ball''' or '''Perry Mann's Exotic Erotic Ball'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exoticeroticball.com/&lt;/ref&gt;) was held annually around [[Halloween]] time (usually the weekend before Halloween Night) in the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area of [[California]] and was the longest-running public adult-themed event in the world. Over three decades, the annual indoor event became a major attraction in the [[San Francisco Bay]] and was attended by nearly half a million people since its inception with steadily increasing growth in attendance each year until 2010, when the event was cancelled due to poor ticket sales and cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-10-23/bay-area/24840491_1 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Henry K. | last=Lee | title=Exotic Erotic Ball moving to Richmond | date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 ball was never planned. Due to the worldwide popularity of the event the City of [[San Francisco]] issued three proclamations for “Exotic Erotic Ball Day,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56325487.html Mayor Willie announced October 23rd 'Exotic Erotic Ball Day' in San Francisco] (Press release), Highbeam Research&lt;/ref&gt; twice by Mayor [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]] in 1999 and again in 2001, and once by Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] in 2004. In 2011 and 2012, similar but unrelated events, Masquerotica and the XO Ball &amp; Expo, respectively, filled the void left by the demise of the original Exotic Erotic.

==Description==
Many attendees of the Exotic Erotic Ball came to the event in wildly elaborate, creative, and sexy [[Halloween costume]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/28/BAJBT2D25.DTL&amp;feed=rss.bayarea Acres of fishnet and flesh at Exotic Erotic Ball], SFGate&lt;/ref&gt; to compete in the annual “Best Costume” contest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbannetwork.com/cms/index.php?news=1092 The Ball's World Famous Costume Contests], Urban Network&lt;/ref&gt; which in later years typically awarded the winner prize money and merchandise in the $10,000 USD range. 

While the Exotic Erotic Ball by definition would be considered a “[[Festival]]” the event is rarely categorized into conventional terms by attendees, the media, or event organizers. Because of the broad spectrum of conventional and [[unconventional]] entertainment offered on multiple stages at the Exotic Erotic Ball, it may be described as a combination of Adult-themed; Halloween festival, [[Music Festival]], [[Burlesque]] show, [[Lingerie party]], [[Masquerade ball]], [[Fetish club]], [[Swingers party]] and [[Adult Industry]] [[Trade Show]].

From 2004 through 2009, organizers expanded the Exotic Erotic Ball to include the [[Exotic Erotic Expo]]. The [[Exotic Erotic Expo|expo]] was a two-day Adult-Expo typically held the day before and the day of the Exotic Erotic Ball. Activities included panel discussions on [[First Amendment rights]] with [[adult actress]], actors, and media, [[wine tasting]]s with [[porn stars]], and various oddities such as the "spiritual oasis" with [[psychic reading]]s and massage, [[body painting]], a classic [[adult cinema]], and a human petting zoo. It also features a commercial area with [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] and exhibitors who showcase the latest in exotic fashion, [[erotic art]], adult products, games, websites, and adult novelties. 

In 2008, 26,341 people participated in the combined Exotic Erotic Ball and Exotic Erotic Expo.

== History ==
Perry Mann organized the first Exotic Erotic Ball in 1979 to raise campaign funds for his business partner and best friend, the late [[Louis Abolafia]], who ran for President of the United States under the [[Nudist Party]] with the slogan: “I have nothing to hide.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exoticeroticball.com/about.php History of the Exotic Erotic Ball], Exoterica Ball&lt;/ref&gt; Louis also coined the phrase, [[Make love, not war|“Make love, not war!”]] and his legendary [[Greenwich Village]] love-ins inspired the New York press to crown him “The Love King.”  Abolafia had previously run in 1968 under the Cosmic Love Party, even then with the slogan "What have I got to hide?" Abolafia died in 1995, reportedly of a drug overdose.
 
The Nudist Ball, a precursor to the Exotic Erotic Ball, took place in Mann's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California]] apartment in 1978 and attracted a few hundred people. In 1979, it moved to California Hall on Turk Street and officially became the Exotic Erotic Ball, with 800 to 900 people paying $10 apiece.

The location changed over the years ending up at its last home at the [[Cow Palace]] in Daly City. In May 2004, Republican legislators in California—countering a move to outlaw gun shows at the Cow Palace—unsuccessfully sought to ban the ball as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/5/20/150948.shtml, retrieved September 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the expo and ball relocated from the Cow Palace to the new Craneway Pavilion in [[Richmond, California]]. The move meant that instead of having 20,000 people, organizers would be limited to 14,000 attendees into the Craneway Pavilion on the Richmond waterfront over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-08-21/bay-are/22229039_1_waterfront-richmond-city-councilman-move | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Matthai | last=Kuruvila | title=Councilman Says New Name for Richmond Would Jazz Up Its Image / Richmond-by-the-Bay has cachet, he thinks | date=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizers expected 7,500 attendees, but canceled the 2010 event the day before it was scheduled to occur, citing poor ticket sales  and cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Contra Costa Times|title=Exotic Erotic Ball in Richmond canceled day before event|first=Katherine|last=Tam|date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many longtime Exotic Erotic Ball attendees were apparently unwilling to travel to Richmond, an industrial city located 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, citing its longtime reputation for being crime-plagued (the city's own police department described Richmond as having a chronic violent crime problem for "decades" and in 2010 was ranked as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_16688493?source=most_viewed East Bay cities ranked among most dangerous in U.S.], Bay City News Services. Contra Costa Times. November 23, 2010. Retrieved November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiveoh"&gt;[http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.aspx?nid=82 RPD main page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The Exotic Erotic Ball fostered strong ties to the San Francisco community. Over the years, the Ball distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbannetwork.com/cms/index.php?news=1092 Exotic Erotic Ball and Snoop Dogg Combine to Raise Funds for The Healing Circle], The Urban Network&lt;/ref&gt; supporting causes such as helping the victims of natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Google News"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NXkOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=goEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826,8007921&amp;dq=exotic-erotic-ball Earthquake-rattled San Francisco returning to abnormal], Google News&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS,&lt;ref name="Google News"/&gt; homelessness, domestic violence, child abuse, and has always supported freedom of expression and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] Rights. The Exotic Erotic Ball hosted an annual blood drive with Blood Centers of the Pacific whereby free tickets were offered to those who donated blood.

For several years, Mann also held an Exotic Erotic New Year's Eve Ball, but discontinued it in 1995. 

In 2001, Mann released the book ''The Exotic Erotic Ball: Twenty Years of the World's Sexiest Party'' ({{ISBN|156171917X}}). Perry Mann: "My late partner's Louis' expression 'Make Love, Not War' was once the rallying cry of a generation. I don't think that message has ever been more timely or important than it is today, and I don't think our show has ever been a more needed diversion." {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In September 2011, Mann announced that they were "pursuing an international opportunity" and "editing our 30-year documentary" but not producing an event. They did recommend a new event called: ''Masquerotica,'' to be held on October 22, 2011 at The Concourse in San Francisco—one of the old Ball's longtime venues. In an announcement posted on the Exotic Erotic Ball's Website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exoticeroticball.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Mann promised, "You'll see a lot of familiar faces ... and other body parts." Masquerotica is produced by different local event producers and other than being recommended by Mann has no affiliation to the Exotic Erotic Ball. Another similar but unrelated event, held in September 2012 at Cow Palace, is the XO Ball and Expo.

'''Thomas Frederick Parnell''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (29 September 1862 &amp;ndash; 14 October 1957), known professionally as '''Fred Russell''', was an English [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]]. Usually credited as being the first to use a knee-sitting figure, he is known as "The Father of Modern Ventriloquism".

==Biography==
Russell was born in [[London]], and began his career as a journalist, but from 1882 began performing his hobby of ventriloquism in public. In 1886, when he was editor of the ''[[Hackney and Kingsland Gazette]]'', he was offered a professional engagement at London's [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy [[Ventriloquism|dummy]] "Coster Joe", broke from the prevailing format of a family of dummies, establishing a precedent for performers such as [[Edgar Bergen]] and [[Paul Winchell]].

According to ''[[The Times]]'' obituary, he changed his name because of the political flavour of "[[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]]".

In 1910, Russell published a book on his craft entitled ''Ventriloquism and Kindred Arts''. His act remained popular for several decades, involving prolonged tours of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as well as visits to the United States and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. In 1938 he appeared at the [[Royal Variety Performance|Royal Command Performance]]. He was active in promoting the [[variety show]] genre and was an early and leading member of the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]]. He was a founder of the [[Variety Artistes' Federation]]. In 1948 he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his long services to the profession.

He continued to perform late in life, giving televised [[music hall]] performances in 1952, billed as "the oldest ventriloquist in the world".  He died in [[Wembley]], aged 95.

Fred Russell lived in [[Kenilworth Court]] in Putney, London, from 1914 to 1926. A blue plaque by the entrance of Kenilworth Court commemorates him.

On October 29, 1999, in [[Los Angeles]], he stretched the skin on his abdomen to a total length of 6.25 inches, earning him the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sapienplus.com/garry-turner-stretch/|title=Garry Turner - Stretch - Superhuman 65 - Real life Superhumans|date=2016-04-10|work=Real life Superhumans|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/72387-stretchiest-skin|title=Stretchiest skin|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was born, the midwife only mentioned that he had loose skin. That was the only clue of his condition.

'''German playing cards''' are a style of [[playing cards]] used in many parts of [[Central Europe]]. Playing cards (''Spielkarten'') entered [[German-speaking]] lands around the late 1370s. The earliest cards were likely Latin-suited like in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Detlef|title=Altdeutsche Spielkarten 1500-1650|date=1993|publisher=Germanischen Nationalmuseums|location=Nuremberg|pages=19-21|ref=Hoffmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much experimentation, the cards settled into new [[suit (cards)|suits]] of [[Acorns (card suit)|Acorns]] (''Eichel''), Leaves (''Grün'', ''Blatt'', ''Laub'' or ''Gras''), Hearts (''Herz'') and Bells (''Schelle'' or "Schell") around 1450.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=10–29|ref=Dummett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related [[Swiss playing cards]] are used in [[German-speaking Switzerland]]. The French suit symbols were derived from the German ones around 1480. German-suited cards spread throughout Central Europe into areas that were once under German or [[Austria]]n control ([[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Croatia]], [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]], [[Vojvodina]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]], and parts of [[Poland]]). They were also produced and used as far east as [[Russia]] until the early 20th century. German-suited decks are not well known all over these countries including parts of Germany itself as they have been undergoing strong competition from [[French playing cards]] since the late 17th-century. Traditional card games in which the German suits are used include [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Schafkopf]], [[Doppelkopf]] and [[Watten (card game)|Watten]].

German suited decks tend to have fewer cards than either the [[French playing cards|French]], [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish]], or [[Italian playing cards|Italian sets]]. The typical northern German pack has 32 cards ranking from 7, 8, 9, 10, Under [[Jack (playing card)|Knave]] (''[[Unter (playing card)|Unter]]'' = inferior / sergeant), Over Knave (''[[Ober (playing card)|Ober]]'' = superior / officer), [[King (card)|King]] (''König''), and [[Ace (card)|Ace]] (''Ass'') for a total of 32 cards. The "Ace" is really a [[Deuce (playing card)|Deuce]] (''Daus'') as usually indicated by its two pips. Southern patterns have 36 cards by including the 6.

In Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, the 6 of Bells is known as the ''[[Weli]]'' or ''Belle'' which is often used as a [[Wild card (card games)|wild card]]. The ''Weli'' first appeared around 1855 in the discontinued Tyrolean pattern and later the Salzburg and William Tell patterns. The 6 of Acorns is known as the ''Spitz'' or ''Soacher'' and is of comparable use, with the ''Weli'' being the higher card. For instance, in the Bavarian [[Watten (card game)|Watten]] game the top three cards following the respective trump ace are - in descending order: ''Maxe'' (= the King of Hearts, nicknamed after [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Bavaria's first King]]), ''Belle'' (or ''Welle'') and ''Spitz''. With the exception of the New Altenburg pattern, all cards with the rank of 10 include the Roman numeral X at the top centre of the card.

[[File:Dauskarte mit Schwein.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Sau'' deuce of bells, 1573]]
The ace in German and Swiss German sets have a peculiar history. Aces disappeared from German decks during the 15th century. When the Ace was promoted above the King in French packs during the 16th century, the deuce did so as well in Germany leading to the conflation of the Ace and Eeuce.  This is why in some sets the ace depicts two pips and is also called a ''[[Daus]]'' (deuce). Confusion is avoided when the 7 or 6 became the lowest card in most packs during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; Players also avoid confusion by alternatively calling the Ace/Deuce a ''Sau'' (sow).

==Patterns==
Many regions have their own pattern (''Bild'') which features their own unique artwork or number of cards. Some patterns are descended from much earlier ones like the Saxon pattern which can trace their ancestry to the 15th-century Stukeley type cards named after their identifier, [[William Stukeley]], in 1763.

Northern patterns have 32 cards and are used to play [[Skat (card game)|Skat]]. In northern patterns, the acorns are red. The only traditional northern pattern still in production is the Saxon pattern where only pip cards have corner indices. It is a product of a long evolution from the primitive Stukeley type cards imported from Nuremberg.&lt;ref name="Schwerdterkarten"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kranich|first1=Jurgen|last2=Radau|first2=Sigmar|last3=Schlede|first3=Stefan|title=Schwerdterkarten Band vol 1|date=2009|publisher=Studien zur Spielkarte|location=Berlin|ref=Schwerdterkarten}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been marginalized by the New Altenburg or ''German pattern'', created by Walter Krauss (1908-1985) in the former [[East Germany]], which added corner indices to every card but the Aces.&lt;ref&gt;further history of this pattern: http://www.altacarta.com/english/research/germany-DDR-pattern.html pictures of the original design: http://www.altacarta.com/overview/DDR-d.html pictures of the second (present) design with queens from third design: http://www.altacarta.com/overview/DDR.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="East Germany"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollett |first1=Andrea |title=Patterns from former East Germany |url=http://playingcards.freewebpages.org/cards88.htm |website=Andy's Playing Cards (archived) |accessdate=2 February 2016 |ref=East Germany |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305190708/http://playingcards.freewebpages.org/cards88.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 36 card Bavarian (Munich and Stralsund types), Franconian, and Salzburg (or ''einfachdeutsche'') patterns are descended from the Old Bavarian pattern which itself goes back to the 15th-century Augsburg pattern.&lt;ref name="Hausler"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hausler|first1=Manfred|title=From Schongau to Saint Petersburg|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2006|volume=35|issue=2|pages=96–110|ref=Hausler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bavarian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Bavarian pattern|url=http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-53.html|publisher=[[International Playing-Card Society]]|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=Bavarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their most notable feature are that the Obers and Unters are engaged in combat except in the suit of leaves where they accompany their fighting comrades by playing musical instruments. Since the 1980s, Italian manufacturers have included 5s into their Salzburg decks to allow the German speaking South Tyroleans to play Italian card games that require 40 cards with suits they are more familiar with. Salzburg decks also inherited the "Weli" from its extinct sibling, the Tyrolean pattern.&lt;ref name="Tyrol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Later Tyrol pattern|url=http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-46.html|publisher=[[International Playing-Card Society]]|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=Tyrol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bohemian (or Prague) pattern is also descended from the Old Bavarian but has only 32 cards like the northern ones. The Salzburg and Bohemian patterns are also not reversible and lack corner indices. Most games require only 32 cards by excluding the 6s such as [[Schafkopf]]. Games that require the full deck include [[Jass]] and [[Tarock]].

===Württemberg===
[[File:Württemberg pattern Old and New.jpg|thumb|Old and new types of the face cards.]]
The [[Württemberg]] pattern was invented around 1865 by C.L. Wüst and carries many unique features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-98Wuert.html Württemberg pattern] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 9 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The kings were copied from French-suited patterns now found in the Netherlands and Portugal. The Obers were inspired by the [[Knight (playing card)|Knights]] in Adler-[[Cego]] decks used in nearby [[Baden]]. Unters are [[Journeyman years|journeymen]].&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=61–114|ref=Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; A younger type of this pattern, using different court designs also exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.froja.de/karten/karten.php?menu_id=2_11 Würtembergisches Doppelbild] at Meine Spielkarten Seite. Retrieved 9 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the present, the cards are sold as a doubled pack of 48 cards (24 unique cards duplicated). The duplicated cards (7, 10, U, O, K, A of each suit) are used to play [[Doppelkopf]], [[Pinochle]], and [[Gaigel]]. They used to be produced in 36 card packs (with every card unique), like other southern patterns, to play Württembergischer Tarock. This was the original format but by 1985 it was restricted to the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] where it died out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deutsche Bilder-Deutsche Farben|date=1985|publisher=F.X. Schmid|location=Prien am Chiemsee|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pressman Toy Corporation|Pressman Toy]] has published a 48 card version where every card is unique to play [[Karnöffel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/61849/karnoffel Karnöffel] at [[BoardGameGeek]]. Retrieved 12 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the younger type and is mislabeled as the Bavarian pattern.

===William Tell===

[[File:Suit of Leaves - William Tell pack.jpg|thumb|320px|The suit of Leaves in a William Tell pattern German-suited pack]]
The [[William Tell]] or Double German (''doppeldeutsche'') pattern is popular throughout the former [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The Ober and Unter cards depict William Tell and other characters from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[William Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]]'' (the title character is Ober of Acorns). The play's first Hungarian performance was in 1833 and the first decks were made by József Schneider of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] around 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/tell-1.html Tell pattern type 1] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 9 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters from the drama were chosen to avoid censorship at the time of the Hungarian opposition to [[Habsburg]] rule. The story, after all, was about a successful revolt against the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name="Trift"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doppeldeutsch: Wilhelm Tell und die Ungarn (Tell cards history)|url=http://trift.org/diary/doppeldeutsch-wilhelm-tell-und-die-ungarn|publisher=trift.org|accessdate=20 June 2016|ref=Trift}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Austrians began producing this deck, they changed two of the characters. The Aces or Deuces depict the four seasons which are also somewhat different in the Austrian and Hungarian versions. The Slovak-Moravian version follows the Austrian version but doesn't label the characters or the seasons. The Kings don't represent anyone in particular and are shown mounted on horses. Except for the Aces, all pip cards have Roman numerals. The suit symbols are also slightly different, most notably the leaves are now half yellow and end with three tips. They come in packs of 32, 33 (with the ''Weli''), or 36 cards. They are sometimes called "Swiss cards" due to the nationality of the characters but this pattern is not used in Switzerland. In Hungary, they are called "magyar kártya", i.e. "Hungarian cards".

The characters and seasons depicted by the cards are as follows:
* '''Hearts'''
** Unter: [[Werner Stauffacher]] or Kuoni the shepherd
** Ober: [[Hermann Gessler]]
** Deuce: [[Spring (season)|Spring]], a young woman picking flowers
* '''Bells'''
** Unter: [[Arnold von Melchtal]] or Itel Reding
** Ober: Stüssi the Ranger
** Deuce: [[Summer]], a young woman haymaking with a sickle
*'''Leaves'''
** Unter: [[Walter Fürst]]
** Ober: Ulrich of Rudenz
** Deuce: [[Autumn]], two boys treading [[grapes]]
*'''Acorns'''
** Unter: Rudolf Harras
** Ober: [[William Tell]]
** Deuce: [[Winter]], an old woman carrying firewood

===German-French hybrid suited decks===
[[image:Schnapskarten_dt-fr.jpg|thumb|An Austrian hybrid deck with the Tell pattern on top and the Vienna pattern on the bottom]]
After the [[unification of Germany|unification]] and [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]], compromise decks were created to help players from around the country who were used to different suits. The [[History of Skat|Skat Congress]] decks split cards diagonally with one half using the pattern with French suits and the other half using the pattern with German suits. This is not unique to Germany as similar split decks are found in Austria, Switzerland and even France.&lt;ref&gt;This is due to the fact that the French regions of [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]] (nowadays : [[Grand-Est]]) were once German territory&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turnierbild pack was created for official Skat tournaments, using the French suited [[Berlin pattern]] but with German colours (green Spades and yellow Diamonds).&lt;ref name=pcg1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playingcards.freewebpages.org/cards19.htm |title=Andy's Playing Cards - Shapes, Sizes and Colours |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221095404/http://playingcards.freewebpages.org/cards19.htm |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disney's Hercules: The Animated Series''''' is an American animated television series based on the [[Hercules (1997 film)|1997 film of the same name]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Heracles|myth]]. The series premiered in syndication on August 31, 1998, and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through its [[ABC Kids (United States)|Disney's One Saturday Morning]] block on September 12, 1998. The syndicated run lasted 52 episodes, while the ABC run lasted 13 episodes.&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Walt_Disney_Studios/Television/Disney_s_Hercules/ Disney's Hercules]". ''www.bcdb.com'',  May 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
''Disney's Hercules'', like the animated series ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|Disney's The Little Mermaid]]'', is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the 1997 theatrically released [[animated]] film of the same name ([[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]) and is based on his teenaged adventures, though it is not a [[prequel]] to the film of the same name (''Disney's The Little Mermaid'' featured tales of a 16-year-old Ariel which occurred before the start of [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|the theatrical film]]) or truly a [[sequel]] like ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Disney's Aladdin]]'' (whose tales takes place after the [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|original film]] and [[The Return of Jafar]]). Rather, the ''Hercules'' TV series is a set during the film's song "One Last Hope", during his years in training on the Isle of Idra under the tutelage of Philoctetes (Phil) the [[satyr]]. Many of the [[Greek gods|Olympian Gods]] and Goddesses only glimpsed during the film pay visit to the young [[hero]]-to-be and help or hinder him in his adventures. Other characters from the film that appear are the evil god [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] (voiced by [[James Woods]]) and winged stallion [[Pegasus]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). [[Corey Burton]] portrayed Hercules' father Zeus, as [[Rip Torn]] did not return.

==Plot==
The series follows Hercules, as a teenager, training as a hero, as well as trying to adjust to life. With his free-spirited friend [[Icarus]], his future-seeing friend [[Cassandra]], and his teacher [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Phil|Philoctetes]] ("Phil"), he battles his evil uncle [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Hades|Hades]]. Like all teenagers though, Hercules has to worry about [[peer pressure]] when the snobbish prince [[Adonis]] ridicules him. The series notably contradicts several events in the original film.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Disney's Hercules characters}}
The main cast of the series includes:
*[[Hercules]] (voiced by [[Tate Donovan]]) – The god-turned-mortal [[hero]]-in-training; thus, he is half-mortal, half-god. He is the son of both Zeus and Hera (in contrast to the myth).
*[[Philoctetes]] (voiced by [[Robert Costanzo]]) – The [[satyr]] hero trainer. One of the few characters from the movie whose voice actor ([[Danny DeVito]]) didn't return.
*[[Pegasus]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) – The winged [[horse]] "with the brain of a bird" formed from clouds by Zeus, he is the childhood pet and faithful companion of his owner Hercules.
*[[Icarus]] (voiced by [[French Stewart]]) – Hercules' best friend. The boy who escaped from a labyrinth with his father on wax wings appears as a complete nut (he was "brain-fried" by flying too close to the [[Sun]]). Despite his accident, Icarus still flies every chance he gets resulting in a few more encounters with the sun and other perils, often requiring Hercules to rescue him. Icarus is very adaptive and hence could adjust to about every situation, except when he is very jealous and acts irrational. He could become an ultra serious soldier at boot camp or a nearly identical version of Hades himself. Thankfully, at the end of each episode, he reverts to his own odd self. He is also completely obsessed with Cassandra and flirts with her at every opportunity he gets. His father, [[Daedalus]] (voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]]), is a teacher in the academy and Icarus doesn't acknowledge his parents' divorce. When Icarus graduates, he goes into inventing with his father and makes a fortune, earning the commercial title "Icarus, the Wax-Wing King".
*[[Cassandra]] (voiced by [[Sandra Bernhard]]) – The [[Trojan War]] [[prophet]] appears as an attractive, yet anti-social girl, that has [[Vision (religion)|visions]] of the future (usually bad) once in a while, which are rarely believed. Icarus is obsessed with marrying her even though she has shown she has no reciprocation. She tolerated his presence even before Hercules joined the trio because otherwise she would have had no friends. But even after she gained Hercules as a friend she still continues to socialize with Icarus and even admitted to him that she considers him a good friend. After graduating, she joins the Oracle Friends Network.
*[[Zeus]] (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) – Hercules' father and king of the gods. He is always ready to provide advice on hero work, but is often prone to mistakes and recklessness himself.
*[[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] (voiced by [[James Woods]]) – Ruler of the Underworld as well as Hercules' uncle and nemesis. Wisecracking, devious, and hot-tempered, he constantly schemes to steal control of Mt. Olympus from his brother Zeus.
* Pain and Panic (voiced by [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] and [[Matt Frewer]]) – Two tiny [[shapeshifting]] [[demon]]s who are Hades's bumbling henchmen.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
The series was produced by [[Tad Stones]], who had previously done ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]''. The directors of ''Hercules'', [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]], jokingly said to him while the film was being produced: "Hey, Tad, we're doing a [[pilot (television)|pilot]] for a series". The producers decided that the irreverence of the movie would be captured more easily by setting it within the events of the movie, with Stones declaring that "by ignoring continuity and trying to stay true to the elements of humor and adventure in the film, we came up with a much stronger series that really stands on its own". Since [[James Woods]] signed to voice [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] again, along with most of the cast of the film, many big-name actors were interested in taking part on the show. Over 150 celebrities took a part in the series, some self-lampooning: [[Merv Griffin]] played a [[griffin]] [[talk show]] host, game show host [[Wink Martindale]] played a riddle-expert [[sphinx]] and [[Mike Connors]], famous for ''[[Mannix]]'', played Athenian policeman Chipacles (named after ''[[CHiPs]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.6/3.6pages/3.6lyonsdisney.html Disney's Little Big Screen: Turning Animated Features Into TV Series], Animation World Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney's revamping of Greek legend moved to the small screen in the late summer of 1998. Disney's Hercules had the Greek god still in "geek god" mode, before his "Zero to Hero" transformation. In the series, "Herc" was enrolled at [[Prometheus Academy]], a school for both gods and mortals.

==Movie: ''Zero to Hero''==
Four episodes of ''Hercules'' were reformatted into the movie ''[[Hercules: Zero to Hero]]'' and released to home video. The episode "Hercules and the Yearbook" serves as the linking narrative, with random clips replaced with the episodes "Hercules and the First Day of School", "Hercules and the Grim Avenger" and "Hercules and the Visit From Zeus". Some of the dialogue between Hercules and Meg was altered to fit the episodes.

* has participated in a professional MMA match under the Unified Rules of MMA or equivalent in the country where the bout took place
* has competed against an opponent with a Pro MMA record at the time the bout took place
* has a professional MMA fight record published anywhere
* National amateur criteria do not hold for IMMAF international competition if it does not conform to the above stipulations

The same from the [[Mixed martial arts rules|Unified Rules of MMA]] plus:
* Elbow and forearm strikes of any kind
* Heel hook
* Twisters/Sit through crucifix and/or any submission deemed as applying pressure to the spine
* Knees to the head at any point

=== Length of the match ===

* The round break shall last sixty (60) seconds

=== Suspension ===
A contestant who was knocked out as a result of a blow to the head, or whose match  was stopped by the judge because of several tough  blows to the head which have made him/her defenseless and unable to continue, shall be suspended from competition and sparring matches.

Suspension periods starting from the day of the latest match:
* One (1) knockout: Minimum four (4) weeks suspension
* (2) knockouts during a period of three (3) months: Minimum three (3) months suspension.

'''KZ Manager''' is a name shared by many similar [[resource management]] computer video games that put the player in the role of a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] commandant or "manager", where the "resources" to be managed include, depending on the version of the game, prisoners (either [[Jews]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] or [[Romani people|Gypsies]]), [[Zyklon B|poison gas]] supplies, "normal" money and various equipment, as well as "public opinion" on the "productivity" of the camp.&lt;ref name="NewYork"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/01/world/video-game-uncovered-in-europe-uses-nazi-death-camps-as-theme.html |title=Video Game Uncovered in Europe Uses Nazi Death Camps as Theme|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 1, 1991|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The goal of the game is to keep the camp functioning by keeping the "public opinion" or other important resources and gauges over or under a certain threshold. In one version, public opinion rises when the "manager" [[execution|executes]] a number of prisoners with [[Zyklon B]]. However, ordering said gas costs money, which can be gathered by forcing the prisoners to work.

Spending too much time without a "sufficient" number of executions makes "public satisfaction" drop, and having too few working prisoners will soon drive to a resource shortage, and closing of the camp, thus losing the game. Also, prisoners must be "purchased" by the camp's "manager", and the corpses of the deceased prisoners must be disposed of (the game describes them as "Müllberg", [[German language|German]] for "garbage mountain " or "pile of garbage"), an operation which also has an associated cost.

Like other resource management games, this means that ultimately the goal of the game is trying to find an optimal balance and timing between expenses, income, actions and "production goals", although with a highly controversial twist.

== Versions ==
Each game version was released several times and began to circulate in Austria and Germany during the 1990s;&lt;ref name="NewYork"/&gt; the earliest versions being [[DOS]], [[text mode]] games, graphical [[DOS]] versions as well as a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version called "KZ manager millennium". According to a 1991 article written by Linda Rohrbough, an [[Amiga]] has been found to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311043800/http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1991_May_3/ai_10692247|title=Racist computer games distributed by Nazis - KZ Manager and similar games exploit antisemitism - neo-Nazis circulating computer games with concentration camp theme|work=[[Newsbytes News Network]]|last=Rohrbough|first=Linda|date=May 3, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gameplay and graphics of the Amiga version and its 256 color DOS port were far more advanced than in the original C64 game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4335">A '''letterhack''' is a fan who is regularly published in magazine and American [[comic book letter column]]s.

==Origin==
The term comes from [[fanspeak]], the slang of science fiction fans, and originally referred to prolific writers of letters to [[fanzine]]s and professional [[science fiction magazine]]s of the early twentieth century.  It was considered to be an important part of [[fanac]] ("fan activity").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/1864|title=letterhack n.|work=Science Fiction Citations for OED|first=Jesse|last=Sheidlower|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New Words|first=Jeff|last=Prucher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|page=110|isbn=9780195387063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1958|first=Ralph Merridette|last=Holland|title=Ghu's Lexicon|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity and recognition==
Many letterhacks became well known throughout the industry. Writer Mark Engblom describes the phenomenon this way:
{{cquote|Chosen by the title's editor (or, in some cases, the writer), a few lucky fans would get the opportunity to share their opinion with not only the creators, but a captive audience of fellow fans as well.  In fact, some of the most prolific fans had letters printed almost every month in a variety of titles, becoming minor celebrities in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Engblom, Mark. [http://comiccoverage.typepad.com/comic_coverage/2007/05/the_letters_pag.html "The Letters Page = Fanboy Valhalla," Comic Coverage (May 7, 2007).] Accessed Feb. 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some letterhacks gained entrée into an actual career in comics because of their letter-writing expertise. For instance, [[Bob Rozakis]] parlayed his frequent published letters to DC comics during the late 1960s and early 1970s into a job as DC's "Answer Man" and eventually a solid career as a DC writer. [[Kurt Busiek]], [[Mary Jo Duffy]], [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Mark Gruenwald]], [[Fred Hembeck]], [[Tony Isabella]], [[Paul Levitz]], [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]], [[Dean Mullaney]], [[Martin Pasko]], [[Diana Schutz]], [[Beau Smith]], [[Roy Thomas]], [[Peter B. Gillis]], [[George R.R. Martin]] and [[Kim Thompson]] are just a few of the many comic book professionals who got their starts as young letterhacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="101358">[[Computer]]s have often been used as fictional objects in [[literature]], [[film|movie]]s and in other forms of [[Mass media|media]]. Fictional computers tend to be considerably more sophisticated than anything yet devised in the real world.

This is a list of computers that have appeared in notable works of [[fiction]]. The work may be about the computer, or the computer may be an important element of the story.  Only static computers are included. [[Robot]]s and other fictional computers that are described as existing in a mobile or humanlike form are discussed in a separate [[list of fictional robots and androids]].

A '''tree deity''' or '''tree spirit''' is a [[nature deity]] related to a [[tree]]. Such deities are present in many cultures. They are usually represented as a young woman, often connected to ancient [[fertility]] and [[tree worship]] lore.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Zimmer, ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization.'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; The status of tree deities varies from that of a local [[fairy]], [[ghost]], [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] or [[nymph]], to that of a [[goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Tr-Wa/Trees-in-Mythology.html#b Trees in Mythology]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of tree deities==
The [[Yakshi]]s or Yakshinis ({{lang-sa|याक्षिणि}}), [[Mythology|mythical]] maiden deities of [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and [[Jainism|Jain]] mythology are closely associated with trees, especially the [[ashoka tree]] and the [[sal tree]]. Although these tree deities are usually benevolent, there are also yakshinis with malevolent characteristics in [[Folklore of India|Indian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Zimmer, ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization.'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

Panaiveriyamman, named after ''panai'', the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for the [[Palmyra palm]], is an ancient fertility deity linked to this palm that is so important in [[Tamil culture]]. This deity is also known as Taalavaasini, a name that further relates her to all types of [[palm tree]]s.
Some other Tamil tree deities are related to ancient [[agricultural deity|agricultural deities]], such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the deity of the [[tamarind|tamarind tree]], and Kadambariyamman, associated with the [[kadamba tree]]. These were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm Mythical Trees and Deities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]] the village ghosts or fairies related to trees such as [[Nang Takian]] and [[Nang Tani]] are known generically as ''[[Nang Mai]]'' (นางไม้).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm Spirits]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other tree ghosts that are male.

Tree deities were common in ancient Northern European lore. In [[Charlemagne]]'s time, following the ''Capitulatio de partibus Saxione'' in 782 offerings to sacred trees or any other form of worship of the spirits of trees and springs were outlawed. Even as late as 1227 the Synod of [[Trier]] decreed that the worship of trees and sources was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leander Petzoldt]]: ''Kleines Lexikon der Dämonen und Elementargeister'', 3. Auflage München 2003; Seite 31–32; Lemma „Baumgeist“&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lottery betting''' is the activity of predicting the results of a [[lottery]] draw and placing a wager on the outcome. Lottery betting (also known as lotto betting) is a form of [[online gambling]], run by licensed betting firms, where players place bets on the outcome of [[lottery]] draws instead of buying physical or online tickets via official lottery operators. 

By betting on the outcome of a lottery draw, rather than purchasing an official ticket, players are able to take part in [[Lotteries by country|international]] and [[Lotteries in the United States|state]] lottery draws that are usually out of their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/insurance-based-schemes-let-britons-play-global-lotteries-prizes/|title=Revealed: The controversial schemes helping Britons chase foreign lottery jackpots worth billions|last=Murray|first=Amelia|date=2017-06-20|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a resident of the [[United Kingdom]] could place a bet on the outcome of the American lottery draw, [[Powerball]], even though they would not be eligible to buy official tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/10/powerball-lottery-record-prize-lotto-jackpot|title=Powerball's $1.3bn prize tempts Britons with lottery fever|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==

===Insurance-based===
Most betting firms that provide lottery betting operate using an [[insurance]]-backed model.

Companies using this model are not required to purchase tickets from official lottery operators. Instead, when a player places a wager on a lottery, the company then forwards this bet to a third-party insurance company. The betting company pays a set fee for every wager placed to the insurance company in order to offset the risk of a large lottery prize being won. If a player wins a large prize (such as a jackpot), the insurance company pays the betting company, who subsequently give the money to the winning player. In the event of small prize wins, the betting firm will typically pay the prize directly to the player from their own funds.

Insurance-backed lottery betting firms are required to hold betting licenses in the jurisdictions they wish to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-the-public/Safer-gambling/Consumer-guides/Betting/Betting-on-lotteries.aspx|title=Betting on lotteries|last=|first=|date=|website=gamblingcommission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ticket reseller===
Companies operating using a ticket reseller model purchase tickets for the official lottery draw on behalf of the player. The company then charges the player the price of the ticket, as well as an extra commission. In the event of a winning ticket, the company collects the winnings from the official lottery operators and then forwards the winnings on to the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://loterijen.info/loterijwinnaar-sterft-kort-na-winst/|title=loterijwinnaar sterft kort na winst|last=|first=|date=2018-08-20|work=Loterijen|access-date=2018-09-15|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types of bets ==

===Draw betting===
Betting on the outcome of lottery draws is the most common form of lottery betting. This follows the same format as purchasing online lottery tickets in that players follow the same ruleset as found on the official lottery draw. Typically, this means that players choose the same amount of numbers and win the same prizes if they match these numbers, as they would have if purchasing an official ticket. The cost of betting on a lottery can differ from the cost of purchasing an official lottery ticket.

===Number betting===
With some betting firms, players are also able to bet on certain numbers being drawn, rather than following the ruleset of official lottery operators. For example, a player could bet on just one number being drawn on a specific lottery. With number betting, the betting company can set its own prize amounts and pays out prizes directly to customers.

== Legality ==
Lottery betting is legal in parts of the world where online gambling is permitted, including most European nations, although it is heavily regulated. Companies offering lottery betting services are required by law to hold a relevant gambling license for the jurisdiction of their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harrishagan.com/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/136_IGAMINGBUSINESS_-_BETTING_ON_LOTTERIES.PDF|title=BETTING ON LOTTERIES: “CLUTTER IN THE MARKETPLACE”?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a year of consultation, the British Government banned third-party betting on the EuroMillions lottery in April 2018. This was, in part, due to its violation of the [[Gambling Act 2005]], and "closed the loophole" used by betting companies to allow gamblers to bet on international lotteries in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Donald B. Hausch, W.T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12854">Though the judgment of [[outlawry]] is obsolete, romanticised '''outlaws''' became [[stock character]]s in several fictional settings.

This was particularly so in the United States, where [[outlaw]]s were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and [[Western film]]s.  Thus, "outlaw" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary at 1255 (4th ed. 1951), citing ''Oliveros v. Henderson'', 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855, 859.&lt;/ref&gt; or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to "law-and-order" notions of conformity and authority (such as the "[[outlaw country]]" music movement in the 1970s).

The colloquial sense of an outlaw as bandit or brigand is the subject of a monograph by British author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]:&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Hobsbawm, ''Bandits''; Penguin Books,  1972&lt;/ref&gt; Hobsbawm's book discusses the bandit as a symbol, and mediated idea, and many of the outlaws he refers to, such as [[Ned Kelly]], Mr. Dick Turpin, and Billy the Kid, are also listed below.

{{cquote|The point about [[social bandits]] is that they are peasant outlaws whom the lord and state regard as criminals, but who remain within peasant society, and are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation, and in any case as men to be admired, helped and supported. This relation between the ordinary peasant and the rebel, outlaw and robber is what makes social banditry interesting and significant ... Social banditry of this kind is one of the most universal social phenomena known to history.|author=Eric Hobsbawm}}

==List of famous outlaws==
[[Image:La Cueva del Gato.jpg|thumb|300 px|''La cueva del Gato'' (The cave of the Cat), 1860 painting by Manuel Barrón y Carrillo depicting the hideout of the Andalusian bandolero of Spain]]
The [[stereotype]] owes a great deal to [[England|English]] [[folklore]] precedents, in the tales of [[Robin Hood]] and of gallant [[highwayman|highwaymen]].  But outlawry was once a [[term of art]] in the [[law]], and one of the harshest [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]s that could be pronounced on anyone's head.

===American===

====American Western====
{{main|List of American Old West outlaws}}
The outlaw is familiar to contemporary readers as an archetype in [[Western film]]s, depicting the lawless [[expansionism]] period of the United States in the late 19th century. The Western outlaw is typically a [[criminal]] who operates from a base in the [[wilderness]], and opposes, attacks or disrupts the fragile institutions of new settlements.  By the time of the Western frontier, many jurisdictions had abolished the process of outlawry, and the term was used in its more popular meaning. Some Old West outlaws, such as [[Billy the Kid]] and [[Jesse James]], became legendary figures in Western lore both in their own lifetime and long after their deaths.

{{main|Bushranger}}
In Australia two gangs of [[bushranger]]s have been made outlaws – that is they were declared to have no legal rights and anybody was empowered to shoot them without the need for an arrest followed by a trial.

* [[Ben Hall (bushranger)|Ben Hall]] – the New South Wales colonial government passed a law in 1865 which outlawed the gang (Hall, [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|John Gilbert]] and [[John Dunn (bushranger)|John Dunn]]) and made it possible for anyone to shoot them.  There was no need for the outlaws to be arrested and for there to be a trial — the law was essentially a [[bill of attainder]].&lt;ref name=BenHall&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/benhall|title = Ben Hall and the outlawed bushrangers|work = Culture and Recreation Portal|publisher = Australian Government|date = 15 April 2008|accessdate = 2008-09-19|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720172553/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/benhall/|archivedate = 20 July 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ned Kelly]] – The Victorian colonial government passed a law on 30 October 1878 to make the Kelly gang outlaws: they no longer had any legal rights and they could be shot by anyone.

"'''Pathfinder'''" is the tenth episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 6)|sixth season]] of the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', 130th episode overall. It features the characters [[Reginald Barclay]] and [[Deanna Troi]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Paris's dad Admiral Paris played by [[Richard Herd]], makes contact with his son. This also marks a continuation of the [[story arc]] of Picard's Enterprise with contact between Voyager crew and Barclay who had served aboard the Enterprise D, and first contact with Earth by Voyager since ''[[Message in a Bottle (Star Trek: Voyager)|Message in a Bottle]]'' (S4E14).

Previously, the Star Trek character Reginald Barclay had appeared in the Voyager show in ''[[Projections (Star Trek: Voyager)|Projections]]'' (S2E3), however, although played by the same actor in that episode it was a holographic simulation of Barclay. The same actor playing as Barclay had appeared in cinema in the feature film [[Star Trek: First Contact]] (1996).

==Plot==
On Earth, [[Reginald Barclay]] is involved in the Pathfinder project, an effort to communicate with the [[USS Voyager (NCC-74656)|USS ''Voyager'']] stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]]. Barclay soon becomes obsessed. He loses himself in the reality of the holographic ''Voyager'' created for the project, enjoying the false friendships within.

He seeks help from old friend and shipmate [[Counselor Deanna Troi]] who advises him to forge real relationships and stop straying into the holo-program he has created of the ''Voyager'' ship and crew. When Admiral Paris visits the project to inspect progress, Barclay ignores orders from Commander Harkins, the project leader, not to bother the Admiral with his infeasible suggestions. Barclay puts forward his theory that using the MIDAS Array (an advanced sensor array), and computing ''Voyager''{{'}}s progress from their last contact, they would be able to create a micro wormhole in the Delta Quadrant near ''Voyager'' and use it to create a two way communication link. Admiral Paris is intrigued by this and promises to give it further study which Barclay is highly excited by, but at a later meeting with Admiral Paris, Barclay oversteps the line and is removed from the project for insubordination.

Later that night, he breaks back in to the Pathfinder project to prove his theory is correct. He hacks into the system and sends commands to the array which, as he predicted, creates the wormhole in the Delta Quadrant. As he attempts to contact ''Voyager'' using the array, [[Starfleet]] detects and sends security personnel to stop him. Barclay locks out the system and takes refuge in the holodeck simulation of ''Voyager'' where he continues to direct the wormhole to locate ''Voyager''. The security officers led by Commander Harkins follow Barclay into the simulation where the faux ''Voyager'' crew rebels, even firing on the security officers. Of course, this has no effect except to momentarily distract them as the safety protocols are on. The holo-Torres is destroyed by a pursuing Commander Harkins, who shuts down the primary cooling systems on the holographic ''Voyager'' which will cause the warp core to overheat and breach, effectively destroying the entire program unless Barclay complies and releases command back to him.

As a dejected Barclay is led out, Admiral Paris enters the lab and announces that Barclay's idea has real promise and should be explored further. As he is informed that the attempt has already been made and was unsuccessful, Admiral Paris expresses regret at Barclay's choice to disregard protocol.

Meanwhile, the real ''Voyager'', far in the Delta Quadrant, detects the micro-wormhole and a communication signal which Seven of Nine disbelievingly identifies as [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] in origin on a Starfleet Emergency Channel. The crew attempts to clear up the signal while back on Earth, the jubilant officers and Barclay assist. For a few seconds the team on Earth clear up the return signal, two-way communication is established for 86 seconds before the micro-wormhole collapses. A few words are exchanged and data from ''Voyager''{{'}}s logs, crew reports, and navigational records are transmitted to Earth. Barclay sends "data on some new hyper-subspace technology", along with recommended modifications to the ship's communications system, so that ''Voyager''{{'}}s crew will be able to keep regular contact with home. In the final seconds, the crew hear some moving words from Admiral Paris ending with, "I want you all to know we're doing everything we can to bring you home."

To celebrate the knowledge that home is looking for them and regular communication will be possible in due time, the crew of ''Voyager'' hold a party in honor of Barclay. They discuss what little they know of him through his personnel record and declare him an honorary ''Voyager'' crewmember.

'''Payana''' is a children's game, originally called "kapichua".  

Similar to [[Jacks (game)|Jacks]], the game is played with five little stones, and involves picking them from the floor in the time between one stone being thrown up into the air and it being caught again.

'''''Putting it Together''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] [[revue]] showcasing the songs of [[Stephen Sondheim]].  Drawing its title from a song in ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', it was devised by Sondheim and [[Julia McKenzie]]. The revue has received several productions, beginning with its premiere in England in 1992, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1999 and the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 2014.

==Production history==
===Original UK production (1992)===
The revue came about due to many requests for an update to ''[[Side by Side by Sondheim]]'' (1976). Having resisted a new show, he was finally convinced by producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]], and Julia McKenzie was brought in to assist.&lt;ref&gt;Abernathy, June.[http://www.sondheim.com/works/putting_it_together/#OLC_info "'Putting It Together' history"] sondheim.com, retrieved August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Putting It Together'' was first performed on January 27, 1992 at the [[Old Fire Station Theatre]] in [[Oxford, England]], where it ran for 24 performances. Directed by Julia McKenzie and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, the cast included [[Diana Rigg]], [[Clive Carter]], [[Claire Moore (singer)|Claire Moore]], [[Clarke Peters]], and [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheimguide.com/pit.html "'Putting it Together' production history"] sondheimguide.com, retrieved August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original US production (1993)===
The [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] production opened [[Off-Broadway]] on April 1, 1993 at [[New York City Center]], where it ran for 59 performances and 37 previews. It was directed by McKenzie and [[choreographed]] by [[Bob Avian]], with scenery by [[Robin Wagner (designer)|Robin Wagner]], costumes by [[Theoni V. Aldredge]], and lighting by [[Tharon Musser]].  The cast included [[Stephen Collins]], [[Christopher Durang]], [[Michael Rupert]], [[Rachel York]], and [[Julie Andrews]], making her return to the New York City stage after an absence of more than 30 years. 

The markedly revised revue now had a slight plot:  At an all-night, black-tie party in a penthouse. The hosts, an older couple (Andrews and Collins) face their disillusions and marital troubles; a younger, less jaundiced couple (Rupert and York) struggle with their feelings and desires, and a commentator (Durang) oversees and influences the action.  The spouses deal with infidelity and divorce but finally reconcile before dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/theater/review-theater-julie-andrews-sings-in-a-sondheim-revue.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Review/Theater; Julie Andrews Sings in a Sondheim Revue (p.2)"] ''The New York Times'', April 2, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[cast recording]] was released by [[RCA Records]].

===Broadway production (1999)===
A production at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] ([[Los Angeles]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/article/the-mark-tapers-putting-it-together-disassembles-dec-6-no-word-on-future-com-78811 The Mark Taper Forum's acclaimed and extended production of the Sondheim revue ''Putting It Together'' will end its run on December 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year, opening November 21, 1999 at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]], where it ran for 101 performances and 22 previews.  Directed by [[Eric D. Schaeffer]] and choreographed by Bob Avian, the Broadway cast included [[Carol Burnett]] (Wife), [[George Hearn]] (Husband), [[Ruthie Henshall]] (Young Woman), [[John Barrowman]] (Young Man), and [[Bronson Pinchot]] (Observer).  [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] replaced Burnett at some performances.  The production marked the return of Burnett to the Broadway stage after performing in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]]'' in 1995.  Hearn was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical.

A video recording of the Broadway production (directed by [[Don Roy King]]) was released for television and home media as [[Putting It Together: Direct from Broadway]].&lt;ref name="Putting It Together"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/470956/Putting-It-Together/|title=Putting It Together|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD release includes blooper footage of Burnett's skirt falling down during the opening of the second act.

===West End production (2014)===
The revue received its [[West End theatre|West End]] premiere in January 2014 at [[St. James Theatre, London]] with a cast that included [[Janie Dee]], [[David Bedella]], [[Damian Humbley]], [[Caroline Sheen]], and Daniel Crossley.

===Original Ireland production (2015)===
The revue received its Irish premiere in December 2015 at [[Lyric Theatre, Belfast]] with [[Fra Fee]], [[Carol Starks]], [[Nicholas Pound]], [[Christina Tedders]], and [[Brad Clapson]], directed by [[Stephen Whitson]], and musical supervision by Alex Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Putting it Together at Lyric Theatre, Belfast|url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Belfast/Lyric-Theatre/Musical/Putting-it-Together/L0245164511/|website=UK Theatre Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronn Lucas''' (born 1954) is an American [[ventriloquist]] and [[stand-up comedian]].

==Career==
Lucas grew up in [[El Paso, Texas]]&lt;ref name=ronn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/sep/01/performer-coming-back-valley-new-sidekicks/#axzz2UamEsY00|work=Las Vegas Sun|title=Performer Ronn Lucas coming back to valley with new sidekicks|date=September 1, 2009}}; retrieved 2013-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from [[Eastwood High School (Texas)|Eastwood High School]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=martinez&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elpasotimes.typepad.com/morgue/2008/07/hometown-star-5.html|work=El Paso Times|title=Hometown stars - Ronn Lucas Ventriloquist comes home to El Paso, where his act started|author=Martinez, Leonard|date=October 25, 2005}}; retrieved 2013-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was 10, Lucas could speak without moving his mouth.&lt;ref name=Broeske&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-29/entertainment/ca-1335_1_ronn-lucas|work=Los Angeles Times|title=More Than Lip Service From Lucas|author=Pat H. Broeske|date=June 29, 1991}}; retrieved 2013-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career performing at Saint Timothy's Lutheran church located in El Paso, Texas.&lt;ref name=ronn/&gt; At 21, he began touring the country. “I was hired by the Billy the Kid Clothing Company, which was big in El Paso at the time,” Lucas said. “They hired me to tour the country with a Billy the Kid puppet. Though that contract was only for a year, it reinforced Lucas’ dream of being in show business, an arena where he has excelled. In September 2004, he received a standing ovation on the Muscular Dystrophy Association Telethon and host Jerry Lewis said, “It doesn’t get any better than that.” In 2005, the Smothers Brothers presented Lucas with the Askins Achievement Award at the ninth annual Vegas Ventriloquist Festival.&lt;ref name=martinez/&gt;

He has received many accolades for his work, including several titles as the best entertainer in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He has performed in numerous live shows and television performances.  He first made the national scene by winning the Showtime cable network's national "Laff-Off" competition&lt;ref name=Broeske/&gt;

Lucas has headlined six separate stints in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] at five different hotels, most recently at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino]], where his show was signed a five-year deal in December 2006, but closed midway through 2007 for unknown reasons. His headlining stint prior to that was at the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio Hotel]]. His show there ran from some time prior to 2003 until Fall 2006. He was the first ventriloquist in the history of Vegas to have a long-running show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegas-nv.com/brett/040305.htm|work=Las Vegas Leisure Guide|title=Brett's Vegas View|author=Brett, Jackie|date=April 3, 2005}}; retrieved 2013-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas has been a performer on [[CBS]] specials at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] for President Ronald Reagan, at [[Ford's Theatre]] for President Bill Clinton, and again at [[Ford's Theatre]] for President [[George W. Bush]]. He also performed at the [[London Palladium]] for [[British monarchy|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Some of his most frequently used puppets include Buffalo Billy, Chuck Roast, and Scorch, the latter who starred in his own sitcom ''[[Scorch (TV series)|Scorch]]''. He also has a routine in which he uses an audience member as a dummy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyTGwflaNx0|title=Ronn Lucas and Big Dummy|date=19 August 2006|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Lucas had his own U.K. [[television]] series for [[Thames Television]] entitled ''The Ronn Lucas Show'' in the early 1990s; the show lasted for five years. He was also a semi-regular on the 1990 revival of ''[[Match Game]]'' and the 1988 revival of ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour#Revival|The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''.

Lucas has also been a regular on sitcoms and variety shows, including ''[[Night Court]]'', ''[[Silk Stalkings]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'', along with appearances on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', ''[[Xuxa (TV series)|Xuxa]]'', and ''[[Circus of the Stars]]''.

Lucas released a [[DVD]] of the [[Disney Channel]] special ''Who's In Charge Here?''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60951">[[File:Hollywood Sign PB050006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hollywood Sign]]. Hollywood is often regarded as a symbol of the American film industry]]
There have been cases and accusations of '''sexual abuse in [[Hollywood]]''', a neighborhood in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], notable as the home of the [[Cinema of the United States|U.S. film industry]], reported against people related to the medium of cinema.&lt;ref name="sex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elcomercio.es/sociedad/acoso-sexual-cine-20171101212927-nt.html|title=El acoso sexual en el cine, un problema "de toda la vida"|trans-title=Sexual harassment in cinema, a "lifelong" problem|work=El Comercio|language=Spanish|date=November 3, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the first film studio was founded there in 1911, Hollywood became an emblematic place for the development of world cinema.

Accusations of sexual assault in the industry go back to 1921, and during the last decades they have gained strength due to the accusations against producers, directors, actors and related publicists. Speculation about sexual assault in the industry grew in 1977, when director [[Roman Polanski]] left the United States after being convicted on charges of sexual abuse against a minor.&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt;

In October 2017, the issue reached widespread media coverage after producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] was [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|accused of sexual abuse]] by more than 80 women. The accusations to Weinstein led to dozens of men and women to publicly began to denounce sexual aggressions, in what became known as the [[Weinstein effect]] and the [[Me Too movement]].&lt;ref name="sex2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/teleshow/infoshow/2017/12/11/las-actrices-de-hollywood-unidas-contra-el-acoso-sexual-no-permanecere-en-silencio/|title=Las actrices de Hollywood, unidas contra el acoso sexual: "No permaneceré en silencio"|trans-title=Hollywood actresses, united against sexual harassment: "I will not remain silent"|work=[[Infobae]]|language=Spanish|date=December 11, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some actors in the medium joined the protest and became sensitized with the victims. The subject continues being object of general interest for the public opinion.&lt;ref name="sex1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/abusos-en-hollywood-t62068|title=Abusos en Hollywood|trans-title=Abuses in Hollywood|work=[[La Nación (Argentina)|La Nación]]|language=Spanish|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Golden Globes" /&gt;

==Background==
The first mediatic case occurred on September 5, 1921, when comic actor [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] was accused of sexual abuse against actress [[Virginia Rappe]]. Arbuckle had organized a party in which, accordong to the accusation, he took advantage of Rappe's alcoholic state to rape her. The aggression was so violent that Rappe died four days later. The news reached an important repercussion when journalist [[William Randolph Hearst]] wrote columns in which he directly accused Arbuckle and added details to the event, such as that Arbuckle had raped Rappe with a bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade|first=Marion|title=Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase|year=1997|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80802-1|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for the rape of Rappe, and after the first two trials, which resulted in [[Hung jury|hung juries]], Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written statement of apology from the jury. Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal was enough to end his career.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-14640719|title='Fatty' Arbuckle and Hollywood's first scandal|publisher=BBC News|date=September 4, 2011|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case was exposed after the death of actress [[Natalie Wood]], who died in 1981 when she fell from her yacht and drowned. After her death, an alleged rape that occurred during the 1950s was revealed, allegedly committed by a major actor at the time. Wood herself had refused to reveal the name of her rapist; however, in 2011, after the publication of a book about the life of the actress, it was speculated that the abuser had been the actor [[Kirk Douglas]]. A year later, through a blog, an anonymous user published a note stating that Douglas, while drunk, had raped her when the actress was 18 years old, and that Wood did not dare to denounce Douglas at the time because "he was a money machine". Later rumors pointed to actor [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as the person who wrote the note, allegedly preferring to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation.

In 2016, actress [[Tippi Hedren]] claimed in her autobiography that in 1963, she had been sexually harassed by film director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] during the filming of the film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' and that he had forbidden other male actors to approach her.&lt;ref name="tippi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/30/estilo/1477859095_943270.html|title=Tippi Hedren acusa a Alfred Hitchcock de acoso sexual|trans-title=Tippi Hedren accuses Alfred Hitchcock of sexual harassment|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=October 31, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the reports, neither Brando nor director [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] warned the actress that she would film a sexual scene with Brando that day, leading in turn to reports that Bertolucci had "confessed" to Schneider being raped on set, prompting Bertolucci to release a statement clarifying that a simulation and not an actual intercourse took place.&lt;ref name=izadi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/05/why-the-last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-is-generating-such-an-outcry-now/|last=Izadi|first=Elahe|title=Why the 'Last Tango in Paris' rape scene is generating such an outcry now|work=The Washington Post|date=December 5, 2016 |access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/global/bernardo-bertolucci-responds-to-last-tango-in-paris-backlash-1201933605/|last=Vivarelli|first=Nick|title=Bernardo Bertolucci Responds to 'Last Tango in Paris' Backlash Over Rape Scene|work=Variety|date=December 5, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First reported cases==
===Roman Polanski case===
{{Main|Roman Polanski sexual abuse case}}
[[File:Roman Polanski at Cannes in 2013 cropped and brightened.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Roman Polanski]]]]
In 1977, Samantha Gailey, then 13 years old, accused director [[Roman Polanski]] of forcing her to have sex with him. Gailey described that the director took her to the house of actor [[Jack Nicholson]] in Los Angeles, under the argument of wanting her as a model for a photo shoot for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine. There, Polanski supplied [[Methaqualone|quaaludes]] and later photographed her topless. Both were alone in Nicholson's house, so Polanski took advantage to take her to the master bedroom and then rape her.&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt; Polanski was accused of sexual abuse of a minor, drug use, perversion and sodomy. The prosecution ordered 90 days of state prison that included a psychiatric evaluation, while deliberating the final sentence. However, Polanski requested another 90-day probation period to finish a then-current project, which was granted. After filming finished, the director returned to his native France where, due to the terms of his sentence, his French nationality prevented him from being extradited to the United States. Since then, he has lived in Europe.

The Polanski case sparked the interest of the American media who condemned the actions of the French authorities. In March 2003, during the [[75th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Polanski was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for the film ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]''; Polanski did not attend. Attendees at the ceremony gave the director a standing ovation despite being absent.&lt;ref name="oscar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk|title=Roman Polanski winning the Oscar® for Directing|publisher=YouTube|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, he was arrested at the [[Zürich Airport]] in Switzerland at the request of American authorities on the Samantha Gailey case, however, the following year, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced that Switzerland would not extradite Polanski. In 2016, the [[Supreme Court of Poland]] also refused to reopen the case. In 2017, Gailey herself asked to close the case, arguing that she only preferred to "turn the page."&lt;ref name="roman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/loc/2017/06/10/593bb653e5fdea3e298b4646.html|title=Samantha Geimer pide cerrar el caso de violación que sufrió de Roman Polanski cuando tenía 13 años|trans-title=Samantha Geimer asks to close the case of rape she suffered from Roman Polanski when she was 13|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=June 10, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gailey was joined by three other women who accused the filmmaker, including actress [[Charlotte Lewis]], who in 2010 accused Polanski of predatory sexual conduct against her when she was 16 years old, claiming that Polanski insisted that she sleep with him in return for casting her in ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Victim Accuses Roman Polanski of Sexual Abuse|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Media/victim-accuses-roman-polanski-sexual-abuse/story?id=10649953&amp;page=1|publisher=ABC News|first1=Russell|last=Goldman|date=May 14, 2010|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1278722/I-forgive-Polanski-Im-telling-truth-Roman-knows-Actress-Charlotte-Lewis-claims-abused-director-16.html|title='I will never forgive Polanski.

===Woody Allen case===
{{Main|Woody Allen sexual assault allegation}}
[[File:Woody Allen Cannes 2015.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Woody Allen]] in 2015]]
In 1978, actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her husband [[André Previn]] adopted Soon-Yi Previn, born in [[Seoul]]. After Farrow's divorce from Previn, she began a relationship with film director [[Woody Allen]]. Besides Farrow's children from her previous relationship with Previn, Farrow and Allen had a son, [[Ronan Farrow]], and adopted two others. In 1992, rumors about a crisis in the relationship between Farrow and Allen were confirmed when she stated that she had discovered her adopted daughter Soon-Yi having sex with Allen. At that time Soon-Yi was 17 years old. After that, the relationship was finished and Farrow was left with the custody of all her children. The court granted Allen an agreement that he could see them with Farrow's permission.&lt;ref name="ronan" /&gt; On August 4, 1992, Farrow left all her children with Allen while she went shopping. According to a later statement, Allen took advantage of the moment to go down to the basement with one of his adopted daughters, Dylan Farrow, then 7 years old, and later sexually abuse her. A legal dispute began for the total custody of the minors and Allen was taken to court, although the accusation did not proceed. A year later, a doctor at the [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]]'s Children's Sexual Abuse Clinic stated that Dylan Farrow's rape story was possibly an invention of the girl caused by the stress of living in a volatile home.&lt;ref name="daughter" /&gt; Dylan Farrow, by then 28, repeated the assault allegation in February 2014 in an open letter in ''The New York Times'' blog of [[Nicholas Kristof]], a family friend, stating, "when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and took me to a dark attic on the second floor of our house. I played with my brother's electric train, then he sexually abused me, he talked to me while he was doing it, whispering to me that he was a good girl, that was our secret and he promised me that we would go to Paris and make me a movie star."&lt;ref name="daughter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2014/02/02/actualidad/1391308435_615844.html|title=La hija de Woody Allen rompe su silencio y acusa a su padre de abusos sexuales|trans-title=Woody Allen's daughter breaks her silence and accuses her father of sexual abuse|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=February 3, 2014|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farrow1Feb2014&gt;{{cite news|first=Dylan|last=Farrow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-dylan-farrows-story.html|title=Dylan Farrow's Story|work=The New York Times|date=February 1, 2014|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Allen has denied all the accusations against him, his son Ronan Farrow defended his sister and became one of the main activists against sexual abuse and one of the first to write a report about the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, leading to the Weinstein effect and the Me Too movement.&lt;ref name="ronan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanitatis.elconfidencial.com/noticias/2018-01-13/ronan-farrow-principe-hollywood-harvey-weinstein_1504688/|title=Ronan Farrow, el 'príncipe de Hollywood' que destapó a Harvey Weinstein, ha hablado|trans-title=Ronan Farrow, the 'Prince of Hollywood' who uncovered Harvey Weinstein, has spoken|work=Vanitatis|language=Spanish|date=January 13, 2018|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen has been married to Soon-Yi since 1997.

In April 2014, Michael F. Egan claimed that his acting career was cut short in 1999 when he refused to continue attending "parties" held by powerful men from the film industry.&lt;ref name="singer"&gt;{{cita web|url=http://www.fotogramas.es/Noticias-cine/El-demandante-de-Bryan-Singer-denuncia-a-otros-tres-peces-gordos-de-Hollywood|title=El demandante de Bryan Singer denuncia a otros tres peces gordos de Hollywood|trans-title=Plaintiff in Bryan Singer's case denounces three other Hollywood bigwigs|work=Fotogramas|language=Spanish|date=April 22, 2014|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egan publicly denounced [[Bryan Singer]], director of films like ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' and the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] of abusing him in those parties that took place inside a mansion in Los Angeles and whose requirement for men was not to wear a swimsuit and swim completely naked. According to his testimony, when he was 15 years old, Singer raped him after forcing him to inhale cocaine. Egan explained that both Singer and other men threatened him and his family under the argument that they controlled Hollywood, and that they added: "If you do not keep the members of this group happy, we will eliminate you."&lt;ref name="singer" /&gt; Singer denied the accusations, however, in 2017 another man identified as César Sánchez-Guzmán said that the director forced him to perform oral sex on him in 2003. Sánchez-Guzmán claimed to the ''New York Times'' that Singer organized parties aimed at the gay community in Hollywood and that he had threatened to "ruin his reputation if he ever spoke."

Egan also accused [[Garth Ancier]], former president of [[BBC America]], David Neuman, former president of [[Disney Channel]], and [[Gary Goddard]], a Broadway producer, of participating in the violations. Jeff Herman, his attorney, said: "Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children." During 2011, photographs showing a party organized by Singer and director Roland Emmerich showing a pool where mature and young men shared were shown.&lt;ref name="party"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/108237871.html|title=Friends in High Places: Bryan Singer and the Hollywood Elite Flocking to his Parties|work=LiveJournal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, actor [[Corey Feldman]] expressed his interest to make a documentary that portrays [[pedophilia]] in Hollywood and the "sectors of power" within the industry.&lt;ref name="corey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2017/12/21/5a3ba1b522601d7e508b45b8.html|title=Corey Feldman contra el mundo|trans-title=Corey Feldman against the world|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=December 21, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman alleged that he suffered sexual abuse within what he described as a "network of prostitution." Feldman said he would seek the money to hire lawyers to back them up, since the material to be published would make a direct statement against "six main Hollywood producers who would seek to deny it." Feldman also said that actor [[Corey Haim]], who was one of his friends and who died in 2010 from an drug overdose, had died without being able to confess to the public the name of the person who raped him when both were looking for a job opportunity.&lt;ref name="corey" /&gt; Feldman had already participated in the 2014 documentary ''[[An Open Secret]]'', which exhibited the sexual abuse committed during the casting and the recruitment of young actors in movies or commercials, by the people of the film industry. The documentary also makes multiple references to the accusations against Singer,&lt;ref name="party" /&gt; and the opinions of the children's parents, who at some point saw themselves in the need to "trust" the agents for the means to improve their economic condition. Similarly, the case of photographer Bob Villard was exposed in the material. According to the statements, Villard took photographs of children and adolescents and then sold them without permission or authorization from parents through the [[eBay]] portal as erotic content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/08/business/la-fi-ct-hollywood-molesters-20120109/2|title=Child sexual abuse cases in Hollywood attract attention|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2012|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/05/hollywood-child-abuse-timeline|title=A Timeline of Child Abuse in Hollywood|work=Complex|date=May 25, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the defendants were also Martin Weiss, manager of child actors who was arrested in 2011.

In other cases, actor [[Jeffrey Jones]] was arrested in 2003 after forcing a 14-year-old boy to pose nude for him; Jones did not deny the accusations.&lt;ref name="jeffrey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2002/11/22/jeffrey-jones-speaks-out-porn-charges/|title=Jeffrey Jones speaks out on porn charges|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 22, 2002|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[Victor Salva]] (director of ''[[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]]'') served 15 months in prison for abusing one of his actors, a 12-year-old boy, and for forcing him to have oral sex with another 14-year-old boy.&lt;ref name="meganslaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/Search.aspx?l=Salva&amp;f=Victor&amp;a=&amp;r=#|title=California Registered Sex Offender Profile - Victor Salva|work=Megan's Law - California Sex Offender Registry|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, around 60 women publicly accused actor and television presenter [[Bill Cosby]] who according to his statements had sexually abused them during the 1970s and 1980s. Most coincided that Cosby had drugged them to facilitate the aggression. For example, former model [[Janice Dickinson]] said that one afternoon in 1982, while suffering from intense menstrual pain, Cosby recommended a "pill" that supposedly calmed the discomfort. "The last thing I remember is losing consciousness and Cosby over me as the monster he is," she told CNN. In the same article, Cosby is held responsible for raping a 15 year old minor.&lt;ref name="cosby1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/tele/20141204/se-acumulan-las-acusaciones-a-bill-cosby-por-abusos-sexuales-3744050|title=Se acumulan las acusaciones a Bill Cosby por abusos sexuales|trans-title=Accusations pile up to Bill Cosby for sexual abuse|work=El Periódico|language=Spanish|date=December 4, 2014|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Cosby faced two trials (the second still ongoing) on charges of sexual abuse. In January 2018, he joked about the issue and appeared unconcerned.&lt;ref name="cosby2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/farandula/bill-cosby-enfrenta-clima-diferente-en-segundo-juicio|title=Bill Cosby enfrenta clima diferente en segundo juicio|trans-title=Bill Cosby faces different climate in second trial|work=El Universal|language=Spanish|date=January 12, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations around the 89th Academy Awards===
There were two high-profile accusations around the time of the [[89th Academy Awards]].

In October 2016, after the premiere of the movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation (2016 film)|The Birth of a Nation]]'', its director and main actor, [[Nate Parker]] was singled out for a 1999 case, when he and his friend Jean Celestin (who co-wrote the film) were accused of sexually abusing a 18-year-old woman after drugging her. During the promotion of the film, the case resurfaced when the victim's brother published that she never overcame the abuse committed and that she had committed suicide in 2012, claiming that she could never file a complaint since Parker himself threatened her not to do so. The promotion of ''The Birth of a Nation'' was involved in a climate of accusations against its director, which were credited with making the film not go beyond expectations.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/birth-of-a-problem-nate-parkers-past-haunts-birth-of-a-nations-road-to-oscar/Content?oid=3903381|title=Birth of a Problem: Nate Parker's Past Haunts Birth of a Nation's Road to Oscar|work=Boise Weekly|date=October 5, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Casey Affleck]] was also singled out for sexual harassment. According to reports, during the filming of the film ''[[I'm Still Here (2010 film)|I'm Still Here]]'', Affleck was accused of sexually harassing Amanda White and Magdalena Gorka, producer and director of photography of the film respectively. Both parties reached an out-of-court settlement in 2010.&lt;ref name="casey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/03/01/estilo/1488388009_173316.html|title=Casey Affleck habla sobre las acusaciones de acoso sexual contra él|trans-title=Casey Affleck talks about allegations of sexual harassment against him|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=March 1, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Brie Larson]], who having won [[88th Academy Awards|a year earlier]] the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Award]] at the Academy Awards, had to give the award to Affleck as Best Actor, did not applaud when the actor went on stage to collect the award. Later she would say that, "whatever it was that I did onstage kind of spoke for itself".&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/brie-larson-casey-affleck-not-clapping-oscars-best-actor|title=Brie Larson Says Not Clapping for Casey Affleck at the Oscars "Speaks for Itself"|work=Vanity Fair|date=March 9, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Affleck declared that he would not present the Academy Award for Best Actress at the [[90th Academy Awards]] ceremony, the reason being credited to not wanting to be the subject of attention at a time of the Me Too movement.&lt;ref name="noactress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/casey-affleck-oscars-best-actress-presenter|title=Casey Affleck Breaks Tradition, Will Not Present Best-Actress Award at the Oscars|work=Vanity Fair|date=January 25, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvey Weinstein case===
{{Main|Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations}}
[[File:Harvey Weinstein 2011 Shankbone.JPG|150px|thumb|left|The Weinstein case led dozens of victims to expose their aggressions]]
The subject of sexual abuse in Hollywood acquired important significance in the world media in 2017, after producer [[Harvey Weinstein]], founder of [[Miramax]] and [[The Weinstein Company]], was accused by more than 80 women of having sexually assaulted them. The accusations ranged from sexual harassment to rape; Weinstein denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/harvey-weinstein-accusers-sexual-assault-harassment-696485|title=Harvey Weinstein Accusers: Over 80 Women Now Claim Producer Sexually Assaulted or Harassed Them|last=Williams|first=Janice|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=October 30, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the women's reports, Weinstein invited young actresses or models to a hotel room or office on the pretext of discussing his career, and then demanded massages or sexual intercourse. During an audio revealed during the ensuring scandal, Weinstein can be heard pressing model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez to accompany him to take a shower, and after her refusal, the producer insists with the phrase, "I will not do anything to you, I swear it for my children."&lt;ref name="audiow"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/america/entretenimiento/2017/10/11/el-escalofriante-audio-de-harvey-weinstein-acosando-a-una-actriz/|title=El escalofriante audio de Harvey Weinstein acosando a una actriz|trans-title=The chilling audio of Harvey Weinstein harassing an actress|work=[[Infobae]]|language=Spanish|date=|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the actresses who claim to have suffered harassment or rape by Weinstein are [[Rose McGowan]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Paz de la Huerta]], [[Annabella Sciorra]] and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]. Another one of them, the Italian actress [[Asia Argento]], elaborated a list in which accusations of sexual abuse against Weinstein were collected.&lt;ref name="List"&gt;{{cite web|author=Argento, Asia et al.|title=List|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1Z95WVLLbh6M1U_Ch4vbfKuJtUmznu-ZgM9yHFBJl68I/htmlview|publisher=[[Google Sheets|Google Docs]]|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents alleged in the list date from 1980 to 2015, and include 18 complaints of rape.&lt;ref name="List" /&gt; In them it was alleged that Weinstein conditioned important roles in films in exchange for sexual favors. As a result, The Weinstein Company and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] decided to expel Weinstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41546694 |title=Harvey Weinstein sacked after sexual harassment claims |publisher=BBC News |date=October 9, 2017 |access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patten|first1=Dominic|title=Harvey Weinstein Resigns From TWC Board As Termination Ratified In Meeting|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-board-meeting-weinstein-company-termination-future-1202189421/|access-date=February 8, 2018|website=Deadline|date=October 17, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017215046/http://deadline.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-board-meeting-weinstein-company-termination-future-1202189421/|archivedate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/academy-expels-harvey-weinstein-1202590109/|title=Harvey Weinstein Stripped of Academy Membership|last=Tapley|first=Kristopher|work=Variety|date=October 14, 2017|access-date=February 3, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103140809/http://variety.com/2017/film/news/academy-expels-harvey-weinstein-1202590109/|archivedate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accusations against Weinstein led to the disclosure of a considered number of victims of other sexual assaults by people in the film industry.

===Kevin Spacey case===
[[File:Kevin Spacey, May 2013.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Kevin Spacey]]]]
On October 30, 2017, actor [[Anthony Rapp]] stated that in 1986, while still a minor, he had been sexually harassed by actor [[Kevin Spacey]] during a party held at Spacey's home. According to the statement, Rapp was in Spacey's bedroom watching TV, when Spacey walked in drunk and laid on top of Rapp. In response to these allegations, Spacey alleged that he did not remember behaving inappropriately, and asked for forgiveness if it was so. In the same statement, Spacey publicly declared that he was gay.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Spacey se declara gay: La estrella se disculpa con el actor Anthony Rapp, que le acusa de haberle acosado cuando tenía 14 años|trans-title=Kevin Spacey declares himself gay: The star apologizes to actor Anthony Rapp, who accuses him of harassing him when he was 14|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/30/gente/1509345665_548008.html|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=October 30, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations against Spacey were aggravated when technical staff from the television series ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' (which Spacey starred) declared that the actor frequently harassed men during filming. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos also accused Spacey of harassing him. In his story he said, "It seems that it only took being a male under 30 to make Mr. Spacey feel free to touch us."&lt;ref name="ks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2017/11/02/mexico/1509584326_413608.html|title=Actor mexicano acusa a Kevin Spacey|trans-title=Mexican actor accuses Kevin Spacey|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=November 2, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the accusations, Spacey announced his admission to the clinic The Meadows, in Arizona, to undergo treatment for sex addiction.&lt;ref name="Rapp" /&gt; [[Netflix]] broke commercial ties with the actor and his participation in the film ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' was eliminated; actor [[Christopher Plummer]] had to re-shoot the scenes of Spacey's character. ''House of Cards'' later announced that its following sixth season would be the series' last, and that it would be filmed without Spacey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trabajadores de 'House of Cards' acusan a Kevin Spacey de abusos sexuales|trans-title=Workers of 'House of Cards' accuse Kevin Spacey of sexual abuse|url=http://www.elmundo.es/loc/celebrities/2017/11/03/59fbbca0268e3ecf198b462d.html|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=November 3, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oldham|first=Stuart|title=Kevin Spacey Fired from 'House of Cards'|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/netflix-fires-kevin-spacey-from-house-of-cards-1202607002/|work=Variety|date=November 3, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===#MeToo===
{{Main|Weinstein effect|Me Too movement|Time's Up (movement)}}
The accusations to Harvey Weinstein unleashed a campaign through the hashtag Me Too with which different people joined the list of victims of sexual abuse by actors, directors and producers. The comedian [[Louis C.K.]] and filmmaker [[Brett Ratner]] had projects canceled after at least six accusations each; C.K. later confirmed the allegations against him and apologized, while Ratner denied the claims against him. For his part, the filmmaker [[James Toback]] had a total of 200 accusations of sexual harassment.

Acting coach [[Anna Graham Hunter]] declared against the actor [[Dustin Hoffman]] claiming that in 1985 during the filming of the television film ''[[Death of a Salesman (1985 film)|Death of a Salesman]]'' the actor groped her and harassed her with comments as when she asked him what he wanted to eat at breakfast; Hoffman replied, "I'll have a hard-boiled egg and a soft-boiled clitoris." This accusation was soon followed by those of six other women. Hoffman later released an apology but denied wrongdoing, saying, "I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation," continuing, "I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am,"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/12/04/john-oliver-grills-dustin-hoffman-over-sexual-harassment-allegation/|title=John Oliver grills Dustin Hoffman about sexual harassment allegations|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|date=December 5, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=February 8, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212084656/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/12/04/john-oliver-grills-dustin-hoffman-over-sexual-harassment-allegation/?utm_term=.616b7aae96e8|archivedate=December 12, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://beta.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-dustin-hoffman-apologizes-after-being-1509561081-htmlstory.html|title=Dustin Hoffman apologizes after allegations that he sexually harassed a 17-year-old intern in 1985|last=Rottenberg|first=Josh|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has not publicly responded to the other six allegations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/14/report-dustin-hoffman-allegedly-exposed-himself-teen-assaulted-two-women/953910001/|title=Five new accounts of sexual misconduct hit Dustin Hoffman|work=USA Today|date=December 14, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://slate.com/arts/2017/12/three-hoffman-accusers-spoke-to-nbc-news-about-their-allegations.html|title="I Wanted to Choose Truth Over Shame": Three Dustin Hoffman Accusers Speak to NBC News About Their Allegations|last=Withers|first=Rachel|work=Slate|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other actors like [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]] denied the accusations against them. In January 2018, after winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], [[James Franco]] was accused by five women, including Sarah Tither-Kaplan, who claimed that when she was a student of Franco, he forced them to undress and remove the plastic protections during the filming of sexual scenes. Franco did not attend the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]] ceremony afterwards.&lt;ref name="franco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/loc/2018/01/11/5a57adf5ca474105218b4668.html|title=Cinco mujeres acusan a James Franco por comportamiento sexual indebido|trans-title=Five women accuse James Franco of sexual misconduct|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=January 11, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of complicity and criticisms===
Public opinion was against not only those who committed sexual abuse but those who covered or silenced it. Actors such as [[Matt Damon]], [[Ben Affleck]] and director [[Quentin Tarantino]] admitted knowing the sexual crimes of Weinstein.&lt;ref name="dam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotogramas.es/Noticias-cine/Matt-Damon-criticado-por-unos-comentarios-polemicos-sobre-el-abuso-sexual-en-Hollywood|title=Matt Damon, criticado por unos comentarios polémicos sobre el abuso sexual en Hollywood|trans-title=Matt Damon, criticized for controversial comments about sexual abuse in Hollywood|work=Fotogramas|language=Spanish|date=December 17, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After actress [[Meryl Streep]] denied knowing the behavior of the producer, Rose McGowan, one of the victims, rebutted her arguing that Streep had knowledge and called her a "hypocrite."&lt;ref name="streep"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinepremiere.com.mx/meryl-streep-victima-ataque-carteles-weinstein.html|title="Ella sabía": el ataque contra Meryl Streep.

DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]], dedicated her speech to the victims of such aggressions. That same night, singer [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] declared that Oprah had been a friend of Weinstein and claimed that she knew his behavior.&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/loc/celebrities/2018/01/11/5a5742cd468aeb5b378b45d8.html|title=Seal acusa a Oprah Winfrey de saber lo que estaba haciendo Harvey Weinstein|trans-title=Seal accuses Oprah Winfrey of knowing what Harvey Weinstein was doing|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|date=January 11, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Liam Neeson]] criticized the social movement, alleging that the accusations against his fellow actors had turned into a [[Witch-hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]], adding, "There are some people, famous individuals, who are suddenly accused of touching a girl's knee, or something like that, and then they are dismissed from their shows."&lt;ref name="neeson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/cine-00128/noticia-liam-neeson-abusos-sexuales-hollywood-convirtiendo-caza-brujas-20180115111510.html|title=Liam Neeson, sobre los abusos sexuales en Hollywood: "Se está convirtiendo en una caza de brujas"|trans-title=Liam Neeson, on sexual abuse in Hollywood: "It's becoming a witch hunt"|work=Europa Press|language=Spanish|date=January 15, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] called "hypocrites" some of the actresses who denounced the abuses.

===In popular culture===
During the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, presenter [[Seth Meyers]] said in reference to the movie ''[[The Shape of Water]]'' (directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]]): "When I heard that the story of an innocent woman who falls in love with a water monster was filmed, I just said, 'Oh no, not another Woody Allen movie!'" In 2016, the presenter of the [[73th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony [[Ricky Gervais]] talked about the movie ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' (about a journalist team who investigated the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston|sexual abuse scandal in Boston]]) thus: "''Spotlight'' is the movie about how a group of sexual predators was allowed to abuse children and continue working with impunity and without punishment. Roman Polanski called it 'the best romantic comedy in history.'"&lt;ref name="gervais"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/01/10/ricky-gervais-golden-globes-jokes-3/|title=Ricky Gervais meanest Golden Globes jokes 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 10, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[85th Academy Awards]] ceremony in 2013, host [[Seth MacFarlane]] joked when announcing the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] nominees: "Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein."&lt;ref name="Axios"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Britzky|first1=Haley|title=The hints of Weinstein's behavior that went ignored|url=https://www.axios.com/the-previous-hints-of-harvey-weinsteins-behavior-2495642089.html|accessdate=February 8, 2018|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|date=October 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044150/https://www.axios.com/the-previous-hints-of-harvey-weinsteins-behavior-2495642089.html|archivedate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology and behavior==
The psychology center Cepsim in Madrid, Spain described in summary the profile of the abuser: "They are men or women with a lot of power who use it with vulnerable people to get what they want. Normally they lack empathy, which is what places us in someone else's pain and makes us not hurt or be selfish."&lt;ref name="cepsim"&gt;{{cite news|title=El lado oscuro de Hollywood: abusos sexuales, poder, impunidad y dependencia|trans-title=The dark side of Hollywood: sexual abuse, power, impunity and dependency|url=https://www.elindependiente.com/tendencias/2017/11/05/abusos-sexuales-hollywood-harvey-weinstein-kevin-spacey/|work=El Independiente|language=Spanish|date=November 5, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Psychology of the [[University of Málaga]] added that the rapist does not usually assimilate that he is committing a crime, since his mind is usually [[Narcissism|narcissistic]].&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite news|title=Así funciona la mente de un acosador|trans-title=This is how a harasser's mind works|url=https://mundo.sputniknews.com/sociedad/201711211074124227-abusosexual-acosador-mentalidad-rasgos/|work=Sputnik News|language=Spanish|date=November 21, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with media power usually present themselves with a "charming" personality and enjoy good public relations, so when the abuse is uncovered the laws themselves doubt the victims.&lt;ref name="mind" /&gt; The personality of abusers in show business also has atypical behaviors such as quoting actresses and models to castings or sign contracts in unusual places such as hotel rooms or private rooms. After the abuse they resort to blackmail or a direct threat to silence the victim.&lt;ref name="cepsim" /&gt; Criminal law lawyer Alicia Ozores explained to the newspaper ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' that some abusers tried to take refuge under the argument that "they were addicted to sex", this in order to reduce a sentence and cleanse their image because [[Hypersexuality|sex addiction]] is a recognized disorder.&lt;ref name="addiction"&gt;{{cite news|title=¿Tiene la adicción al sexo algo que ver con ser un acosador?|trans-title=Does sex addiction have anything to do with being a harasser?|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vivo/psicologia/20171026/432350529005/adiccion-al-sexo-acoso-abuso-sexual-acoso-sexual-caso-harvey-weinstein.html|work=[[La Vanguardia]]|language=Spanish|date=October 26, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein and Spacey used the argument in response to the accusations against them. According to the psychological profile of the abuser, many stalkers and rapists dod not need to resort to physical violence, since they used persuasion, deception or pressure to subdue the victim, based on their authoritative relationship.&lt;ref name="psycho"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abusos sexuales|trans-title=Sexual abuse|url=http://www.insexbcn.com/html/abusos.html|publisher=Institute of Sexology of Barcelona|language=Spanish|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of child abuse itself, the rapist would be opportunistic, taking advantage of the carelessness of the parents and in this case of their desire to venture into the media.&lt;ref name="psycho" /&gt;

Regarding the victims, their fear is usually related to the disbelief of public opinion and to being judged by it. Usually, the society condemns the abuse but in turn questions the reason why the victim did not speak or denounce before.&lt;ref name="cepsim" /&gt; Brazilian psychologist Flavia Dos Santos told Colombian newspaper ''[[El País (Cali)|El País]]'' that victims are usually convinced to speak when they are told that their statement can contribute to cases to happen less and less.&lt;ref name="women3"&gt;{{cite news|title=¿Por qué callan las mujeres víctimas de abuso sexual?|trans-title=Why are women victims of sexual abuse silent?|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/colombia/por-que-callan-las-mujeres-victimas-de-abuso-sexual.html|work=[[El País (Cali)|El País]]|language=Spanish|date=January 25, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim usually feels helpless to know that his abusers are people with media power and as a result can enjoy impunity when he has public demand.&lt;ref name="cepsim" /&gt; Many of The later behaviors of the victims, such as guilt or disbalance in interpersonal relationships, were shown in the documentary ''An Open Secret'', where victims narrate that sexual abuse has been assumed as part of the culture in Hollywood and for that reason nobody has worried about eradicating it.&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;{{cite news|title=An Open Secret: How to watch the child abuse documentary Hollywood 'doesn't want you to see'?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/an-open-secret-how-to-watch-documentary-hollywood-child-abuse-paedophile-ring-vimeo-a8035081.html|work=The Independent|date=November 3, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme in the 2016 United States presidential election==
{{Main|Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape|Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations}}
Sexual abuse as a result of having a position of power was one of the issues during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], particularly when in October of the same year and a month before the election, [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape|an audio recording]] was released that dated from 2005 in which [[Donald Trump]], then the presidential candidate for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was heard expressing himself in 2005 on how he used his power to "grab women." In 2005, Trump, still removed from politics, was the judge of the television show ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', a concept he had created for [[NBC]]. In the recording Trump argued about women, "when you're a star, they let you do anything. Grab them by the pussy."&lt;ref name="women"&gt;{{cite news |first=David A. |last=Fahrenthold |authorlink=David Fahrenthold |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html |title=Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 7, 2016 |access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same day,  Trump gave a statement in which he apologized for the video's content, and said that "he was not perfect." Likewise, during the third presidential debate he argued: "nobody respects women more than me."&lt;ref name="respects"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2016/10/20/mexico/1476924593_909374.html|title="Nadie respeta a las mujeres más que yo": las respuestas en Twitter a esta frase de Trump|trans-title="Nobody respects women more than me": Twitter responses to this phrase from Trump|work=[[El País]]|language=Spanish|date=October 20, 2016|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump won the presidential election a month later and a year later the production company Brave New Films presented a video that compiled the testimonies of 16 women who publicly [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|accused Trump of harassing or sexually assaulting them]].&lt;ref name="accusations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expansion.mx/mundo/2017/11/24/un-video-muestra-16-acusaciones-de-abuso-sexual-contra-donald-trump|title=Un video muestra 16 acusaciones contra Trump de abuso sexual|trans-title=A video shows 16 accusations of sexual abuse against Trump|work=Expansión|language=Spanish|date=November 24, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] expressed their sympathy with victims of sexual abuse. Obama would testify about the specific behavior of Weinstein, "[[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] and I are disgusted by the recent reports on Harvey Weinstein; any man who degrades women in that way should be condemned and held accountable, regardless of their wealth or condition."&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/10/politics/hillary-clinton-harvey-weinstein/index.html|title=Hillary Clinton, Obamas condemn longtime Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein|publisher=CNN|date=October 10, 2017|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin, in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is abruptly cancelled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that [[Princess Fiona]] has been rescued by [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes that Shrek was never born.

In the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a "real [[ogre]]" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.

Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to "thank" him.

Shrek signs the contract and appears in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|Fiona's rescue]] are irrelevant. Now feared by villagers, he takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds "WANTED" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down.

Upon inquiry, Rumpel reveals that he took away the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or met [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], and consequently Rumpel was able to trick King Harold and Queen Lillian into signing their kingdom over to him, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well as he was never born in this timeline. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by "true love's kiss".

They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpel's capture. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to like Shrek, but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.

During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything; however, because in this altered timeline Fiona does not truly love him, the kiss does not work. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres. Afterwards, Rumpel reveals a captured Fiona whom he is going to feed to Dragon along with Shrek. Donkey leads the Ogre army to storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel, while Shrek and Fiona trap Dragon.

As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears, restoring Shrek to his world just before he lashed out at the party. Shrek embraces his friends and family with a newfound appreciation for everything he has.

''Shrek Forever After'' had the widest release for an animated film (4,359 theaters, later expanded to 4,389) in North America. On its opening day (May 21, 2010), it ranked No.1, grossing $20.8&amp;nbsp;million, which was lower than the opening days of the last two ''Shrek'' films. The film then opened in three days with $70.8&amp;nbsp;million, lower than box office analysts' predictions of an opening of $105&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2010/05/20/shrek-box-office-preview/|title='Shrek' kicks off the sure-to-be successful summer kid flick biz|work=EW.com|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also lower than the two previous films of the franchise. Anne Globe, head of worldwide marketing for DreamWorks Animation, said they were "happy with the film's opening" since it debuted at No. 1 and also had the fourth-best opening for an animated film, at the time, in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37302907/ns/today-entertainment/|title='Shrek Forever After' roars to top of box office|work=msnbc.com|date=May 23, 2010|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shrek Forever After'' was No.1 for three consecutive weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10783771|title='Shrek' better than 'Sex' with $43M at box office|work=abcnews.com|date=May 30, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37436302/ns/today-entertainment/|title='Sex' no match for 'Shrek' at box office|work=msnbc.com|date=May 31, 2010|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6530TD20100606|title="Shrek" laughs its way past two new comedies|work=reuters.com|date=June 6, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Shrek Forever After'' has an approval rating of 58% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "While not without its moments, ''Shrek Forever After'' too often feels like a rote rehashing of the franchise's earlier entries."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shrek_goes_fourth/ | title = Shrek Forever After Movie Reviews, Pictures |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate= June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/Shrek4 | title=Shrek Forever After reviews at Metacritic.com | publisher=''[[CBS Interactive]]'' | work=Metacritic | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by ''Shrek'' and ''Shrek 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/05/23/shrek-macgruber-box-office/|title='Shrek' bows to $71.2 million; 'MacGruber' sinks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated "What fortifies “Shrek Forever After” are its brilliantly realized principal characters, who nearly a decade after the first “Shrek” film remain as vital and engaging fusions of image, personality and voice as any characters in the history of animation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Stephen Holden]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/movies/21shrek.html|title=I’m Green and the Kids Are a Pain, but It’s a Wonderful Life, Donkey|accessdate=May 20, 2010|work=The New York Times|date=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Hammond of ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' gave the film 4.5 stars out of 5, writing "Hilarious and heartfelt from start to finish, this is the best ''Shrek'' of them all, and that's no fairy tale. Borrowing liberally from [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', this edition blends big laughs and emotion to explore what Far Far Away might have been like if Shrek never existed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/reviews/theatrical/2010-05-shrek-forever-after | author=Hammond, Pete | title=Shrek Forever After Movie Review | publisher=Boxoffice Media, LLC | date=May 5, 2010 | accessdate=May 21, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529000106/http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/reviews/theatrical/2010-05-shrek-forever-after | archivedate=May 29, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ''Reelviews'' awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote "Even though ''Shrek Forever After'' is obligatory and unnecessary, it's better than ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and it's likely that most who attend as a way of saying goodbye to the Jolly Green Ogre will not find themselves wishing they had sought out a more profitable way of spending 90-odd minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2084 | author=Berardinelli, James | title=Shrek Forever After - A movie review by James Berardinelli | publisher=''Reelviews'' | date=May 19, 2010 | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James White of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film four out of four stars, saying "DreamWorks could be entering a period of fresh creativity. With How To Train Your Dragon and a balanced, darker-hued and very funny Shrek finale, they've found the magic again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrek Forever After Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/shrek-forever/review/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B−" grade, saying "Everyone involved fulfills his or her job requirements adequately. But the magic is gone and ''Shrek Forever After'' is no longer an ogre phenomenon to reckon with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20386387,00.html | author=Schwarzbaum, Lisa | title=Shrek Forever After – Movie – EW.com | publisher=''Entertainment Weekly'' | date=May 20, 2010 | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote "It's a fun ride.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8899">[[File:Stuart Smalley.jpg|thumb|300px|Stuart Smalley]]
'''Stuart Smalley''' is a fictional character invented and performed by comedian and satirist [[Al Franken]]. The character originated on the television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', in a mock [[self-help]] show called "Daily Affirmations With Stuart Smalley." It first aired on the show's February 9, 1991 episode hosted by [[Kevin Bacon]].  Stuart is Franken's middle name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/476/000022410/ Al Franken], NNDB.com&lt;/ref&gt; Franken has stated that his "going to [[Al-Anon]] meetings inspired [the character] Stuart [Smalley]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xqKkLlCfLE&amp;t=20s|title=STUART SMALLEY BORN FROM AL-ANON MEETING|first=|last=ArtisanNewsService|date=3 May 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He attended the meetings in support of his wife, who was battling alcoholism at the time.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/magazine/al-franken-faces-donald-trump-and-the-next-four-years.html|title=Al Franken Faces Donald Trump and the Next Four Years|first=Mark|last=Leibovich|date=13 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Stuart participates in many (sometimes fictional) programs, not limited to [[Overeaters Anonymous]], Children of Alcoholic Parents Anonymous, and Children of Rageaholic Parents Anonymous. He is an [[effeminate]] man with a perfectly coiffed bleached-blond hairdo, who regularly wears a yellow button-down shirt with a powder blue cardigan.

It is frequently hinted that Stuart may be [[gay]], but his [[sexual orientation]] is never clearly stated. All his romantic partners have names which could be male or female, like Dale, Chris, or Merle. His father gripes, "You'd drink too if you had [[Liberace]] for a son." &lt;!-- One character who becomes a romantic interest in the novel appears in the movie, where the character is played by a man; however, in the movie, nothing indicates that the two characters ever meet outside the courtroom, let alone develop romantic interest in each other. --&gt;

Within the context of the show, Stuart is quick to point out that he is ''not'' a licensed therapist but relies instead upon the credibility of his own experiences as a non-professional. His guests are very often celebrities; however, Smalley is seemingly unaware of his guests' fame as he never uses their full names so as to "protect (their) anonymity."

Other guests who appeared were his family members, such as [[Macaulay Culkin]] playing his nephew or [[Roseanne Barr]] playing his sister, who suffers from [[battered wife syndrome]]. One Canadian relative named Leon Smalley and played by [[Kiefer Sutherland]] also had a show called "Today's Meditation", which became a big hit in [[Canada]]. Although he is clearly a copycat of Stuart, Leon does seem more self-confident on his show, which could be a reason for his greater success.

The character was popular enough to spawn a 1992 novel, ''I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley''. The book keeps in line with the concept of the character, and is presented ([[tongue-in-cheek]]) as a legitimate day-to-day affirmation book. Each page is dated and the reader is "supposed" to follow through as if they were actually seeking help. Naturally, however, things go wrong in the writing process, and thus the affirmations branch off into Stuart's own commentary about what a hard time he is having writing it, etc. He also discusses his past relationship with ex-significant-other Dale, "the Rageaholic".

An [[audiobook]] was also released, ''You're Good Enough, You're Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like You''. The content of this audio book was completely different from the printed one, but followed through on the same gag. The tapes played guided visualizations meant to help the listener relax and focus; however, Stuart makes a vow at the beginning not to make any edits or corrections in the recording process because "I'm a perfectionist and if I start making changes, I'll never stop." As such it is full of humorous errors, including one gag in which Stuart tells his listeners who are driving to work to "close their eyes and envision..." something. (As such, there is a warning label on the box that says, "Do not listen while driving," a joke that doesn't make sense until one has actually listened to the tape.)

As the character's popularity increased, a film was released called ''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]''.  It chronicled the life Stuart leads and his relationship with a very [[dysfunctional family]]. His alcoholic father and enabling mother, overweight sister and equally alcoholic brother call upon him when an aunt dies. He is asked to oversee the sale of her home, bringing much-needed money to all of the family. At the same time, his public access self-help show is canceled. Naturally, things go awry, and he must learn to deal with himself and his own life before he can attempt to help others.  While many critics praised the film, including [[Gene Siskel]] (who awarded the film 3.5 stars out of four, in his print review) and [[Roger Ebert]], the film was financially unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a March 1995 article in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Franken regularly lobbied to get the Smalley character on the air more in his last season on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

The character effectively disappeared after the box-office failure of the film and Franken's exit from ''Saturday Night Live'', save one appearance where Smalley, bitter over the failure of the movie, refused to finish his affirmation, excoriated his viewers for not watching, and openly wept. At one point in that skit, Smalley (in reference to the film, its glowing reviews, and the film that beat it) commented: "But you didn't want 'funny' and 'poignant'. You wanted 'Dumb....and Dumber....and Dumber....and Dumber'!" In 2002, Franken reprised the Smalley character again when [[Al Gore]] hosted, in which he mentioned that his father was still an alcoholic.

The character also showed up from time to time on ''[[The Al Franken Show]]''.  Later, after Franken made a [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|bid]] for a [[United States Senate]] seat that ended in success but also in controversy – he would not be officially declared the winner, and therefore under Minnesota law could not be seated, until a full eight months after the election itself – he would be dubbed "Senator Stuart Smalley" by critics and fans alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/archive/Will-Anyone-Remember-Stuart-Smalley.html|title=Franken In, Bunning Out: Senate as Second Act|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2009/06/al_franken_finally_wins_karma.php|title=Al Franken Finally Wins, Karma Makes Up For 2000 Florida Election Fiasco|first=Kyle|last=Munzenrieder|date=30 June 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catchphrases==
{{Importance section|date=September 2017}}
The character is known for a number of [[catchphrase]]s, many of which are chosen not just for comic effect, but to play on a perceived tendency of the self-help movement to talk and think in [[Psychobabble (jargon)|psychobabble]]. Some, such as the phrase "stinkin' thinkin'", are taken from common 12-step slogans.
* "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me."
* "That's just stinkin' thinkin!"
* "You're should-ing all over yourself."
* "[[Nile|Denial]] ain't just a river in [[Egypt]]!"
* "I am a worthy human being."
* "...and that's...okay."
* "Trace it, face it, and erase it."
* "I don't know what I'm doing. They're gonna cancel the show. I'm gonna die homeless and penniless and twenty pounds overweight and no one will ever love me."
* "I'm in a shame spiral."
* "You're only as sick as your secrets."
* "Compare and despair."
* "You need a checkup from the neckup."
* "I am a human being, not a human doing."
* "[[Pee-wee Herman]]: There but for the grace of God go I."
* "It’s easier to put on slippers than to carpet the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgemagazine.net/2003/03/stuart-smalley/|title=Stuart Saves His Country: An interview with Al Franken and Stuart Smalley|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SDSUSylvanTheater.JPG|thumb|250px|right| Sylvan Theater on the Sylvan Green, [[South Dakota State University]], [[Brookings, South Dakota]], USA]]

A '''sylvan theater'''—sometimes called a '''greenery theater''' ({{lang-fr|théâtre de verdure}}) (also spelt '''theatre''', see [[British and American spelling differences|spelling differences]])—is a type of [[outdoor theater]] situated in a wooded (sylvan) setting. Often adorned with classical motifs (columns, statues), a sylvan theater may substitute a simple green lawn for built seating and can include elaborate arrangements of shrubs, flowers and other greenery. These alfresco stages may be features of grand [[formal garden]]s or [[park]]s, or of more intimate settings, and may be intended for either public or private use.

==History of sylvan theaters==
[[File:Parc floral des Thermes aix-les-bains 1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Parc floral des Thermes]]'', [[Aix-les-Bains]], France]] 
A notable early example of a sylvan theater was the ''[[Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau]]'' ("Water Theater Grove") — one of the 14 celebrated [[Gardens of Versailles#Bosquets of the gardens|''bosquet'']] ("groves") in the [[Gardens of Versailles|Gardens of the Palace of Versailles]] near [[Paris]]. The central feature of this ''bosquet'', which was designed for King [[Louis XIV]] by [[Le Nôtre]] between 1671 and 1674, was the auditorium-like theater sided by three tiers of turf seating that faced a stage decorated with four fountains alternating with three radiating cascades. As part of the replantation of the gardens ordered by King [[Louis XVI]] during the winter of 1774-75, the ''Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau'' was destroyed and replaced with an unadorned garden. (As of 2009, the ''Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau'' is currently being rebuilt.)

== Publication history ==
=== Caliber Press ===
[[File:Deadworld 10.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Deadworld'' #10 (1988) back cover. Art by James O'Barr.]]

The Crow first appeared on the back cover of ''Deadworld'' #10 (November 1988); James O'Barr provided a back cover to the first comic book Caliber Press published, which contained an advertisement for the upcoming The Crow appearance in ''Caliber Presents'' #1. (The ads shows The Crow standing with a smoking shotgun in one hand and a samurai sword in the other, with the statement, "For Some Things...There Is No Forgiveness". It mentions The Crow appearing in February 1989.)

The Crow's first in-story appearance was in ''Caliber Presents'' #1 (January 1989), in the story "Inertia", which serves as a prequel to the main series. O'Barr again provided a back cover for this issue.

The character's first limited series was ''The Crow'' #1-4 (Feb.–May 1989). Four issues, titled "Pain", "Fear", "Irony", and "Despair," take readers through a series of vengeance tales as The Crow cuts and shoots through Tin Tin, Tom Tom, Top Dollar, Funboy and T-Bird, the gang members that attacked and killed him and his lover Shelly.

In ''A Caliber Christmas'' (Dec. 1989), Eric reflects back on happier times with Shelly in the story "Atmosphere." (In ''The Crow'' graphic novel, this story is placed between issues #2 and 3.)

''Caliber Presents'' #15 (Sept. 1990) contained a preview of the unpublished ''The Crow'' #5, titled "Death", that was meant to complete the original story arc. 

=== Tundra Publishing ===
[[Tundra Publishing]] later reprinted Caliber's first four issues in two double-sized volumes and printed "Death" (also double-sized) as the third volume.

=== Kitchen Sink Press ===
From 1996-1998, [[Kitchen Sink Press]] published five [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]] and a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] based on The Crow concept with a new avatar in each series.

=== London Night Studios ===
Following the Kitchen Sink series, [[London Night Studios]] published ''The Crow/Razor: Kill the Pain'' in 1998, which saw Eric Draven paired with [[Everette Hartsoe]]'s [[bad girl art|bad girl]] character [[Razor (character)|Razor]].

=== Image Comics ===
In 1999, [[Image Comics]] released a new ''Crow'' comic series with yet another take on the Eric Draven story. It ran for ten issues, ending in November of that year.

=== Titan Books ===
In 2002, [[Titan Books]] compiled and released the previous original books into one, making this the first time The Crow appeared as a single book

=== Gallery Books ===
O'Barr stated in a 2004 interview that an Author's Edition would contain at least "60 pages of new material that no one has ever seen. Half of that are pages that had to be removed for space reasons." O'Barr described the additions as including "more romance flashback scenes between Eric and Shelly," as well as sequences that would make the work "more visually interesting."&lt;ref name="SG04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/James+OBarr+creator+of+The+Crow/|title=James O'Barr, creator of The Crow|last=Epstein|first=Daniel Robert|date=May 21, 2004|publisher=Suicide Girls|accessdate=2008-04-24}} [http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/James Archived]{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} on 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2010, it was announced on O'Barr's official website that the Author's Edition of ''The Crow'' was indeed going to be released and that O'Barr was currently working on it.&lt;ref name="SG05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesobarr.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/01/the-big-news.html|title=The Crow Author's Edition|date=January 16, 2010|publisher=James O'Barr|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2011, O'Barr announced that ''The Crow: Special Edition'' would be released on July 28, 2011, from [[Gallery Publishing Group|Gallery Books]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Barr, James.

=== IDW Publishing ===
In July 2012, [[IDW Publishing]] published a new five-issue Crow series, ''The Crow: Death and Rebirth'', written by novelist [[John Shirley]] (co-writer of the original Crow film) and illustrated by [[Kevin Colden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = Preview of The Crow #1 (IDW)
  | author = The Comic Book Critic
  | url = http://comicbookcritic.net/2012/04/13/preview-crow-idw-kevin-colden/
  | accessdate =2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four more IDW ''Crow'' series followed: ''The Crow: Skinning the Wolves'' (2013), ''The Crow: Curare'' (2013), ''The Crow: Pestilence'' (2014) and ''The Crow: Momento Mori'' (2018).

==Plot==
The story revolves around an unfortunate young man named Eric. He and his fiancée, Shelly, are assaulted by a gang of street thugs after their car breaks down. Eric is shot in the head and is [[paralysis|paralyzed]], and can only watch as Shelly is savagely beaten, [[raped]], and shot in the head. They are then left for dead on the side of the road.  Eric later dies in the hospital operating room while Shelly is [[dead on arrival|DOA]].

He is resurrected by a crow and seeks vengeance on the [[murder]]ers, methodically stalking and killing them. When not on the hunt, Eric stays in the house he shared with Shelly, spending most of his time there lost in memories of her. Her absence is torture for him; he is in emotional pain, even engaging in [[self-harm|self-mutilation]] by cutting himself.

The crow acts as both guide and goad for Eric, giving him information that helps him in his quest but also chastising him for dwelling on Shelly's death, seeing his pining as useless self-indulgence that distracts him from his purpose.

==Characters==
{{For|a list of protagonists in spin-off comics, novels, film and television adaptations|Crow (comics)}}

* Shelly: Fiancée of Eric who gets raped and killed by T-Bird's gang. She appears in Eric's dreams and memories.
* Sherri: A young street girl whom Eric meets while going after Funboy. Sherri is shown as upset, due to her mother not being there for her, and even goes so far as to tell Eric that she believes she's been bad and God sent her to Hell. She and Eric seem to bond closely, and feeling sorry for her, he gives her Shelly's engagement ring. She's overjoyed, because no one has ever given her a gift before, and she calls him a "clown", while he calls her a "princess". She is renamed Sarah in the film adaptation.
* T-Bird: The head of the gang that murders Shelly and Eric.
* Funboy: T-Bird's right-hand man, a morphine addict who is sleeping with Sherri's mother.
* Top Dollar: A low-level drug dealer, who also participated in gang-raping Shelly; in the film adaptation, he is the main antagonist rather than T-Bird.
* Tin-Tin: The first of T-Bird's gang to be eliminated by Eric.
* Tom-Tom: Another of T-Bird's soldiers and one of Shelly's rapists, whom Eric interrogates over the whereabouts of Shelly's ring. Tom-Tom is absent from the film adaptation as his role is largely condensed with another book character, Skank.
* Gideon: A pawnbroker who fences Shelly's engagement ring after it is given to him by T-Bird; in the film adaptation, Tin-Tin gives him the ring.
* Officer Albrecht: A beat cop who confronts Eric outside Gideon's pawnshop.
* Captain Hook: The [[detective]] who originally handled Eric and Shelly's case. Eric sends him his regards through Albrecht.

==Critical reception==
''The Crow'' is ranked 37th in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/37 The Crow - #37 Top Comic Book Heroes - IGN]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, creator James O'Barr claimed that ''The Crow'' was:
*The best-selling independent black-and-white graphic novel of all time.
*Translated into almost a dozen languages and has sold over a quarter-million copies worldwide.
*The second American comic book to get its author the "Storyteller Award" by the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] held annually in [[Angoulême]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080913012157/http://www.jamesobarr.net/word.asp?cat=1&amp;id=67 CrowFansOnline and James O'Barr - the official fansite of the creator of The Crow]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In 1994, a film based on the comic (titled ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'') was released to theaters by [[Miramax Films]]. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning $50,693,129&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = The Crow| url = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=crow.htm| accessdate =2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; total gross during its 1994 United States theatrical release. A cult following, in part due to the accidental death of its star [[Brandon Lee]] on the film's set, has maintained the film's popularity, with a regular staple of movie memorabilia being found at retailers like [[Hot Topic]]. Three sequels have been made so far: ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'' (1996), starring [[Vincent Pérez]] (as The Crow), [[Mia Kirshner]], [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] and [[Iggy Pop]]; ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]'' (2000), starring [[Eric Mabius]] (as The Crow), [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Fred Ward]]; and ''[[The Crow: Wicked Prayer]]'' (2005), starring [[Edward Furlong]] (as The Crow), [[David Boreanaz]] and [[Tara Reid]].

In the late 1990s, a sequel/reboot to ''The Crow'' entitled ''The Crow: 2037'' was in the works; it would be set in the future. It was written and scheduled to be directed by [[Rob Zombie]], but it was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428859/zombie-will-write-direct-next-crow-flick.jhtml |title=Zombie Will Write/Direct Next "Crow" Flick – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=''MTV'' |date=1997-02-11 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/what-happened-to-the-rob-zombie-script-for-crow-2037.html |title=What happened to the Rob Zombie script for Crow: 2037? |publisher=Experts123.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roteirodecinema.com.br/scripts/files/crow_2037_a_new_world_of_gods_and_monster.htm |title=Scripts on the Net – The Crow: 2037 A New World of Gods and Monster, by Rob Zombie – Read The Screenplay |publisher=Roteirodecinema.com.br |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5932803/100-wonderful-and-terrible-movies-that-never-existed |title=100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed |publisher=Io9.com |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 2008, [[Stephen Norrington]] announced in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that he planned to write and direct a "reinvention" of ''The Crow''. Norrington distinguished between the original and his remake: "Whereas Proyas’ original was gloriously Gothic and stylized, the new movie will be realistic, hard-edged and mysterious, almost documentary-style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997365.html?categoryId=1350&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Norrington flies with 'Crow' franchise | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 [[Ryan Kavanaugh]]'s [[Relativity Media]] was negotiating with [[Edward R. Pressman]] for both the film's rights and financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Crow Relaunch Moves Forward With Casting  | work =  | publisher = [[i09]]  | date =  | url = http://io9.com/5410643/the-crow-relaunch-moves-forward-with-casting  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate =2009-11-25  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, actor [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] accepted the role of Eric Draven, with [[F. Javier Gutiérrez]] set to direct. According to James O'Barr the movie is expected to be much more faithful to the comic including flashbacks, metaphors, horses, trains and barbed wire, making it not suitable for younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NYCC 2014: Twenty Years Of ‘The Crow’ With James O’Barr|work = IGN  | date = 2014-10-10 | url = http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2014/10/10/nycc-2014-twenty-years-of-the-crow-with-james-obarr |accessdate =2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Javier Gutiérrez also confirmed that his intentions are to create literally a page-by-page adaptation of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Sean CW|last=Korsgaard|title=Interview with James O'Barr, creator of The Crow|website=korsgaardscommentary.com|date=October 30, 2014|url=http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/2014/10/interview-james-obarr-creator-crow.html|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming was slated to start in the spring of 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last= | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = The Crow Reboot to Start Shooting in Spring 2015  | work = IGN  | date = 2014-10-24 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/25/the-crow-reboot-to-start-shooting-in-spring-2015  | doi =  | accessdate =2014-11-15  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but on July 31, 2015, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that production on the reboot stalled because of Relativity Media's bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/relativity-fallout-crow-remake-sees-812413|title=Relativity Fallout: 'The Crow' Remake Sees Pre-Production Stall|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Ritman|first=Alex|date=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corin Hardy]] was the next director to take on the film and O'Barr said in October 2017:

{{quote|As of right now, it's slated to start pre-production in February with a very talented British director named Corin Hardy. I'm involved in every aspect of the film and working closely with the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.screengeek.net/2017/10/29/the-crow-reboot-to-begin-pre-production-in-february/ |title=Exclusive: The Crow Reboot To Begin Pre-Production In February |last=Salcido |first=Mark |date=2017-10-29 |website=Screengeek |access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On May 31, 2018, it was announced that both director Hardy and star Jason Mamoa had exited the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-crow-remake-dead/|title='The Crow' Remake is Dead Again as Jason Momoa and Corin Hardy Exit|date=2018-05-31|work=/Film|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
A [[television]] series, ''[[The Crow: Stairway to Heaven]]'' (1998), was based on the first movie with [[Mark Dacascos]] replacing Lee in the role of Eric Draven.

=== Novels and story collections ===
From 1996–2001, a number of novels based on the world and thematic concerns of The Crow were published, mostly by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]]. Authors of these novels included such notable names as [[Chet Williamson]], [[David Bischoff]], [[Poppy Z. Brite]], [[S. P. Somtow]], [[Norman Partridge]], and [[A. A. Attanasio]].

In 1998, O'Barr and editor [[Ed Kramer]] asked an array of [[fiction]] writers, poets, and artists — including [[Gene Wolfe]], [[Alan Dean Foster]], [[Charles de Lint]], [[Jack Dann]], [[Jane Yolen]], [[Henry Rollins]] and [[Iggy Pop]] — to interpret this [[Gothic fiction]] phenomenon. ''The Crow: Shattered Lives and Broken Dreams''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-345-41711-4 ''The Crow: Shattered Lives &amp; Broken Dreams'' review], ''Publishers Weekly''. Accessed Oct. 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was released by [[Random House]] on Halloween; and a year later, in a limited signed and numbered volume, by [[Donald M. Grant|Donald M. Grant Publishing]].

=== Video games ===
''[[The Crow: City of Angels (video game)|The Crow: City of Angels]]'' is a 1997 action [[video game]] for [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sony PlayStation]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is loosely based on the [[The Crow: City of Angels|movie of the same title]]. The player assumes the role of the hero of the film, Ashe Corven. It received negative reviews.&lt;ref name=gr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/197002-the-crow-city-of-angels/index.html |title=The Crow: City of Angels |publisher=Game Rankings |date=1997-02-28 |accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''GamePro'' 95 (June 1997), page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
There have been five albums of music related to ''The Crow'' and its attendant films:
* ''[[Fear and Bullets]]'' (1994) — an album created through a collaboration between James O'Barr and longtime friend [[John Bergin]] as a soundtrack to O'Barr's graphic novel ''The Crow.'' It was originally released in 1994 along with a limited edition hardcover copy of the graphic novel.
* ''[[The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' (1994) — showcases the film's music by popular artists
* ''[[The Crow: Original Motion Picture Score]]'' (1994) — original music written by [[Graeme Revell]] for the film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''; not to be confused with the soundtrack album, above
* ''[[The Crow: City of Angels (soundtrack)|The Crow: City of Angels]]'' (1996) — soundtrack to the [[The Crow: City of Angels|film of the same name]]; features a cover of the [[Fleetwood Mac]] song "[[Gold Dust Woman]]" by [[Hole (band)|Hole]], as well as tracks by artists such as [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Korn]], and [[Iggy Pop]]. Like the original ''Crow'' soundtrack, a song by [[Joy Division]] (one of O'Barr's favorite bands) is covered: "In a Lonely Place," by [[Bush (British band)|Bush]].
*  ''[[The Crow: Salvation (soundtrack)|The Crow: Salvation]]'' (2000) —  again compiled and produced by [[Jeff Most]]. As with the soundtrack to ''The Crow: City of Angels'', it includes an otherwise unavailable cover version by [[Hole (band)|Hole]]: this time of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]". Several other notable contemporary artists are also featured on the soundtrack.

=== Card games ===

The Crow is an out-of-print [[collectible card game]] by [[Heartbreaker Press]] and [[Target Games]]. It is based on The Crow [[comic]]s by [[James O'Barr]] and depicted images from the [[The Crow (movie)|movie]]. It was released in November 1995 but initially had a release date of March 1995.&lt;ref name="MILLER2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=John Jackson |title=Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist &amp; Price Guide, Second Edition | year=2003 |page=109 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cardboardconnection.com/upper-deck-lands-card-memorabilia-license-crow|title=The Crow Flies with Upper Deck in Trading Card and Memorabilia Deal|website=Carboardconnection.com|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of three sets released by Heartbreaker Press and Target Games in November along with [[James Bond 007 Collectible Card Game|James Bond 007]] and [[Kult (card game)|Kult]].&lt;ref name="MILLER2"/&gt; The game did not have [[booster pack|starter decks]] and instead it had a core set with 122 cards that included 10 foils that had artwork from the comic.&lt;ref name="MILLER2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandonlee.com/memorab/ccmas.htm|title=The Crow Card Game|website=Brandonlee.com|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was sold in [[booster pack]]s of 15 cards, but no starter packs were available.&lt;ref name="LEE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BROWN"&gt;{{citation |last=Brown |first=Timothy|title=The Official Price Guide to Collectible Card Games|year=1999|pages=51-52|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promo card called ''The Confident Crow'' was available by mail through proof-of-purchase order.&lt;ref name="LEE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BROWN"/&gt; An expansion titled ''Crow: City of Angels'' was announced for an October 1996 release but never materialized.&lt;ref name="MILLER2"/&gt;

Players control Angel, Devil, and Neutral Bystander cards and then send them into combat with "opposing [P]ersonalities". Action cards allow players to pump or hinder a Personality. Each Personality has an attack and defense value, as well as Virtue, which is equal to the highest value. Players play their card Personality card and discard cards from their hands equal to the Virtue of the played card, and then they attack. If a player has a higher attack value than their opponent's defense value, the opponent is wounded. If a Personality would be wounded again, it is killed. A player wins by killing 25 Virtue worth of an opponent's Personalities.&lt;ref name="MILLER2"/&gt;

It is written by [[Craig Mazin]] and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]], based on characters created by [[Evan Daugherty]], which like the first film were inspired by the fairy tale "[[Snow White]]" compiled by the [[Brothers Grimm]], as well as "[[The Snow Queen]]" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

It received mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences alike, with praise for the visuals and cast but many feeling the film was an unnecessary sequel. It grossed $165 million worldwide against an estimated $115 million production cost.

==Plot==
Evil sorceress [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]]'s powers allow her to know that her younger sister [[The Snow Queen|Freya]], whose powers have not yet emerged, is not only involved in an illicit affair with an already elsewhere engaged nobleman Andrew, but is also pregnant with his child. Sometime after Freya gives birth to a baby girl, Freya discovers that Andrew not only reneged on his promise of elopement with her but also murdered their child. In a grief-fueled rage, her broken heart freezes over and she kills him with her sudden emergence of powers - the elemental control of ice.

Freya abandons her sister's kingdom and builds herself a new kingdom up North. Ruling as the much feared Ice Queen, Freya orders children to be abducted so they can be trained to avoid the pain of love (as she suffered), and to be an army of fearsome huntsmen to conquer for her. Despite the training, two of her best huntsmen, [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric]] and Sara, grow up and fall in love, secretly bind, and plan to escape to a free life together. Freya discovers their secret and confronts them, creates a massive ice wall to separate them, then casts Eric out of her kingdom after first forcing him to watch as Sara is killed by one of their fellow huntsmen.

Seven years later, and after [[Snow White and the Huntsman|Ravenna's death]], Queen [[Snow White]] falls ill after hearing Ravenna's [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] beckoning her. Because of its overwhelming dark magic, she ordered it to be taken to Sanctuary, the magical place that sheltered Snow White during the events leading to her retaliation and ultimately Ravenna's death, so the mirror's magic can forever be contained. Snow White's husband, William, informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing while en route to the Sanctuary. Eric realizes that he is being spied upon by Freya through sorcery (via a magical ice owl). Knowing the dark magic of the mirror can make Freya even stronger, perhaps invincible even, Eric agrees to investigate and attempt retrieve the mirror. Reluctantly though, he allows Snow White's dwarf ally [[Seven Dwarfs|Nion]] and his annoying half-brother Gryff to come along.

While travelling to the last known location of the soldiers, they discover they seemingly attacked each other. At a tavern later, the trio are attacked by a group of Freya's huntsmen, but are rescued by a very much still alive Sara. Sara reveals that she was imprisoned by Freya the entire time, only to escape recently. They decipher that Eric was falsely made to see Sara's death, while she was made to see him abandoning her rather than fighting to help. Eric convinces her that Freya conjured these visions to trick them apart, and eventually has Sara join with him and the dwarves to thwart Freya. 

Soon, in a surprise attack, the quartet is ensnared in a trap set by she-dwarves Bromwyn and Doreena. They convince the she-dwarves to also help them find the Mirror, and the two lead them to the [[goblin]]s that stole the mirror from Snow White's soldiers. The party fight off the goblins and retrieve the Mirror.

As the group nears the Sanctuary with the Mirror, they are ambushed by Freya and her huntsmen. Freya reveals Sara has been loyal to her all along, and that Sara was using her companions to find the Mirror for her. In the ensuing chaos, Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues, and Sara shoots an arrow into Eric's chest on Freya's order, killing him. Freya departs with the Magic Mirror, but she is unaware that Sara intentionally missed so that Eric could live. Back in her palace, Freya recites the iconic verse associated with the Mirror, resurrecting Ravenna, who became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her into it. Boasting a new suite of powers thanks to the Mirror's powerful magic, Ravenna usurps Freya's rule by coordinating Freya's huntsmen and army to reclaim the kingdoms Snow White had liberated.

Eric infiltrates the ice palace with help of Gryff and Bromwyn. He attempts to assassinate Freya, but is stopped by Ravenna. When Freya realizes that Sara didn't actually kill Eric, betrayed, she reluctantly sentences them both to death because of Ravenna's manipulation. However, Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to rebel, claiming the love of life-long brethren. Ravenna begins to kill the huntsmen. Freya, realizing that she regards the huntsmen as her own surrogate "children", protects them with an ice wall, separating the huntsmen from the sisters. As Eric, Sara and the other huntsmen climb over the wall to fight Ravenna and retrieve the mirror, the two sisters argue over the icy kingdom. Ravenna lets slip that she's responsible for withdrawing her sister's weakness, awakening her powers. Freya, now suspicious, forces Ravenna (who as the mirror's captive spirit must answer her summoner's questions truthfully) to reveal that the mirror had told her that Freya's child would eventually be more beautiful than Ravenna, that she enchanted Andrew to kill the baby, ultimately causing the death of Freya's child so she could remain 'the fairest of them all'. Freya, outraged by her sister's evil deception and betrayal, finally turns against her. Freya is impaled by Ravenna, but with her remaining strength Freya freezes the Magic Mirror. Eric takes advantage and shatters the Mirror, thus destroying Ravenna. As Freya dies from her wounds, she smiles at the sight of a vision of her old loving self, and gladly witnesses Eric and Sara's devotion for each other.

With Freya's death, those who had been imprisoned by Freya's magic are set free, including Nion and Doreena, while a mysterious golden bird flies overhead. Eric, Sara and the huntsmen look forward to a new future while the dwarves pair off romantically and Eric and Sara share a kiss, finally happy to have a free life together for the first time in their lives.

In a [[post-credits scene]], [[Snow White]] with a crown on her head is seen from behind. The aforementioned bird flies and lands on the balcony next to her. Snow White's own magical spy/scryer. (Though this scene seems to have been excised from consequent broadcast versions.)

== Theatre of Meaning Theory ==

=== The Text ===
Ellis believes that once the author has no control of the work, then it takes on a life of its own, much like a coat which looks different on whoever wears it. "Once the work is completed and the [[author]] has no control over what happens with the text, then it becomes a separate entity disconnected from the author. Whoever reads the work from then on, can place their own meaning based on their own knowledge of their world on the work, whether or not they choose to research into the author themselves. When a company stage a work, they bring their own meaning to it again. A work is just paper covered in words, a building made of bricks. The words are the bricks, when you look at one brick on its own; you as an individual bring your own meaning to what the brick means, based on your own knowledge of the world. Thus each person can have an entirely different view on a work, because each person will interpret words differently."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Gareth 2009"&gt;Ellis, Gareth. ''Theatre of Meaning'',GCE Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Audience ===
Continuing with the idea that the text is transient, "once the text is performed and has been stamped with the meaning given by the company who are staging it, the spoken words, nuances and visual aspects of the production add to the meaning for the audience, although everything is subjective for each individual member."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Gareth 2009"/&gt;

=== Performance ===
Ellis says "a performance does not need to be planned and can have an audience of any size, although it needs to seek to create a reaction, even if it just makes the audience think about what is happening."&lt;ref name="Ellis, Gareth 2009"/&gt;

When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]
'''Women in rock''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women singers, instrumentalists, record producers and other music professionals]] in [[rock music]] and [[popular music]] and the many subgenres and hybrid genres that have emerged from these genres. Women have a high prominence in many [[popular music]] styles as [[singer]]s. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. "[P]laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; As well, rock music "...is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In popular music, there has been a gendered "distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation" in music.&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"/&gt; "[S]everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated – hence, inferior – pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex... – plays a crucial role."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; In the 1960s pop music scene, "[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Erika White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the ’60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;

==All-female bands and girl groups==
An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in [[popular music]] genres such as rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]] and related genres which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a [[girl group]], in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt; While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.

A [[girl group]] is a music act featuring several female singers who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] their vocals together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female [[pop music]] singing groups which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and the [[British Invasion]], many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups - A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalist groups [[Sugababes]] and [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as "girl bands" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud Meet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] ''OK'' magazine, 20 March 2009; [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008; while instrumentalists [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie Database; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s–1960s===
In the [[Jazz Age]] and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, [[The Ingenues]], The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and "Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators" were popular. [[Ina Ray Hutton]] led an all-girl band, the [[Melodears]], from 1934 to 1939.  Eunice Westmoreland, under the name [[Rita Rio]], led an all-female band appearing on [[NBC Radio]] and for [[Vitaphone]] and [[RKO]]. [[Ivy Benson|Ivy Benson's]] "All Girls Band" was the [[BBC|BBC's]] resident dance band in 1943 and toured until the 1980s.  A Polish group [[Filipinki]] was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2 |title=Wyborcza.pl |publisher=Szczecin.gazeta.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were [[Goldie &amp; the Gingerbreads]], to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1964, [[The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|The Pleasure Seekers]] with [[Suzi Quatro]] to Hideout Records in 1964 and [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, [[The Feminine Complex]] to Athena Records in 1968, and [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when [[Mo Ostin]] signed them to [[Warner Bros. Records]].  There were also others, such as [[The Liverbirds]] (1962–1967), [[the Ace of Cups]] (1967), [[The Heart Beats]] (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970).

===1970s–1980s===
In 1971 [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with "Charity Ball" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], recorded the first of a string of albums. [[The Runaways]] were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members [[Joan Jett]], [[Cherie Currie]] and [[Lita Ford]] all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands.  On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1982 "The Billboard Hot 100 1982"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Jett]]'s ''[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]'' at No. 3 and [[the Go-Go's]] ''[[We Got the Beat]]'' at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money.

In the United Kingdom, the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]] in the late 1970s with its "anyone can do it" ethos led to women making significant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Caroline|title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion|date=1977|publisher=Omnibus/Hawthorne Books|location=London|isbn=978-0801561290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Judy|title=15 Essential Women Punk Rock Icons|url=http://flavorwire.com/199630/15-essential-women-punk-icons|website=Flavorwire|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. "That was the beauty of the punk thing," [[Chrissie Hynde]] later said." [Sexual] discrimination didn't exist in that scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Punk and Post-Punk Music|url=http://www.biography.com/people/groups/women-of-punk-and-post-punk-music|website=Biography.com|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This participation played a role in the historical development of punk music, especially in the U.S. and U.K. at that time, and continues to influence and enable future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Women in Punk?|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/whywomeninpunk.htm|website=Women in Punk|publisher=Punk77.co.uk|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music: Female Musicians of the Punk Era|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate/Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-1845539573|url=http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;isbn=9780754657736&amp;lang=cy-GB|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woronzoff|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music' Is an Important Work, But a Replay of the Same Old Themes|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/161962-the-lost-women-of-rock-music...-by-helen-reddington/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues "[i]t would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conference proceedings (September 2001)|title=No Future?|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=University of Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=Introduction: The Lost Women of Rock Music|date=1977|publisher=Ashgate|location=London|isbn=9780754657736|url=http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Lost_Women_of_Rock_Music_Intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Rotten]] wrote that ‘During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ... It wasn’t combative, but compatible.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lydon|first1=John|title=Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs|date=1995|publisher=Coronet|location=London|isbn=978-0312428136|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were involved in bands such as [[The Slits]], [[The Raincoats]], [[Mo-dettes]], and [[Dolly Mixture (band)|Dolly Mixture]], [[The Innocents (UK punk band)|The Innocents]].

Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist [[Viv Albertine]], who stated that "the A&amp;R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously.. So, no, we got no respect anywhere we went. People just didn't want us around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petridis|first1=Alexis|title=The Slits' Viv Albertine on punk, violence and doomed domesticity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/01/the-slits-viv-albertine-punk-violence-domesticity|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Charlotte Richardson|title=Punk has a problem with women.

[[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Kim Gordon]] states, "I think women are natural anarchists, because you're always operating in a male framework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Rock|title=Women Who Rock: 10 Essential Punk Songs|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/7234_women-who-rock--10-essential-punk-songs/|publisher=The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Museum|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heavy metal====
[[File:Girlschool live 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Girlschool]] is a British all-women [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in the 
[[new wave of British heavy metal]] scene in 1978 and frequently associated with contemporaries [[Motörhead]]. They are the longest running [[all-female band|all-female rock band]], still active after more than 35 years.&lt;ref name="Girlschool bio" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.girlschool.co.uk/biography.htm | title = Girlschool biography | accessdate =27 January 2011 | publisher = Girlschool Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="record" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.girlschool.co.uk/album%20review.htm | title = Reviews | accessdate =3 September 2010 | date = December 2004 | work = [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] | publisher = Girlschool official website | quote = ...apparently listed in [[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book Of Records]] for being the world’s longest-surviving all-female rock band }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The all-female [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Girlschool]], from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, [[Kathy Valentine]] departed to join the all-female band [[The Go-Gos]]', switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled "The St. Valentines Day Massacre" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates [[Motörhead]] under the name [[Headgirl]]. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom.

===1990s–2000s===
In the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting [[Bonnie Raitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tina Weymouth]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tina Weymouth &amp; David Byrne, The Talking Heads" (cover story), ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; on their covers. While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.

In the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  "bad" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. [[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more "lunar viewpoint" in their roles as musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Boder, Christopher. "The Hole Story", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70. October 1991.''Most women in rock are only repeating what men have done. The women in this band are not doing that. We're coming at things from a more feminine, lunar, viewpoint.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the punk, female-led [[Riot Grrrl]] genre was associated with bands such as [[Bratmobile]] and [[Bikini Kill]].
