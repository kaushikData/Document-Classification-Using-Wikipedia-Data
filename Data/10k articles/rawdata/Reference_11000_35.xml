'''''101 Albums That Changed Popular Music''''' is a musical reference book written by Chris Smith, an American journalist, author and [[cultural critic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Writer/chris-smith|title=Chris Smith|publisher=[[Rock's Backpages]]|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in July 2009 by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/101-albums-that-changed-popular-music-9780195373714?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp;#|title=101 Albums that Changed Popular Music – Chris Smith|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|oup.com]]|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book tells the history of [[popular music]] from the introduction of the [[LP record|long-playing (LP) record]] in 1948. It focuses on key albums, from the [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] compilation ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' (1952) to [[the White Stripes]]' ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name="JW Pepper" /&gt;

==Selection and sorting methodology==
Chris Smith previous wrote about music and popular culture for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and [[MTV]], among others,&lt;ref name="101AlbumsBackCover"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Chris|title=101 Albums That Changed Popular Music|url=https://books.google.com.au/books/about/101_Albums_that_Changed_Popular_Music.html?id=G4mP7u6mPdkC&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-537371-4|ref=harv|p=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authored ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History'', published by [[Greenwood Press]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Chris-Smith/e/B001H6PVC8|title=Books By Chris Smith|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''101 Albums That Changed Popular Music'', he focuses on albums and their impact on the cultural landscape,&lt;ref name="Amazon product description"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Albums-that-Changed-Popular-Music/dp/0195373715|title=''101 Albums that Changed Popular Music'' by Chris Smith" &gt; "Editorial Reviews|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to songs and musical performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.ala.org/index.php/rusq/article/view/3816/4189|first=Nevin J.|last=Mayer|title=
Sources: Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings|journal=[[Reference and User Services Association awards|RUSA]]|date=Summer 2014|volume=53|number=4|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's preface, he says that, rather than looking to compile a list of the "best" albums, the criteria for inclusion was a combination of an album's sales performance and influence on American music and culture, together with the level of critical commentary it had inspired. He says that artists such as [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bill Haley]] and [[Hank Williams]], and many pioneers in the [[blues]] genre are necessarily excluded, since their most influential work was either confined to [[78rpm]] singles or achieved through live performance.{{sfn|Smith|2009|pp=ix–xi}}

In Smith's opinion, [[Miles Davis]] is "the most revolutionary artist" in the book, while [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967) is the album that most clearly satisfies the three criteria for inclusion.{{sfn|Smith|2009|pp=xi, xiii–xiv}} He comments that the featured albums show artistic ambition and influence in the areas of, variously, technological experimentation, mixing musical genres, presentation of alternate realities, and commentary on contemporaneous music{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=xv}} – the latter being demonstrated especially by [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), which ridiculed "both the status quo and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kallen|first=Stuart A.|title=The History of Alternative Rock|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4205-0738-6|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book includes a timeline of key events in the history of recorded sound and divides the main discussion into seven chapters, starting with "The Birth of the Long Player, 1952–1962". The other six chapters cover the periods 1963–1967, 1968–1971, 1972–1976, 1977–1985, 1986–1990 and 1991–2008.{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=vii}} Each of the featured albums is afforded two or three pages of text.&lt;ref name="Lord/Library" /&gt; Smith also includes appendices titled "Ten Albums That Almost Made It" and "Ten Important Producers".{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=vii}} In the first of these, he comments that his omission of the Beatles' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) from the main body of the book is "somewhat unfair".&lt;ref name="Hirst/Independent" /&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Eric Weisbard]], the co-editor of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide|Alternative Record Guide]]'' and an organizer of the [[Experience Music Project]] conferences, wrote that, just as albums are "structures of order, turning songs, an inherently ersatz form, into statements", Smith's book "albums the album, compiling the 'statement' works that prevailed in jazz, folk, and two generations of rock into a single package".&lt;ref name="101AlbumsBackCover" /&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' described Smith's ''101 Albums'' as a "diverting" work that was "an upmarket version of the best-of lists that rock fans love to argue over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/835f4a88-82e2-11de-ab4a-00144feabdc0|title=The Vinyl Countdown|publisher=[[ft.com]]|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon product description" /&gt; ''[[Express Milwaukee]]''{{'}}s reviewer wrote: "Well argued, Smith compiles a history of rock that is generally correct and identifies such important trends as the fertile interplay between the Beatles and Dylan, the transmogrification of communal '60s folk-rock into me-only '70s singer-songwriter and the punk's reaction against hippy hypocrisy and pompous arena rock."&lt;ref name="Amazon product description"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Albums-that-Changed-Popular-Music/dp/0195373715|title=''101 Albums that Changed Popular Music'' by Chris Smith" &gt; "Editorial Reviews|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The Independent]]'', Christopher Hirst admired Smith's writing and choice of suitable quotes. He said the inclusion of early albums such as ''[[Elvis Presley (album)|Elvis Presley]]'' (1956), ''[[Muddy Waters at Newport]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963) was logical, but "sometimes the wrong record is picked by the right artist" in the case of the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965) and Davis' ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), which were chosen over ''Revolver'' and ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' (1969), respectively. Hirst also found the inclusion of ''[[Boston (album)|Boston]]'' (1976) and ''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' (1978) "inexplicable" and bemoaned the absence of Neil Young's ''[[After the Goldrush]]'' (1970) and [[the Allman Brothers Band]]'s ''[[At Fillmore East]]'' (1971).&lt;ref name="Hirst/Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/101-albums-that-changed-popular-music-by-chris-smith-1739610.html|first=Christopher|last=Hirst|title=101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, By Chris Smith|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Lord, in a review for ''[[Library Journal]]'', said the coverage and detail was impressive and that the author "prov[es] a consummate music critic/historian". Lord also approved of the recognition afforded Television's ''[[Marquee Moon]]'' (1977), Metallica's ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983) and Public Enemy's ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'' (1988), alongside the expected "classics" from the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Lord/Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syndetics.com/index.php?isbn=0195373715/ljreview.html&amp;client=natlibsingapore&amp;type=|first=Douglas C.|last=Lord|title=''Library Journal'' Review: 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music|publisher=syndetics.com|date=2010|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website for the [[J.W. Pepper &amp; Son|JW Pepper]] sheet music company describes the book as "A lively and provocative account" that "tells the fascinating stories behind the most groundbreaking, influential, and often controversial albums ever recorded".&lt;ref name="JW Pepper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jwpepper.com/101-Albums-that-Changed-Popular-Music/10074031.item#/submit|title=''101 Albums that Changed Popular Music'' Chris Smith – Oxford University Press|publisher=[[J.W.

'''A M Bisley &amp; Co Ltd v Thompson''' [1982] 2 NZLR 696 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding express terms in a contract.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It highlights one of the exceptions to the [[parol evidence rule]], that is contracts that are partly written, and partly oral contracts.

==Background==
Thompson ordered a grain dryer to be installed by A M Bisley on his crop farm so he could harvest his grain crops early.

In the written contract, the "estimated delivery date" was a vague "ASAP", however, it had been orally promised to be installed by the next harvest. However, A M Bisley ordered the grain dryer from an overseas manufacturer late, resulting in the grain dryer not being fully installed on Thompson's farm in time.

This unfortunately left Thompson unable to harvest his barley crop early when a storm destroyed his crop.

As a result of this, Thompson refused to pay Bisley for the grain dryer.

Bisley ultimately sued him for the cost of the grain dryer, and Thompson filed a counterclaim for breach of contract for the loss of his barley crop.

The District Court ruled in favour of both claims, meaning that Thompson did not have to pay Bisley's for the grain dryer.

Both parties appealed.

==Held==

The Court of appeal dismissed both the appeals.

The '''Archives of Terror''' ({{lang-es|Archivos del Terror}}) were found on December 22, 1992, by lawyer and [[human-rights]] activist Dr. [[Martín Almada]], and judge [[José Agustín Fernández]], in a police station in a suburb of [[Asunción]] ([[Lambaré]]), capital of [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=MikeCeaser&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1866517.stm "Paraguay's archive of terror"]. By Mike Ceaser. March 11, 2002. [[BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Fernández was looking for files on a former prisoner. Instead, he found archives describing the fates of thousands of Latin Americans who had been secretly kidnapped, tortured, and killed by the security services of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]] with cooperation of the [[CIA]]. This was known as [[Operation Condor]].

The "terror archives" listed 50,000 people murdered, 30,000 people [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] and 400,000 people imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/doc/condor/calloni.html Los Archivos del Horror del Operativo Cóndor] by Stella Calloni, on [[Nizkor]]'s website {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.nationalgeographic.com/thisday/dec22/archives-terror-discovered/ 1992: Archives of Terror Discovered]. ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].'' Retrieved August 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They also revealed that other countries such as [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]] cooperated, to various degrees, by providing intelligence information that had been requested by the security services of the [[Southern Cone]] countries. Some of these countries have used portions of the archives, now in [[Asunción's Palace of Justice]], to prosecute former military officers. Much of the case built against [[Augusto Pinochet|General Pinochet]] by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] was made using those archives. Almada, himself a victim of Condor, was twice interviewed by Baltasar Garzón. 

"[The documents] are a mountain of ignominy, of lies, which [[Alfredo Stroessner|Stroessner]] [Paraguay's dictator until 1989] used for 40 years to blackmail the Paraguayan people," states Almada.&lt;ref name=MikeCeaser/&gt; He wants the [[UNESCO]] to list the "terror archives" as an international cultural site, as this would greatly facilitate access to funding to preserve and protect the documents.

In May 2000, a [[UNESCO]] mission visited Asunción following a request from the Paraguayan authorities for help in putting these files on the [[Memory of the World Register]], one element of a program aimed at safeguarding and promoting the documentary heritage of humanity to ensure that records are preserved and available for consultation.

The '''Binas''' (Often written as '''BiNaS''') is a Dutch science reference work for the higher levels of [[secondary school]], consisting largely of tables and formulas. The name stands for '''bi'''ologie, '''na'''tuurkunde, '''s'''cheikunde ([[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]]). It is compiled by [[NVON]] and has been published by [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]] since 1975. There is also a smaller version for lower educational levels.

At most schools, students are allowed to use the BINAS for reference during a test or the final exam.

The '''Barrington Woolen Mill Museum''', located in [[Barrington, Nova Scotia]], is a part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]].
The museum is a preserved 19th century turbine mill. It was built in 1882, and ceased wool production in 1962. It became part of the Nova Scotia Museum system in 1967, as an example of one of the last small mills of the 1800s. The mill is listed on the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] (CRHP).

'''''Black Bible Chronicles''''' is a two-volume set of "adaptive retelling"  &lt;ref&gt;Boswell, Freddy. 2006.

Hermēneus, Vol. 8: 45-66&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Bible]] by P. K. McCary. ''Black Bible Chronicles: From Genesis to the Promised Land'' is a 190-page "interpretation" of the [[Pentateuch]]. Book 2, titled ''Rappin' With Jesus: The Good News According to the Four Brothers'', was released a year later{{when|date=April 2018}} and includes similarly interpreted versions of the four gospels in 168 pages. There has been no announcement concerning further releases in the series for the remainder of the Biblical books.

It is far more free in its structure than a [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|dynamic equivalence]] translation. In terms of style, it is more free than [[Clarence Jordan]]'s ''Cotton Patch'' version or ''The Aussie Bible''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theaussiebible.com.au/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914014537/http://www.theaussiebible.com.au/ |archive-date=2009-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Black Bible Chronicles'' books were all written by P.K.

'''Child prostitution''' is [[prostitution]] involving a child, and it is a form of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]]. The term normally refers to prostitution of a [[Minor (law)|minor]], or person under the legal [[Coming of age|age of consent]].
In most jurisdictions, child prostitution is illegal as part of general prohibition on prostitution.

Child prostitution usually manifests in the form of [[sex trafficking]], in which a child is [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] or duped into becoming involved in the sex trade, or "[[survival sex]]", in which the child engages in sexual activities to procure basic essentials such as food and shelter. Prostitution of children is commonly associated with [[child pornography]], and they often overlap. Some people travel to foreign countries to engage in [[child sex tourism]]. Research suggests that there may be as many as 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt; The problem is most severe in [[South America]] and [[Asia]], but prostitution of children exists globally,{{sfn|Lim|1998|p=171}} in undeveloped countries as well as developed.{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=10}} Most of the children involved with prostitution are girls, despite an increase in the number of young boys in the trade.

The [[United Nations]] has declared the prostitution of children to be illegal under international law, and various campaigns and organizations have been created to protest its existence.

"Most of the victimized children who face prostitution are vulnerable children who are exploited. Many predators target runaways, sexual assault victims, and children who have been harshly neglected by their biological parents. Not only have they faced traumatic violence that affects their physical being, but become intertwined into the violent life of prostitution." – U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/prostitution-children | title=The Prostitution of Children | publisher=U.S. Department of Justice | accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Sex and the Law}}
Several definitions have been proposed for prostitution of children. The United Nations defines it as "the act of engaging or offering the services of a child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that person or any other person".{{sfn|Lim|1998|p=170}} The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]'s [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography|Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography]] defines the practice as "the act of obtaining, procuring or offering the services of a child or inducing a child to perform sexual acts for any form of compensation or reward". Both emphasize that the child is a victim of exploitation, even if apparent consent is given.{{sfn|Lim|1998|p=170-171}} The [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999]], (Convention No 182) of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) describes it as the "use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C182 – Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182|date=June 17, 1999|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Labour Office]] in Geneva, prostitution of children and [[child pornography]] are two primary forms of child sexual exploitation, which often overlap.{{sfn|Lim|1998|p=171}} The former is sometimes used to describe the wider concept of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] (CSEC). It excludes other identifiable manifestations of CSEC, such as commercial sexual exploitation through [[child marriage]], [[child domestic work|domestic child labor]], and the [[trafficking of children]] for sexual purposes.{{sfn|Narayan|2005|p=138}}

The terminology applied to the practice is a subject of dispute. The [[United States Department of Justice]] states, "The term itself implies the idea of choice, when in fact that is not the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Exploitation and Obscenity|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/ceos/subjectareas/prostitution.html|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that oppose the practice believe that the terms "child prostitution" and "child prostitute" carry problematic connotations because children are generally not expected to be able to make informed decisions about prostitution. As an alternative, they use the terms "prostituted children" and "the commercial sexual exploitation of children".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=187}} Other groups use the term "child sex worker" to imply that the children are not always "passive victims".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=187}}

==Causes and types==
Children are often forced by social structures and individual agents into situations in which adults take advantage of their vulnerability and sexually exploit and abuse them by selling them or selling their bodies. [[Structure and agency]] commonly combine to force a child into commercial sex: for example, the prostitution of a child frequently follows from prior sexual abuse, often in the child's home.{{sfn|Bagley|King|2004|p=124}} Many believe that the majority of prostituted children are from Southeast Asia and the majority of their clients are Western [[Sex tourism|sex tourists]], but sociologist Louise Brown argues that, while Westerners contribute to the growth of the industry, most of the children's customers are Asian locals.{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=1-3}}

Prostitution of children usually occurs in environments such as [[brothel]]s, bars and clubs, homes, or particular streets and areas (usually in socially run down places). According to one study, only about 10% of prostituted children have a pimp and over 45% entered the business through friends.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|last=Hinman|first=Kristen|url=http://www.westword.com/2011-11-03/news/child-sex-trafficking-stereotypes-demolished/|title=Child sex trafficking stereotypes demolished |accessdate=December 4, 2011|newspaper=Westword|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Jaffe and Sonia Rosen from the International Child Labor Study Office write that cases vary widely: "Some victims are runaways from home or State institutions, others are sold by their parents or forced or tricked into prostitution, and others are street children. Some are amateurs and others professionals. Although one tends to think first and foremost of young girls in the trade, there is an increase in the number of young boys involved in prostitution. The most disquieting cases are those children who are forced into the trade and then incarcerated. These children run the possible further risk of torture and subsequent death."{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=10}}

===Human trafficking===
[[Human trafficking]] is defined by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) as "the recruitment, transport, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation".&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Trafficking FAQs|publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/faqs.html|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNODC approximates the number of victims worldwide to be around 2.5 million.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; [[UNICEF]] reports that since 1982 about 30 million children have been trafficked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who are the Victims?|publisher=[[End Human Trafficking Now]]|url=http://www.endhumantraffickingnow.com/who-are-the-victims/|year=2012|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trafficking for [[sexual slavery]] accounts for 79% of cases, with the majority of victims being female, of which an estimated 20% are children. Women are also often perpetrators as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNODC report on human trafficking exposes modern form of slavery|publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/global-report-on-trafficking-in-persons.html|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the UN founded [[United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking]] (UN.GIFT). In cooperation with UNICEF, the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) the United Nations took a grant from the United Arab Emirates to establish UN.GIFT. UN.GIFT aims to fight human trafficking through a mutual support from its stakeholders which includes governments, businesses, and other large global actors. Their first initiative is to spread the word that human trafficking is immoral and has become a growing problem that it will take a global cooperation to cease its continuation. UN.GIFT strives to lower the demand for this exploitation and create a safe environment for potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/index.html |title=About UN.GIFT |publisher=Ungift.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, victims of sex trafficking are kidnapped by strangers, either by force or by being tricked into becoming involved through lies and false promises.{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=31}} In other cases, the children's families allow or force them to enter the industry as a result of severe poverty.&lt;ref name=MNT/&gt; In cases where they are taken out of the country, traffickers prey on the fact that the children are often unable to understand the language of their new location and are unaware of their legal rights.{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=31}}

Research indicates that traffickers have a preference for females age 12 and under because young children are more easily molded into the role assigned to them and because they are assumed to be virgins, which is valuable to consumers. The girls are then made to appear older, and documents are forged as protection against law enforcement.{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=31}} Victims tend to share similar backgrounds, often coming from communities with high crime rates and lack of access to education. However, victimology is not limited to this, and males and females coming from various backgrounds have become involved in sex trafficking.{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=31}}

Psychotherapist Mary De Chesnay identifies five stages in the process of sex trafficking: vulnerability, recruitment, transportation, exploitation, and liberation.{{sfn|De Chesnay|2013|p=3}} The final stage, De Chesnay writes, is rarely completed. Murder and accidental death rates are high, as are suicides, and very few trafficking victims are rescued or escape.{{sfn|De Chesnay|2013|p=4}}

Sex trafficking is a lucrative business due to the low risk and high demand for its existence. The return of high profits acts as a primary incentive driving the spread of human trafficking. Today, most markets are operated online disguised as salon parlors making it harder to enforce sex trafficking laws. Examples are online escort services, residential brothels, brothels disguised as massage businesses or spas, many of which enslave children to their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/overview |title=Human Trafficking &amp;#124; Polaris &amp;#124; Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery |publisher=Polarisproject.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survival sex=== 
{{See also|Survival sex}}
The other primary form of prostitution of children is "survival sex". The US Department of Justice states:

{{quote|"Survival sex" occurs when a child engages in sex acts in order to obtain money, food, shelter, clothing, or other items needed in order to survive. In these situations, the transaction typically only involves the child and the customer; children engaged in survival sex are usually not controlled or directed by pimps, madams, or other traffickers. Any individual who pays for sex with a child, whether the child is controlled by a pimp or is engaged in survival sex, can be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for: Prostitution of Children|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/ceos/faqs/faqs.html#prostitution|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A study commissioned by UNICEF and [[Save the Children]] and headed by sociologist Annjanette Rosga conducted research on prostitution of children in post-war [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Rosga reported that poverty was a strong contributing factor. She stated, "The global sex trade is as much a product of everyday people struggling to survive in dire economic straits as it is an organized crime problem. Attacking the crime and not the poverty is treating the symptom but not the disease...It's not uncommon for girls to know what they're entering into, and to enter voluntarily to some degree. Maybe they think they'll be different and able to escape, or maybe they'd rather take the risk than feel powerless staying at home in poverty."&lt;ref name=MNT&gt;{{cite web|title=Child sex-trafficking study in Bosnia reveals misperceptions|work=[[Medical News Today]]|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/20496.php|date=March 1, 2005|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffe and Rosen disagree and argue that poverty alone does not often force children into prostitution, as it does not exist in a large scale in several impoverished societies. Rather, a number of external influences, such as poor family situations and domestic violence, factor into the problem.{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=11}}

Prostitution of children in the form of survival sex occurs in both undeveloped and developed countries. In Asia, underage girls sometimes work in brothels to support their families. In Sri Lanka, parents will more often have their sons prostitute themselves rather than their daughters, as the society places more weight on sexual purity among females than males.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=188-189}} Jaffe and Rosen write that prostitution of children in North America often results from "economic considerations, domestic violence and abuse, family disintegration and drug addiction".{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=26}} In Canada, a young man was convicted of charges relating to the prostitution of a 15-year-old girl online in 2012; he had encouraged her to prostitute herself as a means of making money, kept all of her earnings, and threatened her with violence if she did not continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|journal=[[Times Colonist]] |title=Pimp who sold girl, 15, for sex gets three years |date=May 30, 2012 |author=Louise Dickson |url=http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/capital_van_isl/story.html?id=e4e5c8e9-4cbf-44c2-b296-ecd628e0ec56 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002215629/http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/capital_van_isl/story.html?id=e4e5c8e9-4cbf-44c2-b296-ecd628e0ec56 |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===Treatment of prostituted children===
Prostituted children are often forced to work in hazardous environments without proper hygiene.{{sfn|Madsen|Strong|2009|p=293}} They face threats of violence and are sometimes raped and beaten. Researchers Robin E. Clark, Judith Freeman Clark, and Christine A. Adamec write that they "suffer a great deal of abuse, unhappiness, and poor health" in general.{{sfn|Clark|Freeman Clark|Adamec|2007|p=68}} For example, [[Derrick Jensen]] reports that female sex trafficking victims from Nepal are "'broken in' through a process of rapes and beatings, and then rented out up to thirty-five times per night for one to two dollars per man".{{sfn|Jensen|2004|p=41}} Another example involved mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in Mumbai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Lucknow, and Gorakhpur. One victim left Nepal at the age of 14 and was sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly circumcised. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were castrated, before escaping and returning to Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many of the other boys there were castrated. Beatings and starvation became a part of his life. “There were 40 to 50 boys in the place,” a gaunt, brooding Raju recalls. “Most of them were Nepalese.”

Criminologist Ronald Flowers writes that prostitution of children and child pornography are closely linked; up to one in three prostituted children have been involved in pornography, often through films or literature. Runaway teenagers, he states, are frequently used for "porn flicks" and photographs.{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=123}} In addition to pornography, Flowers writes that, "Children caught up in this dual world of sexual exploitation are often victims of sexual assaults, sexual perversions, sexually transmitted diseases, and inescapable memories of sexual misuse and bodies that have been compromised, brutalized, and left forever tarnished."{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=124}}

===Physical and psychological effects===
According to [[Humanium]], an NGO that opposes the prostitution of children, the practice causes injuries such as "vaginal tearing, physical after-effects of torture, pain, infection, or unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=Humanium&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanium.org/en/child-prostitution/|title=Child Prostitution|publisher=Humanium|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As clients seldom take precautions against the spread of [[HIV]],&lt;ref name=Humanium/&gt; prostituted children face a high risk of contracting the disease, and the majority of them in certain locations contract it. Other sexually transmitted diseases pose a threat as well, such as [[syphilis]] and [[herpes]]. High levels of [[tuberculosis]] have also been found among prostituted children.{{sfn|Clark|Freeman Clark|Adamec|2007|p=68}} These illnesses are often fatal.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt;

Former prostituted children often deal with psychological trauma, including [[Clinical depression|depression]] and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).{{sfn|Clark|Freeman Clark|Adamec|2007|p=68}} Other psychological effects include anger, insomnia, sexual and personality confusion, inability to trust adults, and loss of confidence. Drug-related health problems included dental problems, hepatitis B and C, and serious liver and kidney problems. Other medical complications included reproductive problems and injuries from sexual assaults; physical and neurological problems from violent physical attacks; and other general health issues including respiratory problems and joint pains.&lt;ref name=Humanium/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Du Mont &amp; McGregor, 2004: Edinburgh, Saewye, Thao, &amp; Levitt, 2006; Farley et al., 2003; Hoot et al., 2006; Izugbara, 2005; Nixon et al.,

Prostitution of children is illegal under international law, and the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]], Article 34, states, "the State shall protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, including prostitution and involvement in pornography."{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=189}} The convention was first held in 1989 and has been ratified by 193 countries. In 1990, the United Nations appointed a [[Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|publisher=United Nations Human Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/children/pages/childrenindex.aspx|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over at least the last decade, the international community has increasingly acknowledged the importance of addressing problems posed by the trafficking of children, child prostitution, and child pornography; activities that undermine the rights of children and are frequently linked to organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buck|first=Trevor|date=2008-05-01|title=‘International Criminalisation and Child Welfare Protection’: the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1099-0860.2008.00148.x/abstract|journal=Children &amp; Society|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=167–178|doi=10.1111/j.1099-0860.2008.00148.x|issn=1099-0860}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the legality of adult prostitution varies between different parts of the world, the prostitution of [[Minor (law)|minors]] is illegal in most countries, and all countries have some form of restrictions against it.{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=10}}

There is a dispute surrounding what constitutes a prostituted child. International law defines a child as any individual below the age of 18,{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=9}} but a number of countries legally recognize lower ages of consent and adulthood, usually ranging from 13 to 17 years of age.{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=10}} Thus, law enforcement officers are sometimes hesitant to investigate cases because of the differences in age of consent.{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=10}} The laws of some countries do, however, distinguish between prostituted teenagers and prostituted children. For example, the Japanese government defines the category as referring to minors between 13 and 18.{{sfn|Chan|2004|p=66}}

Consequences for offenders vary from country to country. In the [[People's Republic of China]], all forms of prostitution are illegal, but having sexual contact with anyone under the age of 14, regardless of consent, will result in a more serious punishment  than raping an adult.&lt;ref&gt;Note 19, Article 360, at 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the legal penalty for participating in the prostitution of children includes five to twenty years in prison.{{sfn|O'Connor|Rausch|Klemenčič|Albrecht|2007|p=264}} The FBI established "Innocence Lost", a new department working to free children from prostitution, in response to the strong public reaction across the country to the news of [[Operation Stormy Nights]], in which 23 [[Minor (law)|minors]] were released from [[forced prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|title=Human network|author=C.G.

==Prevalence==
Prostitution of children exists in every country, though the problem is most severe in [[South America]] and [[Asia]].{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=11}} The number of prostituted children is rising in other parts of the world, including [[North America]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]].{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=11}} Exact statistics are difficult to obtain,{{sfn|Jaffe|Rosen|1997|p=10-11|quote="The situation is rendered more convoluted by the unavailability of accurate statistics. In one country, there is a debate as to whether there really are 800,000 child victims of prostitution or whether this often quoted number is a gross exaggeration. Available statistics are often out of date. I submit, however, that even if one child is exploited sexually, it is a serious matter."}} but it is estimated that there are around 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt;

By 1999, it was reported that in [[Argentina]] prostitution of children was increasing at an alarming rate and that the average age was decreasing. The [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] (CATW) fact book says Argentina is one of the favored destinations of pedophile sex tourists from Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ECPAT International, A Step Forward |year=1999 |url=http://www.gvnet.com/childprostitution/Argentina.htm |publisher=Gvnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina's Criminal Code criminalizes the prostitution of minors of eighteen years of age or younger,&lt;ref&gt;1 Codigo Penal y Leyes Complementarias, art. 125 bis (6th ed., Editorial Astrea, Buenos Aires, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; but it only sanctions those who "promote or facilitate" prostitution, not the client who exploits the minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/argentina.php |title=Children\'s Rights: Argentina &amp;#124; Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==

===Public perception===
Anthropologist Heather Montgomery writes that society has a largely negative perception of prostitution of children, in part because the children are often viewed as having been abandoned or sold by their parents and families.{{sfn|Panter-Brick|Smith|2000|p=182}} The International Labour Organization includes the prostitution of children in its [[List of the worst forms of child labour (ILO convention)|list of the "worst forms of child labour"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The worst forms of child labour|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/Youthinaction/C182-Youth-orientated/worstforms/lang--en/index.htm|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1996 World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children it was called "a crime against humanity", "torture", and "slavery".{{sfn|Cowan|Wilson|2001|p=86}} [[Virginia Kendall]], a district judge and expert on child exploitation and human trafficking, and [[T. Markus Funk]], an attorney and law professor, write that the subject is an emotional one and that there are various perspectives about its prevention:

{{quote|The topic of proscribing and punishing child exploitation triggers intense emotions. While there is general consensus that child sexual exploitation, whether through the Internet, forced prostitution, the international or domestic trafficking of children for sex, or molestation, is on the rise, observers in the United States and elsewhere find little common ground on the questions of how serious such conduct is, or what, if anything, must be done to address it.{{sfn|Kendall|Funk|2012|p=9}}}}

Investigative journalist [[Julian Sher]] states that widespread stereotypes about the prostitution of children continued into the 1990s, when the first organized opposition arose and police officers began working to dispel common misconceptions.{{sfn|Sher|2011|p=35}} Criminologist [[Roger Matthews (criminologist)|Roger Matthews]] writes that concerns over [[pedophilia]] and child sexual abuse, as well as shifting perceptions of youth, led the public to see a sharp difference between prostitution of children and adult prostitution. While the latter is generally frowned upon, the former is seen as intolerable.{{sfn|Matthews|2008|p=17}} Additionally, he states, children are increasingly viewed as "innocent" and "pure" and their prostitution as paramount to slavery.{{sfn|Matthews|2008|p=17}} Through the shift in attitude, the public began to see minors involved in the sex trade as victims rather than as perpetrators of a crime, needing rehabilitation rather than punishment.{{sfn|Sher|2011|p=35-36}}

===Opposition===
Though campaigns against prostitution of children originated in the 1800s,{{sfn|Matthews|2008|p=15}} the first mass protests against the practice occurred in the 1990s in the United States, led largely by [[ECPAT]] (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism). The group, which historian [[Junius P. Rodriguez]] describes as "the most significant of the campaigning groups against child prostitution", originally focused on the issue of children being exploited in Southeast Asia by Western tourists.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=190}} Women's rights groups and anti-tourism groups joined to protest the practice of sex tourism in [[Bangkok]], Thailand. The opposition to sex tourism was spurred on by an image of a Thai youth in prostitution, published in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and by the publication of a dictionary in the United Kingdom describing Bangkok as "a place where there are a lot of prostitutes".{{sfn|Dewey|Kelly|2011|p=148}} Cultural anthropologists Susan Dewey and Patty Kelly write that though they were unable to inhibit sex tourism and rates of prostitution of children continued to rise, the groups "galvanized public opinion nationally and internationally" and succeeded in getting the media to cover the topic extensively for the first time.{{sfn|Dewey|Kelly|2011|p=148}} ECPAT later expanded its focus to protest child prostitution globally.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=190}}

The late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the creation of a number of shelters and rehabilitation programs for prostituted children, and the police began to actively investigate the issue.{{sfn|Sher|2011|p=35}} The National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) was later established by the [[Polaris Project]] as a national, toll-free hotline, available to answer calls from anywhere in the United States, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year. Operated by [[Polaris Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarisproject.org/index.php |title=Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery |publisher=Polaris Project |date= |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hotline was designed to allow callers to report tips and receive information on human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarisproject.org/what-we-do/national-human-trafficking-hotline/the-nhtrc/overview |title=National Human Trafficking Resource Center &amp;#124; Polaris Project &amp;#124; Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery |publisher=Polaris Project |date= |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposition to prostitution of children and sexual slavery spread to Europe and elsewhere, and organizations pushed for prostituted children to be recognized as victims rather than offenders.{{sfn|Matthews|2008|p=17}} The issue remained prominent in the following years, and various campaigns and organizations continued into the 2000s and 2010s.{{sfn|Matthews|2008|p=17}}

==History==
[[File:Stead 1881.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[William Thomas Stead]] in 1881.]]
Prostitution of children dates to antiquity. Prepubescent boys were commonly prostituted in [[Brothel|brothels]] in ancient Greece and [[Rome]].{{sfn|Clark|Freeman Clark|Adamec|2007|p=68-69}} According to Ronald Flowers, the "most beautiful and highest born Egyptian maidens were forced into prostitution...and they continued as prostitutes until their first [[menstruation]]." Chinese and Indian children were commonly sold by their parents into prostitution.{{sfn|Flowers|1994|p=81}} Parents in India sometimes dedicated their female children to the [[Hindu temple|Hindu temples]], where they became "[[Devadasi|devadasis]]". Traditionally a high status in society, the devadasis were originally tasked with maintaining and cleaning the temples of the Hindu deity to which they were assigned (usually the goddess [[Renuka]]) and learning skills such as music and dancing. However, as the system evolved, their role became that of a temple prostitute, and the girls, who were "dedicated" before puberty, were required to prostitute themselves to upper class men.{{sfn|Institute of Social Sciences (New Delhi, India)|National Human Rights Commission|2005|p=504}}{{sfn|Penn|2003|p=49}} The practice has since been outlawed but still exists.{{sfn|Penn|2003|p=49}}

In [[Europe]], child prostitution flourished until the late 1800s;{{sfn|Flowers|1994|p=81}} minors accounted for 50% of individuals involved in prostitution in [[Paris]].{{sfn|Cossins|2000|p=7}} A scandal in 19th-century [[England]] caused the [[government]] there to raise the [[age of consent]].{{sfn|Clark|Freeman Clark|Adamec|2007|p=69}} In July 1885, [[W. T. Stead|William Thomas Stead]], editor of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', published "[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]", four articles describing an extensive underground [[sex trafficking]] ring that reportedly sold children to adults. Stead's reports focused on a 13-year-old girl, [[Eliza Armstrong case|Eliza Armstrong]], who was sold for [[Pound sign|£]]5 (the equivalent of around £500 in 2012), then taken to a [[midwife]] to have her [[virginity]] verified. The age of consent was raised from 13 to 16 within a week of publication.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hogenboom|first=Melissa|title=Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|publisher=BBC News|date=November 1, 2013|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the term ''white slavery'' came to be used throughout Europe and the [[United States]] to describe prostituted children.{{sfn|Flowers|1994|p=81}}{{sfn|Fine|Ellis|2011|pp=83–85}}

A '''cohabitation agreement''' is a form of legal agreement reached between a couple who have chosen to live together (whether they are [[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]]). In some ways, such a couple may be treated like a [[marriage|married]] couple, such as when applying for a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] or working out [[child support]]. However, in some other areas, such as property rights, [[pension]]s and [[inheritance]], they are treated differently.

A cohabitation agreement contains documentation for a couple who want to live together in order to protect themselves from unnecessary cost and litigation should their cohabitation break down. They can clearly regulate their property rights and what arrangements might be made for mutual financial support, dealing with [[debt]], caring for [[child]]ren, etc.

The agreement also, much like a [[prenuptial agreement]], allows the individuals concerned to determine in advance who will keep specific assets and what will happen to assets that have been purchased jointly if they separate. This agreement is intended to bind both parties.

== Advantages ==

In the United States, about 15 million couples qualify as cohabiting. A cohabitation agreement can give each party an idea of the expectations of the relationship with the legal enforceability to protect against financial ruin or the loss of support that was promised.&lt;ref name="minellalawgroup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minellalawgroup.com/dont-wait-to-protect-your-assets-with-an-enforceable-cohabitation-agreement/|title=Enforceable Cohabitation Agreements – Minella Law Group|date=27 February 2013|website=minellalawgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a good idea in that if the couple does break up, an altercation about who receives what may be less likely. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the courts may occasionally change or ignore provisions set out in a cohabitation agreement if they feel that they are inadequate under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.lawdepot.com/wiki/Cohabitation_Agreement_FAQ_-_United_States#Will_my_cohabitation_agreement_be_accepted_by_the_courts.3F|title=Cohabitation Agreement FAQ – United States|website=wiki.lawdepot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages and limitations ==
Cohabitation agreements are not considered to be legally binding in the [[United Kingdom]].

A cohabitation agreement will usually not be adequate to settle all legal issues that might arise, so a [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]] setting out property rights and a [[will (law)|will]] are also recommended.

== Common law marriage ==
It is a common misconception that there is a doctrine of "Common Law marriage" in English law. That is to say that without having married, there is no automatic right to home ownership, even if the home is shared for a long time. Instead, the only way in which ownership can be obtained is through ordinary trust law. Even if the parties are legally married, there is still no automatic right to home ownership. Instead, any transfer of ownership will be at the discretion of the court when exercising their power under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

In Canada, each province has legislation which governs the creation of cohabitation agreements. In the Province of Ontario there are restrictions on what can be included in such agreements. For example, clauses requiring chastity are unenforceable. Provisions which pre-determine issues of child custody and access as well as child support may be disregarded by a court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peires Law LLP|url=http://www.peireslaw.com/marriage-contracts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in Canada, for a cohabitation agreement to be valid, it must be signed, witnessed, and accompanied by financial disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cohabitation Agreement|url=http://www.cohabitationagreement.ca/validity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Same sex couples ==
Some gay activists have been campaigning for legal recognition of their partnerships. Their campaigning for the right to take over a partner's tenancy of the family home on bereavement have been gained, regardless of any cohabitation agreement existing, but if a couple share a home their chances of buying the rights are much more limited.

In December 2005, the British government offered gay couples equal rights with married couples if they register a civil partnership legally. The government-backed scheme – which enables same-sex couples to qualify for next-of-kin entitlements on inheritance tax, pensions and property – is likely to attract many more couples.

There will still be large legal differences between civil partnership and marriage. For example, a couple can get married and have all the legal rights and benefits after knowing each other for only a few days, but a same-sex couple will almost certainly be required to show a lengthy commitment to each other before they are allowed to register their partnership. Currently, for immigration purposes, a same-sex couple must show they have a relationship of two years' standing, and it is likely that a similar term will be imposed for registering a partnership. Consequently, same-sex couples will need to make wills and a cohabitation agreement, to provide security in the event of break-up.

In the United States, a cohabitation agreement offers fewer legal protections than a registered domestic partnership.&lt;ref name="minellalawgroup.com" /&gt;
== Prenuptial agreements ==
As afore mentioned, the term is also sometimes used loosely to refer to prenuptial agreements. These are often designed when one intends to protect his or her wealth in the event of the marriage ending in divorce. The contract aims to achieve a measure of certainty about what the financial "damage" would be if the marriage came to an end. However ''K v K'' (2003) has heightened the importance of prenuptial agreements by deciding that the wife had to stick by the terms of a prenuptial agreement she signed. The courts still keep their discretion about whether or not a prenuptial agreement will be upheld but this new case shows that the courts are in favour of couples making private agreements between themselves.

== Platform ==
The [[operating system]]s or [[virtual machine]]s the SSH clients are designed to run on without [[emulator|emulation]]; there are several possibilities:

 &lt;!--* ''No'' indicates that it does not exist or was never released.--&gt;
* ''Partial'' indicates that while it works, the client lacks important functionality compared to versions for other OSs but may still be under development.
 &lt;!--* ''Beta'' indicates that while a version is fully functional and has been released, it is still in development (e.g. for stability).
* ''Yes'' indicates that it has been officially released in a fully functional, stable version.
* ''Dropped'' indicates that while the client works, new versions are no longer being released for the indicated OS; the number in parentheses is the last known stable version which was officially released for that OS.
* ''Included'' indicates that the client comes pre-packaged with or has been integrated into the operating system.--&gt;

The list is not exhaustive, but rather reflects the most common platforms today.

{{Reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=mouse_input&gt;The ability to transmit mouse input to text mode applications such as [[Midnight Commander]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=openssh_smartcard&gt;OpenSSH needs to be patched to ask for the pin of the smartcard. If you don't want to patch OpenSSH [http://www.gnulinuxmag.com/index.php?2006/11/08/38-precisions-sur-l-article-smartcard-de-glmf-88 you can use ssh-agent (the link is in french)].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=puttySmartcard&gt;PuTTY does not support smart cards, but is supported in [http://sourceforge.net/projects/puttywincrypt/ puttywincrypt], [http://www.risacher.org/putty-cac/ PuTTY-CAC], and in [http://smartcard-auth.de/ssh-en.html Smartcard Authentication – Secure &amp; Easy putty version].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=puttyTabs&gt;PuTTY does not support directly, but many wrappers are available that do (e.g. [http://www.unixmantra.com/2013/04/putty-connection-manager-tabbed-putty.html PuTTY Connection Manager], [https://github.com/jimradford/superputty SuperPuTTY], [http://ttyplus.com/multi-tabbed-putty/ MTPuTTY], [https://sites.google.com/site/macdsite/utilidades/puttytabmanager/ PuTTYTabManager], [http://www.mremoteng.org/ mRemoteNG], [http://winsshterm.blogspot.com/ WinSSHTerm], [http://puttymanager.sourceforge.net/ PuTTY Manager] and [https://www.raisin.de/putty-tabs/putty-tabs.html PuttyTabs]).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=puttyHyperlink&gt;PuTTY does not support this, some forks of PuTTY do (e.g. [http://haanstra.eu/putty/ PuTTY Tray] and [http://www.9bis.net/kitty/ KiTTY]).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=puttyAES&gt;AES-NI support is expected in [https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commit;h=2d31305af9d3bf4096bb0c30e8a8336caaa70673 PuTTY 0.71]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=openssh_mouse_input&gt;Only when the terminal itself supports mouse input. Most graphical ones do, e.g. [[xterm]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=openssh_url_highlight&gt;No native URL highlighting; however most graphical consoles support URL highlighting&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5863">'''Culture Assimilators''' are culture training programs first developed at the [[University of Illinois]] in the 1960s. A team from the psychology department of that university was asked by the [[Office of Naval Research]] to develop a training method that would “make every sailor an ambassador of the United States.”  The team consistent of Fred Fiedler, whose major research was the study of leadership, [[Charles Osgood]], whose major research was on interpersonal communication, [[Larry Stolurow]], whose major research was on the use of computers for training, and [[Harry Triandis]], whose major research was the study of the relationship between culture and social behavior.

__TOC__

== Culture Assimilators ==

The team developed methods for the study of culture and social behavior (Triandis, 1972), and the information was formatted in such a way that computers could be used in the training.

The procedure started with interviews with people who had experience in two cultures, e.g., A and B. The questions asked for “episodes” or “critical incidents” that surprised and confused members of culture B when they interacted with people from culture A.  Student samples from the two cultures were asked to explain why the problem or confusion occurs. When the explanations given by the students from culture A were different from the explanations given by members from culture B, there was something to teach. For example, teachers from the U.S. are annoyed that pupils from Latin America do not look at them when they talk. Why is that? The explanation is that in the U. S. people usually pay attention to the speaker by looking at the speaker, but in Latin America it is “insolent” to look at a high status person in the eyes. One is supposed to look down.

	The format of assimilators is as follows. An episode is described (page 1) followed by 4 or 5 explanations of why there is a problem or difficulty. For example, why do people from culture A behave that way? The trainee selects the explanation that s/he thinks is best. The explanations are selected such that when people from culture B are learning about culture A most of the explanations are frequently given by people in  culture B and one explanation comes from culture A. After the trainee selects an explanation s/he is asked to turn to a page (pages 2, 3, 4, 5) that gives feedback about each explanation. If the explanation selected by the trainee is incorrect, the trainee is told that this is not the best explanation, and to try another explanation. When the trainee picks the correct explanation, the feedback is extensive, describing cultural similarities and differences between cultures A and B. Assimilators that use feedback that includes culture theory, such as the differences between collectivist and individualist cultures, are especially effective. Gradually, the trainee from culture B starts thinking like the people from culture A. In a way, s/he learns to get “into the shoes” of the people from the other culture.

	The result is a training program that makes people more comfortable in working in the other culture. This was tested by assigning trainees randomly to two groups. One group gets the assimilator training, and the other gets geography training, such as what are the physical features of culture A. After the training the trainees go to the other culture and the effectiveness of their interactions in that culture and the comfort they experience while they live in the other culture is measured. The results show that the assimilator training is helpful. Training does not make the trainee an ambassador, that was too much to hope, but the trained individuals have a better experience in the other culture than those who did not receive the culture assimilator training.

'''Domain name speculation''' is the practice of identifying and registering or acquiring Internet [[domain name]]s as an investment with the intent of selling them later for a profit.

The main targets of domain name speculation are generic words which can be valuable for [[type-in traffic]] and for the dominant position they would have in any field due to their descriptive nature. Hence generic words and phrases&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtld.mobi/domain/premium A 242 page list of premium generic words and phrases reserved by the .mobi registry, mTLD during the Sunrise phase of the launch of .mobi TLD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231212656/http://mtld.mobi/domain/premium |date=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''poker'', ''insurance'', ''travel'', ''creditcards'', ''loan'' and others are attractive targets of domain speculation in any [[top-level domain]].

The speculative characteristics of domain names may be linked to news reports or current events. However, the effective period during which such opportunities exist may be limited. Quick turnaround in the resale of domains is often called ''domain [[flipping]]''. Domain flipping may also involve the process of buying a valuable domain name and building a related website around it, all this with the objective of selling the domain and newly built website to an interested party.

==Concept==
Sometimes, domain name speculation involves finding domain names early in a market, particularly when a new top-level domain is launched, registering them and waiting until the market grows to sell them. Domains such as [[sex.com]], marijuana.com and [[business.com]] have sold for millions of US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSN2639237020070726 |title=RH Donnelley buys Business.com domain name-WSJ |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=15 November 2011 |date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/28/weedmaps-acquires-marijuana-com-for-a-kushy-4-20-million/ |title=WeedMaps Acquires Marijuana.com For A Kushy $4.20 Million |agency=TechCrunch  |accessdate=3 March 2015 |date=28 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[.com|COM]] [[top-level domain]] (or 'TLD') is the focus of most domain speculation activity as it is the largest TLD. Domain speculation occurs in other TLDs as well, such as [[.net|NET]] and to a lesser extent in [[.org|ORG]], [[.info|INFO]], and [[.biz|BIZ]].  Of the [[Generic top-level domain]]s, INFO is the most popular by registration volume compared to BIZ gTLD due to the low cost of initial registration and the recognizability of INFO as being an abbreviation of ''information''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forms.icann.org//idashboard/public/ |title=ICANN Registry Status Domain Counts (.aero to .mobi) |publisher=Forms.icann.org |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain name speculation also occurs in [[country code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs) such as [[.uk]], [[.de]] and [[.us]].&lt;ref name="nominet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/digitalAssets/28806_Domaining_May_07.pdf |title=Nominet (.UK Registry) document discusses Domaining, dropcatching and the secondary market in .uk ccTLD |format=PDF |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German TLD consists of over 12 million domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denic.de |title=DE Registration figures |publisher=Denic.de |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's domain has over 7.7 million domains registered according to Nominet's domain registration statistics webpage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/intelligence/statistics/registration/ |title=UK Registration figures |publisher=Nominet.org.uk |accessdate=15 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716155259/http://www.nominet.org.uk/intelligence/statistics/registration/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly in its commercial [[sub-domain]] [[.co.uk|co.uk]]. These TLDs are mature markets where good domain names may command high prices. The [[.eu|EU]] ccTLD is an example of what happens when speculative activity overtakes "ordinary" domain registrations.&lt;ref&gt;[[.eu#Landrush|.eu ccTLD Landrush period controversy.]]&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of an inept registry ([[Eurid|EURid]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/default.aspx?page=7034 |title=Cybersquatters can get rich if they're quick, says .eu registry |publisher=Out-law.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and excessive speculation by businesses exploiting a poorly structured regulatory framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bobbie Johnson, technology correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/apr/08/news.europeanunion |title="Thousands lose out to touts in sale of .eu addresses" Guardian Newspaper, London, UK 8 April 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=15 November 2011 |date=8 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Kieren |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/24/eu_domains_suspended/ |title=74000 .eu domains suspended |publisher=TheRegister.co.uk |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant that, according to [[EURid]]'s own statistics at the end of 2006, over 50% of the registrations could be considered at best speculative and at worst [[domain name warehousing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurid.eu/files/2006_annual_report.pdf |title=Eurid 2006 annual report, Page 20. Numbers of domains per registrant. |format=PDF |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialist and ''repurposed'' [[ccTLD]]s have also seen elements of domain name speculation. One of the best examples is that of the [[.tv]] ccTLD which has found the fact that ''TV'' is an abbreviation for the word television to be rather lucrative. The [[.mobi]] TLD is a good example of a specialist TLD in that it is specifically targeted at mobile phones and similar mobile technology. The operators of .mobi, mTLD, have reserved some of the premium generic words which will be auctioned off. The intent is to create a more level playing field for those interested in developing websites. The .mobi premium generic words and phrases list is a good example of the domain names that are at the heart of most early-market domain name speculation.

Domain name speculators, sometimes known as '''domainers''' or '''domain investors''', also register domain names based on seemingly generic phrases such as ''propertyforsale'' in the hope that these domain names could be sold later to businesses. Some (but not all) domain name investors will try to stay away from domain names containing trademarks as this could be considered [[cybersquatting]].

Some [[ccTLD|country code TLD]]s or [[Sponsored top-level domain|sponsored TLD]]s will have what is referred to as an eligibility or nexus requirement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nic.us/policies/docs/ustld_nexus_requirements.pdf |title=us Nexus requirements |publisher=Nic.us |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurid.eu/files/Annex1.pdf |title=.eu Registration Eligibility. |format=PDF |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.asia/about/faq.html#q21 |title=asia Registration Requirements |publisher=Asia.asia |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=118 |url=http://www.denic.de/en/faq-single/277/246.html |title=de German administrative contact requirement |publisher=Denic.de |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to limit registration to specific geographical or national regions. However this does not deter domain name speculation as various options such as using a local agent or company to enable people to register domains in such TLDs exist and have been used.

==Evolution==
Domain name speculation has evolved with the expansion of the domain name system. Domain names were registered primarily for business purposes. In the 1990s, much of the ccTLD landscape had yet to appear, and the growing public awareness of the [[.com|COM]] TLD was gathering momentum owing to the growth of the [[Dot-com bubble]]. This inevitably attracted the attention of those who saw potential value in domain names, and by this time many of the most valuable generic domain names, such as [[sex.com]] and [[business.com]], had been registered.  No clear legal position existed to distinguish domain name speculation and cybersquatting. Due to the open nature of most TLDs, anyone could register a domain name. This led to the development of the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/udrp-schedule.htm |title=Timeline for the Formulation and Implementation of the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy |publisher=Icann.org |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from cybersquatting==
A common accusation against domain name speculation is that it is cybersquatting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Domain-restrictions-target-cybersquatters/2100-1023_3-225278.html |title="Domain restrictions target cybersquatters" news.com 03 May 1999 |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cybersquatting]] is defined as  registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The key element in this definition is that the intellectual property rights of another's trademark are infringed by the cybersquatter. For a UDRP action to succeed one of the things that the complainant has to establish is that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/dndr/udrp/uniform-rules.htm |title=UDRP rules |publisher=Icann.org |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimate domain name speculation tends to steer clear of trademarks and concentrate on generic words and phrases{{cn|date=August 2016}} as domains based on trademarks can be subject of [[UDRP]] actions by the trademark owners. As the number of registered domain names has increased, the number of [[UDRP]] cases has also increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2009/article_0005.html |title=WIPO Press Release On Rise of UDRP Cases |publisher=Wipo.int |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trademark and [[service mark]] owners now use brand protection services that monitor TLDs for newly registered domains that potentially infringe on their trademarks. This is due in part to [[typosquatting]], a form of cybersquatting where variations of the spelling of a brand's domain will be registered in an attempt to profit from users mistyping the [[URL]] of the site they wish to visit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Microsoft-Ships-URL-Tracer-to-Hunt-Down-TypoSquatters/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/strider/typo-patrol/screenshots.htm |title=Microsoft's Strider URL Patrol |publisher=Research.microsoft.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/strider/urltracer/Parked_Domains.htm |title=Examples of typosquatted domains detected by Microsoft's Strider project |publisher=Research.microsoft.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generic terms, such as the term "salt" when used in connection with sodium chloride, are not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing a product or service. This means that generic terms are generally not afforded any legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trademark distinctiveness#Generic terms|Why generic marks are not generally afforded legal protection.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Canned Foods, Inc. v. Ult Search Inc. decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adrforum.com/domains/decisions/96320.htm |title=Canned Foods, Inc. v Ult. Search Inc. National Arbitration Forum Decision |publisher=Adrforum.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically deals with a case involving a generic term, "Grocery Outlet" and the domain name "groceryoutlet.com". The decision contains the key sentence "Generic terms receive no protection in US trademark law when they are used to label the goods and services that they describe."

Cybersquatting was first used as a legal term in March 1998 by a U.S. District Court in California in the case of ''Avery Dennison vs Sumpton''.&lt;ref name="origins_cybersquatting"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isenberg|first1=Doug|title=The Origins of ‘Cybersquatting’|url=http://www.gigalaw.com/2015/11/18/the-origins-of-cybersquatting/|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early definition of the practice was given in ''Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen'', 947 F. Supp. 1227 (N.D. Ill. 1996). The definition was "These individuals attempt to profit from the Internet by reserving and later reselling or licensing domain names back to the companies that spent millions of dollars developing the goodwill of the trademark."&lt;ref name="intermatic_case"&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen'', 947 F. Supp. 1227 (N.D. Ill. 1996)|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ilnd.58935|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As domain name speculation has evolved alongside the domain name system, the most memorable and shortest domains tend to be amongst those registered first in any TLD. For old TLDs like &lt;tt&gt;[[.com|COM]]&lt;/tt&gt; (introduced in 1985), these domains will be long gone and people registering their first domains are often frustrated at the lack of short and memorable domains in this and other mature TLDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090701/good-domain-names-grow-scarce.html |title=Good Domain Names Grow Scarce – Inc Magazine, 01 July 2009 |publisher=Inc.com |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main problems concerning trademarks and domain names in [[Unrestricted gTLDs#Unrestricted gTLD|unrestricted]] TLDs and gTLDs is that of trademarks in general: the rights of the trademark owner have to be asserted in order to protect the trademark. The trademark owner has to take legal action, typically a [[UDRP]], to defend the trademark after the potentially [[Trademark infringement|infringing]] domain has been registered. The [[UDRP]] action has to follow a procedure of notifying the respondent, receiving a reply from the respondent, appointing an adjudication panel and awaiting a decision. The process can take two months or more&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internic.net/faqs/udrp.html |title=How long does it take to decide a UDRP case? |publisher=Internic.net |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all costs (typically more than [[US dollar|$]]1,000 even for a single domain) are borne by the complainant, while the infringing party stands to lose nothing except the registration fee (usually under $10) for the original domain and the registrar of the infringing name incurs no penalty at all.

The global and unrestricted nature of TLDs and gTLDs effectively means that anyone in any country can register a domain name in them regardless of whether they have any intellectual property rights in that name. With [[ccTLD|country code TLD]]s the jurisdiction is more clearly defined. The affected intellectual property rights owner would have to take a legal action, typically a [[UDRP]] case to transfer or cancel the domain unless the registrant is in the same jurisdiction as the affected intellectual property rights owner. In this case, local law may be sufficient as the action may be considered as [[common law]] [[tort]] of [[passing off]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/disputes/caselaw/index/million/ |title=(UK Registry) The "One In A Million" Court Case which dealt with domain names and passing off |publisher=Nominet |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nominet.org.uk/disputes/caselaw/index/million/millionjudge/ |title="One In A Million" Judgement. 28 November 1997 |publisher=Nominet.org.uk |date=28 November 1997 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary market speculation==
The primary market for domain name speculation covers newly registered domain names that have not been registered before. Such domain names are often linked to news and current events. The launch of a new TLD encourages primary market speculation as domainers rush to register generic terms and also phrases that make a pun on the TLD name ([[domain hack]]). Other more organised domainers or domain name speculators register trademarks in advance of the launch of new TLDs specifically in order to register these short, memorable and potentially high value domains in the sunrise period of new gTLD launches. The Sunrise period is when intellectual property rights owners (trademark owners etc.) can register their trademark in the new gTLD in advance of the gTLD being opened for general registrations. In the last three years the main new TLDs launched were [[.eu]] ccTLD,&lt;ref&gt;[[.eu#Landrush|.eu Landrush period controversy.]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[.mobi]] TLD and [[.asia]] [[Sponsored top-level domain|sTLD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/dotasia_organisation_domain_auction/ |title=asia Landrush and auction. – Circleid.com 27 July 2007 |publisher=Circleid.com |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[.asia#Controversy|.asia Landrush period controversy]]&lt;/ref&gt; All of these had landrush periods of varying success.

== Secondary market speculation ==
{{refimprove|date=October 2010}}
{{see also|Domain aftermarket}}
The secondary market for domain names covers previously registered domain names that have not been renewed by registrants or are available for resale.&lt;ref name="nominet1"/&gt; Sometimes these ''dropped'' domain names can be more valuable due to their having had high-profile websites associated with them. They will have links from other websites and could still have users searching for the websites because of these links. Others can be valuable because of the generic nature of the domain name or the length of the domain name, with two and three character names being the most sought after.

The business of registering the domain names as they are deleted by the registries is known as ''[[drop catching]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drop-Catching|url=http://icannwiki.org/Drop-Catching|website=ICANNWiki|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a highly competitive business. The main operators in this business typically set up a number of front companies as registrars. [[VeriSign]], in the case of TLDs &lt;tt&gt;[[.com|COM]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.net|NET]]&lt;/tt&gt;, allows each registrar a slice of the resources that may be used to register dropped domains. VeriSign drops domains in a random order, giving registrars only a vague idea of the particular drop time of a particular domain. Sometimes a group of [[drop registrar]]s often work in confederation to increase their possibility of registering a dropped domain immediately after it is deleted by the registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Ron|title=Inside a Drop Catcher’s War Room: How eNom Arms Maker Chris Ambler Is Turning The Tide for Club Drop|url=http://www.dnjournal.com/columns/cover080504.htm|website=Domain Name Journal|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the domain is caught by a confederation of registrars attempting to fulfill a domain backorder, then whichever domain registrar caught the domain will register it to the entity who backordered the domain. If the newly reregistered domain is captured by a company that has no customers who backordered it, the domain may be auctioned to the highest bidder by the registrar who captured it or an auction intermediary. The time between a drop and a capture is often measured in seconds or fractions thereof.

Some registrars do not allow domains to drop in the normal fashion, instead introducing an intermediary (e.g., Snapnames and Namejet) that auction the domain prior to their deletion. If nobody buys the domain at auction, it will pass through the normal deletion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=Mason|title=The Domain Name Secondary Market|url=https://archive.icann.org/en/meetings/lisbon/presentation-secondary-snap-25mar07.pdf|website=ICANN|publisher=SnapNames|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domain name speculation and the rise of Pay per click websites==
Cybersquatting has a clear legal definition, but this definition tends to be lost when people open a webpage with only [[pay per click]] ('PPC') advertising. It is often assumed that such a domain is "cybersquatted", especially when the person is searching for the domain in order to register it.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

The ease with which [[Pay per click|PPC]] revenue could be derived from parked domains effectively created a situation where domains were being registered purely for their [[type-in traffic]]. Many of exact phrases that people were searching for in search engines were being registered for the sole purpose of serving PPC advertising. The &lt;tt&gt;[[.com|COM]]&lt;/tt&gt; TLD  grew from 23,662,001 registered domains 1 January 2003 to 80,759,835 registered domains as of 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forms.icann.org//idashboard/public/ |title=ICANN Registry Statistics (.aero to .mobi) |publisher=Forms.icann.org |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While part of that increase in the number of registered domain names is due to the increase in ecommerce and business conducted online, some of the increase is due to the ease of generating revenue from PPC and [[type-in traffic]]. [[Domain tasting]], a practice by which millions of domains would be registered for a limited period (the five-day Add Grace Period during which a domain could be deleted without the registrar effectively having to pay a registration fee to ICANN) and only those generating sufficient revenue from PPC advertising would be retained, also served to increase the number of domains registered. This practice involved [[domain name registrar]]s being created purely for the purpose of domain tasting. The situation became so bad in 2007 that [[ICANN]] was forced to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnso.icann.org/issues/domain-tasting/domain-tasting-board-report-gnso-council-25apr08.pdf |title=GNSO Council Report to the ICANN Board Recommendation for Domain Tasting. |format=PDF |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008 ICANN added a provision to its Fiscal Year 2009 budget to limit the number of domains that a registrar could delete using the Add Grace Period before having to pay the ICANN fee. The effect of this was to massively curtail the number of domains deleted in .com and .net during the Add Grace Period. From June 2008 to April 2009, AGP deletions fell by 99.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/tlds/agp-status-report-12aug09-en.pdf |title=The End Of Domain Tasting. ICANN Report on AGP Measures 12 August 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 2006 Verisign Domain Brief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verisign.com/domain-name-services/domain-information-center/domain-name-resources/domain-name-report-aug06.pdf |title=Verisign Domain Brief August 2006 Page 5 |publisher=Verisign.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that out of approximately 57.37 million &lt;tt&gt;[[.com|COM]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.net|NET]]&lt;/tt&gt; websites spidered, 26% were single page websites, 60% were multipage websites and 14% had no associated websites. Numerically, the number of single page websites was approximately 14.91 million. The single page websites include under-construction, [[Brochureware|brochure-ware]] and parked pages in addition to online advertising revenue generating ([[Pay per click|PPC]]) parked pages.

The latest statistics for domain name usage quoted in the Verisign Domain Brief for June 2009 states that of the 92 million &lt;tt&gt;[[.com|COM]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.net|NET]]&lt;/tt&gt; domain names, 24% of these domains have one page websites, 64% have multipage websites and 12% have no associated websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verisign.com/domain-name-services/domain-information-center/domain-name-resources/domain-name-report-june09.pdf |title=Verisign Domain Brief June 2009 Page 5 |publisher=Verisign.com |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In purely numerical terms, those single page websites would account for approximately 22 million &lt;tt&gt;[[.com|COM]]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[[.net|NET]]&lt;/tt&gt; websites. The survey quoted in the Verisign Domain Brief does not explain the methodology or provide anything other than a summary of the results. However this is effectively a rise in single page websites of just over 7 million websites.

Some hosters such as [[Godaddy]] have their own [[domain parking]] systems and allow unused domains to be parked with the registrant receiving a share of the PPC revenue earned. Other hosters have similar systems.

'''''Flight of the Red Balloon''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le voyage du ballon rouge'''}}) is a 2007 French-Taiwanese film directed by [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]].  It is the first part in a new series of films produced by [[Musée d'Orsay]], and tells the story of a French family as seen through the eyes of a Chinese student. The film was shot in August and September 2006 on location in Paris. This is [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]'s first non-Asian film. It references the classic 1956 French short ''[[The Red Balloon]]'' directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]].

The film opened the ''Un Certain Regard'' section of the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2007.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4436044/year/2007.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Le voyage du ballon rouge|accessdate=2011-08-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Suzanne, a [[puppeteer]], lives with her young son Simon in an apartment in [[Paris]]. While Suzanne is busy with producing her new Chinese puppet play based on an ancient Chinese text (求妻煮海人), she hires a Chinese film student Song as Simon's new nanny.  For her college project - a homage to [[Albert Lamorisse]]'s famous 1956 film ''[[The Red Balloon]]'' - Song starts to film Simon. She develops a good relationship with mother and son, and translates for Suzanne's masterclass with a Chinese puppet master. 

While Simon's older sister Louise is about to graduate from a high school in Brussels, Suzanne plans for Louise to apply for colleges in Paris. For that, she tries to evict her downstairs tenant Marc, who has repeatedly failed to pay his rent, while arguing on the phone with Pierre, Simon's father, who has absented himself to Canada for two years to write a novel and who is rarely in touch. Simon visits the Musée d'Orsay on a school trip, where his class is shown ''The Ball'', a painting by [[Félix Vallotton]] in which a child chases a red ball.

== Cast ==
* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Suzanne
* [[Simon Iteanu]] as Simon
* [[Hippolyte Girardot]] as Marc

==Critical reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 80% of 87 sampled critics and 90% of top critics gave the film positive reviews. The average rating is 6.9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon) (2007) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flight_of_the_red_balloon/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate = January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Hoberman, writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' was particularly appreciative of the film stating, "Flight of the Red Balloon is contemplative but never static, and punctuated by passages of [[Cinéma pur|pure cinema]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-04-01/film/floating-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Stables of [[Sight &amp; Sound]] also highly praised the film, "Finding a serene and contemplative beauty in the quotidian world has long been Taiwanese master-minimalist Hou Hsiao Hsien's stock in trade.... Hou brings the same depth and deliberation to the film's Parisian exterior....  ultimately, it is cinema that is the film's sacred repository of memory and creativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/4261|title=BFI {{!}} Sight &amp; Sound {{!}} Flight of the Red Balloon (2006)|last=Institute|first=The British Film|website=old.bfi.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader likes the film as &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;A relatively slight but sturdy work by Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, this slice of contemporary urban life more or less does for Paris what his Cafe Lumiere did for Tokyo, albeit with less minimalism and more overt emotion''.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

On the other hand, Duane Byrge of Hollywood Reporter was not impressed. "The imagery of the classic movie, where a spirited red balloon wafts unpredictably over Paris, never even attempts to reach a metaphorical height, nor does it even engage us compositionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flight_of_the_red_balloon/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon) - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Flora of Taiwan''''' ({{zh|c=臺灣植物誌|p=Táiwān Zhíwù Zhì}}) is the [[flora]] of the country also known as the ''Republic of China''.

[http://tai2.ntu.edu.tw/ebook.php?ebook=Fl.%20Taiwan%202nd '''''Flora of Taiwan'''''] is also a set of books recording the [[vascular plants]] of [[Taiwan]] (territories). The second edition consists of six volumes published in 1993–2003 and is available on-line.&lt;ref name=FoT&gt;{{cite book |title=Flora of Taiwan | edition=2nd | editor-last=Huang | editor-first=Tseng-chieng |year=2000 |publisher=Editorial Committee of the Flora of Taiwan, Second Edition |location=Taipei, Taiwan |isbn=957-9019-52-5 |url=http://tai2.ntu.edu.tw/ebook.php?ebook=Fl.%20Taiwan%202nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taiwan''' is an island of diverse geography and varied climates, allowing for a vast array of flora to be present. Situated between China and the Philippine sea basin, it is said to be the home of approximately 4000 species of [[Vascular plant|vascular plants]]. Of these plants, it is estimated that 600 are [[Fern|ferns]], 28 are [[Gymnosperm|gymnosperms]], 2400 are [[Dicotyledon|dicots]], and 1000 are [[Monocotyledon|monocots]].  The island can also be divided up into seven different floristic regions; Northeastern, Central, [[Hengchun]], [[Orchid Island|Lanyu]] (Orchid Island) and [[Green Island, Taiwan|Lutao]] (Green Island), Alpine, Upper montaine and supalpine, and Lower montane and lowland.

The '''Northeastern region''' of '''Taiwan''' receives much more rainfall and cloud coverage than other regions, making the species of this particular region distinct to this particular climate. Species of flora within this region include; [[Isoetes taiwanensis]], [[Fagus hayatae]], Maackia taiwaneses, Acer buergerianum var. formosanum, Sedum sekietense, Sedum uniflorum, [[Angelica dahurica]], Angelica hirsutiflora, [[Rhododendron nakaharae|Rhododendron nakaharai]], R. hyperthrum, Rhuchotechum formosanum, Salvia nippocanica var. formosana, Ericaulon chishingsanesis, Woodwardia harlandi, Cinnamomum austro-sinense, [[Mahonia japonica]], [[Bretschneidera|Breischneidera sinensis]], [[Tripterygium wilfordii|Triplerygium wilfordii]], Lingularia japonica, [[Enkianthus perulatus|Enkianthus perulaius]], Quercus (Cyclybalanopsis) myrsinaefolia, [[Acronychia pedunculata]], Enscaphis japonica, Lilum speciosum var. gloriosoides, Smilax nipponica, Keteleeria davidiana var. formosana.

The '''Central region''' of '''Taiwan''' is characterized by basins, and is a plains region mostly surrounded by mountain ranges, such as the [[Xueshan|Hsueshan]] Range in the North. The isolated region consists of forests of endemic flora species such as; Castanopsis eyrie, C. kawakami, [[Quercus dentata|Quercus dentate]], Q. serrata var. brevipetiolata, [[Lindera aggregata|Lindera aggregate]], [[Podocarpus nakaii]], Ormosiaformosana, Wuercus (Cyclobalanopsis) globose, [[Castanopsis fargesii]], Lithocarpus nantoensis. 

The '''[[Hengchun]] region''' of '''Taiwan''' is a subtropical evergreen forested area, with broad-leaved forests, as well as a few semi-tropical rain forests in the low-lands. Some of the flora species that can be found here include; Lithocarpus dodanaeifolia, L. shinsuiensis, Quercus (cuclobalanopsis) hypophaea, Q. (c.) repandaefolia, Cinnamomum brevipedunculatum, C. reticulatum, [[Litsea ligustrina|Litsea lii]], Machilus abovatifolia, [[Neolitsea daibuensis]], N.hiiransis, Ilex loonicerifolia v. matsudai, Aristolochia kaoi, Asarum epigynum, Acalpha matudai, [[Euonymus pallidifolia]], Dolichos trilobus var.kosyunensis, [[Gleditsia rolfei]], Indigofera byobiensis, Millia formosana, Myrica adenphora var. kusanoi, Piper kawakamii, Reevesia formosana, [[Symplocos shilanensis]], [[Camellia hengchunensis|Camellia hengchunesis]], Syzygium euphlebium, Syzygium kiskusense, Callicarpa remotiserrrulata.

The '''[[Orchid Island|Lanyu]] (Orchid Island) and [[Green Island, Taiwan|Lutao]] (Green Island) regions''' of '''Taiwan''' are the most similar to the Philippines, though the rest of Taiwan is more similar to mainland China. Forty-six of four-hundred and forty five seed-plant species within these two islets of '''Taiwan''' are shared with the Philippines, the only region still considered Taiwan that shares species with the neighboring country. Endemic species within this district consist of Cinnamomum kotoense, Murraya paniculata var. omphalocarpa, Chisocheton kanehirai, [[Acalypha hontauyuensis|Acalypha hontauyensis]], Exoecaria kawakamii, Cissus lanyuesis, Calopphyllum changii, [[Garcinia linii]], Medimilla hayataiana, Diospyros kotoensis, Alyxia insularis, Trachelospermum lanyuense, Lysionotus ikeadae, and Lasianthus obliquinervis var. simizui.

The '''Alpine district''' of '''Taiwan''' has distinctly different flora than the rest of the country. The '''alpine district''' pertains mostly of boreal and temperate vegetation such as [[Botrychium lunaria|Botrychium lunar]], Lycopodium selago appressum, [[Osmundastrum|Osmunda cinnamomea]], etc. 

The '''Upper montane/subalpine district,''' similar to the alpine district, is temperate to cool temperate. Conifers are the main vegetation of this region. [[Abies kawakamii]], [[Tsuga chinensis]], and [[Picea morrisonicola|Picea morrisoncola]], to name a few, are some of the species that exist within this floristic zone. 

The '''Lower montane/lowland district''' of Taiwan is more similar to the warm climate forests, supporting broad-leaved forests. Some of the species of the forests common to this floristic zone include; [[Castanopsis]], [[Oak|Quercus]], and [[Lithocarpus]]. 

== Agricultural Flora of Taiwan ==
'''Cultivated agriculture''' produced in '''Taiwan''' has drastically changed Taiwan's development. Agriculture has become as much a part of the naturally existing flora of Taiwan, and human influence on the land has greatly contributed to the vegetation of the country. Bamboo, Fruits, Grains and vegetable crops all thrive on the island, mostly thriving in the Central, Southern and Eastern regions.

'''Bamboo''' has largely taken a hold in the country as a cash-crop. Large areas of Taiwan have been converted into various bamboo plantations. Most of the bamboo is grown to support the developing economy, however the species also provides support to rural communities as its sturdiness provides strength and stands firm in the midst of the high-speed winds that can dominate the country during rainy-monsoon seasons. 

'''Fruit trees''' typically grow in the low-lands of the island. Western and Southwestern Taiwan is the primary fruit producing region. Fruit commonly grown in Taiwan are tropical and plentiful including [[Lychee|lychees]], pengkan tangerines, hseukan tangerines, [[Orange (fruit)|oranges,]] [[Banana|bananas]], [[Grape|grapes]], [[Areca nut|betel nuts]], kaochie pear, [[plum]], [[peach]], [[Carambola|starfruit]], [[persimmon]], [[guava]], [[papaya]], [[mango]], [[lemon]], [[Phoenix sylvestris|Indian dates]], [[Pineapple|pineapples]], [[Coconut|coconuts]], [[Apricot|apricots]], and [[loquat]].

'''Grain and Vegetable crops''' are mainly cultivated in Northern Taiwan. Rice and vegetables are grown in large paddies in the lowlands of the [[Da'an River|TTa'an river]], plains of [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]] and [[Hsinchu]] counties, the Hungli and Taoyen terraces, the [[Taipei Basin|Taipei basin]], and the Ilan plain. The vegetables grown in these areas consist of [[kale]], [[Mustard plant|mustard]], [[Chinese cabbage]], wengtsai, [[celery]], [[cucumber]], [[yucca]], [[winter melon]], [[pumpkin]], [[eggplant]], [[red bean]], [[Pea|peas]], [[Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Radish|radishes]], [[ginger]], [[taro]], [[onion]], [[leek]], and [[garlic]]. Vegetables are typically planted in rotation with rice, and their seasons do not coincide. 

The major agricultural exports from Taiwan include [[paddy rice]], [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]], cloud apples, and [[Areca nut|betel nuts]].

The '''German Federal Archives''' or '''Bundesarchiv''' ('''BArch''') ({{lang-de|Bundesarchiv}}) are the [[National Archives]] of [[Germany]]. They were established at the current location in [[Koblenz]] in 1952.

They are subordinated to the State Minister of Culture and the Media (as of 2014, [[Monika Grütters]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/DE/Bundesregierung/BeauftragtefuerKulturundMedien/beauftragte-fuer-kultur-und-medien.html Staatsministerin für Kultur und Medien, Monika Grütters]'' (German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media official website). English-language version (biographical profile): [http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/FederalGovernment/ChancelleryMinisters/MonikaGruetters/biographie-monika-gruetters.html?nn=393236]. Retrieved 2015-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt;), and before 1998, to the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=budget09&gt;[http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/bundeshaushalt2009/pdf/epl04/s0406.pdf Federal Budget 2009, Einzelplan 04 06]. [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|German Federal Ministry of Finance]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution's 2009 budget amounted to 54.6 million Euro.&lt;ref name=budget09/&gt;

On December 6, 2008 the Archives donated 100,000 photos to the public, by making them accessible via [[Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wikipedia Receives German Pictorial History |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3851534,00.html |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |publisher= |date=December 6, 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The federal archive for institutions and authorities in Germany, the first precursor to the present-day Federal Archives, was established in [[Potsdam]], [[Brandenburg]] in 1919, a later date than in other European countries. This national archive documented German government dating from the founding of the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867. It also included material from the older [[German Confederation]] and the [[Imperial Chamber Court]]. The oldest documents in this collection dated back to the year 1411. Photographs and film of a younger vintage were also contained in the original archive, much of which was contributed by non-governmental sources. Despite efforts to save the most valuable parts of the collection, almost half of the archive's total contents were destroyed during [[World War II]].

In 1946, the German Central Archive was founded in Potsdam, then in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] and later in [[East Germany]]. This archive, renamed the Central State Archive in 1973, was viewed as the successor to the original archive, in part because it was located in the same city. By the end of the 1950s, records that had originally been seized by the [[Government of the Soviet Union|government]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the aftermath of World War II had been returned to the archive.

In [[West Germany]], the [[Cabinet of Germany]] decided to create a new Federal Archive in [[Koblenz]] in 1950, a project that was realized in 1952. The [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], like the Soviet Union, also seized records from Germany following World War II in their respective [[Allied-occupied Germany|zones of occupation]]. In 1955, a ''Military Archives Division'' was established as part of the Federal Archives as a place into which these records were returned. In 1988, the Federal Archives Act elevated the tasks of the Federal Archive into law, and granted it rights to the documents produced by West Germany's courts, public authorities, and  constitutional institutions.

The [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]] in 1990 also led to the unification of West Germany's Federal Archive with East Germany's Central State Archive. In the course of this development, the formerly separate National Film Archive and Military Archives of East Germany were also merged into the Federal Archives.

With the unification of the two German archives in 1990, the traditions of the East Germany state authorities were absorbed into the Federal Archives. However, legal problems were encountered during this process in securing the archives and libraries of East Germany's [[Politics of East Germany|political parties]] and [[Communist party#Mass organizations|mass organizations]]. Even though East Germany's political structure meant that these institutions had very close ties to the government, they were not public institutions. Further problems arose as these records were separated from other East German documents, resulting in the Federal Archives presenting an incomplete picture of [[History of the German Democratic Republic|East Germany's history]]. In 1991, an initiative was implemented that placed the records in question into the possession of the Federal Archives. As a result of this initiative, a bill amending the Federal Archives Act of 1988 that established the department foundation provided for the Federal Archives came into force on 13 March 1992.

==Content==
The collection of the German Federal Archives today includes older documents from [[German Empire|Germany's imperial past]], [[Nazi Germany]],&lt;ref name=33-45archive&gt;[https://www.bundesarchiv.de/benutzung/zeitbezug/nationalsozialismus/index.html.en Bundesarchiv - German Reich: National Socialism (1933-1945)] (English version)&lt;/ref&gt; civilian and military records from [[East Germany]] (including East German political parties and mass organizations), and the documents inherited from [[West Germany]]'s Federal Archive. In addition to state records, the Archives also contain material from [[List of political parties in Germany|political parties]], associations, and societies of national prominence as well as historical collections. Besides the text documents, the Archives also keeps [[photograph]]s, [[film]]s, [[map]]s, [[poster]]s, and [[Data (computing)|electronic data]] in its collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">'''Ghayrah''' ({{lang-ar|غَيْرَة}}) (sometimes transliterated as '''Ghayra,''' '''Ghira,''' or '''Gheerah''') is an Arabic word which means a person’s dislike of another’s sharing in a right (which belongs to the former). It has a sense of earnest concern or zeal over something and can be considered a kind of protective jealousy.&lt;ref name=SeekersHub&gt;[http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2012/01/18/the-protective-jealousy-ghayra-of-spouses/ Seekers Hub: "The Protective Jealousy (Ghayra) of Spouses"] January 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, there are different kinds of ghayrah: that which relates to Allah and which relates to a Muslim. Allah's discontent is with sharing the obedience of His servant which rightfully belongs to Him. For a Muslim it is the uneasiness in his heart which moves him to guard his family from indecency.

==Background==
The term is based on the following Quran verses:

:"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women" (Quran - Surah An-Nisa: 34)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20150515243863 Saudi gazette: "Men are the protectors and maintainers of women"] May 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Oh you who believe, Protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones." (Quran - Surah At-Tahrim: 6):

Men who do not have Ghayrah are known as a ''dayyuth'' ({{lang-ar|دَيُّوث}}). Being a dayyuth is a major sin and a description of what is deemed an evil characteristic can be found in Az-Zahabi's book of Major Sins (Al-Kaba'ir). The prophet [[Mohammed]] and his companions were known to have very strong Ghayrah.&lt;ref name=WorldofIslam&gt;[http://islam.worldofislam.info/index.php/glossary/200-dictionary-ah World of islam Glossary: Gheera] retrieved January 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/49024 Islam QA Fatwa 49024: "He wants to look at women in the street with the intention of proposing marriage"] retrieved February 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is claimed that the concept of Ghayrah is the source of [[honor killings]] in the Islamic world,&lt;ref&gt; Daniel Akbari and Paul Tetreault [https://books.google.com/books?id=msb5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76&amp;lpg=PT76&amp;dq=ghayra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9BZa7y6Ko5&amp;sig=6gxf2z0jw3HcyWZFAp5q3gte_nQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9LjwVIm_LcPeoATF6IC4CQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ghayra&amp;f=false Honor Killing: A Professional's Guide to Sexual Relations and Ghayra Violence from the Islamic Sources] Jan 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnIslamYounus&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/family/your-society/gender-and-society/482893-are-muslim-men-jealous-or-selfish.html?Society= OnIslam: "Are Muslim Men Jealous or Selfish? - Selfish Jealousy Vs.

Per Salafi scholar Al-Munajjid, if a Muslim man suspects that certain family members will commit an immoral act, he is allowed to tie up or otherwise detain them in order to prevent the action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/8980 IslamQA: Fatwa 8980: "Who is the one who should carry out the hadd punishment for zina?"] retrieved February 12, 2015 | ''The family of the woman should prevent her from committing immoral actions and should prevent the things that lead to that, such as going out, speaking to non-mahram men, and everything that may enable her to commit evil. If the only way is to detain her and tie her up, then they have the right to do that, so they should detain her in the house. But as for killing her, they should not do that''&lt;/ref&gt;

Salafi scholar [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]] indicates that the concept also applies to protecting the [[Prophet Muhammad]] from [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]] although the determination of guilt and application of the penalty (execution) is to be solely applied by Islamic authorities.&lt;ref name=IslamQADefame&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/14305 Islam QA Fatwa 14305: It is essential to respond to those who defame the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] retrieved February 12, 2015 | ''If we leave the kuffaar and atheists to say whatever they want without denouncing it or punishing them, great mischief will result, which is something that these kuffaar love.... Whoever hears the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) being insulted and does not feel any honor or get angry is not a true believer – we seek refuge with Allah from humility, kufr and obeying the Shaytaan''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic Meaning==
Hans Wehr's Arabic dictionary defines ghayrah as: jealously; zeal, fervor, earnest concern, vigilant care, solicitude (على for); sense of honor, self-respect. It can be defined as a person’s dislike of another’s sharing in a right (which belongs to the former).

==Ghayrah in the Hadith==
*Narrated By Abu Huraira: The Prophet; said, “Indeed, Allah has Ghayrah, and the faithful believer has Ghayrah, and the Ghayrah which Allah has is provoked when a believer commits that which Allah has forbidden.” [al-Bukhari (4925) and Muslim (2761)]
*Asma' relates, "When az-Zubayr married me, he had neither land nor wealth nor slave", so Asma' had to work very hard kneading dough, going far off to get water. "And I used to carry on my head," she continues, "the date stones from the land of az-Zubair which Allah's Messenger had endowed him and it was a distance of two miles from Madinah. One day, as I was carrying the date-stones upon my head, I happened to meet Allah's Messenger, along with a group of his Companions. He called me and told the camel to sit down so that he could make me ride behind him. I felt shy to go with men and I remembered az-Zubair and his Ghayrah and he was a man having the most Ghayrah. The Messenger of Allah understood my shyness and left. I came to az-Zubair and said, "The Messenger of Allah met me as I was carrying date-stones upon my head and there was with him a group of his Companions. He told the camel to kneel so that I could mount it, but I felt shy and I remembered your Ghayrah." So Asma' declined the offer made by the Prophet. Upon this az-Zubair said, "By Allah, the thought of you carrying date-stones upon your head is more severe a burden on me than you riding with him." (related in [[Sahih Bukhari]])
*Narrated ‘Abdullah bin Masud: RasulAllah said: “There is none having a greater sense of Ghayrah than Allah. And for that He has forbidden the doing of evil actions (illegal sexual intercourse etc.).” (related in [[Sahih Bukhari]])&lt;ref name=OnIslamYounus /&gt;
*"The foundation of the Religion is Ghayrah, and the one without Ghayrah is one without Religion, for Ghayrah protects the heart and enlivens the limbs, and shields one from evil and lewdness, and lack of Ghayrah kills the heart so that the limbs die, so that there remains not even shielding from [the minor things]. And the example of Ghayrah in the heart is the example of the strength that shields one from sickness and fights it off, so if the strength leaves, he will be faced with the sickness, and will not find anything to protect himself from it, so it will establish itself [within him] and destroy him.” ([[Ibn Qayyim]], Ad-Daa’ Wad-Dawaa’)&lt;ref name=OnIslamYounus /&gt;
*Al-Mugheerah mentions that Saʿd ibn ʿUbaadah said: "If I find a man with my wife I will take this sword and smite his neck". And the Prophet said, "Are you amazed about Saʿd’s Ghayrah?" He said: "By Allaah, I have more of this than Saʿd, and Allaah has more of it than me". (related in [[Sahih Bukhari]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albaseerah.org/publication/nl/vol1iss5&amp;6.pdf Al BaSeerah: "My Family, My Home, My Jannah" by the Shaykh Abdullaah Al-Ghudyaan] Mar-Apr 2009 ~ Rabi` al-Awwal-Rabi` ath-Thaanee 1430&lt;/ref&gt;
*the Messenger of Allah said: "There is a kind of protective jealousy that Allah loves and a kind that Allah hates. As for that which Allah loves, it is protective jealousy when there are grounds for suspicion. And as for that which He hates, it is protective jealousy when there are no grounds for suspicion." (Sunan ibn Majah Book 9, Hadith 2074)

Many Dutch group portraits of guilds feature members holding one with a wine glass or [[rummer]], in it. They were also often featured in still-life paintings, possibly to commemorate the banquet or feast of the holder.

The '''Afghanistan Compact''' was the outcome of the London Conference on Afghanistan in 2006. It was the result of consultations of the government of [[Afghanistan]] with the [[United Nations]] and the [[international community]] and established the framework for international cooperation with Afghanistan for the following five years.  The Afghanistan Compact is a political commitment of the participants and not an actionable treaty.

== Introduction ==
On January 31 and February 1, 2006, 66 states and 15 international organizations participated in the London Conference on Afghanistan, which was chaired by British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Afghanistan's President [[Hamid Karzai]] and UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]]. The government of Afghanistan provided an overview of developments in the country and of its strategies, priorities and plans for economic and political development in the following five years. At the end of the conference, the delegates adopted the Afghanistan Compact, a political agreement between the international community and the government of Afghanistan. 

The agreement confirms the commitment of both the government of Afghanistan and the international community to cooperate in creating conditions allowing the people of Afghanistan to live in peace and security under the rule of law, with a strong government which protects human rights and supports economic and social development in the country.

The compact followed the formal conclusion of the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn process]], which had launched the reconstruction process in 2001 and reached its goal in the parliamentary and provincial elections in 2005. It serves as a basis for the next stage of reconstruction, which is to rely more strongly on the country's own institutions. The donor countries and institutions promised to support this process with a total of 10.5 billion [[US dollar]]s.

== Individual measures (selection) ==
=== Goal: Increased security ===
*A professional and ethnically balanced [[Afghan National Army]] with up to 70.000 soldiers is to be established and fully functional by 2010.
*The police being formed is to provide reliable security in the country and at the borders.
*Reduction of existing [[mine field]]s by 70%.
*Disarmament of all illegal [[militia]]s by 2007 at the latest.

=== Goal: Drug reduction ===
The government of Afghanistan increases its measures to curb drugs, with the goal of completely ending the cultivation of [[opium poppy]] in Afghanistan and cutting off the supply of raw opium from Afghanistan to hinder the production of and trade in [[heroin]]. 

=== Goal: Efficient executive ===
*Government personnel is to be reduced to provide an efficient public administration. 
*The National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan is to increase women's chances of working in government and public service.

=== Goal: Economic and social development ===
*The government's revenues are to be nearly doubled to approximately 8% of the [[gross domestic product]] by 2010. 
*66% of households in major urban areas and 25% in rural areas are to be provided with [[electricity]].
*50% of households in the capital [[Kabul]] and 30% of households in other major urban areas are to have access to piped water.
*At least 60% of girls and at least 75% of boys are to be enrolled in primary schools.
*At least 90% of the population are to have access to basic health services.
*The proportion of people living on less than 1 US dollar a day is to decrease by 3% each year. 
*The proportion of people who suffer from [[hunger]] is to be reduced by 5% each year.

=== Monitoring ===
A Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, co-chaired by a senior Afghan official and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan, ensures implementation and monitoring of the steps of this five-year plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''''Jack Flea's Birthday Celebration''''' is a television play written by [[Ian McEwan]] and directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], part of the ''[[Second City Firsts]]'' series recorded by the BBC at [[Pebble Mill]] and broadcast on 10 April 1976. McEwan wrote the play in 1974, just after completing his first book, ''[[First Love, Last Rites]]'', a collection of short stories and he regards it as belonging to that collection.&lt;ref name=ig&gt;Ian McEwan ''The Imitation Game: Three Plays for Television'', London: Picador, 1982 {{ISBN|0-330-26830-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
David lives with Ruth, a woman nearly twice his age. It is his birthday and he invites his parents to dinner to meet Ruth for the first time. After much wine has been drunk, David pretends to read a chapter from his autobiographical novel, in which the 'stifling, sinister attractions' of his mother drive the protagonist, Jack Flea into the arms of Hermione, an older woman who turns David into her fantasy child. When Mrs. Lee grabs the piece of paper from David it is blank. Ruth and David then act up the fantasy of being mother and child; Ruth and Mrs. Lee vying for possession of David. But is this just drunken fantasy?&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Groes (ed.) ''Ian McEwan: Contemporary Critical Perspectives'', London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
*[[Sara Kestelman]] as  Ruth
*[[Eileen McCallum]] as Mrs Lee
*[[Ivor Roberts (actor)|Ivor Roberts]] as Mr Lee
*David Wilkinson as David Lee  

==Reception==
[[Peter Buckman]] in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' wrote of the play "tension well beyond breaking point...a half hour I shall not easily forget".&lt;ref name=ig/&gt;

==Inspiration==
Writing in 1980, Ian McEwan reveals, 'My intention was to take a television cliché - a kind of family reunion, a dinner party - and to transform it by degrees and by logical extension to a point where fantasy had become reality. The self-reflecting fiction at the centre of the play is perhaps one of those conceits that many writers new to the form are tempted to exploit. As it turned out it was not, as I had feared, too literary or undramatic. It simply became a feature of David Lee's illusory sense of control'.&lt;ref name=ig/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2824">[[File:Ladislau_de_Souza_Mello_Netto.jpg|thumb|c. 1887]]
'''Ladislau de Souza Mello Netto''' (1838–1894) was a [[Brazil]]ian [[botanist]] and director of the [[Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro|Brazilian National Museum]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Ladislau Netto was appointed museum director in 1870, as a substitute, and 1876, as full director, by the Brazilian Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], who strove to make the museum a showcase of science and learning. Thus, Ladislau Netto became the most influential Brazilian scientist of his time, with a mandate for modernizing and expanding the museum and making contacts with foreign scientists.

He was a France-trained botanist, and in this capacity his contributions were substantial. 

He was also drawn to [[anthropology]], especially physical anthropology and the question of the origin of Brazilian Indians. Here his record is less commendable: his use of science to back racism and elitism was not unusual for the period, but his exclusive focus on the interests of the National Museum led him to questionable practices, such as not returning a collection borrowed from the [[Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi|Museu Paraense]] for an exhibition.&lt;ref name ="Sanjad 2010"&gt;Sanjad, Nelson. 2010. ''A Coruja de Minerva: o Museu Paraense entre o Império e a República (1866-1907)''. [[Instituto Brasileiro de Museus]], Brasília. {{ISBN|9788563078001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 Ladislau Netto was taken in by a supposed [[Phoenicia]]n inscription from Brazil's state of [[Paraíba]]. Netto initially accepted the inscription as genuine, but when his mentor [[Ernest Renan]] declared it to be a hoax, he backed down and blamed foreigners for its fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badarchaeology.com/?page_id=421 The Paraíba (Parahyba) Stone]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, he founded the museum's scientific journal, the ''[[Archivos do Museu Nacional]]'', which is still published. He hired several foreign scientists as traveling naturalists, including [[Fritz Müller]], [[Emílio Goeldi]], [[Domingos Soares Ferreira Penna]], [[Hermann von Ihering]], [[Wilhelm Schwacke]], [[Orville Adalbert Derby]], and others. 

In 1882, the National Museum, directed by him, promoted the [[Brazilian Anthropological Exhibition of 1882|Brazilian Anthropological Exhibition]], which had international influence.

With the advent of the [[Proclamation_of_the_Republic_(Brazil)|Republic]] in  1889 and the exile of Pedro II, Ladislau Netto lost his chief patron and some of his influence. He retired in 1893.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1978">'''Letters of horning''' ''(Scots law)'': a document (i.e., letters) issued by civil authorities that publicly denounce a person as a rebel. The document was issued against persons who had not paid their debts.

Historically, the documents would be announced by three blasts of a horn, and the documents themselves came to be known as "letters of horning". A person who was denounced in these documents was described as having been "put to the horn".
&lt;!--
==Additional explanations==
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--&gt;

==History==
Originally in Scotland, imprisonment for debt was enforceable only in certain cases, but a custom gradually grew up of taking the debtor's oath to pay. If the debtor broke his oath, he became liable to the discipline of the Church. The civil power could step in to aid the ecclesiastical, denouncing the debtor as a rebel, imprisoning his person and confiscating his goods. The method of declaring a person a rebel was by giving three blasts on a horn and publicly proclaiming the fact; hence the expression "put to the horn".

The subsequent process, a warrant directing a [[messenger-at-arms]] to charge the debtor to pay or perform in terms of the letters, was called letters of horning. This system of execution was simplified by the [[Debtors (Scotland) Act 1838|Personal Diligence Act of 1838]], and execution was thereafter usually by [[Diligence (Scots law)|diligence]] (see [[writ of execution]]).

The granting of letters of horning, letters of horning and [[poinding]], letters of [[poinding]], and letters of caption all ceased to be competent following the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987.&lt;ref&gt;s89 Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 http://opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1987/pdf/ukpga_19870018_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Register of Hornings is kept by [[Registers of Scotland]].

'''Machine-readable dictionary''' ('''''MRD''''') is a [[dictionary]] stored as machine (computer) data instead of being printed on paper. It is an [[electronic dictionary]] and lexical database.

A machine-readable dictionary is a dictionary in an electronic form that can be loaded in a database and can be queried via application software. It may be a single language explanatory dictionary or a multi-language dictionary to support translations between two or more languages or a combination of both. Translation software between multiple languages usually apply bidirectional dictionaries. An MRD may be a dictionary with a proprietary structure that is queried by dedicated software (for example online via internet) or it can be a dictionary that has an open structure and is available for loading in computer databases and thus can be used via various software applications. Conventional dictionaries contain a [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] with various descriptions. A machine-readable dictionary may have additional capabilities and is therefore sometimes called a smart dictionary. An example of a smart dictionary is the Open Source [[Gellish English dictionary]]. 
&lt;br /&gt;The term dictionary is also used to refer to an electronic [[vocabulary]] or [[lexicon]] as used for example in [[spelling checker]]s. If dictionaries are arranged in a subtype-supertype hierarchy of concepts (or terms) then it is called a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]. If it also contains other relations between the concepts, then it is called an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]]. Search engines may use either a vocabulary, a taxonomy or an ontology to optimise the search results. Specialised electronic dictionaries are [[morphological dictionary|morphological dictionaries]] or syntactic dictionaries.&lt;br /&gt;
The term MRD is often contrasted with [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] dictionary, in the sense that an MRD is the electronic form of a dictionary which was printed before on paper. Although being both used by programs, in contrast, the term NLP dictionary is preferred when the dictionary was built from scratch with NLP in mind. An ISO standard for MRD and NLP is able to represent both structures and is called [[Lexical Markup Framework]].&lt;ref&gt;Gil Francopoulo (edited by) LMF Lexical Markup Framework, ISTE / Wiley 2013 ({{ISBN|978-1-84821-430-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first widely distributed MRDs were the Merriam-Webster Seventh Collegiate (W7) and the Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dictionary (MPD). Both were produced by a government-funded project at [[System Development Corporation]] under the direction of John Olney. They were manually keyboarded as no typesetting tapes of either book were available. Originally each was distributed on multiple reels of magnetic tape as card images with each separate word of each definition on a separate punch card with numerous special codes indicating the details of its usage in the printed dictionary. Olney outlined a grand plan for the analysis of the definitions in the dictionary, but his project expired before the analysis could be carried out. Robert Amsler at the University of Texas at Austin resumed the analysis and completed a taxonomic description of the Pocket Dictionary under [[National Science Foundation]] funding, however his project expired before the taxonomic data could be distributed. Roy Byrd et al. at IBM Yorktown Heights resumed analysis of the Webster's Seventh Collegiate following Amsler's work. Finally, in the 1980s starting with initial support from Bellcore and later funded by various U.S. federal agencies, including NSF, [[Advanced Research and Development Activity|ARDA]], [[DARPA]], [[Disruptive Technology Office|DTO]], and [[REFLEX]], [[George Armitage Miller]] and [[Christiane Fellbaum]] at Princeton University completed the creation and wide distribution of a dictionary and its taxonomy in the [[WordNet]] project, which today stands as the most widely distributed computational lexicology resource.

'''''Monty Python’s Flying Circus''''' (known during the final series as just '''''Monty Python''''') is a British [[sketch comedy]] series created by the comedy group [[Monty Python]] and broadcast by the [[BBC]] from 1969 to 1974. The shows were composed of [[Surreal humour|surreality]], risqué or innuendo-laden humour, [[Visual gag|sight gags]] and observational sketches without [[punch line|punchlines]]. It also featured animations by group member [[Terry Gilliam]], often sequenced or merged with live action. The first episode was recorded on 7 September and premiered on 5 October 1969 on BBC One, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.

The show often targets the idiosyncrasies of [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British life]], especially that of professionals, and is at times politically charged. The members of Monty Python were highly educated. [[Terry Jones]] and [[Michael Palin]] are [[Oxford University]] graduates; [[Eric Idle]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]] attended [[Cambridge University]]; and American-born member [[Terry Gilliam]] graduated from [[Occidental College]]. Their comedy is often pointedly [[intellectualism|intellectual]], with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures. The series followed and elaborated upon the style used by [[Spike Milligan]] in his ground breaking series ''[[Q (TV series)|Q5]]'', rather than the traditional sketch show format. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded (although, by their perspective, failed) so completely that the adjective "[[wiktionary:Pythonesque|Pythonesque]]" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.

The Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves, including the majority of the female characters, but occasionally they cast an extra actor. Regular supporting cast members include [[Carol Cleveland]] (referred to by the team as the unofficial "Seventh Python"), [[Connie Booth]] (Cleese's first wife), series producer [[Ian MacNaughton]], [[Ian Davidson (scriptwriter)|Ian Davidson]], [[Neil Innes]] (in the fourth series), and [[Fred Tomlinson (singer)|Fred Tomlinson]] and the Fred Tomlinson Singers (for musical numbers).&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Fred Tomlinson, singer on Monty Python – obituary  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/08/02/fred-tomlinson-singer-on-monty-python--obituary/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2016-08-02 |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel E.|last=Slotnik |title=Fred Tomlinson, Singer Who Led a ‘Monty Python’ Troupe, Dies at 88  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/arts/television/fred-tomlinson-monty-python-singer-dies-at-88.html?_r=0 |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2016-08-04 |accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
The title ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' was partly the result of the group's reputation at the BBC. [[Michael Mills (British producer)|Michael Mills]], the BBC's Head of Comedy, wanted their name to include the word "circus" because the BBC referred to the six members wandering around the building as a circus, in particular, "Baron Von Took's Circus", after [[Barry Took]], who had brought them to the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''flying circus'' first being applied to Baron von Richthofen's [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War 1)|Jagdgeschwader 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; The group added "flying" to make it sound less like an actual circus and more like something [[Manfred von Richthofen#Flying Circus|from World War I]]. The group was coming up with their name at a time when the 1966 [[Royal Guardsmen]] song ''[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]'' had been at a peak. [[Manfred von Richthofen|''Freiherr'' Manfred von Richthofen]], the World War I German flying ace known as The Red Baron, commanded the [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)| Jagdgeschwader 1 squadron of planes]] known as "The Flying Circus." 

The words "Monty Python" were added because they claimed it sounded like a really bad theatrical agent, the sort of person who would have brought them together, with [[John Cleese]] suggesting "[[Pythonidae|Python]]" as something slimy and slithery, and [[Eric Idle]] suggesting "Monty".&lt;ref name="Palin 2008 650"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palin|first=Michael|title=Diaries 1969–1979 : the Python Years / Michael Palin|publisher=Griffin|year=2008|page=650|isbn=0-312-38488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later explained that the name Monty "...made us laugh because Monty to us means [[Lord Montgomery]], our great general of the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpL12ilpDnQ&amp;t=6m20s |title=Live At Aspen|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC had rejected some other names put forward by the group including ''Whither Canada?'', ''The Nose Show'', ''Ow! It's Colin Plint!'', ''A Horse, a Spoon and a Basin'', ''The Toad Elevating Moment'' and ''Owl Stretching Time''.&lt;ref name="Palin 2008 650"/&gt; Several of these titles were later used for individual episodes.

== Recurring characters ==
Compared to many other [[sketch comedy]] shows, ''Flying Circus'' had fewer recurring characters, many of whom were involved only in titles and linking sequences. Continuity for many of these recurring characters was frequently non-existent from sketch to sketch, with sometimes even the most basic information (such as a character's name) being changed from one appearance to the next.

=== Frequently recurring characters (six or more appearances)===
* '''The "It's" Man''' (Palin), a [[Robinson Crusoe]]-type castaway with torn clothes and a long, unkempt beard who would appear at the beginning of the programme. Often he is seen performing a long or dangerous task, such as falling off a tall, jagged cliff or running through a mine field a long distance towards the camera before introducing the show by just saying, "It's..." before being abruptly cut off by the opening titles and Terry Gilliam's animation sprouting the words 'Monty Python’s Flying Circus'. ''It's'' was an early candidate for the title of the series.
* '''A BBC [[continuity announcer]] in a [[dinner jacket]]''' (Cleese), seated at a desk, often in highly incongruous locations, such as a forest or a beach. His line, "[[And Now for Something Completely Different|And now for something completely different]]", was used variously as a lead-in to the opening titles and a simple way to link sketches. Though Cleese is best known for it, Idle first introduced the phrase in Episode 2, where he introduced a man with three buttocks. It eventually became the show’s [[catchphrase]] and served as the title for the troupe’s first movie. In Series 3 the line was shortened to simply: "And now..." and was often combined with the "It's" man in introducing the episodes.
[[File:Gumbys-present-architects-sketch.jpg|thumb|Gumbys on parade]]
* '''The [[Gumbys]]''', a group of slow-witted individuals identically attired in [[gumboots]] (from which they take their name), high-water trousers, [[Braces (clothing)|braces]], [[Fair Isle (technique)|Fair Isle]] [[tanktop]]s, and round, wire-rimmed glasses, with [[toothbrush mustache|toothbrush moustache]]s and knotted handkerchiefs worn on their heads (a stereotype of the English [[working class culture|working-class]] holidaymaker). They hold their arms stiffly at their sides, speak slowly in loud, throaty voices punctuated by frequent grunts and groans, and have a fondness for pointless violence. All of them are surnamed Gumby: D.P. Gumby, R.S. Gumby, etc. Even though all Pythons played Gumbys in the show's run, the character is most closely associated with Michael Palin.
* '''The Knight with a Raw Chicken''' (Gilliam), who would hit characters over the head with the chicken when they said something particularly silly. The knight was a regular during the first series and made another appearance in the third.
* '''A nude [[organist]]''' (played in his first appearance by Gilliam, later by Jones) who provided a brief fanfare to punctuate certain sketches, most notably on a sketch poking fun at ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' or as yet another way to introduce the opening titles. This character was addressed as "[[Onan]]" by Palin's host character in the ersatz game show sketch "Blackmail".
* '''The "Pepper Pots"''' are screeching middle-aged, [[lower-middle class]] housewives, played by the Pythons in frocks, and engage in surreal and inconsequential conversation. "The Pepper Pots" was the in-house name that the Pythons used to identify these characters, and were never identified as such on-screen. On the rare occasion these women were named, it was often for comic effect, featuring such names as Mrs. Scum, Mrs. Non-Gorilla, or the duo Mrs. Premise and Mrs. Conclusion. "Pepper pot" refers to what the Pythons believed was the typical body shape of middle-class, British housewives, as explained by John Cleese in ''[[How to Irritate People]]''.{{sfn|Larsen|2008|p=13}}  [[Terry Jones]] is perhaps most closely associated with the Pepper Pots, but all the Pythons were frequent in performing the drag characters.
* Brief black-and-white [[stock footage]], lasting only two or three seconds, of '''middle-aged women sitting in an audience and applauding'''. The film was taken from a [[Women's Institutes (British)|Women’s Institute]] meeting and was sometimes presented with a colour tint.{{sfn|Larsen|2008|p=292}} This was used as a reference to the types of audiences they had to face during the first series.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

===Characters who made multiple appearances===
* "[[The Colonel (Monty Python)|The Colonel]]" (Chapman), a British Army officer who interrupts sketches that are "too silly" or that contain material he finds offensive. The Colonel also appears when non-BBC broadcast repeats need to be cut off for time constraints in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]].
* Arthur Pewtey (Palin), a socially inept, extremely dull man who appears most notably in the "[[Marriage Guidance Counsellor]]" and "[[Ministry of Silly Walks]]" sketches. His sketches all take the form of an office appointment with an authority figure (usually played by Cleese), which are used to parody the officious side of the British establishment by having the professional employed in the most bizarre field of expertise. The spelling of Pewtey's surname is changed, between appearances.
* The Reverend Arthur Belling is the [[vicar]] of St Loony-Up-The-Cream-Bun-and-Jam. He is known for his bizarrely odd behaviour. In one sketch (within Series 2, played by Chapman), he makes an appeal to the insane people of the world to drive sane people insane. In another sketch (within Series 3, played by Palin), which is among the pantheon of fan favourites, he politely joins a honeymooning couple at an outdoor café, repeatedly insisting he does not wish to disturb them; he then sits down, opens a suitcase full of props, and calmly proceeds to smash plates on the table, shake a baby doll in their faces, bounce a rubber crab from a ping-pong paddle, and spray shaving cream all over his face, all whilst loudly chanting nonsense syllables. Rev. Belling's odd version of 'not being disturbing' serves to convert the couple to his bizarre sect of Christianity.
* A somewhat disreputable shopkeeper, played by Palin, is a staple of many a two-person sketch (notably "Dead Parrot Sketch"). He often speaks with a strong Cockney accent, and has no consistent name.
* Mr. Badger (Idle), a Scotsman whose speciality was interrupting sketches ('I won't ruin your sketch, for a pound'). He was once interviewed, in a sketch opposite Cleese, regarding his interpretation of the [[Magna Carta]], which Badger believes was actually a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in [[Dorset]]. He has also been seen as an [[Aircraft hijacking|aeroplane hijacker]] whose demands grow increasingly strange.
* [[Mr. Praline|Mr. Eric Praline]], a disgruntled man, played by Cleese and who often wears a [[Cagoule (raincoat)#The roll-up-able cagoule|Pac-a-Mac]]. His most famous appearance is in the "[[Dead Parrot sketch]]". His name is only mentioned once on-screen, during the "[[Fish Licence]]" sketch, but his attire (together with Cleese's distinctive, nasal performance) distinguishes him as a recognisable character who makes multiple appearances throughout the first two series. An audio re-recording of "Fish Licence" also reveals that he has multiple pets of wildly differing species, all of them named "[[Eric the Half-a-Bee|Eric]]".
* Mr. Cheeky, a well-dressed moustachioed man, referred to in the published scripts as "Mr. Nudge" (Idle), who pointedly annoys uptight characters (usually Jones). He is characterised by his constant nudging gestures and cheeky innuendo. His most famous appearance is in his initial sketch, "[[Nudge Nudge]]", though he appears in several later sketches too, including "The Visitors", where he claimed his name was Arthur Name.
* [[Biggles]] (Chapman, and [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|in one instance]] Jones), a World War I pilot. Derived from the famous series of fiction stories by [[W. E. Johns]].
* &lt;span id="Luigi_Vercotti"&gt;Luigi Vercotti&lt;/span&gt; (Palin), a [[Mafioso (criminal)|mafioso entrepreneur]] and [[pimp]] featured during the first series, accompanied in his first appearance by his brother Dino (Jones). He appears as the manager for [[Ron Obvious (Monty Python)|Ron Obvious]], the owner of La Gondola restaurant and as a victim of the [[Piranha Brothers]]. With his brother, he attempts to talk the Colonel into paying for [[Pizzo (extortion)|protection of his Army base]].
* [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]] would burst into a previously unrelated sketch whenever their name was mentioned. Their catchphrase was 'Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!' They consist of Cardinal Ximinez (Palin), Cardinal Fang (Gilliam), and Cardinal Biggles (Jones). They premiered in series two and Ximinez had a cameo in "The Buzz Aldrin Show".
* Frenchmen: Cleese and Palin would sometimes dress in stereotypical French garb, e.g. striped shirt, tight pants, [[beret]], and speak in garbled French, with incomprehensible accents. They had one fake moustache between them, and each would stick it onto the other's lip when it was his turn to speak. They appear giving a demonstration of the technical aspects of the flying sheep in episode 2 ("Sex and Violence"), and appear in the [[Ministry of Silly Walks]] sketch as the developers of "La Marche Futile". They also make an appearance in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.
* The Compère (Palin), a sleazy nightclub emcee in a red jacket. He linked sketches by introducing them as nightclub acts, and was occasionally seen after the sketch, passing comment on it. In one link, he was the victim of the Knight with a Raw Chicken.
* [[Piranha Brothers|Spiny Norman]], a Gilliam animation of a giant hedgehog. He is introduced in Episode 1 of Series 2 in "Piranha Brothers" as an hallucination experienced by Dinsdale Piranha when he is depressed. Later, Spiny Norman appears randomly in the background of animated cityscapes, shouting 'Dinsdale!'
* [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (Palin) is impersonated by someone or is impersonating someone else. He is first seen as a witness in court, but he turns out to be Ron Higgins, a professional Cardinal Richelieu impersonator. He is later seen during the "Historical Impersonations" sketch as himself impersonating [[Petula Clark]].
* Ken Shabby (Palin), an unkempt, disgusting man who cleaned public lavatories, appeared in his own sketch in the first series, attempting to get approval from another man (Chapman) to marry his daughter (Booth). In the second series, he appeared in several ''vox populi'' segments. He later founded his own religion (as part of the "Crackpot Religions" sketch) and called himself Archbishop Shabby.
* Raymond Luxury-Yacht (Chapman) is described as one of Britain's leading skin specialists. He wears an enormous fake nose made of [[polystyrene]]. He proudly proclaims that his name 'is spelled "Raymond Luxury-Yach-t", but it is pronounced "Throat-Wobbler Mangrove"'.
* A Madman (Chapman) Often appears in vox pops segments. He wears a [[bowler hat]] and has a bushy [[moustache]]. He will always rant and ramble about his life whenever he appears and will occasionally foam at the mouth and fall over backwards. He appears in "The Naked Ant", "The Buzz Aldrin Show" and "It's a Living".

Other returning characters include a married couple, often mentioned but never seen, [[Ann Haydon-Jones]] and her husband Pip. In "[[Election Night Special]]", Pip has lost a political seat to [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]. Several recurring characters are played by different Pythons. Both Palin and Chapman played the insanely violent Police Constable [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]. Both Jones and Palin portrayed police sergeant Harry 'Snapper' Organs of Q division. Various historical figures were played by a different cast member in each appearance, such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (Cleese, then Palin), or [[Queen Victoria]] (Jones, then Palin, then all five Pythons in Series 4).

Some of the Pythons' real-life targets recurred more frequently than others. [[Reginald Maudling]], a contemporary [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician, was singled out for perhaps the most consistent ridicule.{{sfn|Larsen|2008|p=288}} Then-[[Secretary of State for Education and Science]], and (well after the programme had ended) Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], was occasionally mentioned, in particular referring to Thatcher's brain as being in her shin received a hearty laugh from the studio audience. Then-US President [[Richard Nixon]] was also frequently mocked, as was Conservative party leader [[Edward Heath]], prime minister for much of the series' run. The [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police]] were also a favourite target, often acting bizarrely, stupidly, or abusing their authority, frequently in drag.

== Popular character traits ==
Although there were few recurring characters, and the six cast members played many diverse roles, each perfected some character traits.

=== Chapman ===
[[Graham Chapman]] often portrayed straight-faced men, of any age or class, frequently authority figures such as military officers, policemen or doctors. His characters could, at any moment, engage in "Pythonesque" [[mania]]cal behaviour and then return to their former sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;Sketches "An Appeal from the Vicar of St. Loony-up-the-Cream-Bun-and-Jam", "[[Colin "Bomber" Harris vs Colin "Bomber" Harris|The One-Man Wrestling Match]]", "Johann Gambolputty..." and "[[Argument Clinic]]"&lt;/ref&gt; He was also skilled in abuse, which he brusquely delivered in such sketches as "The Argument Clinic" and "Flying Lessons". He adopted a dignified demeanour as the leading "[[straight man]]" in the Python feature films ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' ([[King Arthur]]) and ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (title character Brian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= If You Like Monty Python...: Here Are Over 200 Movies, TV Shows and Other Oddities That You Will Love |author= Zack Handlen |publisher= Limelight Editions |year= 2011 |isbn= 9780879104320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cleese ===
[[John Cleese]] played ridiculous authority figures. Gilliam claims that Cleese is the funniest of the Pythons in drag, as he barely needs to be dressed up to look hilarious, with his square chin and 6' 5" (196 cm) frame (see the "Mr. and Mrs. Git" sketch).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Cleese also played intimidating maniacs, such as an instructor in the "[[Self Defence Against Fresh Fruit]]" sketch. His character [[Mr. Praline]], the put-upon consumer, featured in some of the most popular sketches, most famously in "[[Dead Parrot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume One | first1 = Graham | last1 = Chapman | first2 = John | last2 = Cleese | first3 = Terry | last3 = Gilliam | first4 = Eric | last4 = Idle | first5 = Terry | last5 = Jones | first6 = Michael | last6 = Palin | editor-first = Roger | editor-last = Wilmut | year = 1989 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-679-72647-0 | page = 320 (Appendix)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One star turn that proved most memorable among Python fans was "[[The Ministry of Silly Walks]]", where he worked for the eponymous government department. The sketch features some rather extravagant physical comedy from the notoriously tall and loose-limbed Cleese. Despite its popularity, particularly among American fans, Cleese himself particularly disliked the sketch, feeling that many of the laughs it generated were cheap and that no balance was provided by what could have been the true satirical centrepoint.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Another of his trademarks is his over-the-top delivery of abuse, particularly his screaming "You bastard!"

Cleese often played foreigners with ridiculous accents, especially Frenchmen, most of the time with Palin. Sometimes this extended to the use of actual French or German (such as "The Funniest Joke in the World", "Hitler in [[Minehead]]", or "La Marche Futile" at the end of "The Ministry of Silly Walks"), but still with a very heavy accent (or impossible to understand, as for example [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] speech).

=== Gilliam ===
[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|right|thumb|The famous Python Foot can here be seen in its original format in the bottom left corner of ''"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time"'']]
[[File:Foot detail from Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time by Agnolo Bronzino.jpg|right|thumb|Close up of the foot]]
Many Python sketches were linked together by the [[Cutout animation|cut-out animations]] of [[Terry Gilliam]], including the opening titles featuring the iconic giant foot that became a symbol of all that was 'Pythonesque'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Designer's Dictionary of Color |author= Sean Adams |publisher= Abrams |year= 2017 |isbn= 9781683350026 |page= 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilliam’s unique visual style was characterised by sudden, dramatic movements and deliberate mismatches of scale, set in [[surrealism|surrealist]] landscapes populated by [[engraving]]s of large buildings with elaborate architecture, grotesque [[Victorian era#Technology and engineering|Victorian]] gadgets, machinery, and people cut from old [[Sears Roebuck]] catalogues. Gilliam added [[airbrush]] illustrations and many famous pieces of art. All of these elements were combined in incongruous ways to obtain new and humorous meanings in the tradition of surrealist ''[[Collage|collage assemblies]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The surreal nature of the series allowed Gilliam’s animation to go off on bizarre, imaginative tangents. Some running gags derived from these animations were a giant [[hedgehog]] named Spiny Norman who appeared over the tops of buildings shouting, "Dinsdale!", further petrifying the paranoid [[Piranha Brothers|Dinsdale Piranha]]; and [[The Foot of Cupid]], the giant foot that suddenly squashed things. The latter is appropriated from the figure of [[Cupid]] in the [[Agnolo Bronzino]] painting ''"[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]"''.

Notable Gilliam sequences for the show include Conrad Poohs and his Dancing Teeth, the rampage of the cancerous black spot, The Killer Cars and a giant cat that stomps its way through London, destroying everything in its path.

Initially only hired to be the animator of the series, Gilliam was not thought of (even by himself) as an on-screen performer at first, being American and not very good at the deep and sometimes exaggerated English accent of his fellows. The others felt they owed him something and so he sometimes appeared before the camera, usually in the parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of make-up or involved uncomfortable costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Terry Gilliam: Interviews |author= Terry Gilliam |editor= David Sterritt, Lucille Rhodes |edition= illustrated |publisher= Univ. Press of Mississippi |year= 2004 |isbn= 9781578066247 |page= 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recurrent of these was The-Knight-Who-Hits-People-With-A-Chicken, a knight in armour who would walk on-set and hit another character on the head with a plucked chicken when they said something really corny. Some of Gilliam's other on-screen portrayals included:
* A man with a [[stoat]] through his head
* Cardinal Fang in "[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]"
* A dandy wearing only a mask, bikini underwear and a cape, in "The Visitors"
* A hotel clerk in "The Cycling Tour" episode
* A trouser-less man with a multi coloured wig and a Goat on a lead asking for "Mrs. Rogers" at the start of the New Gas Cooker sketch.
* A fat young man covered in beans in "Most Awful Family In Britain"
* A wheelchair using security guard, sporting an enormous sword through his head.
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in the "Michael Ellis" episode

Gilliam soon became distinguished as the go-to member for the most obscenely grotesque characters. This carried over into the ''Holy Grail'' film, where Gilliam played King Arthur's hunchbacked page 'Patsy' and the bridgekeeper at the Bridge of Death. It has also been claimed that he was originally asked by Terry Jones to play Mr. Creosote in ''The Meaning of Life'', but turned it down.

===Idle===
[[Eric Idle]] is known for his roles as a cheeky, suggestive playboy ("[[Nudge Nudge]]"), a variety of pretentious television presenters (such as his over-the-top portrayal of [[Philip Jenkinson]] in the segments connecting the "[[Cheese Shop sketch|Cheese Shop]]" and "[[Sam Peckinpah's "Salad Days"|Salad Days]]" sketches), a crafty, slick salesman ("Door-to-Door Joke Salesman", "Encyclopedia Salesman") and the merchant who loves to haggle in ''[[Monty Python’s Life of Brian]]''. He is acknowledged as 'the master of the one-liner' by the other Pythons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pythons: Autobiography |authors= Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones |editor= Bob McCabe |edition= illustrated |publisher= Macmillan |year= 2005 |isbn= 9780312311452 |page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also considered the best singer/songwriter in the group; for example, he wrote and performed "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]" from ''The Life of Brian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Palin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Palin |date=2006 |title=Diaries 1969–1979: The Python Years|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |page=473 |accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jones, he often played female characters in a more straightforward way, only altering his voice slightly, as opposed to the falsetto shrieking used by the others. Several times, Idle appeared as upper-class, [[middle-aged]] women, such as Rita Fairbanks ("Reenactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor") and the sexually-repressed Protestant wife in the "[[Every Sperm is Sacred]]" sketch, ''The Meaning of Life''.

Because he was not from an already-established writing partnership prior to Python, Idle wrote his sketches alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism |author= Bill Cooke |publisher= Prometheus Books |year= 2006 |isbn= 9781615923656 |page= 349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jones ===
Although all of the Pythons played women, [[Terry Jones]] is renowned by the rest to be 'the best Rat-Bag woman in the business'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} His portrayal of a middle-aged housewife was louder, shriller, and more dishevelled than that of any of the other Pythons. Examples of this are the "[[Dead Bishop]]" sketch, his role as Brian's mother Mandy in ''[[Life of Brian]]'', Mrs. Linda S-C-U-M in "Mr. Neutron" and the café proprietor in "[[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]]". Also recurring was the upper-class reserved men, in "[[Nudge, Nudge]]" and the "It's a Man's Life" sketch, and incompetent authority figures ([[Harry "Snapper" Organs]]). He also played the iconic Nude Organist that introduced all of series three. Generally, he deferred to the others as a performer, but proved himself behind the scenes, where he would eventually end up pulling most of the strings.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

=== Palin ===
[[Michael Palin]] was regarded by the other members of the troupe as the one with the widest range, equally adept as a [[wiktionary:Straight man|straight man]] or wildly over the top character.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} He portrayed many working-class northerners, often portrayed in a disgusting light: "[[The Funniest Joke in the World]]" sketch and the "[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]" segment of ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]''. In contrast, Palin also played weak-willed, put-upon men such as the husband in the "[[Marriage Guidance Counsellor]]" sketch, or the boring accountant in the "[[Vocational Guidance Counsellor]]" sketch. He was equally at home as the indefatigable Cardinal Ximinez of Spain in "[[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|The Spanish Inquisition]]" sketch. Another high-energy character that Palin portrays is the slick TV show host, constantly smacking his lips together and generally being over-enthusiastic ("[[And Now for Something Completely Different#Sketches|Blackmail]]" sketch). In one sketch, he plays the role with an underlying hint of self-revulsion, where he wipes his oily palms on his jacket, makes a disgusted face, then continues. One of his most famous creations{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} was the shopkeeper who attempts to sell useless goods by very weak attempts at being sly and crafty, which are invariably spotted by the customer (often played by Cleese), as in the "[[Dead Parrot]]" and "[[Cheese Shop sketch|Cheese Shop]]" sketches. Palin is also well known for his leading role in "[[The Lumberjack Song]]".

Palin also often plays heavy-accented foreigners, mostly French ("La marche futile") or German ("Hitler in Minehead"), usually alongside Cleese. In one of the last episodes, he delivers a full speech, first in English, then in French, then in heavily accented German.

Of all the Pythons, Palin played the fewest female roles.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Among his portrayals of women are: [[Queen Victoria]] in the "Michael Ellis" episode, Debbie Katzenberg the American in ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', or as a rural idiot's wife in the "Idiot in rural society" sketch.

== Lost sketches ==
Some material originally recorded went missing later, such as the use of the word "[[masturbation]]" in the "Summarize Proust" sketch (which was muted during the first airing, and later cut out entirely) or "What a silly bunt" in the Travel Agent sketch (which featured a character [Idle] who has a speech impediment that makes him pronounce "C"s as "B"s),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which was cut before the sketch ever went to air. However, when this sketch was included in the album ''[[Monty Python's Previous Record]]'' and the ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl|Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'' film, the line remained intact. Both sketches were included in the Danish [[DR K]] re-airing of all episodes ("Episode 31", aired 1 November 2018, 6:50 pm).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dr.dk/tv/se/monty-python-s-flying-circus-eps-1-45/monty-python-s-flying-circus-3/monty-python-s-flying-circus-27&lt;/ref&gt; After a less successful participation in the "Summarize Proust Competition", Mr Harry Bagot from Luton (Graham Chapman) is asked by the television host (Terry Jones) what other hobbies outside summarizing he might have. Harry replies, "Well, strangling animals, golf and masturbating."

Some sketches were deleted in their entirety and later recovered. One such sketch is the "Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)", where a Conservative Party spokesman (Cleese) delivers a party political broadcast before getting up and dancing, being coached by a choreographer (Idle), and being joined by a chorus of spokesmen dancing behind him. The camera passes two Labour Party spokesmen practising ballet, and an animation featuring [[Edward Heath]] in a tutu. Once deemed lost, a home-recorded tape of this sketch, captured from a broadcast from [[Buffalo, New York]] PBS outlet [[WNED-TV]], turned up on [[YouTube]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monty Python - political choreographer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8Ija4Dec7o|work=Monty Python - political choreographer|publisher=Spiny Norman|accessdate=17 June 2013|author=Monty Python|date=18 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another high-quality recording of this sketch, broadcast on [[WTTW]] in Chicago, has also turned up on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Sketch- Choreographed Party Political Broadcast from WTTW-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KO4_feIKO0|work=Lost Sketch- Choreographed Party Political Broadcast - Monty Python's Flying Circus WTTW Channel|publisher=MontyPythoNET|accessdate=23 January 2012|author=Monty Python|date=18 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buffalo version can be seen as an extra on the new [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]/[[DVD Region code|4]] eight-disc ''The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus'' DVD set.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD of ''Before The Flying Circus'', which is included in ''The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus Collector's Edition Megaset'' and ''Monty Python: The Other British Invasion'', also contains the Buffalo version as an extra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =  DVD Talk Review: The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus - Collectors Edition Megaset|date = 18 November 2008|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35399/complete-monty-pythons-flying-circus-collectors-edition-megaset-the/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another lost sketch is the "Satan" animation following the "Crackpot Religion" piece and the "Cartoon Religion Ltd" animation, and preceding the "[[How Not To Be Seen]]" sketch: this had been edited out of the official tape. Six frames of the animation can be seen at the end of the episode, wherein that particular episode is repeated in fast-forward. A black and white 16 mm film print has since turned up (found by a private film collector in the US) showing the animation in its entirety.

At least two references to cancer were censored, both during the second series. In the sixth episode ("It's A Living" or "School Prizes"), [[Carol Cleveland]]'s narration of a Gilliam cartoon suddenly has [[Michael Palin]]'s voice dub '[[gangrene]]' over the word cancer (although the word 'cancer' was used unedited when the animation appeared in the movie ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'' as well as the 2006 special ''[[Monty Python's Personal Best|Terry Gilliam's Personal Best]]''). Another reference was removed from the sketch "Conquistador Coffee Campaign", in the eleventh episode "How Not to Be Seen", although a reference to [[leprosy]] remained intact. This line has also been recovered from the same 16 mm film print as the above-mentioned "Satan" animation.

A sketch from Episode 7 of Series 2 (subtitled 'The Attila the Hun Show') featured a parody of [[Michael Miles]], the 1960s TV [[game show]] host (played by Cleese), and was introduced as 'Spot The Braincell'. This sketch was deleted shortly afterwards from a repeat broadcast as a mark of respect following Miles' death in February 1971.

A restored Region 2 DVD release of Series 1–4 was released in 2007, with no additional features.

== ''Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus'' ==
{{Main article|Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus}}
Two episodes were produced in German for WDR ([[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]), both entitled ''Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus'', the literal German translation of the English title. While visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer [[Alfred Biolek]] caught notice of the Pythons. Excited by their innovative, absurd sketches, he invited them to Germany in 1971 and 1972 to write and act in two special German episodes.

The first episode, advertised as ''Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus: Blödeln für Deutschland'' ("Monty Python's Flying Circus: Clowning around for Germany"), was produced in 1971 and performed in German. The second episode, advertised as ''Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus: Blödeln auf die feine englische Art'' ("Monty Python's Flying Circus: Clowning around in the distinguished English way"), produced in 1972, was recorded in English and dubbed into German for its broadcast in Germany. The original English recording was transmitted by the BBC in October 1973.

== Stage incarnations ==
The members of Monty Python embarked on a series of stage shows during and after the television series. These mostly consisted of sketches from the series, though they also included other famous sketches that had preluded them. One such sketch was the [[Four Yorkshiremen sketch]], written by Cleese and Chapman, and performed for ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''; the sketch subsequently became part of the live Python repertoire. The shows also included songs from collaborator [[Neil Innes]].

Recordings of four of these stage shows have subsequently appeared as separate works:
# [[Monty Python Live at Drury Lane]] (aka Monty Python Live at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane), released in the UK in 1974 as their fifth record album
# [[Monty Python Live at City Center]], performed in New York City and released as a record in 1976 in the US
# [[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]], recorded in Los Angeles in 1980 and released as a film in 1982
# [[Monty Python Live (Mostly)|Monty Python Live (Mostly): One Down, Five to Go]], the troupe's reunion / farewell show, ran for 10 shows at [[The O2 Arena]] in London in July 2014. The final performance on 20 July was live streamed to cinemas worldwide. A re-edited version was later released on Blu-ray, DVD and double Compact Disc; the CD version is exclusive to the deluxe version of the release which contains all 3 formats on four discs housed in a 60-page hardback book.

Graham Chapman also performed on stage at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth Festival]] in 1975 with [[Pink Floyd]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://vintagerock.wordpress.com/category/monty-pythons-flying-circus Monty Pythons Flying Circus | Vintagerock's Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a troupe of actors headed by Rémy Renoux, translated and "adapted" a stage version of ''Monty Python’s Flying Circus'' into French. Usually the original actors defend their material very closely, but given in this case the "adaptation" and also the translation into French (with subtitles), the group supported this production. The adapted material sticks close to the original text, mainly deviating when it comes to ending a sketch, something the Python members themselves changed many times over the course of their stage performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Language differences also occur in the lyrics of several songs. For example, "[[Sit on My Face]]" (which translated into French would be "Asseyez-vous sur mon visage") becomes "cum in my mouth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Logan| first = Brian| title = Ce perroquet est mort: Monty Python in French?

== Landing of ''Flying Circus'' ==
[[John Cleese]] left the show after the third series and did not appear in the six episodes of the fourth and final series. (However, he did receive writing credits for sketches derived from the writing sessions for the film of ''Holy Grail''). [[Neil Innes]] and [[Douglas Adams]] are the only two non-Pythons to get writing credits in the show – Innes for songs in episodes 40, 42 and 45 (and for contributing to a sketch in episode 45), and Adams for contributing to a sketch about a doctor whose patients are stabbed by his nurse, in episode 45. (He also had walk-on acting parts in episodes 42 and 44.) Innes frequently appeared in the Pythons' stage shows and can also be seen as Sir Robin's lead minstrel in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' and (briefly) in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]''. Adams had become friends with [[Graham Chapman]], and they later went on to write the failed sketch show pilot ''[[Out of the Trees]]''.

Although Cleese stayed for the third series, he claimed that he and Chapman only wrote two original sketches ("Dennis Moore" and "Cheese Shop"), whereas he felt everything else was derivative of previous material. Either the third or fourth series are often seen as the weakest and most uneven of the show's run by both fans and the Pythons themselves.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, with the fourth series, the Pythons started making episodes into more coherent stories that would be a precursor to their films, and featured Terry Gilliam onscreen more.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The final episode of Series 4 was recorded on 16 November and broadcast on 5 December 1974. That year NBC's summer replacement series, ''Dean Martin's Comedyworld'' aired several segments from the Python shows. This paid enough to the BBC-TV distributors, [[Time-Life Films]], to finally pay for the conversion of the ''Flying Circus'' programmes from PAL to the American NTSC system, and meant the PBS stations could afford the series at last.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} It was an instant hit, rapidly garnering an enormous loyal cult following nationwide that surprised even the Pythons themselves, who did not believe that their humour was exportable without being tailored specifically, even without a language barrier.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1974, the [[PBS]] station [[KERA-TV|KERA]] in [[Dallas]] was the first television station in the United States to broadcast episodes of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', and is often credited with introducing the programme to American audiences.&lt;ref name="dallas_news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/alan-peppard/20110825-alan-peppard-bob-wilson-hailed-in-kera-documentary.ece|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519004645/http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/columnists/alan-peppard/20110825-alan-peppard-bob-wilson-hailed-in-kera-documentary.ece|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 May 2014|title=Alan Peppard: Bob Wilson hailed in KERA documentary |author=Peppard, Alan |publisher=The Dallas Morning News |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When several episodes were broadcast by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in their ''[[Wide World of Entertainment]]'' showcase in 1975, the episodes were re-edited, thus losing the continuity and flow intended in the originals. When ABC refused to stop treating the series in this way, the Pythons took them to court. Initially the court ruled that their artistic rights had indeed been violated, but it refused to stop the ABC broadcasts. However, on appeal the team gained control over all subsequent US broadcasts of its programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uconn.edu/homes/swilf/ip/cases/gilliam.htm Monty Python, v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir 1976)]&lt;/ref&gt; The case also led to their gaining the rights from the BBC, once their original contracts ended at the end of 1980.

The show also aired on [[MTV]] during the network's infancy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHoAoaVBz0|title=MTV Monty Python Warning|date=31 May 2007|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monty Python'' was part of a two-hour comedy block on Sunday nights that also included another BBC series, ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.

In April 2006, ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' returned to non-cable American television on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. In connection with this, PBS commissioned ''[[Monty Python's Personal Best]]'', a six-episode series featuring each Python’s favourite sketches, plus a tribute to Chapman, who died in 1989. [[BBC America]] has aired the series on a sporadic basis since the mid-2000s, in an extended 40-minute time slot in order to include commercials. [[Independent Film Channel]] acquired the rights to the show in 2009, though not exclusive, as BBC America still airs occasional episodes of the show. IFC also presented a six-part documentary ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (The Lawyers Cut)]]'', produced by Terry Jones' son Bill.

== Legacy ==
[[Douglas Adams]], creator of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and co-writer of the "[[Patient Abuse]]" sketch, once said "I loved Monty Python's Flying Circus. For years I wanted to be John Cleese, I was most disappointed when I found out the job had been taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010930/bio?ref_=nm_dyk_qt_sm#quotes | title = Douglas Adams - Biography - IMdb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lorne Michaels]] counts the show as a major influence on his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584427/bio?ref_=nm_ql_1 | title = Lorne Michaels - Biography - IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleese and Palin re-enacted the [[Dead Parrot sketch]] on ''SNL'' in 1997.

The show was a major influence on the Danish [[cult following|cult]] sketch show ''[[Casper &amp; Mandrilaftalen]]'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hansen |first=Helle Kastholm |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/ekstra/ekstra-kendte/lars-hjortshoej-mine-boern-saetter-mig-paa-plads/6593764 |title=LARS HJORTSHØJ: Mine børn sætter mig på plads |language=Danish |work=[[Ekstra Bladet]] |publisher=[[JP/Politikens Hus]] |date=April 2, 2017 |page=16 (4th section) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501050649/http://ekstrabladet.dk/ekstra/ekstra-kendte/lars-hjortshoej-mine-boern-saetter-mig-paa-plads/6593764 |archivedate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cleese starred in its 50th episode.&lt;ref name="dfi-mandrillen"&gt;"[http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/film/da/77461.aspx?id=77461 Casper &amp; mandrilaftalen]".

== Production ==
The production team was headed by [[Ian MacNaughton]]. Other regular team members included Hazel Pethig (costumes), Madelaine Gaffney (makeup) and John Horton (video effects designer). Maggie Weston, who worked on both makeup and design, married Gilliam in 1973 and they are still together. The series was primarily filmed in London studios and nearby locations, although location shooting to take in beaches and villages included filming in [[Somerset]] and [[Norwich]].

== Transnational themes ==
The overall humour of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' is built on an inherent Britishness; it is “based on observations of British life, society, and institutions”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobrogoszcz|first1=Tomasz|editor1-last=Dobrogoszcz|editor1-first=Tomasz|title=The British Look Abroad: Monty Python and the Foreign|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, part of this focus is achieved through seeing the ‘other’ through a British lens.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kern|first1=Kevin F.|editor1-last=Dobrogoszcz|editor1-first=Tomasz|title=Twentieth-Century Vole, Mr. Neutron, and Spam: Portrayals of American Culture in the Work of Monty Python|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The often “excessive generalization and utterly banal stereotypes” can be seen as a persiflage of the views held by the British public, rather than poking fun at the cultures that were depicted.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

For example, while American culture is not often in the foreground in many sketches, it is rather a frequent side note in many skits. Almost all of the 45 episodes produced for the BBC contain a reference to Americans or American culture, with 230 references total, resulting in approximately five references per show, but increasing over the course of the show.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In total, 140 references to the American entertainment industry are made. Entertainment tropes, such as [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], [[Film noir]] and [[Hollywood]] are referenced 39 times. Further, there are 12 references to arts and literature, 15 to US politics, 5 to the American military, 7 to US historical events, 12 to locations in the US, 7 to space and science fiction, 21 economic references, such as brands like [[Pan-Am]], [[Time-Life]], and [[Spam (food)|Spam]], and 8 sports references. Some references do double count in various categories.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; It is also notable that American music is regularly heard in the show, such as the theme to the television series ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'', but most prominently the show's theme tune (''[[The Liberty Bell (march)|The Liberty Bell]]'' by [[John Philip Sousa]]).

While American entertainment was a pervasive cultural influence in Britain&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; at the time of the production of the series, not all references to American culture can be seen as conscious decisions. For example, [[Terry Jones]] did not know that Spam was an American product at the time he wrote the sketch.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Kevin Kern summarises in his analysis of references to the US 'that portrayals of American themes reflected three broad responses to American hegemony: 1) minor or passing references to specific individuals, events, or products of American culture, 2) American cultural tropes used to serve a general comedic purpose, and 3) satire aimed at American targets, specifically US economic power, the crassness or banality of American culture, or American violence and militarism'.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, Kern does not see this as exhibiting anti-American tendencies, but as 'a natural extension of the Pythons’ frequent (…) satirical focus on vulgarity, banality, violence, and militarism in the United Kingdom (…)' &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In '''''NUMSA v Bader Bop''''', an important case in [[South African labour law]], the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa]] (NUMSA) requested of the employer, Bader Bop, that it be granted the organisational rights in sections 12 to 15 of the Labour Relations Act. The union had less than fifty per cent representivity within the workplace.

The employer took the view that, although it was prepared to grant access and stop-order facilities, it was not prepared to recognise the union’s shop stewards.

Since the union did not have majority representation, it could not compel the employer to grant this right in terms of the procedure in section 21 of the LRA, so the union gave notice, instead, that it would embark on strike action to acquire this right.

The issue before the courts was whether or not such a strike would be permitted in terms of the LRA. The lower courts were divided, the Labour Appeal Court holding that minority unions could not strike for such a right because,

* once the union has conceded that it lacks a majority, there is no dispute over which to strike; and
* such a strike would be hit by section 65(1)(c) of the Labour Relations Act (LRA), which prohibits strikes over disputes that either party may refer to arbitration.

This judgment was overturned by the Constitutional Court, which held that the minority unions may strike in support of demands for organisational rights to which they are not entitled under the LRA.

The Constitutional Court found nothing in section 20 of the LRA which precludes a collective agreement granting collective-bargaining rights, even if the qualification for representativity is not met.

The court's interpretation of this was that, if a minority union asks for, but does not succeed in acquiring, the organisational rights in question, and if conciliation subsequently fails, the dispute-resolution mechanism is to strike for it.

This judgment has been severely criticised.

{{wiktionary|Berber}}
The ethnonym Berber dates to the 19th century, derived from ''[[Barbary]]'' the term for the [[Maghreb]] coast used during the early modern period, itself from Greek ''barbaria'' "land of [[barbarian]]s".
The contemporary self-designation current mostly in Morocco is  ''Imazighen'' (singular ''Amazigh''). 
This term is common in Morocco, especially among Central Atlas, Rifian and Shilah speakers in 1980,&lt;ref name="inalco"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_dialectes/tamazight.htm | title=INALCO report on Central Morocco Tamazight: maps, extension, dialectology, name | accessdate=October 2, 2012 | language=fr | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727120243/http://www.inalco.fr/crb/crb_2/fiches_dialectes/tamazight.htm | archivedate=July 27, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but elsewhere within the Berber homeland sometimes a local, more particular term, such as [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] (Kabyle comes from Arabic: tribal confederation) or [[Chaoui]], is more often used instead in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Le guide de la culture berbère | publisher=Paris Méditerranée | author=Mohand Akli Haddadou | year=2000 | pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berber tribal populations of antiquity are known as [[Numidians]] and later as [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in classical antiquity. These are umbrella terms that would include populations whose self-designation was a variety of tribal names, although [[Strabo]] asserts that ''Mauri'' was also used indigenously.
The ''[[Libu]]'' of ancient Egyptian sources, eponymous of the name ''[[ancient Libya|Libya]]'' may also have been an early Berber or [[Proto-Berber]] population. 

==Berber==

The term ''Berber'' is a variation of the Greek original word [[Barbarian|''barbaros'' ("barbarian")]], earlier in history applied by Romans specifically to their northern hostile neighbors from Germania (modern Germany) and Celts, Iberians, Gauls, Goths and Thracians. The variation is a French one when spelled ''Berbère'' and English when spelled ''Berber''.  The term appeared first in the 4th century in the religious conflicts between [[Saint Augustine]], a [[Numidian]] Berber-Roman bishop of the [[Catholic]] faith, and the Berber Donatists of the [[Donatism]] faith who were allies of the Barbarian [[Vandals]]. The Vandals migrated from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) where they were assailed by the Gauls allied to the Romans, and settled west of the Roman city of Carthage (in modern Tunisia) in the highlands (in modern Algeria).

[[Etymology|Derived terms]] include the toponym [[Barbary]] and the animals [[Barb horse]] and [[Barbary duck]].

The Greek term "βάρβαρος / βάρβαροι" was originally a term for all non-Greek speakers, not necessarily used derogatively. The nonsense syllables "bar-bar" have no meaning in Greek; the term implied that all languages other than Greek were a collection of nonsense syllables. The term has been variously translated as "stutterers," "stammerers," or "babblers." (Compare the widespread belief that the Dutch term ''[[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentot]]'', a term for the [[Khoikhoi]] people that came generally to mean 'barbarian', originated as an [[onomatopoetic]] term.&lt;ref&gt;"Hottentot, n. and adj." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, March 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/88829. Accessed 13 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;) The term did in origin refer to any people of "incomprehensible speech" (cf. [[Names of Germany#Names from Nemets|names for Germans]]), including Persia and Egypt; its connotation of uncivilized rudeness (cf. ''[[Philistine]]'' and ''[[Vandal]]''), now the primary meaning of the term "barbarian",  appears to have emerged in the Roman era or with the [[Migration period]].

Because the Berbers were called ''Al-Barbar'' by the [[Arab]]s, the early modern ''[[Barbary]]'' seems to be a re-adoption of the name from Arabic.{{cn|date=October 2014}}
[[Muslim historians|Muslim historiography]] has an eponymous ''Barbar''  as the ancestor of the Berbers, "the Berbers were the descendants of Barbar, the son of Tamalla, the son of Mazigh, the son of Canaan, the son of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], the son of [[Noah]]" ([[Ibn Khaldun]], ''The History of Ibn Khaldun'', Chapter 3). 

Another people called Berbers by medieval Arab, ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian geographers, respectively, were the ancestors of the [[Somali people|Somalis]]. ''[[Barbara (region)|Barbara]]'', an ancient region on the northern coast of [[Somalia]] was referred to as '''Bilad al-Barbar''' (''Land of the Berbers'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raunig|first=Walter|title=Afrikas Horn: Akten der Ersten Internationalen Littmann-Konferenz 2. bis 5. Mai 2002 in München|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3-447-05175-2|pages=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpNY7VPn1WUC&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=ancient Arabic geography had quite a fixed pattern in listing the countries from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean: These are al-Misr (Egypt) -- al-Muqurra (or other designations for Nubian kingdoms) -- al-Habasha (Abyssinia) -- Barbara (Berber, i.e. the Somali coast) -- Zanj (Azania, i.e. the country of the "blacks"). Correspondingly almost all these terms (or as I believe: all of them!) also appear in ancient and medieval Chinese geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagley"&gt;F.R.C. Bagley et al., ''The Last Great Muslim Empires'', (Brill: 1997), p.174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 12: V. 12'', (Kessinger Publishing, LLC: 2003), p.490&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amazigh  ==
The modern self-designation  ''Imazighen'' (singular ''Amazigh'') apparently derives from the name of the ''Mazikes'' mentioned in Byzantine sources.{{cn|date=October 2014}}
The Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines mentioned various tribes with similar names living in Greater Libya (North Africa) in the areas where Berbers were later found. Later tribal names differ from the classical sources, but are probably still related to the modern ''Amazigh''. The [[Meshwesh]] tribe among them represents the first thus identified from the field. Scholars believe it would be the same tribe called a few centuries after in Greek Mazyes by Hektaios and Maxyes by [[Herodotus]], while it was called after that the "Mazaces" and "Mazax" in Latin sources, and related to the later [[Massylii]] and [[Masaesyli]]. All those names are similar and perhaps foreign renditions to the name used by the Berbers in general for themselves, ''Imazighen''.

Laredo (1954)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Abraham Isaac Laredo, Bereberos y Hebreos en Marruecos | publisher=Instituto de Estudios Africanos | year=1954 | location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that the name Amazigh could be derived from the name of the ancestor ''Mezeg'' which is the translation of biblical ancestor Dedan son of Sheba in the ''[[Targum]]''. 
According to [[Leo Africanus]], ''Amazigh'' meant "free man".{{cn|date=October 2014}}
Etymologically, the name may be related to the well attested "aze" strong, "Tizzit" bravery, or "jeghegh"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alojali|date=1980|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be brave/courageous. 
Further it also has a cognate in the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] word "Amajegh", meaning "noble".&lt;ref name="Brett1996"&gt;{{Citation| author = Brett, M. |author2=Fentress, E.W.B. | year = 1996| title = The Berbers| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maddy"&gt;{{Citation| author = Maddy-weitzman, B.| year = 2006| title = Ethno-politics and globalisation in North Africa: The berber culture movement*| journal = The Journal of North African Studies| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 71–84| url = http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/J28P5N4836V252T6.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate = 17 July 2007| doi = 10.1080/13629380500409917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''''National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan''''' ({{lang-uz|Oʻzbekiston milliy ensiklopediyasi, OʻzME in [[Latin script]], Ўзбекистон миллий энциклопедияси, ЎзМЭ in [[Cyrillic script]]}}) is a general-knowledge [[encyclopedia]] in the [[Uzbek language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2000–2005 | title = National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan | encyclopedia = National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan | publisher = National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan State Scientific Publishing House | location = Tashkent | language = Uzbek | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the ''Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia'' was published in 14 volumes, the ''National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan'' has only 12, much smaller volumes. The first volume of the ''National Encyclopedia'' was published in 2000. The final 12th volume was published in 2005.

In 2013, all of the articles of the ''National Encyclopedia'' were added to the [[Uzbek Wikipedia]] with the help of a [[Wikipedia:Bot|bot]].

== Content ==
The ''National Encyclopedia of Uzbekistan'' has about 50,000 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filling the gaps in our encyclopedic knowledge|url=http://turkistonpress.uz/article/23|accessdate=22 March 2015|work=Turkiston-Press|date=14 January 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the articles in the ''National Encyclopedia'' were directly taken from the ''Uzbek Soviet Encyclopedia''. The bulk of the ''National Encyclopedia'' (40 percent) is devoted to subjects about Uzbekistan. About 60 percent of the articles are on [[social sciences]] and the other 40 percent are on [[natural sciences]]. The 12th volume is entirely dedicated to subjects about Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In 2012, the Uzbek National Encyclopedia published 15 reference books|url=http://www.encyclopedia.ru/news/enc/detail/46964/|publisher=Encyclopedia.ru|accessdate=22 March 2015|date=7 January 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of its theoretical foundations, PNC combined elements or orthodox [[Marxism]], [[Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]] and [[Neo-anarchism]] (as inspired by [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] of [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]]).&lt;ref name="Тарасов"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic system that existed in the [[USSR]] was viewed by PNC members as [[socialist]], but at the same time the political system was seen as non-socialist ([[neo-Stalinist]], [[bureaucratic]]), which, in their opinion, represented the classic conflict of Marxism: the conflict between [[productive forces]] and the [[relations of production]], and would inevitably lead to a political [[revolution]].&lt;ref name="Fäldin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=(Russian)&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; PNC members believed that the victory of a group of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s supporters over their political opponents in the inner-party struggle within [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|VKP (b)]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s&lt;ref name="Fäldin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roßbach" /&gt; was the reason of the fundamental differences between political and economic systems.

PNC set it as their objective to perform a political revolution and return the country back to pre-[[Stalinist]] ideological and political foundations. [[Student activism|Students]] were thought to be the vanguard of the new revolution.&lt;ref name="Roßbach" /&gt;

PNC had neither a developed structure, nor official theoretical documents (it was expected that such documents would be adopted by the future [[party conference]]). The organisation consisted of just two groups in [[Moscow]] and one in the city of Kaliningrad (presently known as [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast|Korolyov]], a city in [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow Region]]). "The Principles of Neo-communism" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Принципы неокоммунизма) written by A. Tarasov in the form of a [[catechism]] in November 1973, served as a temporary theoretical and programme document of the party. In some theoretical issues, important from the point of view of PNC members, they were guided by Tarasov's works, written in 1973-1974 and revised after they had been discussed within PNC. Such theoretical issues included:  preference of revolutionary approach to the [[Reformism|reformist]] one (based on the work "[[Chile]], [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus crisis]] and [[Eurocommunism]]"); identification of the new Soviet [[Philistinism|philistines]] as representatives of [[petite bourgeoisie]] and a major [[reactionary]] force in the Soviet society (based on the work "Swamp Rot. [[Black Hundreds]] as Revolutionary Counter-revolutionism of Petit Bourgeoisie"); incompatibility of [[representative democracy]] and communism, the need for [[direct democracy]] (based on the work "Every Man is a King").&lt;ref name="Fäldin" /&gt; None of these works have survived; they were burnt in January 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

PNC members were engaged in sourcing, selecting and distributing illegal literature ("[[samizdat]]" and literature of the pre-Stalinist period), established contacts among students and young people, promoted their ideas through verbal [[propaganda]] (in the 1970s, such propaganda was prosecuted as felony, which carried a penalty of up to seven years in prison under Art. 70 of the [[Criminal Code]] of the [[RSFSR]]).

In the summer of 1974, PNC members ran a trial [[graffiti]] propaganda campaign, when they inscribed in chalk on buildings and fences about fifteen messages that read "Revolution – here and now!", "Remove the [[Senile dementia|seniles]] from power!", "Ten years is enough!" (referring to long years of [[Brezhnev]]'s term in office). The campaign proved to be a failure: the inscriptions  were fairly dull in colour and were easily washed away by rain.&lt;ref name="Roßbach" /&gt; It was decided to abandon the use of graffiti and start printing and distributing [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]].&lt;ref name="Lachin"&gt;{{cite journal

In September 1973, PNC established contacts with another underground [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] group, called the [[Left School]], having first concurred with them in their views on the reasons for the defeat of the Chilean revolution of 1970–1973 years, and then on the nature of the political regime in the USSR. In May 1974 PNC and Left School agreed to unite their forces, and in September 1974 they merged into one organization under the name of the [[Neo-Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (NCPSU).&lt;ref name="Тарасов"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Despite the agreement to merge, [[de facto]] PNC and the Left School were operating separately for some time; therefore, when part of the Moscow group of PNC (including its [[leadership|leaders]]) was arrested by the [[KGB]] in January 1975, the unaffected leaders of the Left School took on the task of saving the organisation through increased secrecy. They successfully kept the organization alive deep underground up until 1977, when arrested NCPSU leaders (from among former PNC members) were released to freedom and began to revive the party. Thus, until January 1977, PNC existed as a separate clandestine group effectively controlled by the Left School.&lt;ref name="Fäldin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Тарасов"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Paul Hazard.jpg|thumb|right|Paul Hazard]]
'''Paul Gustave Marie Camille Hazard''' ({{IPA-fr|azaʁ|lang}}; 30 April 1878, [[Noordpeene]], [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] &amp;ndash; 13 April 1944, [[Paris]]), was a [[French people|French]] [[scholar]], [[professor]] and [[History of ideas|historian of ideas]].

==Biography==
Hazard was the son of a school teacher. Starting in 1900, he attended the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]]. He received a doctorate from the [[Sorbonne]] in 1910 and became famous for his Ph.D. dissertation ''La Révolution française et les lettres italiennes'' (1910). 

Hazard began his career at the [[University of Lyon]] in 1910, teaching [[comparative literature]]. In 1919 he began teaching also at the Sorbonne. In 1925 Hazard was appointed to the chair of comparative literature at the [[Collège de France]] in Paris. In alternating years, from 1932 until 1940, he was a visiting lecturer at [[Columbia University]] in New York. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hazard also lectured at other American schools. He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1939. 

After finishing his semester of teaching at Columbia in 1940, Hazard voluntarily returned to [[Nazi]] [[occupied France]] in January 1941. He continued to teach, at Lyon and Paris, and to study. Later that same year Hazard was nominated to the [[Rector (academia)|rectorship]] of the [[University of Paris]], but was rejected by the Nazis as unacceptable. Working under what have been described as cruel circumstances, he completed ''European Thought in the Eighteenth Century''. In the year of his death, an article, ''Pour que vive l'âme de la France'' (''So That the Soul of France May Live''), appeared in the clandestine review ''France de demain''. 

Hazard died in Paris on 13 April 1944.

==Published works==
Hazard founded, with Fernand Baldensperger, the ''Revue de littérature comparée'' in 1921. Some of his important writings are ''Histoire illustrée de la littérature française'' (comp. with [[Joseph Bédier]], 2 vol., 1923–24); ''[[Leopardi]]'' (1913); ''[[Lamartine]]'' (1926); ''[[Stendhal]]'' (1927); ''[[Don Quichotte]]'' (1931); and ''Les livres, les enfants et les hommes'' (1932)  (''Books, Children and Men'' tr. 1944). This last work has been described as a sensitive appraisal of works written either for very young [[Reading (process)|readers]], or taken over by them, covering all Europe over many centuries. In this book, he was the first to point out that [[Northern Europe]] surpassed [[Southern Europe]] in children's literature. 

Hazard is known today mainly for two works. The first was ''La Crise de la conscience européenne'', 1935 (''The European Mind, the Critical Years, 1680-1715, tr. 1952''). This work examined the conflict between 17th-century [[Neoclassicism]] and its ideals of order and perfection and the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. 

The other was his last completed work ''La Pensée européenne au XVIIIème siècle, de [[Montesquieu]] à [[Lessing]]'' (1946) (''European Thought in the Eighteenth Century from Montesquieu to Lessing'', tr. 1954) published posthumously in 1946. This work was a continuation of the subject matter discussed in ''The European Mind''. Apparently, Hazard intended a third volume which would have focused on "the Man of Feeling. On that enterprise we have already embarked. One day, perchance, we shall complete it. One day, ''si vis suppeditat'', as the [[Romans]] used to say." (''European Thought in the Eighteenth Century'', p. xx)  Hazard did not live to complete it.

The '''Ruth and Raymond G.

It is an [[Art Deco]] building that features cathedral-like entrances and is adorned with [[Architectural sculpture|sculpture]] and [[gilding]].&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.about.com/od/artmuseums/ss/perelman_bldg_2.htm |title=Ruth and Raymond G.

== History ==
Philadelphia architectural firm [[Zantzinger, Borie and Medary]], which had collaborated on the Philadelphia Museum of Art, designed the building to be the headquarters for Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; Construction began in 1926 and the building was completed in 1928. Sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]] created its decorative scheme, which features [[polychrome]] facades adorned with figures symbolizing attributes of insurance: the owl of wisdom, the dog of fidelity, the pelican of charity, the opossum of protection, and the squirrel of frugality.&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt; Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company occupied the building from 1927 to 1972.&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt; In 1982, it was acquired and restored by the Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company, which in turn relocated in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tNjAgQxISgoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA305#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Historic landmarks of Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philadelphia Museum of Art restoration ===
The Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the building in 1999 through the City of Philadelphia. In anticipation of its 125th anniversary in 2001, the museum began a capital campaign that collected $240 million in donations.&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/information/45-289-400-242.html Perelman Building: Construction Timeline], Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the $15 million contributed by the Perelmans, the annex was renamed the Ruth and Raymond G. Perelman Building in 2000. [[Gluckman Mayner Architects]] restored and renovated the historic building, and expanded it with a {{convert|59000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} addition. The Perelman Building opened on September 15, 2007.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;

[[Roald Dahl]] (1916–1990) was a British author and scriptwriter,&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; and "the most popular writer of children's books since [[Enid Blyton]]", according to [[Philip Howard (journalist)|Philip Howard]], the literary editor of ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Times: Howard" /&gt; The death of an elder sister and his father within a few months when he was three gave his writing "a black savagery".{{sfn|Howard|2011}} He was raised by his Norwegian mother, who took him on annual trips to Norway, where she told him the stories of trolls and witches present in the dark Scandinavian fables. Dahl was influenced by the stories, and returned to many of the themes in his children's books.{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|pp=60–62}} His mother also nurtured a passion in the young Dahl for reading and literature.{{sfn|Howard|2011}}

During the Second World War Dahl was a pilot in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the subsequent injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant [[air attaché]], ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work.{{sfn|Conant|2008|p=xvii}} In 1942 the writer [[C.S. Forester]] asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use in an article in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to ''[[The Gremlins]]'', a serialised story in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the [[gremlin]]; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943.{{sfn|Dalby|1994|pp=5–6}} Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946.{{sfn|Walker|2004|pp=40–41}} Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories.{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|pp=350–51}}&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; His first children's novel, ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'', was published in 1961,{{sfn|Walker|2002|p=12}} which was followed, along with others, by ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' (1970), ''[[Danny, the Champion of the World]]'' (1975), ''[[The BFG]]'' (1982) and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' in 1988.{{sfn|Book and Magazine Collector|2005|pp=20–27}}

Dahl's first script was for a stage work, ''[[The Honeys (play)|The Honeys]]'', which appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1955. He followed this with a television script, "[[Lamb to the Slaughter]]", for the ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' series. He also co-wrote screenplays for film, including for ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968).{{sfn|Walker|2002|p=22–23}}&lt;ref name="AFI: scripts" /&gt; In 1982 Dahl published the first of three editions of poems—all aimed at children. The following year he edited a book of ghost stories.&lt;ref name="Dahl Museum biblio" /&gt; He also wrote several works of non-fiction, including three autobiographies, a cookery book, a safety leaflet for the British railways and a book on measles, which was about the death of his daughter Olivia from [[Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis|measles encephalitis]].&lt;ref name="Dahl Museum biblio" /&gt;{{sfn|Sturrock|2010|pp=627–28}}

As at 2015, Dahl's works have been translated into 59 languages and have sold more than 200&amp;nbsp;million books worldwide.&lt;ref name="BBC: Global" /&gt; His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]], and the [[Specsavers National Book Awards|British Book Awards']] Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008 ''The Times'' placed Dahl 16th on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".&lt;ref name="Times: 50" /&gt; He has been referred to by an anonymous writer for ''[[The Independent]]'' as "one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century"&lt;ref name="Indie: greatest" /&gt; On Dahl's death in 1990, Howard considered him "one of the most widely read and influential writers of our generation".&lt;ref name="Times: Howard" /&gt;

==Quick SOFA score==
The Quick SOFA Score (quickSOFA or qSOFA) was introduced by the Sepsis-3 group in February 2016 as a simplified version of the SOFA Score as an initial way to identify patients at high risk for poor outcome with an infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angus|first=Derek C.|last2=Seymour|first2=Christopher W.|last3=Coopersmith|first3=Craig M.|last4=Deutschman|first4=Clifford S.|last5=Klompas|first5=Michael|last6=Levy|first6=Mitchell M.|last7=Martin|first7=Gregory S.|last8=Osborn|first8=Tiffany M.|last9=Rhee|first9=Chanu|title=A Framework for the Development and Interpretation of Different Sepsis Definitions and Clinical Criteria|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00003246-201603000-00035|journal=Critical Care Medicine|volume=44|issue=3|pages=e113–e121|doi=10.1097/ccm.0000000000001730|pmc=4765912}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SIRS Criteria definitions of sepsis are being replaced as they were found to possess too many limitations; the “current use of 2 or more SIRS criteria to identify sepsis was unanimously considered by the task force to be unhelpful.” The qSOFA simplifies the SOFA score drastically by only including its 3 clinical criteria and by including "any altered mentation" instead of requiring a GCS &lt;15. qSOFA can easily and quickly be repeated serially on patients.

The score ranges from 0 to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points near the onset of infection was associated with a greater risk  of death or prolonged intensive care unit stay. These are outcomes that are more common in infected patients who may be septic than those with  uncomplicated infection. Based upon these findings, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis recommends qSOFA as a simple prompt to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to be septic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qsofa.org/what.php|title=qSOFA :: What is qSOFA?|website=www.qsofa.org|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54392">Every day, people are presented with endless amounts of information, and in an effort to help keep track and organize this information, people must be able to recognize, differentiate and store information. One way to do that is to [[information organization|organize information]] as it pertains to the self.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9), 677-688. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677&lt;/ref&gt; The overall concept of [[self-reference]] suggests that people interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their [[self-concept]] as a background for new information.&lt;ref name = "source1" /&gt;  Examples include being able to attribute [[personality traits]] to oneself or to identify [[recollection|recollected]] episodes as being personal memories of the past.&lt;ref name="source6"&gt;Benoit, R.

''Neuroimage, 50''(3), 1340-1349. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.091&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the "[[cocktail party effect]]" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of [[implicit self-esteem]]). For example, people tend to prefer their [[Implicit self-esteem#Name.E2.80.93letter effect|own initials]] over other letters.&lt;ref name="source8"&gt;Heatherton, T. F., Macrae, C., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2004). What the social brain sciences can tell us about the self. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13''(5), 190-193. doi:10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00305.x&lt;/ref&gt; The [[self-reference effect]] (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of '''self-referential encoding''' and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential [[mnemonic]] properties of self-reference.&lt;ref name="source5"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56''(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.853&lt;/ref&gt;

Research includes investigations into [[self-schema]], [[self-concept]] and [[self-awareness]] as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in [[memory]]. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including [[#Simulation theory|simulation theory]] and the [[#Expansion of the SRE: group reference|group reference]] effect.
After researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with [[#Autism spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]]s or those experiencing [[#Depression|depression]].

==Self-concept and self-schema==
Self-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]]. A [[self-schema]] is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves.&lt;ref name="source14"&gt;Katz, A. N. (1987). Self-reference in the encoding of creative-relevant traits. ''Journal of Personality, 55''(1), 97-120. doi:10.1111/j.1467-6494.1987.tb00430.x&lt;/ref&gt; For any given trait, an individual may or may not be "schematic"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered "schematic" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., Hamill, R., &amp; Sentis, K. P. (1987). Thinking fat: Self-schemas for body weight and the processing of weight relevant information. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', ''17''(1), 50-71. doi:10.1111/j.1559-1816.1987.tb00292.x&lt;/ref&gt; When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory.&lt;ref name = "source15"&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Burton, H. A. (1989). Two self-reference effects: The importance of distinguishing between self-descriptiveness judgments and autobiographical retrieval in self-referent encoding. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56(6), 853-865. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.56.6.8533&lt;/ref&gt; Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema.&lt;ref name="source16"&gt;Mills, C. J. (1983). Sex-typing and self-schemata effects on memory and response latency. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45''(1), 163-172. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.45.1.163&lt;/ref&gt; Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.&lt;ref name = "source14"/&gt;

Self-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema.&lt;ref name = "source12"/&gt; When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and [[Recall (memory)|recalled]].  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.&lt;ref name = "source16"/&gt;

Self-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university).&lt;ref name="source31"&gt;Johnson, C., Gadon, O., Carlson, D., Southwick, S., Faith, M., &amp; Chalfin, J. (2002). Self-reference and group membership: Evidence for a group-reference effect. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 32''(2), 261-274. doi:10.1002/ejsp.83&lt;/ref&gt; Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.

In order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks.&lt;ref name="ego"&gt;Dunkel, C. S. (2005). Ego-identity and the Processing of Self-relevant Information . Self and Identity, 349-359&lt;/ref&gt; Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were "like me" or "not like me," they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.&lt;ref name="behavior"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Strube, M., Berry, J. M., Lott, C., Fogelman, R., Steinhart, G., Moergen, S., &amp; Davison, L. (1986). Self-schematic representation of the Type A and B behavior patterns. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''51''(1), 170-180. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.170&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive.&lt;ref name = "ego"/&gt; Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

In addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt; That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the "like me" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.

===Self-awareness and personality===
Two of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;Hull, J. G., &amp; Levy, A. S. (1979). The organizational functions of the self: An alternative to the Duval and Wicklund Model of self-awareness. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37''(5), 756-768. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.37.5.756&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention &lt;ref&gt;Duval, S., &amp; Wicklund, R. A. (1972). ''A theory of objective self-awareness.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment.&lt;ref name = "hull"/&gt; The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.

In later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Hull, J. G., Van Treuren, R. R., Ashford, S. J., Propsom, P., &amp; Andrus, B. W. (1988). Self-consciousness and the processing of self-relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54''(3), 452-465. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.452&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence "The robber took the money from the bank".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1983). ''The architecture of cognition.'' Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

In reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt; Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "review"/&gt;

Similar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A and Type B behavior patterns]], focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.&lt;ref name = "behavior"/&gt;

==Theoretical background==
Influential psychologists [[Fergus Craik|Craik]] and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, F. I. M., &amp; Lockhart, R. S. (1972).'' ''Levels of processing: A framework for memory research. ''Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 11''(6), 671-684. [[doi:10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X|doi: 10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1986). Elaboration, organization, and the self-reference effect in memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115''(1), 26-38. doi:10.1037/0096-3445.115.1.26&lt;/ref&gt; Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive [[adjectives]] on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an "incidental recall task". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and [[phonemic]] tasks lead only to "shallow" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to "deep" encoding and resulted in better recall.&lt;ref&gt;Craik F., &amp; Tulving, E. (1975). Depth of processing and the retention of words in episodic memory. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104,'' 268-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Experts suggest that the call on [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]] required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field &lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 "revisited" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the "self" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive &lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt; In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.&lt;ref name = "source1"/&gt;

Researchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A [[meta-analysis]] by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on [[Semantic memory|semantic]] encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.&lt;ref name="source4" /&gt;

Theorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory.&lt;ref name = "source13"/&gt; Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndyke, P. W., &amp; Hayes-Roth, B. (1979). The use schemata in the acquisition and transfer of knowledge.'' Cognitive Psychology, 11''(1), 82-106. [[doi: 10.1016/0010-0285(79)90005-7]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.&lt;ref name="source16" /&gt;

==Types of self-referential encoding tasks==
As research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as "self-descriptive." Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.

In a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt; For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive.&lt;ref name="source12" /&gt;  The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.&lt;ref name = "source5"/&gt;

==Explanations for the self-reference effect==
While a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis.&lt;ref name="source3"&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1988). The nature of self-referent encoding: The contributions of elaborative and organizational processes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55''(1), 5-11. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.5&lt;/ref&gt; Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.&lt;ref name="source34"&gt;Bennett, M., Allan, S., Anderson, J., &amp; Asker, N. (2010). On the robustness of the group reference effect. European Journal of Social Psychology, 40(2), 349-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elaboration===
Elaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace,&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Organization===
The organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt; This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Structural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not.&lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt; Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior &lt;ref name = "source2"/&gt;

===Dual process===
Psychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, G. O., &amp; Hunt, R. R. (1980). Levels of processing and organization: Additive effects of individual item and relational processing. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory'',''6'', 588-598.&lt;/ref&gt; Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.
 
Ultimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt; Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.&lt;ref name = "source3"/&gt;

Overall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled.&lt;ref name="source4"&gt;Symons, C. S., &amp; Johnson, B. T. (1997). The self-reference effect in memory: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 121''(3), 371-394. doi:10.1037/0033-2909.121.3.371&lt;/ref&gt; The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.&lt;ref name = "source4"/&gt;

==Social brain science==
The field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics.&lt;ref name="source7"&gt;Mitchell, J. P., Banaji, M. R., &amp; Macrae, C. (2005). The Link between social cognition and self-referential thought in the medial prefrontal cortex. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17''(8), 1306-1315. doi:10.1162/0898929055002418&lt;/ref&gt; Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial [[prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt;

The research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source33"&gt;Moran, J. M., Macrae, C. N., Heatherton, T. F., Wyland, C. L., &amp; Kelley, W. M. (2006). Neuroanatomical evidence for distinct cognitive and affective components of self. ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18''(9), 1586-1594. doi:10.1162/jocn.2006.18.9.1586&lt;/ref&gt; When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The [[caudate nucleus]] has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Fossati, P., Hevenor, S. J., Lepage, M., Graham, S. J., Grady, C., Keightley, M. L., et al. (2004). Distributed self in episodic memory: Neural correlates of successful retrieval of self-encoded positive and negative personality traits. ''Neuroimage, 22''(4), 1596-1604. [[doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034|doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.034]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; The ventral [[Cingulate cortex#Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex]] (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt; There is also pCC ([[posterior cingulate cortex]]) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.&lt;ref name = "source33"/&gt;

===Depth of processing or cognitive structure===
Given all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt;

Previous studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks.&lt;ref name = "source8"/&gt; The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.

===Simulation theory===
While not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the [[simulation theory of empathy]]. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others.&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt; The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference.&lt;ref name = "source6"/&gt; However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the [[false-consensus effect]].&lt;ref name = "source7"/&gt;

==Expansion of the SRE: group reference==
In addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer M. B. ,&amp; Gardner, W. (1996). Who is this 'We'? Levels of collective identity and self representations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71'', 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Previous research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members &lt;ref&gt;Wright, S.C., Aron A., McLaughlin-Volpe, T., &amp; Ropp, S. A. (1997). The extended contact effect: Knowledge of cross-group friendships and prejudice. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73'', 73–90.&lt;/ref&gt; into the development of their self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., Aron, E., Tudor, M., &amp; Nelson, G. (1991). Close relationships as including other and self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60'', 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

In order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

Despite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;
 
Both experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, T. J., Rule, G. R., &amp; Carlson, D. (1983). Memory for personally relevant information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44'', 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;Gaertner, L., Sedikides, C., &amp; Graetz, K. (1999). In search of self-definition: Motivational primacy of the individual self, motivational primacy of the collective self, or contextual primacy? ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76'', 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt; This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.&lt;ref name = "source31"/&gt;

Ultimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt; Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.&lt;ref name="source31"/&gt;

==Applications==
Once the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.

===Autism spectrum disorder===
Individuals diagnosed with [[autism spectrum]] disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms.  Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more "self-focused." That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective.&lt;ref name="source10"&gt;Lombardo, M. V., Barnes, J. L., Wheelwright, S. J., Cohen-Baron, S. (2007). Self-referential cognition and empathy in autism. ''PLoS ONE, 2''(9), e883. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000883&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture &lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Noting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with [[self-awareness]], it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes.&lt;ref name="source9"&gt;Henderson, H. A., Zahka, N. E., Kojkowski, N. M., Inge, A. P., Schwartz, C. B., Hileman, C. M., &amp; ... Mundy, P. C. (2009). Self-referenced memory, social cognition, and symptom presentation in autism. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50''(7), 853-861. doi:10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02059.x&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: "the self," asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, "similar close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, "dissimilar non-close other," asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Therefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals.&lt;ref name = "source9"/&gt; However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

Lombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt; This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.

Ultimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can [[mentalization|mentalize]] with others.&lt;ref name = "source10"/&gt;

===Depression===
There are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  [[anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions. And the third is whether different specific cognitive processes are able to be considered associates of different disorders.&lt;ref name="source11"&gt;Strauman, T. J. (1989).

These prompts only led participants to a more depressive series of emotions and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, M., &amp; Beck, A. T. (1977). Cognitive-affective processes in depression. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), ''Emotions and psychopathology'' (pp.79-107). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from the study done by Derry and Kuiper supported Beck's theory that a negative self-schema is present in people, especially those with depressive disorder.&lt;ref name="source13" /&gt; Depressed individuals attribute depressive adjectives to themselves more than nondepressive adjectives.&lt;ref name="source12"&gt;Dobson, K. S., &amp; Shaw, B. F. (1987). Specificity and stability of self-referent encoding in clinical depression.

that during self-referential processing, those with major depressive disorder show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that depressed individuals may be exhibiting greater cognitive control than
non-depressed individuals when processing self-relevant information.&lt;ref name="source35"&gt;Lemogne, C., le Bastard, G., Mayberg, H., Volle, E., Bergouignan, L., Lehericy, S., et al. (2009).

'''''Swing Shift Cinderella''''' is an [[animated cartoon]] [[short subject]] directed by [[Tex Avery]]. The plot involves the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood. Frank Graham voiced the wolf, and Colleen Collins voiced Cinderella, with [[Imogene Lynn]] providing her singing voice.&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/2996-Swing_Shift_Cinderella.html Swing Shift Cinderella]". ''www.bcdb.com'', April 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At the beginning, [[Big Bad Wolf#MGM/Tex Avery's Big Bad Wolf|the Big Bad Wolf]] is chasing the young version of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] from the beginning of ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]''. But then Little Red [[Fourth wall|stops and points out that the two of them are in the wrong cartoon]]. The Wolf shoos away Little Red and decides to go and meet [[Cinderella]] (played by Red from ''Red Hot Riding Hood''). He takes a taxi to her house and [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love with her upon seeing her]], but she sternly rebuffs him. Eventually, Cinderella calls her [[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]] (played by Grandma from ''Red Hot Riding Hood'') to get rid of him and set her up for that night's ball. The second the Fairy Godmother hears that there's a Wolf, she rushes right over. The Fairy Godmother traps the Wolf, then gives Cinderella a sexy dress and transforms a pumpkin into a [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]] for her to go the ball, but tells Cinderella that she has to get home by midnight (just like in the [[Fairy tale|classic fairy tale]]).

The oversexed Fairy Godmother then keeps the Wolf busy. She appears before him in [http://oldrags.tumblr.com/post/12465303686/mens-bathing-suit-1890s-1910s an old-fashioned 1890s] [[swimsuit]] ("Miss Repulsive 1898") and then [[Evening gown|an evening gown]] before trying to snuggle up to him on the couch. She chases him all around Cinderella's house, but the Wolf escapes when he gets the Fairy Godmother's wand, turning Cinderella's [[bathtub]] into a [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. He leaves for the [[nightclub]] where Cinderella is performing, with the Fairy Godmother in pursuit. Soon after arriving, the Wolf accidentally kisses the Fairy Godmother, thinking she was Cinderella, which only further deepens her lust for the Wolf. Cinderella soon comes out on-stage and performs [[Exotic dancer|an exotic dance]] while singing the song "Oh Wolfie" (to the tune of "[[Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!]]"). The Wolf howls and chases after Cinderella, but the [[Infatuation|smitten]] Godmother uses various methods (usually a [[mallet]]) to keep him in line.

After the performance, more brief chasing ensues until the clock strikes midnight. Cinderella rushes home as the Fairy Godmother's transformation wears off, but she manages to make it home in time--it turns out that Cinderella's a [[Rosie the Riveter]] and that the reason she had to be home by midnight was so she wouldn't be late for the night shift. Cinderella's relieved to be rid of the Wolf, but it's revealed that the bus is full of wolves, who start [[Wolf-whistling|wolf-whistling and catcalling]] at her.

The '''Fossil room II''' is one of two paleontological display rooms in [[Teylers Museum]]. The Fossil room II was built in 1885 as an extension of the first Fossil room I, under the direction of the architect [[Ad van der Steur Jr.]].&lt;ref name=RCE&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The Teylers Museum was originally opened in 1784 as a museum of science and arts. During the course of the next few decades the number of natural history objects grew, and under [[Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda|J.G.S. van Breda]] the Paleontological collection grew with the purchase of various collections based on his in-depth knowledge and personal network. [[Tiberius Winkler]] began the task of cataloguing, and was thus able to sort the collection into more or less important objects, and to display these, the idea of a new museum slowly gained ground with the directors.

{{nihongo||鶴の恩返し|'''Tsuru no Ongaeshi'''|lit. "Crane's Return of a Favor"}} is a story from [[Japanese folklore]] about a crane who returns a favor to a man.  A variant of the story where a man marries the crane that returns the favor is known as {{nihongo||鶴女房|'''Tsuru Nyōbō'''|"Crane Wife"}}.

==Crane's Return of a Favor==
An elderly couple saves a crane caught in a trap.  That night, a beautiful girl appears at the couple's house and asks to stay the night.  Soon, she asks to be their daughter, takes care of them, and offers to weave cloth so that they may sell it for money at market.  She warns them not to look in on her as she is weaving, but they disobey her warning.  When they look in on her weaving, they discover a crane plucking out its feathers to weave the cloth.  She admits she was the crane they once saved, and had wished to take care of them to return the favor.  She explains now that her identity is revealed, she must leave, and so she transforms into a crane and flies away.

==The Crane Wife==

In ''The Crane Wife'', a man (generally named Karoku)  marries a woman who is in fact a crane disguised as a human. To make money the crane wife plucks her own feathers to weave silk brocade which the man sells, but she becomes increasingly ill as she does so. When the man discovers his wife's true identity and the nature of her illness, she leaves him.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, John, and Hertha Dawn. Wong. Family of Earth and Sky: Indigenous Tales from around the World. Beacon Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Variations==

In ''The Copper Pheasant Wife'', the wife does not weave cloth but instead provides her husband a plume to feather an arrow shaft the husband is rewarded for.  The wife is not looked in on by the husband like in ''The Crane Wife''; instead like in ''Crane's Return of a Favor'' the pheasant wife leaves as soon as the favor is returned.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Bird Wife'', it is an injured wild goose the man saves.  In this story, the wife weaves without prompting from the husband.  One day she disappears, and he finds her in a local pond.  It is there she explains she was trying to repay his kindness, and asks him to use the money from selling the cloth to take care of their child before flying away.&lt;br&gt;  
In ''The Fox Wife'', it is a fox that the man helps and who shows up on the man's doorstep to become his bride.  In this tale the fox does not weave but uses her tail to help sweep the floors.  Upon discovering his wife's identity, the husband drives her away.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Clam Wife'' A man finds a beautiful woman mysteriously appear at his doorway.  They become married, and the wife cooks the husband a delicious bean soup each day.  He peeks in on her cooking, and discovers that she is urinating clam juice into the soup, so he chases her away.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Fish Wife'' a fisherman releases fish that he does not need to eat back into the water because he does not have a greedy nature.  A beautiful woman appears at the fisherman's door and begs to be his wife.  The wife cooks the husband a bean soup that is so good he is suspicious of how she makes it.  He spies on her while she is cooking, and discovers she urinates in the soup.  Later at dinner he alludes to her cooking method.  When the wife realizes he knows she says she must return to her former home, and bids the husband visit her at the pond the following day.  When he does, she explains how she was a fish he saved and had wanted to repay the favor.  She disappears into the water, leaving him a box of gold and silver.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Snake Wife'' a beautiful woman appears in a widower's doorway asking to stay the night.  They become married, and the wife becomes pregnant.  The wife warns the husband not to look in on the hut where she intends to have their child.  He looks, and discovers a snake.  The wife says that as the husband has seen her true form, she must leave.  She ends up giving her child her two eyeballs for nourishment as she cannot be there to feed it.  When the son grows of age he takes care of his blind mother.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Fanny Hagin. Ancient Tales in Modern Japan: an Anthology of Japanese Folk Tales.

The center’s mission is to provide quality information through a series of publications, research programs and practical initiatives. CIDE engages in educational development projects around the world in areas such as teacher education, higher educational change, educational finance, and international educational leadership.  Though he technically retired in 2008, he continues to work with incoming doctoral students as an academic advisor and with CIDE.

In November 2013, Rust was the target of a protest claiming that [[microaggression]]s were common in the culture of UCLA. Approximately 25 students, many representing Students of Color, staged a [[sit-in]] in Rust's classroom and stated that they objected to his writing of grammatical corrections on assignments. Rust said he was committed to "being rather thorough" with graduate students. Rust was defended by former students and also other members of Students of Color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/11/25/ucla-grad-students-stage-sit-during-class-protest-what-they-see-racially-hostile|title=In-class sit-in|first=Colleen|last=Flaherty|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|date=2013-11-25|accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Ride of the Valkyrs.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Ride of the Valkyrs'' (1909) by [[ John Charles Dollman]]]]

In [[Norse mythology]], a '''valkyrie''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|l|ˈ|k|ɪər|i|,_|-|ˈ|k|aɪ|r|i|,_|v|ɑː|l|-|,_|ˈ|v|æ|l|k|ər|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/valkyrie "Valkyrie"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|valkyrja}} "chooser of the slain") is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess [[Freyja]]'s afterlife field {{lang|non|[[Fólkvangr]]}}), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, [[Valhalla]], ruled over by the god [[Odin]]. There, the deceased warriors become {{lang|non|[[einherjar]]}} ([[Old Norse]] "single (or once) fighters"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD36LINDOW104&gt;Orchard (1997:36) and Lindow (2001:104).&lt;/ref&gt;). When the {{lang|non|einherjar}} are not preparing for the events of [[Ragnarök]], the valkyries bear them [[mead]]. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by [[raven]]s and sometimes connected to [[swan]]s or [[horse]]s.

Valkyries are attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the {{lang|non|[[Heimskringla]]}} (both by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) and the {{lang|non|[[Njáls saga]]}} (one of the [[Sagas of Icelanders]]), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of [[skald]]s, in a 14th-century [[magical formula|charm]], and in various [[runic inscriptions]].

The [[Old English]] [[cognate]] terms {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagans]]. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the [[Norns]], and the {{lang|non|[[dís]]ir}}, all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.

==Etymology==
The word ''valkyrie'' derives from [[Old Norse]] ''{{linktext|valkyrja|lang=non}}'' (plural {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}), which is composed of two words: the noun ''{{linktext|valr|lang=non}}'' (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb ''{{linktext|kjósa|lang=non}}'' (meaning "to choose"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}} is cognate to [[Old English]] ''{{linktext|wælcyrge|lang=ang}}''.&lt;ref name="BYOCK142-143"&gt;Byock (2005:142–143).&lt;/ref&gt; From the Old English and Old Norse forms, [[philology|philologist]] [[Vladimir Orel]] reconstructs the [[Proto-Germanic]] form {{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/walakuzjǭ|wala-kuzjōn]]}}.&lt;ref name="OREL-442"&gt;Orel (2003:442).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the [[#Old English attestations|Old English attestations]] section below.

Other terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include {{lang|non|óskmey}} ("wish maid"), appearing in the poem {{lang|non|[[Oddrúnargrátr]]}} and  {{lang|non|Óðins [[wikt:mey|meyjar]]}} ("[[Odin]]'s maids"), appearing in the {{lang|non|[[Nafnaþulur]]}}. {{lang|non|Óskmey}} may be related to the [[List of names of Odin|Odinic name {{lang|non|Óski|nocat=y}}]] (roughly meaning "wish fulfiller"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.&lt;ref name="SIMEK254+349"&gt;Simek (2007:254 and 349).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse attestations==

===''Poetic Edda''===
Valkyries are mentioned or appear in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Völundarkviða]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' and ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''.

====''Völuspá'' and ''Grímnismál''====
[[File:Hild, Thrud and Hløkk by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The valkyries Hildr, Þrúðr and Hlökk bearing ale in Valhalla (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
In stanza 30 of the poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', a [[völva]] (a travelling [[seeress]] in Norse society) tells Odin that "she saw" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to "the realm of the gods". The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: [[Skuld]] (Old Norse, possibly "debt" or "future") who "bore a shield", [[Skögul]] ("shaker"), [[Gunnr]] ("war"), [[Hildr]] ("battle"), [[Göndul]] ("[[wand]]-wielder") and [[Geirskögul]] ("Spear-Skögul"). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the "ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth".&lt;ref name="DRONKE15ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Dronke (1997:15). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young [[Agnarr Geirröðsson|Agnar]] that he wishes that the valkyries [[Hrist]] ("shaker") and [[Mist (valkyrie)|Mist]] ("cloud") would "bear him a [drinking] [[drinking horn|horn]]", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says "bear [[ale]] to the [[einherjar]]"; [[Skeggjöld]] ("axe-age"), Skögul, Hildr, [[Þrúðr]] ("power"), [[Hlökk]] ("noise", or "battle"), [[Herfjötur]] ("host-fetter"), [[Göll]] ("tumult"), [[Geirahöð]] ("spear-fight"), [[Randgríð]] ("shield-truce"), [[Ráðgríð]] ("council-truce") and [[Reginleif]] ("power-truce").&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON57ORCHARD193-195"&gt;Larrington (1999:57). Valkyrie name etymologies from Orchard (1995:193–195).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Völundarkviða''====
[[File:Walkyrien by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Walkyrien'' (c. 1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]
A prose introduction in the poem ''[[Völundarkviða]]'' relates that the brothers [[Slagfiðr]], [[Agilaz|Egil]] and [[Wayland Smith|Völund]] dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir ("wolf dales"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár ("wolf lake"), and "near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named [[Hlaðguðr svanhvít]] ("swan-white") and [[Hervör alvitr]] (possibly meaning "all-wise" or "strange creature"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD83"&gt;Orchard (1997:83).&lt;/ref&gt;); the third, daughter of [[Kjárr]] of [[Valland]], is named [[Alruna|Ölrún]] (possibly meaning "[[beer]] [[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="SIMEK251"&gt;Simek (2007:251).&lt;/ref&gt;). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON102"&gt;Larrington (1999:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar''====
[[File:ValkyrieOnHorse.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1908) by [[Stephan Sinding]] located in [[Churchillparken|Churchill Park]] at [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'', a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a [[Tumulus#Scandinavia|burial mound]]. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as [[Sváfa|Sváva]], King Eylimi's daughter, who "often protected him in battles". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name ''[[Helge (name)|Helgi]]'' (meaning "the [[hallow|holy]] one"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD81"&gt;Orchard (1997:81).&lt;/ref&gt;). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as "bright-face lady", and asks her what gift he will receive with the [[Germanic name|name]] she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON125"&gt;Larrington (1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; Further into the poem, Atli [[flyting|flytes]] with the female [[jötunn]] [[Hrímgerðr]]. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[[Numbers in Germanic paganism|Three times nine girls]], but one girl rode ahead,
:white-skinned under her helmet;
:the horses were trembling, from their manes
:dew fell into the deep valleys,
:hail in the high woods;
:good fortune comes to men from there;
:all that I saw was hateful to me.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON128"&gt;Larrington (1999:128).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva's father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva "was a valkyrie just as before".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON129"&gt;Larrington (1999:129).&lt;/ref&gt; The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva "are said to be reincarnated".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON130-131"&gt;Larrington (1999:130–131).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I''====
[[File:Helgi Hundingsbane and Sigrún by Robert Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and Sigrún (1919) by [[Robert Engels]]]]
In the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', the hero [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the [[fell]], and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length [[Mail (armour)|mail armour]] is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Then light shone from Logafell,
:and from that radiance there came bolts of lightning;
:wearing helmets at Himingvani [came the valkyries].
:Their byrnies were drenched in blood;
:and rays shone from their spears.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116"&gt;Larrington (1999:116).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as "southern goddesses") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie [[Sigrún]] ("victory-[[runic alphabet|rune]]"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"&gt;Orchard (1997:194).&lt;/ref&gt;), informs him from her horse that her father [[Högni]] has betrothed her to [[Höðbroddr]], the son of king [[Granmar]] of the [[Nibelung|Hniflung]] clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON116-117"&gt;Larrington (1999:116–117).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the poem, the hero [[Sinfjötli]] [[flyting|flyts]] with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON119"&gt;Larrington (1999:119).&lt;/ref&gt; Further in the poem, the phrase "the valkyrie's airy sea" is used for "[[mist]]".&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON120"&gt;Larrington (1999:120).&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as "the [[troll]]-woman's mount") consume corpses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Helmeted valkyries came down from the sky
:—the noise of spears grew loud—they protected the prince;
:then said Sigrun—the wound-giving valkyries flew,
:the [[troll]]-woman's mount was feasting on the fodder of ravens:&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON121"&gt;Larrington (1999:121).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON122"&gt;Larrington (1999:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Helgakviða Hundingsbana II''====
[[File:Helgi und Sigrun by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Helgi und Sigrun'' (1901) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]
At the beginning of the poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'', a prose narrative says that King [[Sigmund]] (son of [[Völsung]]) and his wife [[Borghild]] (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the antagonist of the earlier ''Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar'').&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON132"&gt;Larrington (1999:132).&lt;/ref&gt; After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is "a valkyrie and rode through air and sea", and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133"&gt;Larrington (1999:133).&lt;/ref&gt; In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase "fed the [[goose|gosling]] of Gunn's sisters". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are [[raven]]s, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON133+281"&gt;Larrington (1999:133 and 281).&lt;/ref&gt;

After stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON135"&gt;Larrington (1999:135).&lt;/ref&gt; Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that "there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated" and that "Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of [[Halfdan]]; the valkyrie [[Kára]]. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work ''[[Káruljóð]]''.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON141"&gt;Larrington (1999:141).&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Sigrdrífumál''====
[[File:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|The valkyrie [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''. Illustration (1911) by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', the hero [[Sigurd]] rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards "the land of the [[Franks]]". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, "as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a ''skjaldborg'' with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the ''skjaldborg'', and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's [[corslet]] is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword [[Gram (mythology)|Gram]] to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.&lt;ref name="THORPE180"&gt;Thorpe (1907:180).&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a [[drinking horn|horn]] of [[mead]] to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen [[prayer]] in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named [[Sigrdrífa]] and that she is a valkyrie.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON166-167"&gt;Larrington (1999:166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had "brought down" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again "fight victoriously in battle", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing [[runic alphabet|runes]], mystic wisdom, and prophecy.&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON167"&gt;Larrington (1999:167).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
[[File:Valkyrie (1834-1835) by H. W. Bissen.jpg|thumb|''Valkyrie'' (1835) by [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]]]]
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] informs [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says "there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups." Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem ''Grímnismál'' that contains a list of valkyries. High says "these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory". High adds that [[Gunnr]] ("war"&lt;ref name="ORCHARD194"/&gt;), [[Róta]], and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as "the youngest [[norns|norn]]"—"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle".&lt;ref name="BYOCK44-45"&gt;Byock (2005:44–45).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife [[Frigg]] arrived at the funeral of their slain son [[Baldr]], with them came the valkyries and also [[Hugin and Munin|Odin's ravens]].&lt;ref name="BYOCK67"&gt;Byock (2005:67).&lt;/ref&gt;

References to valkyries appear throughout the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work ''[[Húsdrápa]]'' by the 10th century skald [[Úlfr Uggason]]. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:There I perceive valkyries and ravens,
:accompanying the wise victory-tree [Odin]
:to the drink of the holy offering [Baldr's funeral feast]
:Within have appeared these motifs.&lt;ref name="FAULKES68"&gt;Faulkes (1995:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Further in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem ''[[Eiríksmál]]'' is provided (see the ''Fagrskinna'' section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:What sort of dream is that, Odin?
:I dreamed I rose up before dawn
:to clear up Val-hall for slain people.
:I aroused the Einheriar,
:bade them get up to strew the benches,
:clean the beer-cups,
:the valkyries to serve wine
:for the arrival of a prince.&lt;ref name="FAULKES69"&gt;Faulkes (1995:69).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including "[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or ''dísir''".&lt;ref name="FAULKES94"&gt;Faulkes (1995:94).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 41, while the hero [[Sigurd]] is riding his horse [[Grani]], he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a [[Mail (armour)|coat of mail]]. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and "she is known as [[Brynhildr]], and was a valkyrie".&lt;ref name="FAULKES102"&gt;Faulkes (1995:102).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 48, poetic terms for "battle" include "weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise", followed by examples of compositions by various [[skald]]s that have used the name of valkyries in said manner ([[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]] uses "Skögul's din" for "battlefield", [[Bersi Skáldtorfuson]] uses "Gunnr's fire" for "sword" and "Hlökk's snow" for "battle", [[Einarr Skúlason]] uses "Hildr's sail" for "shield" and "Göndul's crushing wind" for "battle" and [[Einarr Helgason|Einarr skálaglamm]] uses "Göndul's din"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term "death-maidens"—Old Norse ''valmeyjar''—instead of "valkyries" is used here), with further examples.&lt;ref name="FAULKES117-119"&gt;Faulkes (1995:117–119).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 57, within a list of names of [[ásynjur]] (and after alternate names for the goddess [[Freyja]] are provided), a further section contains a list of "Odin's maids"; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, [[Eir]], Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that "they are called norns who shape necessity".&lt;ref name="FAULKES157"&gt;Faulkes (1995:157).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manuscripts of the feature ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of ''Skáldskaparmál'' contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the "valkyries of [[List of names of Odin|Viðrir]]"—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.&lt;ref name="JÓNSSON678"&gt;Jónsson (1973:678).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hrafnsmál''===
[[File:Valkyrie and raven.jpg|thumb|A valkyrie speaks with a raven in a wood-engraving by [[Joseph Swain (engraver)|Joseph Swain]] after [[Frederick Sandys]], 1862]]
The fragmentary skaldic poem ''[[Hrafnsmál]]'' (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald [[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]]) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of [[Harald I of Norway]]. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a "high-minded", "golden-haired" and "white-armed" maiden speaking with a "glossy-beaked raven". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Wise thought her the valkyrie; were welcome never
:men to the bright-eyed one, her who the birds' speech knew well.
: Greeted the light-lashed maiden, the lily-throated woman,
:The [[ymir|hymir]]'s-skull-cleaver as on cliff he was perching.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"How is it, ye ravens—whence are ye come now
:with beaks all gory, at break of morning?
:Carrion-reek ye carry, and your claws are bloody.
:Were ye near, at night-time, where ye knew of corpses?"&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54"&gt;Hollander (1980:54).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER54-57"&gt;Hollander (1980:54–57).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Njáls saga''===
[[File:Henry De Groux001.jpg|thumb|''Ride of the Valkyries'' (around 1890) by [[Henry De Groux]]]]
In chapter 157 of ''[[Njáls saga]]'', a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on [[Good Friday]] in [[Caithness]]. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular [[loom]]; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]], a sword is the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], and the [[reel]]s are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'', which Dörruð memorizes.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER66"&gt;Hollander (1980:66).&lt;/ref&gt;

The song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] (fought outside [[Dublin]] in 1014 [[Common Era|CE]]). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, [[Hjörþrimul]], [[Sanngriðr]], [[Svipul]], [[Guðr]] and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Now awful it is to be without,
:as blood-red rack races overhead;
:is the welkin gory with warriors' blood
:as we valkyries war-songs chanted.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER68"&gt;Hollander (1980:68).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the end of the poem, the valkyries sing "start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!"&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER68/&gt; The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER66/&gt;

===''Heimskringla''===
[[File:The Valkyrie's Vigil.jpg|thumb|''The Valkyrie's Vigil'' (1906) by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
At the end of the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' saga ''[[Hákonar saga góða]]'', the poem ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by the 10th century [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]] is presented. The saga relates that king [[Haakon I of Norway]] died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died "among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North [[Hordaland]]. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, "words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla". The poem ''Hákonarmál'' is then provided.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER124-125"&gt;Hollander (2007:124–125).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hákonarmál'', Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to "choose among the kings' kinsmen" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the [[kenning]] "Skögul's-stormblast" for "battle". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that "groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads". Haakon hears "what the valkyries said", and the valkyries are described as sitting "high-hearted on horseback", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them.&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER125"&gt;Hollander (2007:125).&lt;/ref&gt; A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Hákon said:''
:"Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?
:though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?"
:''Skogul said:''
:"'Tis owing to us that the issue was won
: and your foemen fled."&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126"&gt;Hollander (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the "green homes of the godheads" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref name="HOLLANDER126-127"&gt;Hollander (2007:126–127).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fagrskinna''===

[[File:Walhall by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Valhalla'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
In chapter 8 of ''[[Fagrskinna]]'', a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband [[Eric Bloodaxe]], [[Gunnhild Mother of Kings]] had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as ''[[Eiríksmál]]''. It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse ''Óðinn''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'What kind of a dream is it,' said Óðinn,
:in which just before daybreak,
:I thought I cleared Valhǫll,
:for coming of slain men?
:I waked the Einherjar,
:bade valkyries rise up,
:to strew the bench,
:and scour the beakers,

:wine to carry,
:as for a king's coming,
:here to me I expect
:heroes' coming from the world,
:certain great ones,
:so glad is my heart.&lt;ref name="FINLAY58"&gt;Finlay (2004:58).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The god [[Bragi]] asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes [[Sigmund]] and [[Sinfjötli]] to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.&lt;ref name="FINLAY59"&gt;Finlay (2004:59).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ragnhild Tregagás charm===
A [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft trial]] held in 1324 in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], records a spell used by the accused [[Ragnhild Tregagás]] to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie [[Göndul]] being "sent out":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:I send out from me the spirits of (the valkyrie) Gondul.
:May the first bite you in the back.
:May the second bite you in the breast.
:May the third turn hate and envy upon you.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:37).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Old English attestations==
[[File:Sermo Lupi.jpg|thumb|A page from {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}]]
The Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} appear several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. In the sermon {{lang|la|[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]}}, written by [[Wulfstan II]], {{lang|ang|wælcyrie}} is used, and considered to appear as word for a human "sorceress".&lt;ref name="NORTH106"&gt;North (1997:106).&lt;/ref&gt; An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's {{lang|la|De laudis virginitatis}} (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] {{lang|la|ueneris}} with {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} (with {{lang|ang|gydene}} meaning "goddess"). {{lang|ang|Wælcyrge}} is used to translate the names of the [[Classical mythology|classical]] [[Erinyes|furies]] in two manuscripts ([[Cotton Cleopatra]] A. iii, and the older ''Corpus Glossary''). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} is also used to gloss the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}} (meaning "dark one choosing the slain"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).&lt;ref name="NORTH106"/&gt;

==Archaeological record==

===Female figures and cup and horn-bearers===
[[File:Valkyrie on horse and giving valkyrie.jpg|thumb|Viking Age jewellery thought to depict valkyries. On the left of the photograph is a female mounted on horseback with a 'winged' cavalry spear clamped under her leg and a sword in her hand. The mounted female is being greeted by another female figure who is carrying a shield. On the right of the photograph is one of numerous female silver figures usually described in museums and books as valkyries (right)]]
[[Viking Age]] stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing [[drinking horn]]s, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir.&lt;ref name="SILVERFIGURES"&gt;Orchard (1997:172) and Lindow (2001:96).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because "they were thought to have protective powers".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt;

The [[Tjängvide image stone]] from the Baltic island of [[Gotland]], Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]], being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla.&lt;ref name="LINDOW276"&gt;Lindow (2001:276).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century [[runestone]] [[Sigurd stones#U 1163|U 1163]] features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.&lt;ref name="WESSEN621"&gt;Wessén &amp; Jansson (1953–58:621).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in [[Hårby]], [[Denmark]] by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that "there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700".&lt;ref name="KENNEDY-2013"&gt;Kennedy (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Runic inscriptions===
[[File:Rökstenen.jpg|thumb|The [[Rök Runestone]]]]
Specific valkyries are mentioned on two [[runestones]]; the early 9th century [[Rök Runestone]] in [[Östergötland]], [[Sweden]], and the 10th-century [[Karlevi Runestone]] on the island of [[Öland]], [[Sweden]], which mentions the valkyrie [[Þrúðr]].&lt;ref name="MACLEOD37"/&gt; On the Rök Runestone, a [[kenning]] is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:That we tell the twelfth, where the horse of the Valkyrie [literally "the horse of [[Gunnr]]"] sees food on the battlefield, where twenty kings are lying.&lt;ref name="ANDRÉN11"&gt;Andrén (2006:11).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], is the "valkyrie stick" from the late 14th century. The stick features a [[Runic alphabet|runic inscription]] intended as a charm. The inscription says that "I cut cure-runes", and also "help-runes", once against [[elf|elves]], twice against [[trolls]], thrice against [[jötunn|thurs]] and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Against the harmful ''skag''-valkyrie,
:so that she never shall, though she never would –
:evil woman! – injure (?) your life.&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-35"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–35).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is followed by "I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and ''jöluns'' wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself." According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription "seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie", and they posit the final line appears "to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman".&lt;ref name="MACLEOD34-37"&gt;MacLeod (2006:34–37).&lt;/ref&gt;

MacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Sigrdrífumál'', where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term ''skag'' is unclear, but a cognate exists in ''Helgakviða Hundingsbana I'' where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a "''skass''-valkyrie". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like "supernatural sending", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also "sent forth".&lt;ref name=MACLEOD34-37/&gt;

==Valkyrie names==
{{main|List of valkyrie names}}
The Old Norse poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Darraðarljóð]]'' and the ''[[Nafnaþulur]]'' section of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as ''[[Sigrún]]'' (who is attested in the poems ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'' and ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]''). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON96"&gt;Davidson (1988:96).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of [[skalds]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON+SIMEK"&gt;Examples include Davidson (1988:96–97) and Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name ''[[Herja]]'' has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess ''[[Hariasa]]'', who is attested from a stone from 187 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK143AND131"&gt;Simek (2007:143). For Hariasa, Simek (2007:131).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Herfjötur]]'' has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters.&lt;ref name="SIMEK142"&gt;Simek (2007:142).&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''[[Svipul]]'' may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over [[wyrd|wyrd or ørlog]]—a [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] concept of [[Destiny|fate]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK308"&gt;Simek (2007:308).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Old English {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} and Old English charms===
[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound.jpg|thumb|An Anglo-Saxon [[tumulus|burial mound]] at [[Sutton Hoo]] in [[Suffolk]], [[England]]]]
Richard North says that the description of a raven flying over the [[Egypt]]ian army (glossed as {{lang|ang|wonn wælceaseg}}) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} in {{lang|la|De laudibus virginitatis}} may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse {{lang|non|valkyrja}}, but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the ''Corpus Glossary'' instances "appear to show an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] conception of {{lang|ang|wælcyrge}} that was independent of contemporary [[Scandinavia]]n influence".&lt;ref name=NORTH106/&gt;

Two [[Old English literature|Old English]] charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; {{lang|ang|[[Wið færstice]]}}, a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and ''[[For a Swarm of Bees]]'', a charm to keep [[honey bee]]s from [[swarming (honey bee)|swarming]]. In {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}}, a sudden pain is attributed to a small, "shrieking" spear thrown with supernatural strength ({{lang|ang|mægen}}) by "fierce" loudly flying "mighty women" ({{lang|ang|mihtigan wif}}) who have ridden over a burial mound:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;They were loud, yes, loud,
when they rode over the (burial) mound;
they were fierce when they rode across the land.
Shield yourself now, you can survive this strife.
Out, little spear, if there is one here within.
It stood under/behind lime-wood (i.e. a shield), under a light-coloured/light-weight shield,
where those mighty women marshalled their powers, and they send shrieking spears.&lt;ref name="HALL1-2"&gt;Hall (2007:1–2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD257"&gt;Greenfield (1996:257).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard North says that "though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse {{lang|non|valkyrjur}}."&lt;ref name="NORTH105"&gt;North (1997:105).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorizes that {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke "a prosaic stitch in the side".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON63"&gt;Davidson (1990:63).&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of ''For a Swarm of Bees'', the swarming bees are referred to as "victory-women" (Old English {{lang|ang|sigewif}}):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Settle down, victory-women,
never be wild and fly to the woods.
Be as mindful of my welfare,
as is each man of eating and of home.&lt;ref name="GREENFIELD256"&gt;Greenfield (1996:256).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "victory women" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the "victorious sword" (the stinging) of the bees.&lt;ref name=GREENFIELD256/&gt;

===Merseburg Incantation, fetters, {{lang|non|dísir}}, {{lang|non|idisi}} and norns===
[[File:Idise by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|''Idise'' (1905) by Emil Doepler]]
[[File:The Dises by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''The Dises'' (1909) by [[Dorothy Hardy]]]]

One of the two [[Old High German]] [[Merseburg Incantations]] call upon female beings—''[[Idisi]]''—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,
some bound fetters, some hampered the army,
some untied fetters:
Escape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"&gt;Simek (2007:171).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Idisi'' mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that "these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name {{lang|non|[[Herfjötur]]}} (Old Norse "army-fetter").&lt;ref name=SIMEK171/&gt; Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English {{lang|ang|Wið færstice}} charm and theorises a similar role for them both.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSON63/&gt;

Simek says that the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] term ''Idisi'' ({{lang-osx|idis}}, {{lang-goh|itis}}, {{lang-ang|ides}}) refers to a "dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin {{lang|la|[[matres and Matrones|matrona]]}}" and that a link to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] term {{lang|non|dísir}} is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name [[Idistaviso|Idisiaviso]] (meaning "plain of the Idisi") where forces commanded by [[Arminius]] fought those commanded by [[Germanicus]] at the [[Battle of the Weser River]] in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name ''Idisiaviso'', the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.&lt;ref name="SIMEK171"/&gt;

Regarding the {{lang|non|dísir}}, Simek states that Old Norse {{lang|non|dís}} appears commonly as simply a term for "woman", just as Old High German {{lang|goh|itis}}, Old Saxon {{lang|osx|idis}} and Old English {{lang|ang|ides}}, and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, "several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in {{lang|non|[[Guðrúnarkviða]]}} I 19 the valkyries are even called {{lang|non|Herjans dísir}} "Odin's {{lang|non|dísir}}". The {{lang|non|dísir}} are explicitly called dead women in {{lang|non|[[Atlamál]]}} 28 and a secondary belief that the {{lang|non|dísir}} were the souls of dead women (see {{lang|non|[[fylgja|fylgjur]]}}) also underlies the {{lang|non|[[landdísir]]}} of [[Scandinavian folklore|Icelandic folklore]].&lt;ref name="SIMEK61-62"&gt;Simek (2007:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt; Simek says that "as the function of the [[Matres and Matrones|matrons]] was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the {{lang|non|dísir}}, like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses."&lt;ref name=SIMEK61-62/&gt;

[[Jacob Grimm]] states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a {{lang|non|dís}} can be both norn and a valkyrie, "but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs ''ride'' to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods".&lt;ref name="GRIMM421"&gt;Grimm (1882:421).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and development===
[[File:Die Nornen (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Norns'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]]]]

Various theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as "demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred "when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise". Simek says that this original concept was "superseded by the [[Shieldmaiden|shield girls]]—Irish female warriors who lived on like the ''einherjar'' in Valhall." Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as "demons of death". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in [[Poetic Edda#Heroic lays|heroic poetry]], and during this transition were stripped of their "demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...]." Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of [[List of valkyrie names in Norse mythology|valkyrie names]] do not appear to be very old, and that the names "mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief."&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"/&gt;

MacLeod and Mees theorise that "the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the [[Norns]], the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...]."&lt;ref name="MACLEOD39"&gt;MacLeod (2006:39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] says that, regarding valkyries, "evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the [[Völva|seeresses]], who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the [[Black Sea]]". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a "priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61"&gt;Davidson (1990:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson places emphasis on the fact that ''valkyrie'' literally means "chooser of the slain". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a "chooser of the slain" in his ''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos'' sermon, which appears among "a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers", to "all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions", and concludes as those "are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well." Davidson points out that [[Arab]] traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s detailed account of a 10th-century [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] ship funeral on the [[Volga River]] features an "old [[Huns|Hunnish]] woman, massive and grim to look upon" (who Fadlan refers to as the "Angel of Death") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that "it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god "chose" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war." Davidson says that it appears that from "early times" the [[Germanic peoples]] "believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON61-62"&gt;Davidson (1990:61–62).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freyja and Fólkvangr===
[[File:Freya by C. E. Doepler.jpg|thumb|left|''Freya'' (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]]]]
The goddess [[Freyja]] and her afterlife field [[Fólkvangr]], where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in ''Gylfaginning'' where it is said of Freyja "whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain", and interprets ''Fólkvangr'' as "the field of the Warriors". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is [[Sessrumnir]] (which she translates as "filled with many seats"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that "still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'."&lt;ref name="NÄSSTRÖM61"&gt;Näsström (1999:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegfried Andres Dobat comments that "in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar {{Sic}} and the dísir."&lt;ref name="DOBAT186"&gt;Dobat (2006:186).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern art==
[[File:Jugend-magazine-valkyrie-rheingold-advertisement-I.jpg|thumb|upright|A valkyrie examines a bottle of [[Söhnlein]]'s "Rheingold" [[Sparkling wine#Sekt|sekt]] in a 1901 [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] advertisement]]
Valkyries have been the subjects of various poems, works of art and musical works. In poetry, valkyries appear in "''Die Walküren''{{-"}} by H. Heine (appearing in ''Romanzero'', 1847), "''Die Walküren''{{-"}} (1864) by H. v. Linge, and "''Sköldmon''{{-"}} (appearing in ''Gömda Land'', 1904).&lt;ref name="SIMEK349"&gt;Simek (2007:349).&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art depicting valkyries include ''Die Walküren'' (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, ''Reitende Walküre'' ([[fresco]]), previously located in [[Munich]] palace but now destroyed, 1865–66 by M. Echter, ''Valkyrien'' and ''Valkyriens død'' (paintings, both from 1860), ''Walkürenritt'' ([[etching]], 1871) by A. Welti, ''Walkürenritt'' ([[woodcut]], 1871) by T. Pixis, ''Walkürenritt'' (1872) by A. Becker (reproduced in 1873 with the same title by A. v. Heyde), ''Die Walkyren'' ([[charcoal]], 1880) and ''Walkyren wählen und wecken die gefallenen Helden (Einherier), um sie vom Schlachtfield nach Walhall zu geleiten'' (painting, 1882) and ''Walkyrenschlacht'' (oil painting, 1884) by K. Ehrenberg, ''Walkürenritt'' (oil painting, 1888, and etching, 1890) by A. Welti, ''Walküre'' (statue) by H. Günther, ''Walkürenritt'' (oil painting) by H. Hendrich, ''Walkürenritt'' (painting) by F. Leeke, ''Einherier'' (painting, from around 1900), by K. Dielitz, ''The Ride of the Valkyries'' (painting, from around 1900) by J. C. Dollman, ''Valkyrie'' (statue, 1910) and ''Walhalla-freeze'' (located in the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Copenhagen]], 1886–87), ''Walkyrien'' (print, 1915) by A. Kolb, and ''Valkyrier'' (drawing, 1925) by E. Hansen.&lt;ref name="SIMEK349-350"&gt;Simek (2007:349–350).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yahoo Kids.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of Yahoo! Kids website in 2010]]

'''Yahoo! Kids''' (known as '''Yahoo!きっず''' in Japan) is a public [[web portal]] provided by [[Yahoo! Japan]] to find [[age appropriateness|age appropriate]] online content for children between the ages of four and twelve. This site was formerly available in English via [[Yahoo!]], where it was known as '''Yahooligans!''' until December 2006, and in Korean via [[Yahoo! Korea]].

The website is used for both educational and entertainment purposes. It was established in March 1996 by [[Yahoo!]] to give children a venue to find appropriate, safe Internet content. Yahoo! Kids is the oldest online search directory for children.

Yahoo! Kids and other less popular products were discontinued in English on April 30, 2013 and Korean earlier in the year, allowing the company to redirect its resources to mobile applications.

==Reviews==
In August 1996, Greg Mefford of ''The Galveston Daily News'' (later renamed to ''[[The Daily News (Texas)|The Daily News]]'') stated that Yahooligans is "as much fun as it is educational, with links to darn near everything".&lt;ref name="Mefford"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mefford |first=Greg |date=1996-08-04 |page=22 |title=Educational aids aplenty are online |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/876408/the_galveston_daily_news/ |newspaper=[[The Daily News (Texas)|The Daily News]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=2014-08-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RuJ8MUVL?url=http://www.newspapers.com/clippings/downloadClipping/?id=876408 |archivedate=2014-08-18 |deadurl=no |df= }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kokomo Tribune]]'' columnist Amy Irick wrote in January 1998 that Yahooligans! was a "great alternative to the Yahoo! search engine for younger computer users".&lt;ref name="Irick1998-01-19"/&gt; In August 1999, Irick said that Yahooligans! was "very user friendly, just like its parent Yahoo!" and that its teachers' guide is a "must see for teachers".&lt;ref name="Irick1999-08-15"/&gt; ''[[Indiana Gazette]]''{{'}}s John Smathers wrote in June 2002, "I can't mention kids sites without mentioning Yahooligans.com", praising the website as a "great tool to teach kids more about Internet surfing".&lt;ref name="Smathers"/&gt;

In June 2005, reviewer Gail Junion-Metz of the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' praised Yahooligans! Games, writing that it is "[o]ne of the best spots to find kid-appropriate games that don't require downloads".&lt;ref name="Junion-Metz"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Junion-Metz, Gail |date=June 2005 |title=Yahooligans!

In July 2007, reviewer Holly Gunn of ''Teacher Librarian'' praised Yahoo! Kids for its helpful, comprehensible results but criticized it for having an interface filled with too many ads and that was "too busy and filled with too many diversions. Useful material is buried amidst entertainment".&lt;ref name="Gunn"/&gt;

==Closure==
Yahoo!

Kids' closure, Yahoo! Executive Vice president of Platforms Jay Rossiter wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e want to bring you experiences that inspire and entertain you every day. That means taking a hard look at all of our products to make sure they are still central to your daily habits. As part of that ongoing effort, today we are shutting down a few more products.&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharpening our focus – to bring you new Yahoo! products |author=Rossiter, Jay |url=http://yodel.yahoo.com/blogs/general/sharpening-focus-bring-yahoo-products-010032874.html |newspaper= |accessdate=2013-05-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Glj3v7U5?url=http://yodel.yahoo.com/blogs/general/sharpening-focus-bring-yahoo-products-010032874.html |archivedate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He said that Yahoo! would redirect those resources to newer products like email and weather mobile applications.&lt;ref name="MacMillan"/&gt;

Rossiter wrote that Yahoo!'s "youngest users" could continue using the company's services. Children younger than 13 could create a Yahoo! account through Yahoo!'s Family Accounts program. Young users could also find age-appropriate movies through the "Family Movies" section of Yahoo! Movies.&lt;ref name="Rossiter"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8400">'''Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga''' (August 20, 1920 &amp;ndash; May 5, 2006) was a [[Romania]]n comparatist and essayist. A native of the national capital [[Bucharest]], she was educated at [[University of Bucharest|its main university]], going on to become a professor there. Together with a focus on interdisciplinary studies, she was noted for devoting several studies to [[Mihail Eminescu]]. Meanwhile, Dumitrescu was a dignitary of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. Following the [[Romanian Revolution]], after several years spent in Rome, she retired to a monastery.

==Biography==
===Education and academic career===
Born in [[Bucharest]], her parents were Nicolae Dumitrescu, a jurist, and his wife Maria (''née'' Apostol).&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; In her native city, she attended primary school (1927&amp;ndash;1931) and the Central School for Girls (1931&amp;ndash;1939).&lt;ref name="dobre"/&gt; An early lover of music, she was unable to pursue a career in that field due to medical reasons.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; Enrolling in the [[University of Bucharest]], she studied law from 1939 to 1943 and literature from 1944 to 1948, and earned a doctorate in 1970. Also, from 1947 to 1948, around the time a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] was established in her country, she went to the Soviet Union to attend the [[N. A. Dobrolyubova State Linguistic University of Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky Pedagogical Institute]].&lt;ref name="dobre"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florica Dobre (ed.), ''Membrii C. C. al P. C. R.: 1945-1989'', p. 245. Bucharest: Editura Enciclopedică, 2004. {{ISBN|973-45-0486-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumitrescu worked as an editor at Editura de Stat from 1948 to 1949, and at Editura pentru Literatură until 1957. Hired as teaching assistant at her alma mater in 1949, she rose to assistant professor in 1951, associate professor in 1963, full professor in 1971 and began chairing the department of universal and comparative literature in 1975.&lt;ref name="dobre"/&gt; Critic [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], a former student, recalled her courses as being "impressive in their erudition and solemnity, and through a veneration of humanist values visibly at odds with the proletarian egalitarianism promoted by the communist regime".&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;

Having been a researcher there until 1957, she rose to director of the George Călinescu Institute of Literary History and Theory in 1973. She was admitted to the [[Romanian Writers' Union]] in 1963. From 1970 to 1982, she served as vice president of the Social and Political Sciences Academy.&lt;ref name="dobre"/&gt; She was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1974. In 1975, she became president of the Romanian National Committee for Comparative Literature, from 1973 to 1979 was on the executive board of the [[International Comparative Literature Association]], and in 1972 was visiting professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Dumitrescu's rapid ascent in academia drew the ire of [[Elena Ceaușescu]], who eventually decided to halt her progress.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt; She directed two magazines, ''Synthesis'' and ''Revista de istorie și teoria literară''. A comparatist and critic in the Anglo-German mould, her interests included [[interdisciplinarity]] and [[philosophy of culture]]. Among her books were ''Renașterea: Umanismul și dialogul artelor'' (1971), ''Valori și echivalențe umanistice'' (1973), ''Periplu umanistic'' (1980) and ''Itinerarii prin cultură'' (1982). Dumitrescu also initiated and coordinated several syntheses of literary history for the institute she led.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol. I, p. 539. Pitești: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four books she published between 1964 and 1989 closely analyze the works of poet [[Mihail Eminescu]].&lt;ref name="maica"/&gt; A gifted communicator, she spoke widely: before students, in conference halls and on radio and television, emerging as a public intellectual.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;

===Political involvement, later years and legacy===
Dumitrescu joined the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1966, the year after [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] came to power. She was a member of the party's central committee from August 1969 to November 1974.&lt;ref name="dobre"/&gt; She served two terms in the [[Great National Assembly]], representing Bucharest districts both times: from 1975 to 1980 and from 1980 to 1985. She was awarded the Order of 23 August, fourth class; this was followed in 1971 by the Cultural Merit Order, second class; and by the special prize of the Writers' Union in 1986 and 1989. She was granted the [[Order of Cyril and Methodius]] by the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] in 1977, and the following year became a commander of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]. She took the [[Herder Prize]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="dobre"/&gt; In 1990, following the [[Romanian Revolution]], she was elevated to titular membership of the Romanian Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=D Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 1997, she headed the ''[[Accademia di Romania]]'' in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Toma, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/103_viata-romaneasca-12-2015/129_semnal/2306_accademia-di-romania-la-93-de-ani.html "Accademia di Romania, la 93 de ani"], in ''Viața Românească'', nr. 12/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life, beginning around 2000, she spent most of her time at the [[Romanian Orthodox]] [[Văratec Monastery]] and ultimately took the vows of a nun, adopting the name Benedicta.&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maica"/&gt; She had been introduced to the monastery by Valeria, the widow of writer [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], who invited her to spend summers there.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex. Ștefănescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/ce_urt_ne-am_purtat_cu_zoe_dumitrescu-buulenga "Ce urât ne-am purtat cu Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga!"], in ''România Literară'', nr. 19/2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maica"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mădălin Sofronie, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/slobozia/cum-s-a-transformat-criticul-literar-zoe-dumitrescu-busulenga-maica-benedicta-cea-deslusit-misterele-credintei-dumnezeu-1_55cf1a74f5eaafab2c8a2503/index.html "Cum s-a transformat criticul literar Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga în maica Benedicta"], in ''Adevărul'', August 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Dumitrescu was herself a widow,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex. Ștefănescu, [http://www.evz.ro/zoe-dumitrescu-busulenga-a-spus-nu-istoriile-lui-alex-stefanescu.html "Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga a spus NU"], in ''Evenimentul Zilei'', January 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; having married at age 29, and had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Teodora Stanciu, [http://www.romlit.ro/zoe_dumitrescu-buulengaaveam_o_grdin_splendid_n_spatele_casei._acolo_am_trit_pn_la_29_de_ani.

Acolo am trăit până la 29 de ani.'"], in ''România Literară'', nr. 34/2007&lt;/ref&gt; She died in [[Iași]] and was buried at [[Putna Monastery]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; Writing shortly after her death, Ștefănescu claimed that her rapprochement with the regime was motivated by a desire to be left alone, permitted to teach the humanities at home and assert the importance of Romanian culture abroad. He lamented that this stance drew opprobrium in the post-communist period, both from "maniacal vigilantes bereft of a feeling for nuance" and from "poorly educated youths of the sort who deface statues with paint".&lt;ref name="alex"/&gt;
