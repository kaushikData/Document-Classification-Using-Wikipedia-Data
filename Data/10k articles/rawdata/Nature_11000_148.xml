'''Big Bambú''' is a work of [[installation art]] by identical twin artists [[Doug and Mike Starn]]. Variations on the Big Bambu theme have been constructed at several locations around the world. Combining architecture and sculpture, it examines the tension between chaos and order in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/presentation/exhibit/?id=900 The Israel Museum, Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Big Bambú had its first installation in the artists' studio in [[Beacon, New York]].&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/arts/design/12vogel.html See It, Feel It, Touch It, Climb It], Carol Vogel, February 11, 2010, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; From April to October 2010 it was the featured exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art Roof Garden]].&lt;ref name=Vogel/&gt; In 2011 another incarnation of Big Bambú was installed as a collateral exhibition of the 54th [[Venice Biennale|Biennale]] in Venice, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.starnstudio.com/Big%20Bambu%20Venice.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223123832/http://www.starnstudio.com/Big%20Bambu%20Venice.html |archive-date=December 23, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was installed on the Japanese island of [[Teshima]] during the [[Setouchi Triennale]] art festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/tv/journeys/archives20130821.html |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154145/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/tv/journeys/archives20130821.html |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was presented in the [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/bigbambu/en/ |title=Big Bambú &amp;#124; Doug + Mike Starn at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem |publisher=Imj.org.il |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Big Bambú is made of thousands of [[bamboo]] poles, lashed together to form a complex structure through which visitors walk on elevated bamboo paths even as a crew continues to build a new part of the structure.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/be_part_of_the_art_gwmSzdr5mrb0JVAkGqOlfO Be a part of the art; Sculpture you can walk through], Barbara Hoffman and Calla Salinger, ''New York Post'', June 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2010/06/04/03004-20100604ARTFIG00393-une-jungle-de-bambous-sur-le-toit-du-met.php Une jungle de bambous sur le toit du Met], Adèle Smith, ''Le Figaro'', June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is taken from the [[Cheech &amp; Chong]] album ''[[Big Bambu]]''&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;[http://www.nyc-arts.org/events/7919/doug-mike-starn-on-the-roof-big-bambu Doug + Mike Starn on the Roof: Big Bambu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124414/http://www.nyc-arts.org/events/7919/doug-mike-starn-on-the-roof-big-bambu |date=October 6, 2014 }}, NYC Arts, The Complete Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original installation in the artists studio in Beacon, New York, Big Bambú is in continual motion as a crew disassembles one end and continues to build the other end.&lt;ref name=Haseltine&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2009/05/a-day-of-art-along-the-hudson/18218/ A Day of Art Along the Hudson], William Haseltine, ''The Atlantic'', May 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was reconfigured into a gothic letter "T" to be photographed for the cover of the fifth anniversary edition of the ''[[New York Times]]'' style magazine.&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/now-showing-the-making-of-the-starn-brothers-t/ Now Showing | The Making of The Starn Brothers ‘T’], Alix Browne.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metropolitan Museum installation==
The installation on the roof of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was conceived as a giant wave cresting over the rooftop.&lt;ref name=siew&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48015420100426 "Living" bamboo sculpture opens at Met rooftop garden], Walden Siew, Reuters, April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/7636985/Big-Bambu-Met-visitors-climb-on-bamboo-exhibit-in-NY.html Big Bambu: Met visitors climb on bamboo exhibit in NY], ''The Telegraph'', April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Karen Wilkin]] wrote that the experience of walking on the roof terrace under the sculpture felt like "wandering through a bamboo grove."&lt;ref name=Wilkin&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704302304575214351111410626 Branching Out Atop the Met Museum With 'Big Bambú', Doug and Mike Starn Have Erected a Surrogate Forest, At Once Artificial and Natural], ''The Wall Street Journal'', Karen Wilkin, May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She described the piece as not a "significant sculpture... it's more of a phenomenon. But it's a delightful addition to the Met for the next six months—a temporary, ecologically correct folly designed to entertain."&lt;ref name=Wilkin/&gt;

Big Bambú is built of several types of bamboo, primarily a Japanese type called Madake, and also thin Meyeri bamboo and thick moso bamboo.  All of the bamboo was grown in Georgia and South Carolina.&lt;ref name=siew/&gt; The construction was undertaken by the artists working together with a team of twenty qualified rock climbers.&lt;ref name=Metropolitan&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/19639/6185/124295/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york/exhibition/big-bambu/press_release/ Big Bambu; April 27, 2010 – October 31, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703221243/http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/19639/6185/124295/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york/exhibition/big-bambu/press_release/ |date=July 3, 2010 }}, ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Press Release'',&lt;/ref&gt; Construction continued throughout the exhibition's six-month run, with the sculpture ultimately reaching 100 feet long, 50 feet wide, 50 feet high and using 3,200 bamboo poles.&lt;ref name=Metropolitan/&gt; Museum visitors were required to wear rubber-soled, close-toed shoes to climb through the structure.   Visitors could walk underneath the sculpture without obtaining a ticket and with no restriction on footwear.&lt;ref name=Metropolitan/&gt;

==Israel Museum installation==
''Big Bambu: 5000 arms to hold you'', constructed in the sculpture garden of the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 2014, is 16 meters (52.5 feet) high and covers an area of over 700 square meters (7,500 square feet). Visitors are invited to climb on the framework of 10,000 bamboo poles bound by rope, which forms a labyrinth of winding paths and offers panoramic views of the Jerusalem cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/art/starn-brothers-big-bambu-installation-jerusalem-06-17-2014/Starn|title=starn brothers build-up monumental big bambu installation in jerusalem|work=designboom – architecture &amp; design magazine|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordrupgård Museum, Denmark==
In 2018 a ''Big Bambú'' installation was made at [[Ordrupgård Museum]] in Denmark.

The '''Burdigalian''' is, in the [[geologic timescale]], an [[age (geology)|age]] or [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the early [[Miocene]]. It spans the time  between 20.43 ± 0.05 [[annum|Ma]] and 15.97 ± 0.05 Ma (million years ago). Preceded by the [[Aquitanian (stage)|Aquitanian]], the Burdigalian was the first and longest warming period of the Miocene&lt;ref&gt;Edward Petuch, Ph.D. Florida Atlantic University, Department of Geosciences.{{cite web |url=http://www.geology.fau.edu/people/petuch.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620072033/http://www.geology.fau.edu/people/petuch.html |archivedate=2010-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is succeeded by the [[Langhian]].

==Stratigraphic definition==
The name Burdigalian comes from ''Burdigala'', the [[Latin]] name for the city of [[Bordeaux]], [[France]]. The Burdigalian stage was introduced in scientific literature by [[Charles Depéret]] in 1892.

The base of the Burdigalian is at the first appearance of [[foram]] species ''Globigerinoides altiaperturus'' and the top of magnetic chronozone C6An. {{As of|2016}}, an official [[GSSP]] for the Burdigalian had not yet been assigned.

The top of the Burdigalian (the base of the Langhian) is defined by the first appearance of foram species ''Praeorbulina glomerosa'' and is also coeval with the top of magnetic chronozone C5Cn.1n. 

==Paleontology==
Famous Burdigalian [[palaeontology|palaeontologic]] localities include the [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen in [[Germany]] and the [[Dominican amber]] deposits of [[Hispaniola]].

Possible human evolutionary ancestors such as [[Victoriapithecus]] evolved during this time interval.

The '''Central Powers''' ({{lang-de|Mittelmächte}}; {{lang-hu|Központi hatalmak}}; {{lang-tr|İttifak Devletleri}} / {{lang|tr|Bağlaşma Devletleri}}; {{lang-bg|Централни сили|translit=Tsentralni sili}}), consisting of [[German Empire|Germany]], {{nowrap|[[Austria-Hungary]]}}, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]—hence also known as the '''Quadruple Alliance'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/outofmylife00hinduoft|title=Out of my life|author=Hindenburg, Paul von|work=Internet Archive | page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Vierbund}})—was one of the two main coalitions that fought [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] (1914–18).

It faced and was defeated by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] that had formed around the [[Triple Entente]]. The Powers' origin was the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1879]]. Despite having joined the alliance before, Italy refused to take part in World War I on the side of the Central Powers; the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria did not join until after World War I had begun, even though the Ottoman Empire had retained close relations with both Germany and Austria-Hungary since the beginning of the 20th century.

== Member states ==
The Central Powers consisted of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the beginning of the war. The [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers later in 1914. In 1915, the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] joined the alliance. The name "Central Powers" is derived from the location of these countries; all four (including the other groups that supported them except for [[Finland]] and [[Lithuania]]) were located between the [[Russian Empire]] in the east and [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in the west. Finland, [[Azerbaijan]], and Lithuania joined them in 1918 before the war ended and after the Russian Empire collapsed.

In early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] and the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russian intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place.&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P57"&gt;Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2007. P57&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia enacted a [[general mobilization]], Germany viewed the act as provocative.&lt;ref name="Meyer, G.J 1918. P39"&gt;Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian government promised Germany that its general mobilization did not mean preparation for war with Germany but was a reaction to the events between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.&lt;ref name="Meyer, G.J 1918. P39" /&gt; The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany, in turn, mobilized for war.&lt;ref name="Meyer, G.J 1918. P39" /&gt; On 1 August, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Meyer, G.J 1918. P95"&gt;Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P95.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization.&lt;ref name="Meyer, G.J 1918. P95" /&gt;

In August 1914, Germany waged war on Russia, the German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, William W. German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation. P228.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer C. A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East. ABC-CLIO. 2009. P1556.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, facing a two-front war, enacted what was known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], that involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan was hoped to quickly gain victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] that both nations signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged.

Subsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916, the [[United States]] declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917 and [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] declaring war on Germany in July 1917.

==== Colonies and dependencies ====
{{Main|German colonial empire}}
; Europe
Upon its founding in 1871, the German Empire controlled [[Alsace-Lorraine]] as an "imperial territory" incorporated from France after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was held as part of Germany's sovereign territory.

; Africa
Germany held multiple African colonies at the time of World War I. All of Germany's African colonies were invaded and occupied by Allied forces during the war.

[[Kamerun|Cameroon]], [[German East Africa]], and [[German Southwest Africa]] were German colonies in Africa. [[Togoland]] was a German protectorate in Africa.

; Asia

The [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] was a German dependency in East Asia leased from China in 1898. It was occupied by Japanese forces following the [[Siege of Tsingtao]].

; Pacific

[[German New Guinea]] was a German protectorate in the Pacific. It was occupied by Australian forces in 1914.

[[German Samoa]] was a German protectorate following the [[Tripartite Convention]]. It was [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in 1914.

=== Austria-Hungary ===
{{Main|Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I|Austria-Hungary}}

[[File:Austrian troops marching up Mt. Zion, 1916.JPG|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers marching up [[Mount Zion]] in [[Jerusalem]] in the Ottoman Empire, during the Middle Eastern campaign.]]

==== War justifications ====
Austria-Hungary regarded the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] as being orchestrated with the assistance of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P57" /&gt; The country viewed the assassination as setting a dangerous precedent of encouraging the country's [[South Slavs|South Slav]] population to rebel and threaten to tear apart the multinational country.&lt;ref name="Meyer, G.J 1918. P39" /&gt; Austria-Hungary formally sent an ultimatum to Serbia demanding a full-scale investigation of Serbian government complicity in the assassination, and complete compliance by Serbia in agreeing to the terms demanded by Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P57" /&gt; Serbia submitted to accept most of the demands, however Austria-Hungary viewed this as insufficient and used this lack of full compliance to justify military intervention.&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P61"&gt;Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2007. P61&lt;/ref&gt; These demands have been viewed as a diplomatic cover for what was going to be an inevitable Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia.&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P61" /&gt;

Austria-Hungary had been warned by Russia that the Russian government would not tolerate Austria-Hungary crushing Serbia.&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P61" /&gt; However, with Germany supporting Austria-Hungary's actions, the Austro-Hungarian government hoped that Russia would not intervene and that the conflict with Serbia would be a regional conflict.&lt;ref name="Cashman, Greg 2007. P57" /&gt;

Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia resulted in Russia declaring war on the country and Germany in turn declared war on Russia, setting off the beginning of the clash of alliances that resulted in the World War.

; Territory
Austria-Hungary was internally divided into two states with their own governments, joined in communion through the Habsburg throne. Austrian [[Cisleithania]] contained various duchies and principalities but also the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. Hungarian [[Transleithania]] comprised the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] sovereign authority was shared by both Austria and Hungary.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}

==== War justifications ====
The Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire had gained strong economic connections with Germany through the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway project that was still incomplete at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Michael. The First World War: Volume 4 The Mediterranean Front 1914–1923. P31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire made a formal alliance with Germany signed on 2 August 1914.&lt;ref name="Afflerbach, Holger 2012. P. 292"&gt;Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David. An Improbable War: The Outbreak of World War 1 and European Political Culture. Berghan Books. 2012. P. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance treaty expected that the Ottoman Empire would become involved in the conflict in a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Afflerbach, Holger 2012. P. 292" /&gt; However, for the first several months of the war the Ottoman Empire maintained neutrality though it allowed a German naval squadron to enter and stay near the strait of [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref name="Kent, Mary 1998. P119"&gt;Kent, Mary. The Great Powers and the End of the Ottoman Empire. end ed. Frank Cass. 1998. P119&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman officials informed the German government that the country needed time to prepare for conflict.&lt;ref name="Kent, Mary 1998. P119" /&gt; Germany provided financial aid and weapons shipments to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Afflerbach, Holger 2012. P. 292" /&gt;

After pressure escalated from the German government demanding that the Ottoman Empire fulfill its treaty obligations, or else Germany would expel the country from the alliance and terminate economic and military assistance, the Ottoman government entered the war with the recently acquired cruisers from Germany, the ''[[SMS Goeben|Yavuz Sultan Selim]]'' (formerly ''SMS Goeben'') and the ''[[SMS Breslau|Midilli]]'' (formerly ''SMS Breslau'') launching a naval raid on the Russian port of [[Odessa]], thus engaging in a military action in accordance with its alliance obligations with Germany. [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the Triple Entente declared war on the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David.

Bulgaria was still resentful after its [[Second Balkan War|defeat]] in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia, [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. It signed [[Ottoman–Bulgarian alliance|a treaty of defensive alliance]] with the Ottoman Empire on 19 August 1914. It was the last country to join the Central Powers, which Bulgaria did in October 1915 by declaring war on Serbia. It invaded Serbia in conjunction with [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian forces]]. Bulgaria held claims on the region of [[Vardar Macedonia]] then held by Serbia following the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913 and (from the Bulgarian point of view), the costly [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Richard C.|title=Bulgaria in the First World War|url=http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/arc/bulgaria.shtml|website=Russia's Great War and Revolution|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition of entering WW1 on the side of the Central Powers, Bulgaria was granted the right to reclaim that territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jelavich|first1=Charles|last2=Jelavich|first2=Barbara|title=The establishment of the Balkan national states, 1804–1920|date=1986|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-96413-3|pages=284–297|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard C.

The [[Dervish State|Dervish movement]] was a rebel Somali movement led by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] seeking independence of Somali territories. Dervish forces fought against Italian and British forces in [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] during [[World War I]] in the [[Somaliland Campaign]]. The Dervish movement received support from Germany and the Ottoman Empire. It also briefly received support by the [[Ethiopian Empire]] from 1915–1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mukhtar|first1=Mohammed|title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia|date=25 February 2003|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=126|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=iyasu+dervish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJjrCxr7LSAhVG4YMKHTEkDgwQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iyasu%20dervish&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{flagicon image|Flag of Transvaal.svg}} South African Republic ===
In opposition to the [[Union of South Africa]], which had joined the war, [[Boer]] rebels founded the [[South African Republic (1914–15)|South African Republic]] in 1914 and engaged in the [[Maritz Rebellion]]. Germany assisted the rebels, and the rebels operated in and out of the German colony of [[German South-West Africa]]. The rebels were defeated by British imperial forces.

The [[Sultanate of Darfur]] forces fought against British forces in [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] during [[World War I]] in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition]].

== Client states ==
During 1917 and 1918, the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finns]] under [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] and [[Lithuania]]n nationalists fought Russia for a [[Co-belligerence|common cause]]. With the Bolshevik [[Ukrainian–Soviet War|attack]] of late 1917, the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine]] sought military protection first from the Central Powers and later from the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|armed forces of the Entente]].

The Ottoman Empire also had its own allies in [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]] and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus|Northern Caucasus]]. The three nations fought alongside each other under the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]] in the [[Battle of Baku]].

Soon after [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded the republic and quickly reached [[Borjomi]]. This forced Georgia to ask for help from [[Germany]] which they were granted. Germany forced the Ottomans to withdraw from Georgian territories and recognize Georgian soverignty. Germany, Georgia and the Ottomans signed a peace treaty, the [[Treaty of Batum]] which ended the conflict with the last two. in return Georgia become a German "ally". This time period of Georgian-German friendship was known as [[German Caucasus expedition]].

== Controversial cases ==
States listed in this section were not officially members of the Central Powers, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Central Powers members on level that makes their neutrality disputable.

=== {{flagicon image|Flag of Ethiopia (1897-1936; 1941-1974).svg}} Ethiopia ===
[[File:Iyasu in a Muslim Turban.png|thumb|upright|[[Iyasu V|Lij Iyasu]], ruler of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] until 1916 pictured in his Ottoman-style turban]]
The [[Ethiopian Empire]] was officially neutral throughout World War I but widely suspected of sympathy for the Central Powers between 1915 and 1916. At the time, Ethiopia was one of the few independent states in Africa and a major power in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Its ruler, [[Iyasu V|Lij Iyasu]], was widely suspected of harbouring pro-Islamic sentiments and being sympathetic to the Ottoman Empire. The German Empire also attempted to reach out to Iyasu, dispatching several unsuccessful expeditions to the region to attempt to encourage it to collaborate in an [[Arab Revolt]]-style uprising in East Africa. One of the unsuccessful expeditions was led by [[Leo Frobenius]], a celebrated ethnographer and personal friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Under Iyasu's directions, Ethiopia probably supplied weapons to the Muslim Dervish rebels during the [[Somaliland Campaign]] of 1915 to 1916, indirectly helping the Central Powers' cause.&lt;ref name=EthiopiaBBC&gt;{{cite news |title=How Ethiopian prince scuppered Germany's WW1 plans |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-37428682 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fearing the rising influence of Iyasu and the Ottoman Empire, the Christian nobles of Ethiopia conspired against Iyasu over 1915. Iyasu was first excommunicated by the [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Ethiopian Orthodox Patriarch]] and eventually deposed in a coup d'état on 27 September 1916. A less pro-Ottoman regent was installed on the throne.&lt;ref name=EthiopiaBBC/&gt;

== Non-state combatants ==

Other movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons, such as the radical [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Irish Nationalists]] who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] in April 1916; they referred to their "gallant allies in Europe". However, the majority of Irish Nationalists supported the British and allied war effort up until 1916 when the Irish political landscape was changing. In 1914, [[Józef Piłsudski]] was permitted by Germany and Austria-Hungary to form independent [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]]. Piłsudski wanted his legions to help the Central Powers defeat Russia and then side with France and the UK and win the war with them.

A '''cloud forest''', also called a '''water forest''', is a generally [[tropical]] or [[subtropical]], evergreen, [[Montane forest|montane]], [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist forest]] characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level [[cloud]] cover, usually at the canopy level, formally described in the [[International Cloud Atlas]] (2017) as '''silvagenitus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of [[moss]]es covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as '''mossy forests'''. Mossy forests usually develop on the [[mountain pass|saddles]] of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.{{sfn|Clarke|1997|p=29}}

== Distribution and climate ==
[[Image:costa rica santa elena skywalk.jpg|thumb|300px|left|One of the hanging bridges of the Sky walk at the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] in [[Monteverde, Costa Rica]] disappearing into the clouds]]
Dependent on local climate, which is affected by the distance to the sea, the exposition and the latitude (from 23°N to 25°S), the altitude varies from 500 m to 4000 m above sea level. Typically, there is a relatively small band of altitude in which the atmospheric environment is suitable for cloud forest development. This is characterized by persistent fog at the vegetation level, resulting in the reduction of direct sunlight and thus of [[evapotranspiration]].{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}} Within cloud forests, much of the moisture available to plants arrives in the form of [[fog drip]], where [[fog]] [[condensation|condenses]] on tree leaves and then drips onto the ground below.

Annual rainfall can range from 500 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;mm/year and mean temperature between 8 and 20&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}

While cloud forest today is the most widely used term, in some regions, these ecosystems or special types of cloud forests are called mossy forest, [[elfin forest]], montane thicket, and dwarf cloud forest.{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}

The definition of cloud forest can be ambiguous, with many countries not using the term (preferring such terms as [[Afromontane]] forest and upper montane rain forest, montane [[laurel forest]], or more localised terms such as the Bolivian ''[[yungas]]'', and the ''[[laurisilva]]'' of the Atlantic Islands),{{sfn|García-Santos|Bruijnzeel|Dolman|2009}}{{sfn|García-Santos|2007|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} and occasionally subtropical and even temperate forests in which similar meteorological conditions occur are considered to be cloud forests.

Only 1% of the global woodland consists of cloud forests.{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}

Important areas of cloud forest are in Central and [[South America]], East and Central Africa, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua-New Guinea, and in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/forest/cloudforest/|title=Resources Data - UNEP-WCMC|work=unep-wcmc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:Papillaria Cloudforest-Mt Budawang.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Hanging moss in a cool temperate rainforest at [[Budawang National Park]], [[Australia]]]]
In comparison with lower tropical moist forests, cloud forests show a reduced tree stature combined with increased stem density and generally the lower diversity of woody plants.{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}} Trees in these regions are generally shorter and more heavily stemmed than in lower-altitude forests in the same regions, often with gnarled trunks and branches, forming dense, compact crowns. Their leaves become smaller, thicker and harder with increasing altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bruijnzeel|Proctor|1995}} quote from {{harvnb|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high moisture promotes the development of a high [[biomass]] and [[biodiversity]] of [[epiphyte]], particularly [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[fern]]s (including [[filmy ferns]]), [[bromeliads]] and [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}} The number of [[Endemism|endemic]] plants can be very high.{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}

An important feature of cloud forests is the tree crowns can intercept the wind-driven cloud moisture, part of which drips to the ground. This [[fog drip]] occurs when water droplets from the fog adhere to the needles or leaves of trees or other objects, coalesce into larger drops and then drop to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fog drip - AMS Glossary |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Fog_drip |accessdate=2014-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be an important contribution to the [[hydrologic cycle]].{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}

Due to the high water content of the soil, the reduced [[solar radiation]] and the low rates of [[decomposition]] and [[mineralization (soil)|mineralization]], the [[soil acidity]] is very high,{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}{{sfn|van Steenis|1972|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}{{sfn|Grubb|Tanner|1976}} with more humus and [[peat]] often forming the upper soil layer.{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}

Stadtmüller (1987) distinguishes two general types of tropical montane cloud forests:
* Areas with a high annual precipitation due to a frequent cloud cover in combination with heavy and sometimes persistent orographic rainfall; such forests have a perceptible canopy strata, a high number of epiphytes, and a thick peat layer which has a high storage capacity for water and controls the runoff;
* In drier areas with mainly seasonal rainfall, cloud stripping can amount to a large proportion of the moisture available to plants.

== Temperate cloud forests ==
Although far from being universally accepted as true cloud forests, several forests in temperate regions have strong similarities with tropical cloud forests. The term is further confused by occasional reference to cloud forests in tropical countries as "temperate" due to the cooler climate associated with these misty forests.

== Importance ==
[[Image:DirkvdM cloudforest.jpg|thumb|250px|At the edge of the Panamanian side of the [[Parque Internacional la Amistad]]]]
* Watershed function: Because of the cloud-stripping strategy, the effective rainfall can be doubled in dry seasons and increase the wet season rainfall by about 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vogelmann|1973}} and {{harvnb|Bruijnzeel|1990|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} quote by {{harvnb|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|García-Santos|2007|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} Experiments of Costin and Wimbush (1961){{psc|date=December 2017}} showed that the tree canopies of non-cloud forests intercept and evaporate 20 percent more of the precipitation than cloud forests, which means a loss to the land component of the hydrological cycle.{{fact|date=December 2017}}
* Vegetation: Tropical montane cloud forests are not as species-rich as tropical lowland forests, but they provide the habitats for many species found nowhere else.{{sfn|Bruijnzeel|Hamilton|2000|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}{{sfn|García-Santos|2007|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} For example, the [[Cerro de la Neblina]], a cloud-covered mountain in the south of [[Venezuela]], accommodates many shrubs, orchids, and [[insectivorous]] plants which are restricted to this mountain only.{{sfn|Bruijnzeel|Hamilton|2000|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}
* Fauna: The endemism in animals is also very high. In [[Peru]], more than one-third of the 270 endemic birds, mammals, and frogs are found in cloud forests.{{sfn|Bruijnzeel|Hamilton|2000|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} One of the best-known cloud forest mammals is the [[mountain gorilla]] (''Gorilla b. beringei''). Many of those endemic animals have important functions, such as seed dispersal and forest dynamics in these ecosystems.{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}

== Current situation ==
[[Image:Nimbosilva de Fray Jorge.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Seaborne moisture is vital to the cloud forest of [[Bosque de Fray Jorge National Park|Fray Jorge]] that is surrounded by the arid southern reaches of the [[Atacama Desert]].]]
In 1970, the original extent of cloud forests on the Earth was around 50 million [[hectare]]s. [[Population growth]], [[poverty]] and uncontrolled land use have contributed to the loss of cloud forests. The 1990 Global Forest Survey found that 1.1% of tropical mountain and highland forests were lost each year, which was higher than in any other tropical forests.{{sfn|Bruijnzeel|Hamilton|2000|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} In Colombia, one of the countries with the largest area of cloud forests, only 10–20% of the initial cloud forest cover remains.{{sfn|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} Significant areas have been converted to [[plantation]]s, or for use in [[agriculture]] and [[pasture]]. Significant crops in montane forest zones include [[tea]] and [[coffee]], and the [[logging]] of unique species causes changes to the forest structure.{{sfn|Hamilton|Juvik|Scatena|1995}}

In 2004, an estimated one-third of all cloud forests on the planet were protected at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kappelle|2004}} quote by {{harvnb|Häger|2006|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of climate change==
Because of their delicate dependency on local climates, cloud forests will be strongly affected by global [[climate change]]. Results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70 years.{{sfn|Ponce-Reyes|Nicholson|Baxter|Fuller|2013}} A number of climate models suggest low-altitude cloudiness will be reduced, which means the optimum climate for many cloud forest habitats will increase in altitude.{{sfn|Foster|2001}}{{sfn|Bubb|May|Miles|Sayer|2004|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} Linked to the reduction of cloud moisture immersion and increasing temperature, the hydrological cycle will change, so the system will dry out.{{sfn|Bubb|May|Miles|Sayer|2004|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} This would lead to the wilting and the death of epiphytes, which rely on high humidity.{{sfn|Foster|2001}} Frogs and lizards are expected to suffer from increased drought.{{sfn|Bubb|May|Miles|Sayer|2004|p={{pn|date=December 2017}}}} Calculations suggest the loss of cloud forest in Mexico would lead to extinction of up to 37 [[vertebrates]] specific to that region.{{sfn|Ponce-Reyes|Reynoso-Rosales|Watson|Vanderwal|2012}} In addition, climate changes can result in a higher number of [[hurricane]]s, which may increase damage to tropical montane cloud forests. All in all, the results of climate change will be a loss in biodiversity, altitude shifts in species ranges and community reshuffling, and, in some areas, complete loss of cloud forests.{{sfn|Foster|2001}}

== In botanical gardens ==
Cloud-forest conditions are hard and expensive to replicate in a glasshouse because it is necessary to maintain a very high humidity. This is usually expensive as a high temperature must usually be maintained as well, and a high temperature combined with high humidity calls for good air circulation or else [[fungi]] and [[algae]] will develop. Such displays usually are quite small, but there are some notable exceptions. For many years, the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]] have a so-called coolhouse, whereas the newly opened (2012) [[Gardens by the Bay]] feature a very big {{convert|0.8|ha}} coolhouse that is simply named "[[Gardens by the Bay#Cloud Forest|Cloud Forest]]". The latter features a {{convert|35|m|adj=on}}-high artificial mountain clad in [[epiphyte]]s such as [[orchid]]s, ferns, [[clubmoss]]es, [[bromeliad]]s and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/attractions/cloud-forest/facts-and-figures.html|title=Cloud Forest Facts and Figures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''Cold-hardy citrus''' is [[citrus]] with increased [[frost]] tolerance and which may be cultivated far beyond traditional citrus growing regions. Citrus [[species]] and [[citrus hybrids]] typically described as cold-hardy generally display an ability to withstand wintertime temperatures below {{convert|-5|to|-10|°C|°F}}. Cold-[[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] citrus may be generally accepted 'true' species (e.g. [[Satsuma mandarin]], [[Kumquat]]) or hybrids (e.g. [[Citrange]]) involving various other citrus species.  All citrus fruits are technically edible, though some have bitter flavors often regarded as unpleasant, and this variability is also seen in cold-hardy citrus fruits. Those listed as "inedible fresh" or "semi-edible" can (like all citrus) be cooked to make [[marmalade]].

[[File:Dead Stream Swamp MI.jpg|thumb|Dead Stream Swamp, [[Michigan]]: a northern white cedar swamp]]

'''Coniferous swamps''' are forested [[wetland]]s in which the dominant trees are lowland [[conifers]] such as northern white cedar (''[[Thuja occidentalis]]'').  The soil in these swamp areas is typically saturated for most of the growing season and is occasionally inundated by seasonal storms or by winter snow melt. 

The substrate is usually organic in nature and may contain [[peat]] in varying amounts or be composed entirely of [[hydric soil|muck]].  The swamp substrate is typically nutrient-rich and neutral to [[alkaline]] but can be [[acidic]] and nutrient-poor. 

Coniferous swamps vary in composition, with different species of conifer dominating, and varying amounts of deciduous hardwoods growing within the swamp.  A wide diversity of plants is represented within the swamps, with certain species dominating in a variety of [[microhabitat]]s dependent on factors such as available sunlight (as in cases of trees downed by wind or disease), soil Ph, standing groundwater, and differences of elevation within the swamp such as [[tussock (grass)|tussock]]s and [[nurse log]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota's St. Croix River Valley and Anoka sandplain:...

The different types of coniferous swamps are referred to{{by whom?|date=April 2015}} according to their dominant trees.  ''Rich conifer swamp'' is dominated by Northern white-cedar and typically occurs south of the climatic [[tension zone]] throughout the [[Midwest]] and northeastern United States and adjacent areas in Canada.  North of the climatic tension zone, tamarack (''[[Larix laricina]]'') is the dominant species of conifer in [[minerotrophic]] wetlands classified as ''rich tamarack swamp''.  A roughly equal mix of hardwood trees and conifers is known as a ''hardwood-conifer swamp''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15885">'''Criteria air Pollutants''' (CAP), or '''criteria pollutants''', are a set of [[air pollution|air pollutants]] that cause [[smog]], [[acid rain]], and other health hazards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants|title=Criteria Air Pollutants {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. CAPs are typically emitted from many sources in [[industry]], [[mining]], [[transportation]], [[electricity generation]] and [[agriculture]]. In many cases they are the products of the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuels]] or industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/ard/documents/ard-41.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==

The six criteria air pollutants were the first set of pollutants recognized by the [[United States]] [[Environmental Protection Agency]] as needing standards on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan Department Of Environmental Quality, January 2004. What is an Air Contaminant Pollutant? Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set US [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) for the six CAPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/air/criteria.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202082735/http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html |archivedate=2011-02-02 |df= }} US EPA&lt;/ref&gt; The NAAQS are health based and the EPA sets two types of standards: primary and secondary. The primary standards are designed to protect the health of 'sensitive' populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly.  The secondary standards are concerned with protecting the environment.  They are designed to address visibility, damage to crops, vegetation, buildings, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210101749/http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html |archivedate=2010-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections 108 and 109 of the U.S. Clean Air Act==

The EPA established the NAAQS according to Sections 108 and 109 of the U.S. Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ttnnaaqs/&lt;/ref&gt; These sections require the EPA "(1) to list widespread air pollutants that reasonably may be expected to endanger public health or welfare; (2) to issue air quality criteria for them that assess the latest available scientific information on nature and effects of ambient exposure to them; (3) to set primary NAAQS to protect human health with adequate margin of safety and to set secondary NAAQS to protect against welfare effects (e.g., effects on vegetation, ecosystems, visibility, climate, manmade materials, etc); and (5) to periodically review and revise, as appropriate, the criteria and NAAQS for a given listed pollutant or class of pollutants."&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=158823&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six Criteria Air Pollutants==
# [[Tropospheric Ozone|Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): Ozone found on the surface-level, also known as tropospheric ozone is also regulated by the NAAQS under the Clean Air Act.  Ozone was originally found to be damaging to grapes in the 1950s.  The US EPA set "oxidants" standards in 1971, which included ozone.  These standards were created to reduce agricultural impacts and other related damages.  Like lead, ozone requires a reexamination of new findings of health and vegetation effects periodically.  This aspect necessitated the creation of a US EPA criteria document.  Further analysis done in 1979 and 1997 made it necessary to significantly modify the pollution standards
#
# [[Atmospheric particulate matter]]
#* PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, coarse particles: 2.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (μm) to 10 μm in size (although current implementation includes all particles 10 μm or less in the standard)
#* PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, fine particles: 2.5 μm in size or less. Particulate Matter (PM) was listed in the 1996 Criteria document issued by the EPA.  In April 2001, the EPA created a Second External Review Draft of the Air Quality Criteria for PM, which addressed updated studies done on particulate matter and the modified pollutant standards done since the First External Review Draft.  In May 2002, a Third External Review Draft was made, and the EPA revised PM requirements again.  After issuing a fourth version of the document, the EPA issued the final version in October 2004.
#
# [[Lead]] (Pb): In the mid-1970s, lead was listed as a criteria air pollutant that required NAAQS regulation.  In 1977, the EPA published a document which detailed the Air Quality Criteria for lead.  This document was based on the scientific assessments of lead at the time.  Based on this report (1977 Lead AQCD), the EPA established a "1.5 µg/m3 (maximum quarterly calendar average) Pb NAAQS in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=158823.&lt;/ref&gt;" The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of NAAQS, and new scientific data published after 1977 made it necessary to revise the standards previously established in the 1977 Lead AQCD document.  An Addendum to the document was published in 1986 and then again as a Supplement to the 1986 AQCD/Addendum in 1990. In 1990, a Lead Staff Paper was prepared by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OPQPS), which was based on information presented in the 1986 Lead/AQCD/Addendum and 1990 Supplement, in addition to other OAQPS sponsored lead exposure/risk analyses.  In this paper, it was proposed that the Pb NAAQS be revised further and presented options for revision to the EPA.  The EPA elected to not modify the Pb NAAQS further, but decided to instead focus on the 1991 U.S. EPA Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposure.  The EPA concentrated on regulatory and remedial clean-up efforts to minimize Pb exposure from numerous non-air sources that caused more severe public health risks, and undertook actions to reduce air emissions.
#
# [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO): The EPA set the first NAAQS for carbon monoxide in 1971.  The primary standard was set at 9 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period and 35 ppm over a 1-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/carbonmonoxide/.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of CO emitted into the ambient air is from mobile sources.  The EPA has reviewed and assessed the current scientific literature with respect to CO in 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ncea/pdfs/coaqcd.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; After the review in 1984 the EPA decided to remove the secondary standard for CO due to lack of significant evidence of the adverse environmental impacts. On January 28, 2011 the EPA decided that the current NAAQS for CO were sufficient and proposed to keep the existing standards as they stood. The EPA is strengthening monitoring requirements for CO by calling for CO monitors to be placed in strategic locations near large urban areas. Specifically, the EPA has called for monitors to be placed and operational in CBSA's (core based statistical areas) with populations over 2.5 million by January 1, 2015; and in CBSA's with populations of 1 million or more by January 1, 2017. In addition they are requiring the collocation of CO monitors with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors in urban areas having a population of 1 million for more.  As of May 2011 there were approximately 328 operational CO monitors in place nationwide.  The EPA has provided some authority to the EPA Regional Administrators to oversee case-by-case requested exceptions and in determining the need for additional monitoring systems above the minimum required.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/carbonmonoxide/pdfs/COFactSheet.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA reports the national average concentration of CO has decreased by 82% since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/carbon.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last nonattainment designation was deemed in attainment on September 27, 2010.  Currently all areas in the US are in attainment.&lt;ref name="CO"/&gt;
#
# [[Sulfur oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;): SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the oxides of sulfur, a highly reactive group of gases.  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is of greatest interest and is used as the indicator for the entire SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; family. The EPA first set primary and secondary standards in 1971.  Dual primary standards were set at 140 ppb averaged over a 24-hour period, and at 30 ppb averaged annually.  The secondary standard was set at 500 ppb averaged over a 3-hour period, not to be exceeded more than once a year.  The most recent review took place in 1996 during which the EPA considered implementing a new NAAQS for 5-minute peaks of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affecting sensitive populations such as asthmatics.  The Agency did not establish this new NAAQS and kept the existing standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the EPA decided to replace the dual primary standards with a new 1-hour standard set at 75 ppb.  On March 20, 2012 the EPA "took final action" to maintain the existing NAAQS as they stood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/pdfs/20120320factsheet.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three monitoring sites have exceeded the current NAAQS for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, all of which are located in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.  The violations occurred between 2007-2008 and the state of Hawaii suggested these should be exempt from regulatory actions due to an 'exceptional event' (volcanic activity).  Since 1980 the national concentration of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the ambient air has decreased by 83%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/sulfur.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual average concentrations hover between 1-6 ppb.  Currently all ACQR's are in attainment for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/basic.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
# [[Nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;): The EPA first set primary and secondary standards for the oxides of nitrogen in 1971.  Among these are nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), all of which are covered in the NAAQS.  NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the oxide measured and used as the indicator for the entire NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; family as it is of the most concern due to its quick formation and contribution to the formation of harmful ground level ozone.&lt;ref name="airqualityNO"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/nitrogenoxides/.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 the primary and secondary NAAQS for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were both set at an annual average of 0.053 ppm.  The EPA reviewed this NAAQS in 1985 and 1996, and in both cases concluded that the existing standard was sufficient.  The most recent review by the EPA occurred in 2010, resulting in a new 1-hour NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; primary standard set at 100 ppb; the annual average of 0.053 ppm remained the same.  Also considered was a new 1-hour secondary standard of 100 ppb.  This was the first time the EPA reviewed the environmental impacts separate from the health impacts for this group of criteria air pollutants&lt;ref name="airqualityNO"/&gt;  Also, in 2010, the EPA decided to ensure compliance by strengthening monitoring requirements, calling for increased numbers of monitoring systems near large urban areas and major roadways. On March 20, 2012 the EPA "took final action" to maintain the existing NAAQS as they stand.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet – Air Quality Designations for the 2010 Primary Nitrogen Dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) National Ambient Air Quality Standards http://www.epa.gov/airquality/nitrogenoxides/designations/pdfs/20120120FS.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The national average of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations has dropped by 52% since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/nitrogen.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual concentration for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported to be averaging around 10-20 ppb, and is expected to decrease further with new mobile source regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/nitrogenoxides/basic.html.&lt;/ref&gt;   Currently all areas of the US are classified as in attainment.&lt;ref name="airqualityNO"/&gt;

==EPA Endangerment Findings/ Mass v. EPA==
In 2009, the EPA Administrator found that under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act greenhouse gases threaten both the public health and the public welfare, and that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to that threat. This final action has two distinct 'findings,' which are:

1) The ''''Endangerment Finding'''' in which the Administrator found that the mix of atmospheric concentrations of six key, well-mixed greenhouse gases threatens both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. These six greenhouse gases are: carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). These greenhouse gases in the atmosphere constitute the "air pollution" that threatens both public health and welfare.

2) The ''''Cause or Contribute Finding''',' in which the Administrator found that the combined greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change.

The EPA issued these endangerment findings in response to the 2007 supreme court case [[Massachusetts v. EPA]], when the court determined that greenhouse gases are air pollutants according to the Clean Air Act. The court made the decision that the EPA must determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles "cause or contribute to air pollution which may be reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or whether the science is too uncertain to make a reasoned decision" (EPA's Endangerment Finding).

The EPA determined that, according to this decision, there are six greenhouse gases that need to be regulated. These include: 
* [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
* [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs)
* [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFCs)
* [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
This action allowed the EPA to set the greenhouse gas emission standards to light-duty vehicles proposed jointly with the Department of Transportation's [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/endangerment/EndangermentFinding_FAQs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petition to Add Seven Criteria Air Pollutants==
On December 2, 2009, the Center for Biological Diversity and [[350.org]] requested that the EPA recognize that carbon dioxide and other GHGs are reasonably anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.  Petitioners proposed that EPA list carbon dioxide as a criteria air pollutant, as outlined in the Clean Air Act.  They also requested that the EPA set NAAQS for carbon dioxide at no greater than 350 ppm- a "level that accurately reflects the most recent scientific knowledge."  Petitioners further requested that EPA designate the five other greenhouse gases, highlighted in Mass v. EPA, as criteria pollutants as well and establish pollution caps for them.  Furthermore, the petitioners proposed that nitrogen trifluoride (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be regulated as a criteria air pollutant in addition to the other six.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/global_warming_litigation/clean_air_act/pdfs/Petition_GHG_pollution_cap_12-2-2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">'''Di-positronium''', or '''dipositronium''', is a molecule consisting of two atoms of [[positronium]].  It was predicted to exist in 1946 by [[John Archibald Wheeler]],&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Wheeler, Polyelectrons, ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''48''', #3 (1946), pp. 219&amp;ndash;238.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently studied theoretically, but was not observed until 2007 in an experiment performed by David Cassidy and Allen Mills at the [[University of California, Riverside]].  
The researchers made the positronium [[molecules]] by firing intense bursts of [[positron]]s into a thin film of porous [[silicon dioxide]]. Upon slowing down in the silica, the positrons captured ordinary electrons to form positronium atoms. Within the silica, these were long lived enough to interact, forming molecular di-positronium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''Earth X''''' is a [[1999 in comics|1999]] [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. ''Earth X'' was written by [[Jim Krueger]] with art by [[John Paul Leon]]. Based on [[Alex Ross]]' notes, the series features a [[dystopian]] version of the [[Marvel Universe]].

The series was followed by two sequels, '''''Universe X''''' and '''''Paradise X'''''. The universe of ''Earth X'' is designated as [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-9997]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#Marvel Encyclopedias|Marvel Encyclopedia]] Volume 6: [[Fantastic Four]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe]]: Alternate Universes 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Earth X'' began in 1997 when ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine asked Alex Ross to create a possible dystopian future for Marvel. Ross designed a future where all ordinary humans had gained superpowers, and he examined how some of the most well-known Marvel characters (including [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]) would manage a world where their superhero powers had now become commonplace. The issue of ''Wizard'' that contained the Ross article sold out rapidly. Demand was so extensive that in 1999 (in affiliation with Marvel), they republished the article as the ''Earth X Sketchbook'', which also sold out. Based on this indicator of fan interest, Marvel commissioned Ross to create a full series based on his notes.

==Plot summary==
===''Earth X''===
Earth X is one of a number of planets implanted with a gestating [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] egg. About ten years after the end of the heroic age, [[Black Bolt]] releases the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]s into Earth's atmosphere, seeking to transform humanity into [[Inhumans]] so that his people would not suffer persecution.

He blinded [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] to prevent him from witnessing his actions, and Black Bolt and the Inhumans leave Earth. Unable to operate his observation equipment, Uatu transports X-51 ([[Machine Man]])—who has long since given up super-heroics to imitate the life of his human creator—to the Moon to act as Earth's new Watcher. X-51 gets increasingly annoyed at Uatu's assurance of the heroes' defeat.

After killing [[Red Skull]], [[Captain America]] quits the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], considering himself unfit for the team. Shortly afterward, [[Reed Richards]] constructs a worldwide network of [[vibranium]] power centers to solve the looming energy crisis, but the experiment fails when one of Reed's scientists falls into the reactor, causing a worldwide explosive chain reaction. The scientist that fell into the reactor became encased within vibranium and discovered that she can manipulate the rare metal, becoming the Iron Maiden.

The Terrigen Mists begin mutating Earth's human population, though much of the world blames "Plague X" on Richards' failed experiment. Benny Beckley, the young son of [[Comet Man]], gains the ability to control the actions of others and becomes known as Skull. Nearly all of the world's [[telepathy|telepaths]] are killed by the backlash caused by Beckley's power manifestation. Meanwhile, [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] fight the [[Fantastic Four]]. Doom is killed in an explosion along with [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]]. Namor kills [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]]. [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] responds by cursing Namor, causing one side of his body to burst into flame upon contact with air, forcing Namor back into the ocean. A distraught Reed Richards dons Doom's armor and exiles himself to Castle Doom in [[Latveria]].

Soon after, the [[Absorbing Man]] absorbs [[Ultron]]. The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] defeats the Absorbing Man with a [[computer virus]]. Attempting to isolate the virus by turning to stone, the Absorbing Man is shattered by the Vision after murdering the Avengers. Absorbing Man's pieces are scattered amongst the world's leaders so that he can never be reassembled.

[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] manipulates America into electing him President by using alien DNA to create the Hydra—a parasite collective that mind-controls its host bodies—and grants [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (one of the last unmutated humans) political asylum in exchange for constructing robotic replicas of the fallen Avengers to battle the Hydra menace.

Loki tricked Odin into changing Thor into a female and discovers an elaborate Celestial manipulation on a cosmic scale: ancient humans were modified by the Celestials, given the ability to develop powers in order to act as a type of anti-bodies meant to stop radical elements such as deviants and alien species from harming the Earth and the Celestial embryo growing within it. Along with Earth, the Celestials modified the native species of many planets harboring Celestial embryos. Species affected by Celestial modification gradually undergo an evolution process where they develop powers either through natural means such as mutants, or unnatural means such as meta-humans like Spiderman. Species with Celestial modifications in theory hold enough power to rival the celestials, but are inhibited by a clever psychological safeguard put in place by the Celestials. The safeguard relates to constructivist philosophy, that essentially states that people are shaped by their environment. The deities and devils within the Marvel universe are species that were modified by Celestials and unwittingly inhibit their own abilities due to the fact that they self-identify as a Marvel deity or devil. These evolved beings hold their sense of identity being reinforced by those that interact with them. Loki realizes that he was only the evil son of Odin and a Norse God because when he evolved beyond his mortal form and his psyche became a tabula rasa. The first interaction that he had with another in that form were Nordic humans who thought that he was an evil god and thus he became one.

Meanwhile, Captain America and his partner [[Wyatt Wingfoot|Redwing]] learn that the Skull is gathering a mind-controlled army. After Redwing is overcome by the Skull's powers, Captain America retreats and recruits allies to fight the Skull.

Meanwhile, the Inhuman Royal Family return from space and contact Reed Richards, hoping to reunite with their people. While trying to find the lost Inhuman nation with [[Cerebro]], Richards discovers Bolt's actions. The Skull's army reaches New York, overtaking it, and Captain America and his allies fall to the Skull's powers. While the Skull is distracted, Captain America kills the child dictator and liberates his followers.

Before the heroes can celebrate, the  Celestials arrive on Earth to germinate the embryo. As the Celestials prepare to attack New York, Loki arrives with a host of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]] found in the afterlife and announces he's not bad because he formed the Avengers. Tony Stark sacrifices himself while trying to hold off the arriving Celestials. Black Bolt is killed just after using his voice to travel across the universe and call for [[Galactus]], who is revealed to be devouring worlds in order to destroy Celestial embryos growing within them. Galactus kills several Celestials and forces the others to flee. Afterwards, Galactus consumes Earth's Celestial embryo. Galactus prepares to leave, and Reed requests that he remove his helmet. Galactus reluctantly agrees, revealing that he is actually Franklin Richards. Franklin Richards previously convinced himself that he was Galactus, willingly sacrificing his own identity to turn into the destroyer of worlds after realizing that Galactus needed to exist in order to keep the Celestial population in check. This needed to be done after the Fantastic Four killed the original Galactus with the ultimate nullifier. Reed Richards also realizes this fact and makes the heartbreaking decision to not remind Franklin of who he originally was for the sake of the universe.

X-51 realizes the Watchers' true purpose is to watch over Celestial eggs because one of their numbers failed to stop the birth of Galactus millions of years ago. X-51 destroys Uatu's ears and decides to destroy all Celestial eggs gestating inside the various planets within the universe. Reed converts his vibranium power network into "Human Torches", hoping to burn off the Terrigen Mists and restore Earth's human population.

===''Universe X''===
With the Celestial embryo gone, the Earth's mass is reduced, causing a shift in orbit and polarity as well as drastic worldwide climate changes. One-fourth of New York's population dies as temperatures plummet. The Tong of Creel, a cult dedicated to reassembling the Absorbing Man, begins killing those who hold his fragments. Under [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s influence, [[Immortus|Pope Immortus]] founds a church advocating mutant dominance of the galaxy and the destruction of Reed's Human Torches. Meanwhile, [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Mar-Vell]] is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic [[Adam Warlock|Him]] and [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Her]], though his soul remains in the Realm of the Dead. Captain America becomes the Mar-Vell child's guardian and embarks on a worldwide quest with his new ward to obtain various items in order to deal with Earth's restless mutant population and prepare for an impending war in the Realm of the Dead. Arriving at Zero Street, the duo is attacked by the [[Night People (comics)|Night People]], and Captain America sacrifices his life to save the Mar-Vell child.

Mar-Vell reveals that other than creating constructivist safeguards to stop species that they modified from being able to challenge their supremacy, the Celestials also schemed to manipulate causality and fatalism by helping to create beings such as death and Mephisto to distort truth and reality. Mar-Vell also discovered that beings that travel through time actually create new universes in the process of doing so and Celestials, acting through others such as Mephisto, encouraged time travel as it created entirely new universes for the Celestial to inhabit and grow in number.

When the Tong of Creel finally reassembles the Absorbing Man in New York, he attacks the city's Human Torch. Battling New York's heroes, the Absorbing Man absorbs Manhattan itself, adding its buildings and streets to his being, but [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] and Iron Maiden convince the villain to transform himself into vibranium and use his mass to stabilize the planet's fluctuating orbit and polarity. Meanwhile, in the Realm of the Dead, Mar-Vell leads an army of deceased heroes and villains against [[Thanos]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. With the artifacts collected by himself and Captain America in his possession, Mar-Vell shows Thanos how Death has manipulated him and convinces Thanos to use the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] on the entity.

===''Paradise X''===
With Death destroyed, Mar-Vell constructs a Paradise in the center of the [[Negative Zone]] for the dead to inhabit. However, those among the living find themselves unable to die.

Meanwhile, X-51 decides that the inhabitants of alternate Earths should be warned about the Celestial embryos he believes are growing within their planets. He spreads the alarm across the multiverse by recruiting and dispatching Heralds from alternate timelines such as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Other versions|Bloodstorm]] (Ororo Monroe, Earth-1298), [[Deathlok]] (Luther Manning, Earth-7484), [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] (Earth-1121), [[Killraven]] (Earth-691), [[Iron Man 2020]] (Earth-8410), [[Spider-Girl]] (Earth-1122), and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] ([[Days of Future Past]] Earth-811).

After banishing the Watchers of Earth-9997 to alternate worlds with the hope that their presence will lead to the discovery and destruction of each Celestial embryo, X-51 takes his Heralds to his Earth, where he will aid each in achieving his or her wishes. In Mar-Vell's Paradise, the [[High Evolutionary]]'s equipment transforms the souls of Black Bolt, Captain America, Daredevil (Matt Murdock), Dr. Doom, [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]], and Tony Stark into the Avenging Host, charged with ushering souls from the Realm of the Dead to Paradise. Those who enter Paradise consume a piece of the [[Cosmic Cube]], enabling them to create their own, seemingly perfect pocket reality. But as more souls enter Paradise, it begins to expand and consume entire worlds within the [[Negative Zone]], causing [[Blastaar]] and [[Annihilus]] to attack the [[Baxter Building]] in New York.

Reed Richards, [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]], the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], and several other brilliant scientists convene to discuss a solution to Death's absence. They decide to access the imprisoned Jude the Entropic Man, who can turn others to dust on contact, and synthesize his essence into a chemical to end the suffering of those unable to die. With the chemical complete, Reed, growing suspicious of Mar-Vell's motives, plans to use [[Pym Particles]] to slow Paradise's rapid growth within the Negative Zone. [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] frees Jude from captivity, convincing him to go on a killing spree. Mephisto then steers Jude to Britain, where Mephisto hopes to find the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], which will allow him to traverse the multiverse. With the help of [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Psylocke]] and the sacrifice of a recently resurrected [[Meggan]], King Britain is able to slay Mephisto with [[Excalibur]]. Meanwhile, in Paradise, Reed and a legion of heroes confront Mar-Vell. After Paradise is nearly conquered in the name of the [[Supreme Intelligence]] by the arriving souls of the [[Kree]] military, Mar-Vell explains to Reed that he (Reed) is to become the new [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].

Using his new role as Eternity, Reed is able to end the conflict and free the remaining heroes from their Cosmic Cube-induced dream-worlds. Once this is accomplished, Mar-Vell explains to Reed that his plan is to build a wall around their universe, preventing any further influence from the Celestials. Feeling that his work is not yet complete, Mar-Vell tells the people of Paradise that he is going to the source of Excalibur, which is strongly implied to be the original universe.

==Clarifications==
Initially, the ''Earth X'' storyline was purported as being the future of [[Earth-616]]. However, the series often substantially [[retcon]]ned the origins and workings of characters to better suit the story, to the point where they were no longer reconcilable with their counterparts in the mainstream Marvel Universe. One example is the revelation in ''Paradise X'' that Wolverine is not a mutant, but instead one of the few remaining "pure strain humans", free from the genetic manipulations of the Celestials (as well as a descendent of [[Moon-Boy]]). Marvel editors solved these discrepancies by officially declaring that anything stated in ''Earth X'' would not be considered [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]]. It is later revealed in issue #11 of ''Paradise X'' that the events shown in the series are not set in an alternative future, but rather an alternative present (the issue reveals that ''Paradise X'' is set in 2003, the year of publication).

The ''Paradise X'' series was never properly concluded, due to editorial interference midway through its publication. Due to dwindling sales, the ''X'' and ''A'' specials, which were intended to be double-sized issues, were both reduced to 22 pages and the intended ending was never used. Writer Jim Krueger expressed dismay at the loss of pages and not being able to use the original ending. In the intended ending, Captain America, suspecting Captain Marvel's treachery, would have killed Marvel just as Marvel put the energy wall around the universe to keep out the Celestials and Elders. At this final moment, having ascended to the throne of Paradise, Captain America would have realized that Marvel's intentions were good. "Cap would have sat on the throne, completely unworthy of it. And this, this would have been the final testing necessary to make Cap worthy of it."&lt;ref&gt;http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=36989&amp;page=4&amp;pp=20  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044922/http://x-mencomics.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=36989&amp;page=4&amp;pp=20 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a planned limited series, ''Tales of Earth X'', was proposed but never greenlighted. The series, set before the events of ''Earth X'', would have revealed the final days of characters like Professor X before the mutation that turned the world into mutants and killed all of Earth's psychics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

A one-shot called ''The Earth X Companion'' was released in 2008, containing production notes and sketches by Jim Krueger and Alex Ross as well as a short story drawn by artist Bill Reinhold detailing the fate of one of [[Nick Fury]]'s [[Life Model Decoys]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with electroluminescent backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]

'''Electroluminescence''' ('''EL''') is an [[optical phenomenon]] and [[electrical phenomenon]] in which a material emits light in response to the passage of an [[electric current]] or to a strong [[electric field]]. This is distinct from [[black body]] [[light emission]] resulting from heat ([[incandescence]]), from a chemical reaction ([[chemiluminescence]]), sound ([[sonoluminescence]]), or other mechanical action ([[mechanoluminescence]]).

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Electroluminescent panel spectrum.png|thumb|right|300px|Spectrum of a blue/green electroluminescent light source for a clock radio (similar to the one seen in the above image). Peak wavelength is at 492&amp;nbsp;nm and the [[full width at half maximum|FWHM]] spectral bandwidth is quite wide at about 85&amp;nbsp;nm.]]
Electroluminescence is the result of [[radiative recombination]] of [[electron]]s &amp; [[electron hole|hole]]s in a material, usually a [[semiconductor]]. The excited electrons release their energy as [[photon]]s - light. Prior to recombination, electrons and holes may be separated either by [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] the material to form a [[p-n junction]] (in semiconductor electroluminescent devices such as [[light-emitting diode]]s) or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated by a strong electric field (as with the [[phosphor]]s in [[electroluminescent display]]s).

It has been recently shown that as a solar cell improves its light-to-electricity efficiency (improved open-circuit voltage), it will also improve its electricity-to-light (EL) efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raguse|first1=John|title=Correlation of Electroluminescence with Open-CIrcuit Voltage from Thin-Film CdTe Solar Cells|journal=Journal of Photovoltaics|volume=5|issue=4|date=April 15, 2015|pages=1175-1178|doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2417761|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7086293&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7086293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of electroluminescent materials==
Electroluminescent devices are fabricated using either organic or inorganic electroluminescent materials. The active materials are generally semiconductors of wide enough bandwidth to allow exit of the light.

The most typical inorganic thin-film EL (TFEL) is ZnS:Mn with yellow-orange emission. Examples of the range of EL material include:
* Powdered [[zinc sulfide]] [[dopant|doped]] with [[copper]] (producing greenish light) or [[silver]] (producing bright blue light)
* Thin-film [[zinc sulfide]] doped with [[manganese]] (producing orange-red color)
* Naturally blue [[diamond]], which includes a trace of [[boron]] that acts as a dopant.
* Semiconductors containing [[Group (periodic table)|Group]] III and Group V elements, such as [[Indium phosphide|indium phosphide (InP)]], [[Gallium arsenide|gallium arsenide (GaAs)]], and [[Gallium nitride|gallium nitride (GaN)]] ([[Light-emitting diode]]s.)
* Certain organic semiconductors, such as [Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine

==Practical implementations==
The most common electroluminescent (EL) devices are composed of either powder (primarily used in lighting applications) or [[thin film]]s (for information displays.)

''Light-emitting capacitor'', or '''LEC''', is a term used since at least 1961 &lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the National Electronics Conference, Volume 17'', National Engineering Conference, Inc., 1961 ;  page 328&lt;/ref&gt; to describe  electroluminescent panels. [[General Electric]] has patents dating to 1938 on flat electroluminescent panels that are still made as [[night light]]s and backlights for [[Control panel (engineering)|instrument panel]] displays. Electroluminescent panels are a [[capacitor]] where the [[dielectric]] between the outside plates is a [[phosphor]] that gives off [[photon]]s when the capacitor is charged.  By making one of the contacts transparent, the large area exposed emits light.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Kane, Heinz Sell, ''Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress, 2nd ed.'', The Fairmont Press, Inc., 2001 {{ISBN|0881733784}},  pages 122–124&lt;/ref&gt;

Electroluminescent automotive instrument panel backlighting, with each gauge pointer also an individual light source, entered production on 1960 Chrysler and Imperial passenger cars, and was continued successfully on several Chrysler vehicles through 1967.

Sylvania Lighting Division in Salem and Danvers, MA, produced and marketed an EL night lamp (right), under the trade name ''Panelescent'' at roughly the same time that the Chrysler instrument panels entered production. These lamps have proven extremely reliable, with some samples known to be still functional after nearly 50 years of continuous operation. Later in the 1960s, Sylvania's Electronic Systems Division in Needham, MA developed and manufactured several instruments for the Apollo Lunar Lander and Command Module using [[electroluminescent display]] panels manufactured by the Electronic Tube Division of Sylvania at Emporium, PA. Raytheon, Sudbury, MA,  manufactured the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|Apollo guidance computer]], which used a Sylvania electroluminescent display panel as part of its display-keyboard interface (DSKY).

Powder phosphor-based electroluminescent panels are frequently used as backlights for [[liquid crystal display]]s. They readily provide gentle, even illumination for the entire display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as pagers, wristwatches, and computer-controlled thermostats, and their gentle green-cyan glow is common in the technological world. They require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts).&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}  pp 22-28&lt;/ref&gt; For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a converter circuit within the device. This converter often makes an audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. For line-voltage-operated devices, it may be supplied directly from the power line. Electroluminescent nightlights operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.&lt;ref name=Handbook /&gt;

Thin film phosphor electroluminescence was first commercialized during the 1980s by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp Corporati]]

[[Sharp Corporation|on]] in Japan, [[Finlux]] (Oy Lohja Ab) in Finland, and [[Planar Systems]] in the US.  Here, bright, long-life light emission is achieved in thin film yellow-emitting manganese-doped zinc sulfide material.  Displays using this technology were manufactured for medical and vehicle applications where ruggedness and wide viewing angles were crucial, and liquid crystal displays were not well developed. In 1992, [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] introduced its [[Indiglo]] EL display on some watches.

Recently, blue-, red-, and green-emitting thin film electroluminescent materials that offer the potential for long life and full color electroluminescent displays have been developed.

In either case, the EL material must be enclosed between two electrodes and at least one electrode must be transparent to allow escape of the produced light. Glass coated with [[indium tin oxide]] is commonly used as the front (transparent) electrode while the back electrode is coated with reflective metal.  Additionally, other transparent conducting materials, such as [[carbon nanotube]] coatings or [[PEDOT]] can be used as the front electrode.

The display applications are primarily passive (i.e., voltages are driven from edge of the display cf. driven from a transistor on the display). Similar to LCD trends, there have also been Active Matrix EL (AMEL) displays demonstrated, where circuitry is added to prolong voltages at each pixel.  The solid-state nature of TFEL allows for a very rugged and high-resolution display fabricated even on silicon substrates.  AMEL displays of 1280x1024 at over 1000 lines per inch (lpi) have been demonstrated by a consortium including Planar Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Khormaei, et al., "High Resolution Active Matrix Electroluminescent Display", Society for Information Display Digest, p. 137, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planar.com/support/design-resources/docs/overview.pdf |title=Active Matrix Electroluminescence (AMEL) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722221137/http://www.planar.com/support/design-resources/docs/overview.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rogers Shine-01.jpg|thumbnail|left|The world's first electroluminescent billboard campaign, Canada, Winter 2005]]Electroluminescent technologies have low power consumption compared to competing lighting technologies, such as neon or fluorescent lamps. This, together with the thinness of the material, has made EL technology valuable to the advertising industry. Relevant advertising applications include electroluminescent billboards and signs. EL manufacturers are able to control precisely which areas of an electroluminescent sheet illuminate, and when. This has given advertisers the ability to create more dynamic advertising that is still compatible with traditional advertising spaces.

An EL film is a so-called [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian radiator]]: unlike with neon lamps, filament lamps, or LEDs, the brightness of the surface appears the same from all angles of view; electroluminescent light is not directional and therefore hard to compare with (thermal) light sources measured in lumens or lux. The light emitted from the surface is perfectly homogeneous and is well-perceived by the eye. EL film produces single-frequency (monochromatic) light that has a very narrow bandwidth, is absolutely uniform and visible from a great distance.

[[Image:66ChargerDash2.jpg|right|thumb|1966 [[Dodge Charger]] instrument panel with electroluminescent lighting. [[Chrysler]] first introduced cars with EL panel lighting in its 1960 model year.]]
In principle, EL lamps can be made in any color.  However, the commonly used greenish color closely matches the peak sensitivity of human vision, producing the greatest apparent light output for the least electrical power input.  Unlike neon and fluorescent lamps, EL lamps are not [[negative resistance]] devices so no extra circuitry is needed to regulate the amount of current flowing through them.
A new technology now being used is based on multispectral phosphors that emit light from 600 to 400nm depending on the drive frequency; this is similar to the colour changing effect seen with aqua EL sheet but on a larger scale.

Electroluminescent lighting is now used as an application for public safety identification involving alphanumeric characters on the roof of vehicles for clear visibility from an aerial perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.Air-EL.com/ |title=air-el |publisher=Federal Signal |access-date=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electroluminescent lighting, especially [[electroluminescent wire]] (EL wire), has also made its way into clothing as many designers have brought this technology to the entertainment and night life industry.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Eng. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn9cPkCtzcsC "Fashion Geek: Clothes Accessories Tech"]. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers have developed an electroluminescent "skin" that can stretch more than six times its original size while still emitting light. This hyper-elastic light-emitting capacitor (HLEC) can endure more than twice the strain of previously tested stretchable displays. It consists of layers of transparent hydrogel electrodes sandwiching an insulating elastomer sheet. The elastomer changes luminance and capacitance when stretched, rolled and otherwise deformed. In addition to its ability to emit light under a strain of greater than 480% its original size, the group's HLEC was shown to be capable of being integrated into a [[soft robotics|soft robotic]] system. Three six-layer HLEC panels were bound together to form a crawling soft robot, with the top four layers making up the light-up skin and the bottom two the pneumatic actuators. The discovery could lead to significant advances in health care, transportation, electronic communication and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160303150224.htm|title=Super elastic electroluminescent 'skin' will soon create mood robots|last=Cornell University|date=March 3, 2016|work=Science Daily|access-date=March 4, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy subsidies''' are measures that keep prices for consumers below market levels or for producers above market levels, or reduce costs for consumers and producers.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Energy subsidies may be direct cash transfers to producers, consumers, or related bodies, as well as indirect support mechanisms, such as tax exemptions and rebates, price controls, trade restrictions, and limits on market access. They may also include energy conservation subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Industrial Productivity [http://iepd.iipnetwork.org/policy/subsidy-scheme-energy-efficiency JP-6:Subsidy scheme for energy efficiency ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311025632/http://iepd.iipnetwork.org/policy/subsidy-scheme-energy-efficiency |date=2016-03-11 }} Retrieved 10 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of today's major modern energy industries have all relied on substantial subsidy support.

== Overview ==
Main arguments for energy subsidies are:
* Security of supply&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; subsidies are used to ensure adequate domestic supply by supporting indigenous fuel production in order to reduce import dependency, or supporting overseas activities of national energy companies.
* Environmental improvement&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; subsidies are used to reduce pollution, including different emissions, and to fulfill international obligations (e.g. [[Kyoto Protocol]]).
* Economic benefits&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; subsidies in the form of reduced prices are used to stimulate particular economic sectors or segments of the population, e.g. alleviating poverty and increasing access to energy in developing countries.
* Employment and social benefits&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; subsidies are used to maintain employment, especially in periods of economic transition.&lt;ref name=eea&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher=European Environmental Agency | url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2004_1/ | title=Energy subsidies in the European Union: A brief overview.

Main arguments against energy subsidies are:
* Some energy subsidies counter the goal of sustainable development, as they may lead to higher consumption and waste, exacerbating the harmful effects of energy use on the environment, create a heavy burden on government finances and weaken the potential for economies to grow, undermine private and public investment in the energy sector.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt; Also, most benefits from fossil fuel subsidies in developing countries go to the richest 20% of households.&lt;ref name="odifossilfuels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/subsidies-change-the-game |title=Time to change the game: Fossil fuel subsidies and climate |last=Whitley |first=Shelagh |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |accessdate=3 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103192458/http://www.odi.org.uk/subsidies-change-the-game |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impede the expansion of distribution networks and the development of more environmentally benign energy technologies, and do not always help the people that need them most.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt;
* The study conducted by the [[World Bank]] finds that subsidies to the large commercial businesses that dominate the energy sector are not justified. However, under some circumstances it is reasonable to use subsidies to promote access to energy for the poorest households in developing countries. Energy subsidies should encourage access to the modern energy sources, not to cover operating costs of companies.&lt;ref name=wb&gt;{{cite journal | publisher=[[World Bank]] | title=The role of energy subsidies | author1=Douglas F.

Types of energy subsidies are:
* Direct financial transfers&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; grants to producers; grants to consumers; low-interest or preferential loans to producers.
* Preferential tax treatments&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; rebates or exemption on royalties, duties, producer levies and tariffs; tax credit; accelerated depreciation allowances on energy supply equipment.
* Trade restrictions&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; quota, technical restrictions and [[trade embargo]]es.
* Energy-related services provided by government at less than full cost&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; direct investment in energy infrastructure; public research and development.
* Regulation of the energy sector&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; demand guarantees and mandated deployment rates; price controls; market-access restrictions; preferential planning consent and controls over access to resources.
* Failure to impose [[external cost]]s&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; environmental externality costs; energy security risks and price volatility costs.&lt;ref name=iea&gt;{{cite book | publisher = [[International Energy Agency|IEA]]/[[UNEP]] | title = Reforming energy subsidies | url = http://www.uneptie.org/energy/publications/pdfs/En-SubsidiesReform.pdf | format = PDF | isbn = 92-807-2208-5 | year = 2002 | accessdate = 2008-03-09 | author = United Nations Environment Programme, Division of Technology, Industry and Economics. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321185557/http://www.uneptie.org/energy/publications/pdfs/En-SubsidiesReform.pdf | archivedate = 2007-03-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depletion Allowance&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; allows a deduction from gross income of up to ~27% for the depletion of exhaustible resources (oil, gas, minerals).

Overall, energy subsidies require coordination and integrated implementation, especially in light of globalization and increased interconnectedness of energy policies, thus their regulation at the World Trade Organization is often seen as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}} and {{cite journal|title=WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law|journal=49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International|ssrn=2704453|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Paolo Davide and Cima, Elena, WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law (December 15, 2015). 49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International, {{ISSN|1011-6702}}, December 2015, pp. 1103 – 1116.

== Impact of fossil fuel subsidies ==
The degree and impact of fossil fuel studies is extensively studied.  Because fossil fuels are a leading contributor to climate change through greenhouse gases, fossil fuel subsidies increase emissions and exacerbate climate change. The OECD’s inventory in 2015 determined an overall value of $160bn-$200bn per year between 2010 and 2014 relying on the WTO's 1994 definition of fossil fuel subsidies as “financial contribution by a government” which “confers a benefit” on its recipient.  This is the only internationally agreed definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/oecd-companion-to-the-inventory-of-support-measures-for-fossil-fuels-2015_9789264239616-en#page11|title=OECD Companion to the Inventory of Support Measures for Fossil Fuels 2015 {{!}} READ online|website=OECD iLibrary|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-challenge-of-defining-fossil-fuel-subsidies|title=Explainer: The challenge of defining fossil fuel subsidies {{!}} Carbon Brief|date=2017-06-12|work=Carbon Brief|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 IMF study estimated that global fossil fuel subsidies were $5.3 trillion in 2015, which represents 6.5% of global GDP.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coady|first=David|last2=Parry|first2=Ian|last3=Sears|first3=Louis|last4=Shang|first4=Baoping|title=How Large Are Global Fossil Fuel Subsidies?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16304867|journal=World Development|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that "China was the biggest subsidizer in 2013 ($1.8 trillion), followed by the United States ($0.6 trillion), and Russia, the European Union, and India (each with about $0.3 trillion)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The authors estimated that the elimination of "subsidies would have reduced global carbon emissions in 2013 by 21% and fossil fuel air pollution deaths 55%, while raising revenue of 4%, and social welfare by 2.2%, of global GDP."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This study is controversial for its radical break with previous definitions of subsidies by redefining externalities as a subsidy, as well as an excessively broad application of social costs as oil externalities.  The externalities accounted for are broad enough that oil companies not paying for automobile accidents is considered a subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/5/20/8630913/IMf-fossil-fuel-subsidies|title=The IMF says we spend $5.3 trillion a year on fossil fuel subsidies.

According to the ''International Energy Agency'', the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies worldwide would be the one of the most effective ways of reducing greenhouse gases and battling [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="NYT12515"&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Schwartz|title=On Tether to Fossil Fuels, Nations Speak With Money|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/science/on-tether-to-fossil-fuels-nations-speak-with-money.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=5 December 2015|quote=...the elimination of subsidies as one of the most effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206082056/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/science/on-tether-to-fossil-fuels-nations-speak-with-money.html|archivedate=6 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, the G7 nations set for the first time a deadline for ending most fossil fuel subsidies; saying government support for coal, oil and gas should end by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/g7-nations-pledge-to-end-fossil-fuel-subsidies-by-2025|title=G7 nations pledge to end fossil fuel subsidies by 2025|last=Mathiesen|first=Karl|date=27 May 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=7 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606213906/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/g7-nations-pledge-to-end-fossil-fuel-subsidies-by-2025|archivedate=6 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[OECD]], subsidies supporting fossil fuels, particularly coal and oil, represent greater threats to the environment than subsidies to renewable energy. Subsidies to nuclear power contribute to unique environmental and safety issues, related mostly to the risk of high-level environmental damage, although nuclear power contributes positively to the environment in the areas of air pollution and climate change.&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher= OECD | title = Forthcoming, Draft synthesis report on environmentally harmful subsidies, SG/SD(2004)3| date=2004-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fatih Birol]], Chief Economist at the [[International Energy Agency]] without a [[fossil fuel phase-out|phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies]], countries will not reach their climate targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/blog/2013/02/fossil-fuel-subsidies-are-public-enemy-number-one/ Fossil fuel subsidies are “public enemy number one”&amp;nbsp;– IEA Chief] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211055451/http://www.ewea.org/blog/2013/02/fossil-fuel-subsidies-are-public-enemy-number-one/ |date=2013-02-11 }} EWEA 04 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by Global Subsidies Initiative compared global relative subsidies of different energy sources. Results show that fossil fuels receive 0.8 US cents per kWh of energy they produce (although it should be noted that the estimate of fossil fuel subsidies applies only to consumer subsidies and only within non-OECD countries), nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents / kWh, renewable energy (excluding hydroelectricity) receives 5.0 cents / kWh and bio-fuels receive 5.1 cents / kWh in subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf |title= Relative Subsidies to Energy Sources: GSI estimates 19 APRIL 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513055956/http://www.iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf |archivedate= 13 May 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, IEA chief economist Faith Birol said the current $409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy, and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Renewable-Energy-Being-Held-Back-by-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-IEA.html |title=Renewable Energy Being Held Back by Fossil Fuel Subsidies – IEA |date=1 November 2011 |work=Oilprice.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103005935/http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Renewable-Energy-Being-Held-Back-by-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-IEA.html |archivedate=3 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of renewable energy subsidies ==
Global [[renewable energy]] subsidies reached $88 billion in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/news/detail/2013/02/04/eu-wind-industry-faces-tough-challenge-and-politicians-should-not-make-it-worse|title=EU wind industry faces tough challenge - and politicians should not make it worse EWEA 04 Feb 2013 | accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the OECD, subsidies to renewable energy are generally considered more environmentally beneficial than fossil fuel subsidies, although the full range of environmental effects should be taken into account.&lt;ref name="oecd" /&gt;

== IEA position on subsidies ==
According to [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) (2011) energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production. "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits".&lt;ref name="IEA-FS2011"&gt;[http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204112700/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf |date=February 4, 2012 }} How will global energy markets evolve to 2035? IEA November 2011 6 pages&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''[[Deploying Renewables 2011]]'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand. "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," the IEA said, and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=Nov 23, 2011 |work=Reuters |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016031117/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |archivedate=2015-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil-fuel consumption subsidies were $409 billion in 2010, oil products being half of it. Renewable-energy subsidies were $66 billion in 2010 and will reach $250 billion by 2035, according to IEA. Renewable energy is subsidized in order to compete in the market, increase their volume and develop the technology so that the subsidies become unnecessary with the development. Eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies could bring economic and environmental benefits. Phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020 would cut primary energy demand 5%. Since the start of 2010, ''at least 15 countries have taken steps to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies.'' According to IEA onshore wind may become competitive around 2020 in the European Union.&lt;ref name="IEA-FS2011"/&gt;

According to the IEA the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, over $500 billion annually, will reduce 10% greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/149809454/President-Obama-s-Climate-Action-Plan|title=President Obama's Climate Action Plan - Climate Resilience - Renewable Energy|author=|date=|website=Scribd|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305185504/https://www.scribd.com/doc/149809454/President-Obama-s-Climate-Action-Plan|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study found that oil, natural gas, and coal received $369 billion, $121 billion, and $104 billion (2010 dollars), respectively, or 70% of total energy subsidies over that period. Oil, natural gas, and coal benefited most from percentage depletion allowances and other tax-based subsidies, but oil also benefited heavily from regulatory subsidies such as exemptions from price controls and higher-than-average rates of return allowed on oil pipelines. The MISI report found that non-hydro renewable energy (primarily wind and solar) benefited from $74 billion in federal subsidies, or 9% of the total, largely in the form of tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development (R&amp;D). Nuclear power benefited from $73 billion in federal subsidies, 9% of the total, largely in the form of R&amp;D, while hydro power received $90 billion in federal subsidies, 12% of the total.

The study estimated that subsidies to fossil fuel-based sources totaled about $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totaled $29 billion. The study did not assess subsidies supporting nuclear energy.

The three largest fossil fuel subsidies were:
# Foreign tax credit ($15.3 billion)
# Credit for production of non-conventional fuels ($14.1 billion)
# Oil and Gas exploration and development expense ($7.1 billion)

The three largest renewable fuel subsidies were:
# Alcohol Credit for Fuel Excise Tax ($11.6 billion)
# Renewable Electricity Production Credit ($5.2 billion)
# [[Corn-Based Ethanol]] ($5.0 billion)
In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74 billion for energy subsidies to support [[R&amp;D]] for [[nuclear power]] ($50 billion) and [[fossil fuels]] ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same timeframe,  [[renewable energy]] technologies and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] received a total of US $26 billion.  It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors, namely [[solar power]], [[wind power]], and [[biofuels|bio-fuels]].&lt;ref name="per"&gt;Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity'', p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many of the "subsidies" available to the oil and gas industries are general business opportunity credits, available to all US businesses (particularly, the foreign tax credit mentioned above). The value of industry-specific (oil, gas, and coal) subsidies in 2006 was estimated by the Texas State Comptroller to be $6.25 billion - about 60% of the amount calculated by the Environmental Law Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/energy/subsidies/|title=Welcome to the New Comptroller.Texas.Gov|first=Texas Comptroller of Public|last=Accounts|date=|website=window.state.tx.us|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627090709/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/energy/subsidies/|archivedate=27 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of federal subsidies, which the comptroller valued at $7.4 billion, came from shared credits and deductions, and oil defense (spending on the [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]], energy infrastructure security, etc.).

Critics allege that the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry have not involved cash payments, but rather the shifting of construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers, burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns, defaults to accidents, and [[nuclear waste management]]. Critics claim that this approach distorts market choices, which they believe would otherwise favor less risky energy investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |title=Nuclear Power:Still Not Viable without Subsidies |author=Koplow, Doug |date=February 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |page=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309051045/http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many energy analysts, such as [[Clint Wilder]], [[Ron Pernick]] and [[Lester Brown]], have suggested that energy subsidies need to be shifted away from mature and established industries and towards high growth clean energy. They also suggest that such subsidies need to be reliable, long-term and consistent, to avoid the periodic difficulties that the wind industry has had in the United States.&lt;ref name="per" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L.R.

[[Renewable electricity]] (mainly wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, and tidal energy) will account for the largest share of this expenditure, 32.1%, while spending on liquid biofuels will account for the next largest share, 16.1%. Spending on multiple and other forms of clean energy, including energy efficiency, electric vehicles and advanced batteries, high-speed rail, grid and transportation electrification, nuclear, and advanced fossil fuel technologies, will account for the remaining share, 51.8%. Moreover, the report finds that absent federal action, spending on clean energy will decline by 75%, from $44.3 billion in 2009 to $11.0 billion in 2014.

==== United States government role in the development of new energy industries ====
From civilian nuclear power to hydro, wind, solar, and shale gas, the United States federal government has played a central role in the development of new energy industries.&lt;ref name="Case Studies"&gt;Jesse Jenkins, Devon Swezey, and Yael Borofsky (December 2010).

America's nuclear power industry, which currently supplies about 20% of the country's electricity, has its origins in the [[Manhattan Project]] to develop [[atomic weapons]] during [[World War II]]. From 1942 to 1945, the United States invested $20 billion (2003 dollars) into a massive nuclear research and deployment initiative. But the achievement of the first nuclear weapon test in 1945 marked the beginning, not the end, of federal involvement in nuclear technologies. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s “[[Atoms for Peace]]” address in 1953 and the [[1954 Atomic Energy Act]] committed the United States to develop peaceful uses for nuclear technology, including commercial energy generation. The new [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|National Laboratory system]], established by the Manhattan Project, was maintained and expanded, and the government poured money into nuclear energy research and development.&lt;ref name="MIT Study"&gt;[[John M. Deutch]] and [[Ernest Moniz]] (2003 with 2009 update) [http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ The Future of Nuclear Power: An Interdisciplinary MIT Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518215841/http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ |date=2017-05-18 }} (PDF). Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Retrieved April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that research was not sufficient to spur the development of a nascent, capital-intensive industry, the federal government created financial incentives to spur the deployment of nuclear energy. For example, the 1957 Price Anderson Act limited the liability of nuclear energy firms in case of serious accident and helped firms secure capital with federal loan guarantees. In the favorable environment created by such incentives, more than 100 nuclear plants were built in the United States by 1973.&lt;ref name="MIT Study"/&gt;

Commercial [[wind power]], today one of the fastest growing energy sectors, was also enabled through government support. In the 1980s, the federal government pursued two different R&amp;D efforts for [[wind turbine]] development. The first was a “[[big science]]” effort by [[NASA]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) to use U.S. expertise in high-technology research and products to develop new large-scale wind turbines for electricity generation, largely from scratch.&lt;ref name="Vicki Norberg-Bohm 2002"&gt;Vicki Norberg-Bohm (October 2002). "Pushing and Pulling Technology into the Marketplace: The Role of Government in Technology Innovation in the Power Sector,” in The Role of Government in Energy Technology Innovation: Insights for Government Policy in Energy the Sector, ed. Vicki Norberg-Bohm, BSCIA Working Paper 2002-14, Energy Technology Innovation Project, [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second, more successful R&amp;D effort, sponsored by the DOE, focused on component innovations for smaller turbines that used the operational experience of existing turbines to inform future research agendas. Joint research projects between the government and private firms produced a number of innovations that helped increase the efficiency of wind turbines, including twisted blades and special-purpose airfoils. Publicly funded R&amp;D was coupled with efforts to build a domestic market for new turbines. At the federal level, this included tax credits and the passage of the [[Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act]] (PURPA), which required that utilities purchase power from some small renewable energy generators at avoided cost.&lt;ref name="Vicki Norberg-Bohm 2002"/&gt; Both federal and state support for wind turbine development helped drive costs down considerably, but policy incentives at both the federal and state level were discontinued at the end of the decade.&lt;ref name="Vicki Norberg-Bohm 2002"/&gt; However, after a nearly five-year federal policy hiatus in the late 1980s, the U.S. government enacted new policies to support the industry in the early 1990s. The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) continued its support for wind turbine R&amp;D, and also launched the Advanced Wind Turbine Program (AWTP). The goal of the AWTP was to reduce the cost of wind power to rates that would be competitive in the U.S. market. Policymakers also introduced new mechanisms to spur the demand of new wind turbines and boost the domestic market, including a 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour tax credit (adjusted over time for inflation) included in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. Today the wind industry's main subsidy support comes from the federal production tax credit.

The development of commercial [[solar power]] was also dependent on government support. Solar PV technology was born in the United States, when Daryl Chapin, [[Calvin Fuller]], and [[Gerald Pearson]] at [[Bell Labs]] first demonstrated the silicon solar [[photovoltaic cell]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Chris P. Knight 2010"&gt;Chris P. Knight (2010). “Failure to Deploy: Solar Photovoltaic Policy in the United States,” in ''State of Innovation: The U.S. Government’s Role in Technology Development'', ed. Fred Block and Matthew R. Keller, (Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt; The first cells recorded efficiencies of four percent, far lower than the 25 percent efficiencies typical of some silicon crystalline cells today. With the cost out of reach for most applications, developers of the new technology had to look elsewhere for an early market. As it turned out, solar PV did make economic sense in one market segment: aerospace. The [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] viewed the technology as an ideal power source for a top-secret project on earth-orbiting satellites. The government contracted with [[Hoffman Electronics]] to provide solar cells for its new space exploration program. The first commercial satellite, the [[Vanguard I]], launched in 1958, was equipped with both silicon solar cells and chemical batteries.&lt;ref name="Chris P. Knight 2010"/&gt; By 1965, NASA was using almost a million solar PV cells. Strong government demand and early research support for solar cells paid off in the form of dramatic declines in the cost of the technology and improvements in its performance. From 1956 to 1973, the price of PV cells declined from $300 to $20 per watt.&lt;ref name="Chris P. Knight 2010"/&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, as costs were declining, manufacturers began producing solar PV cells for terrestrial applications. Solar PV found a new niche in areas distant from power lines where electricity was needed, such as oil rigs and [[Coast Guard lighthouses]]. The government continued to support the industry through the 1970s and early 1980s with new R&amp;D efforts under Presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]], both Republicans, and President [[Jimmy Carter]], a Democrat. As a direct result of government involvement in solar PV development, 13 of the 14 top innovations in PV over the past three decades were developed with the help of federal dollars, nine of which were fully funded by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Taylor et al.

===Venezuela===
In Venezuela, energy subsidies were equivalent to about 8.9 percent of the country's GDP in 2012. Fuel subsidies were 7.1 percent while electricity subsidies were 1.8 percent. In order to fund this the government used about 85 percent of its tax revenue on these subsidies. It is estimated the subsidies have caused Venezuela to consume 20 percent more energy than without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troncoso|first=Karin|last2=Soares da Silva|first2=Agnes|date=2017-08-01|title=LPG fuel subsidies in Latin America and the use of solid fuels to cook|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517302719|journal=Energy Policy|volume=107|pages=188–196|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel subsidies are given more heavily to the richest part of the population who are consuming the most energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21612186-border-colombia-closed-crackdown-contraband-wild-frontier|title=The wild frontier|author=|date=|website=The Economist|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324112846/https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21612186-border-colombia-closed-crackdown-contraband-wild-frontier|archivedate=24 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel subsidies maintained a cost of about $0.01 US for a liter of gasoline at the pump since 1996 until president Nicolas Maduro reduced the national subsidy in 2016 to make it roughly $0.60 US per liter (The local currency is Bolivar and the price per liter of gas is 6 Bolivars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/venezuela-president-raises-fuel-price-by-1300-and-devalues-bolivar-to-tackle-crisis|title=Venezuela president raises fuel price by 6,000% and devalues bolivar to tackle crisis|last=Brodzinsky|first=Sibylla|date=2016-02-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061558/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/venezuela-president-raises-fuel-price-by-1300-and-devalues-bolivar-to-tackle-crisis|archivedate=2017-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel consumption has increased overall since the 1996 policy began even though the production of oil has fallen more than 350,000 barrels a day since 2008 under that policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monaldi|first=Francisco|date=September 2015|title=THE IMPACT OF THE DECLINE IN OIL PRICES ON THE ECONOMICS, POLITICS AND OIL INDUSTRY OF VENEZUELA|url=|journal=Columbia SIPA: Center on Global Energy Policy|volume=|pages=|via=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company, has been losing money on these domestic transactions since the enactment of these policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Bella|first=Gabriella|date=February 2015|title=Energy Subsidies in Latin America and the Caribbean: Stocktaking and Policy Challenges|url=|journal=IMF Working Paper|volume=|pages=|via=IADB}}&lt;/ref&gt; These losses can also be attributed to the 2005 Petrocaribe agreement, under which Venezuela sells many surrounding countries petroleum at a reduced or preferable price; essentially a subsidy by Venezuela for countries that are a part of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robalino-López|first=Andrés|last2=Mena-Nieto|first2=Ángel|last3=García-Ramos|first3=José-Enrique|last4=Golpe|first4=Antonio A.|date=2015-01-01|title=Studying the relationship between economic growth, CO2 emissions, and the environmental Kuznets curve in Venezuela (1980–2025)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114007679|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=41|pages=602–614|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.08.081}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidizing of fossil fuels and consequent low cost of fuel at the pump has caused the creation of a large black market.

This is due to the large profits that can be gained by this act, as fuel is much more expensive in Colombia than in Venezuela.

=== Russia ===
Russia is one of the world’s energy powerhouses. It holds the world’s largest natural gas reserves (27% of total), the second-largest coal reserves, and the eighth-largest oil reserves.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Dansie|last2=Marc|first2=Lanteigne|last3=Overland|first3=Indra|date=2010-02-01|title=Reducing Energy Subsidies in China, India and Russia: Dilemmas for Decision Makers|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41667826|journal=Sustainability|volume=2|doi=10.3390/su2020475|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411174211/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41667826|archivedate=2018-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia is the world's third-largest energy subsidizer as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/|title=WEO - Energy Subsidies|website=worldenergyoutlook.org|access-date=2017-08-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815124551/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/|archivedate=2017-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country subsidizes electricity and natural gas as well as oil extraction. Approximately 60% of the subsidies go to natural gas, with the remainder spent on electricity (including under-pricing of gas delivered to power stations).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For oil extraction the government gives tax exemptions and duty reductions amounting to about 22 billion dollars a year.

===European Union===
In February 2011 and January 2012 the UK [[Energy Fair]] group, supported by other organisations and environmentalists, lodged formal complaints with the [[European Union|European Union's]] [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|Directorate General for Competition]], alleging that the Government was providing unlawful state aid in the form of subsidies for nuclear power industry, in breach of [[European Union competition law]].&lt;ref name=energyFair1&gt;[http://www.energyfair.org.uk/press-releases/legal-bid Legal bid to halt nuclear construction]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Energy Fair, published 2011-11-07, accessed 2012-01-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16646405 UK 'subsidising nuclear power unlawfully'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120175304/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16646405 |date=2012-01-20 }} [[BBC]], published 2012-01-20, accessed 2012-01-20&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest subsidies is the cap on liabilities for [[nuclear accident]]s which the nuclear power industry has negotiated with governments. “Like car drivers, the operators of nuclear plants should be properly insured,” said Gerry Wolff, coordinator of the Energy Fair group. The group calculates that, "if nuclear operators were fully insured against the cost of nuclear disasters like those at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]], the price of nuclear electricity would rise by at least €0.14 per kWh and perhaps as much as €2.36, depending on assumptions made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eaem.co.uk/news/complaint-about-nuclear-subsidies-may-prevent-new-reactor-builds |title=Complaint about nuclear subsidies may prevent new reactor builds |date=24 January 2012 |work=Energy and Environmental Management |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526080520/http://www.eaem.co.uk/news/complaint-about-nuclear-subsidies-may-prevent-new-reactor-builds |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the most recent statistics, subsidies for fossil fuels in Europe are exclusively allocated to coal (€10 billion) and natural gas (€6 billion).

'''Fergusonite''' is a mineral comprising a [[complex oxide]] of various rare-earth elements. The chemical formula of fergusonite species is (Y,REE)NbO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where REE = rare-earth elements in solid solution with [[Yttrium|Y]]. Yttrium is usually dominant (the species fergusonite-(Y)), but sometimes [[Cerium|Ce]] or [[Neodymium|Nd]] may predominate in molar proportion (species fergusonite-(Ce) and fergusonite-(Nd)). All the other [[rare-earth element]]s are present in subordinate amount, and [[tantalum]] substitutes for some of the [[niobium]]. There are [[Fergusonite-beta]]-(Nd), Fergusonite-beta-(Y), Fergusonite-beta-(Ce) too, but they are classified as 4.DG.10 in the [[Nickel–Strunz classification|Nickel–Strunz system]]. The mineral has [[tetragonal]] crystal symmetry and the same structure as [[scheelite]] (calcium tungstate, CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), but can be [[metamict]] (amorphous) due to radiation damage from its small content of [[thorium]].  It is found as needle-like or prismatic crystals in [[pegmatite]]. It was named after British politician and mineral collector [[Robert Ferguson of Raith]] (1767–1840).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst369.html Robert Ferguson of Raith].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">'''GPoT Center''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Küresel Siyasal Eğilimler Merkezi'') officially the '''Global Political Trends Center''' is a [[research]] unit, which was established by [[Mensur Akgun]] and [[Sylvia Tiryaki]] at the [[Istanbul Kültür University]] in [[Turkey]] in 2008. The mission of the Center is to conduct research, projects, to produce innovative [[publication]]s analyzing the latest issues in the international relations, to formulate viable political recommendations and to boost the dialogue between [[civil society]], [[academia]] and [[Mass media|media]].

== Activities ==

GPoT Center, as one of the leading Turkish [[think tank]]s, runs [[project]]s in various areas and has organized numerous [[Meeting|conferences]], workshops and round-table meetings focused on: the EU - Turkey relations, the [[Cyprus question]], the Turkey - [[Armenia]] relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-207740-us-meetings-reinvigorate-turkish-armenian-reconciliation.html US meetings reinvigorate Turkish-Armenian reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish - [[Arab]] dialogue, [[NATO]], second track [[diplomacy]] between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], Arab-Israeli conflict and other issues related to the international agenda in general and the agenda of Turkish [[foreign policy]] in particular.

The projects implemented by GPoT Center often involve participation of [[high-level]] politicians and [[opinion]] makers, however the Center is also active in organization of second-track diplomacy meetings aiming at effective conflict solution. For the purposes of second-track diplomacy, GPoT Center brings together representatives of conflicting parties, i.e. [[civil society]] activists, opinion leaders, as well as academics to discuss issues pertaining to solution of the relevant problem. The meetings are usually conducted in friendly atmosphere and under Chatam House rules.

== Publications ==

The Center publishes various types of publications available in the electronic as well as printed form. It has published a number of [[policy]] briefs analyzing issues in [[international relations]] and shorter essays, i.e. GPoT Briefs focusing on one topic from the current global issues. GPoT Center published its first two books on Cyprus issue in the summer 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtk.cc/index.php/lang/en/cat/2/news/50924 BRT: Rauf Denktash and Michael Moran write a book]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since then published other books on developments in Cyprus, Israeli-Turkish relations, as well as [[democratization]] of the [[Middle East]].

== Partners and Networks ==

The Center cooperates with institutions from [[Sweden]] - SIIA, [[Lebanon]] - CAUS, [[Qatar]] - ADF, [[United Kingdom]] - LSE, [[Czech Republic]] - EUROPEUM, [[Slovak Republic]] - SFPA, [[Armenia]] - EPF, YPC and Internews, [[Egypt]] - Ibn-Khaldun Center, and [[France]] - ENS. GPoT Center is also part of larger research and academic networks such as the United Nations's [[Alliance of Civilizations]], International Research and Security Network, [[United Nations]]' Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures.

The '''Garden of Ridván''' (literally ''garden of paradise'') or '''Najibiyyih Garden'''&lt;ref name="walbridge"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ridvan| title = Sacred Acts, Sacred Space, Sacred Time | first = John | last = Walbridge | year = 2005| url = http://bahai-library.com/walbridge_encyclopedia_ridvan | publisher = George Ronald | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 0-85398-406-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a wooded garden in what is now [[Baghdad]]'s [[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Rusafa District]], on the banks of the [[Tigris]] river. It is notable as the location where [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], stayed for twelve days from April 21 to May 2, 1863, after the [[Ottoman Empire]] exiled him from Baghdad and before commencing his journey to [[Constantinople]].  During his stay in this garden, Bahá'u'lláh announced to his followers that he was the [[messianic figure]] of [[He whom God shall make manifest]], whose coming had been foretold by the [[Báb]]. These events are celebrated annually during the [[Ridván|Festival of Ridván]].&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;

==Location and appearance==
[[File:Baghdad-map-1854.jpg|thumb|280px|Baghdad in the 1850s. The garden is located at the left of this map, above the Tigris River.]]
The garden was located in a large agricultural area immediately north of the walls of the city of Baghdad, about {{convert|450|m|ft}} from the city's northern Mu'azzam gate. Located on the eastern bank of the [[Tigris]] River in what is now the [[Bab Al-Moatham|Bab al-Mu'azzam]] neighbourhood of Baghdad's [[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Rusafa District]], it was directly opposite the district in which Bahá'u'lláh lived during his stay in the city, on the river's western bank.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rob1_1" /&gt;

A ground plan drawn in the 1850s by officers of the [[Royal Indian Navy|Indian Navy]] ''(pictured)'' shows the garden immediately adjacent to the city's citadel, with four avenues meeting at a circular area in the centre. A structure, possibly the garden palace, is located at the edge of the garden near the riverbank.&lt;ref name="1902eb"&gt;Henry Creswicke Rawlinson. [http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/B/BAG/baghdad.html Baghdad]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 10th ed. 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was described as a wooded garden&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt; having four "flower-bordered avenues" lined with roses,&lt;ref name="gpb" /&gt; which were collected by gardeners during Bahá'u'lláh's stay and piled in the center of his tent to be offered to visitors. "So great would be the heap," the chronicler [[Nabíl-i-A`zam]] relates, "that when His companions gathered to drink their morning tea in His presence, they would be unable to see each other across it."&lt;ref name="gpb" /&gt; [[Nightingale]]s were said to sing loudly in the garden, which, together with the fragrance of the roses, "created an atmosphere of beauty and enchantment".&lt;ref name="nightingale" group="nb"&gt;The love of the nightingale for the rose is a common theme in Persian literature, particularly in mystic poetry, where the nightingale's yearning is used as a metaphor for the soul's yearning for God. ({{cite web | url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/v11f1/v11f1034.html | title=The Rose and nightingale in Persian literature |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080122005248/http://www.iranica.com/articles/v11f1/v11f1034.html |archivedate = 2008-01-22}}) One night during his stay in the Garden of Ridván, Bahá'u'lláh is recorded as having spoken the following words: "Consider these nightingales. So great is their love for these roses, that sleepless from dusk till dawn, they warble their melodies and commune with burning passion with the object of their adoration. How then can those who claim to be afire with the rose-like beauty of the Beloved choose to sleep?"

In travelling to Constantinople, Bahá'u'lláh's caravan would take a road that would bring them by the garden, thus it was a logical choice for them stop there in order to assemble and to receive visitors. Access to the garden from the opposite riverbank was possible by way of a ferry across the Tigris, as in Bahá'u'lláh's case, or by "floating bridge",&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt; as in the case of the governor and other friends who followed.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rob1_1" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Necip Mehmet Paşa.JPG|thumb|145px|Muhammad Najib Pasha.]]
The Najibiyyih Garden, as it was first known, was named for [[Muhammad Najib Pasha]], the ''[[wāli]]'' (governor) of Baghdad from 1842 to 1847, who built the garden and an attached palace in what was originally an agricultural area outside the city.&lt;ref name="ceylan" /&gt; Although Najib Pasha died in May 1851, the garden was presumably in the hands of his heirs when it was used by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], during the period of April–May 1863.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;

Despite its importance to the Bahá'í community, the garden was never owned by the Bahá'ís. It was purchased by the government in 1870, and was used as a guest house for [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Nasruddin-Shah]]—who was responsible for Bahá'u'lláh's imprisonment and exile&lt;ref name="gpb"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/}}
&lt;/ref&gt;—when he visited Iraq in 1870. The park was further developed during the governorship of [[Midhat Pasha]] (1869–1872), who leveled the road leading to the garden and built another road, approximately 400–500 meters in length.&lt;ref name="ceylan"&gt;[http://www.belgeler.com/blg/rer/ottoman-centralization-and-modernization-in-the-province-of-baghdad-1831-1872-osmanli-bagdatinda-merkezlesme-ve-modernlesme-1831-1872 Ottoman centralization and modernization in the province of Baghdad, 1831-1872]. Ebubekir Ceylan. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The garden was cleared during the early twentieth century, to make way for the Royal Hospital.&lt;ref name="1928map" group="nb"&gt;A [http://www.tlemea.com/iraq/mapwindow.htm 1928 map] produced by the Public Works Department of the City of Baghdad shows the Royal Hospital on the site where the garden was once located. (National Archives of the United Kingdom)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baghdad Medical City]], a large complex of teaching hospitals, now stands in its place.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;

===Ridván===
{{Main|Ridván}}
Bahá'u'lláh, after being imprisoned in Persia for his involvement with the [[Bábism|Bábí]] community, was exiled to Baghdad by Nasruddin-Shah, arriving in the spring of 1853. Over the next decade in Baghdad, his influence grew to the point where the Persian government feared he might use it to threaten their sovereignty from abroad. In response, the Persian ambassador in Constantinople demanded Bahá'u'lláh be banished from Baghdad, to which the Ottoman government eventually acceded.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;

Bahá'u'lláh entered the Najibiyyih Garden on April 22, 1863, in order to receive visitors and allow his family to prepare for his upcoming trip to [[Constantinople]]. He crossed the [[Tigris]] in a small boat accompanied by his sons [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], [[Mírzá Mihdí]] and [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], his secretary Mirza Aqa Jan and some others.&lt;ref name="rob1_1"&gt;{{cite book |first=Adib |last= Taherzadeh |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 1 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 |page= 259 |url= http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/p257-282Ch16.html#p259}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their arrival in the garden, Bahá'u'lláh announced his mission and station for the first time to a small group of family and friends. For the next eleven days Bahá'u'lláh received visitors including the governor of Baghdad.  Bahá'u'lláh's family was not able to join him until April 30, the ninth day, since the river had risen and made travel to the garden difficult. On the twelfth day of their stay in the garden, Bahá'u'lláh and his family left the garden and started on their travel to Constantinople.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rob1_1" /&gt;

It was Bahá'u'lláh who gave the garden the name of ''Ridván'' ("paradise") during his stay, and the name was thereafter applied to the twelve-day [[Ridván|Festival of Ridván]]—known as the "King of Festivals"&lt;ref name ="aqdas_notes" /&gt;—celebrated annually by Bahá'ís between 21 April and 2 May.&lt;ref name="walbridge" /&gt; Certain days of this festival are tied to major events that took place during the period of Bahá'u'lláh's stay in the garden: the first day celebrates his arrival in the garden; the ninth day, the arrival of his family; and the twelfth day, his caravan's departure towards Constantinople. These three days are major [[Baha'i Holy Days|Bahá'í holy days]], on which work must be suspended.&lt;ref name="rob1_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="aqdas_notes"&gt;{{cite book |author=Universal House of Justice |year=1992 |title=The Kitáb-i-Aqdas | chapter = Notes |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-85398-999-0 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-155.html.iso8859-1#gr1 | pages = 213–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Goldberry''' is a supporting character from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Also known as the "River-woman's daughter", she is the wife of [[Tom Bombadil]]. Goldberry is described as a beautiful and (seemingly) young woman with golden hair.

==Fictional history==
Goldberry first appeared in Tolkien's writings in his 1934 poem, 'The Adventures of Tom Bombadil',&lt;ref&gt;H. Carpenter, ''J. R. R. Tolkien'' (London 2002) p. 216-7&lt;/ref&gt; [re-worked in  ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' (1962)].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'' (London 2001) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  The poem tells of how she drags Tom into the river, before he escapes, returning later to capture her and make her his bride.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'' (London 2001) p. 60-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the first book of ''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Frodo Baggins]] and his companions [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] encounter Goldberry and Tom in the [[Old Forest]] near [[Buckland (Middle-earth)|Buckland]]. The couple gives them shelter in their cottage after the [[Hobbit]]s are rescued from [[Old Man Willow]]. Their stay is brief but puzzling, for Tom and Goldberry are clearly more than they seem.

Although Goldberry's origins are uncertain, Bombadil clearly identifies her as having been found by him in the river and her title "River-woman's daughter" strongly suggests that she is not a mortal human being, but rather a spirit of the river [[Withywindle]] in the Old Forest of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]]. This is similar to the many named river spirits of traditional [[English folklore]] such as [[Jenny Greenteeth]] or [[Peg Powler]] of the [[River Tees]],&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'' (London 2001) p. 602&lt;/ref&gt; (though Goldberry is a noticeably gentler figure), or to the [[naiad]]s of the Greeks. Otherwise, she and Bombadil are enigmas in Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]], not fitting easily into any of his definitions of sentient beings in his imagined world.

One frequently proposed explanation is that she is a (minor) [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maia]] associated with the element of water and in some way with the river Withywindle in particular, though that is by no means the only possible answer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/Bombadil.html Tolkien Essays: What is Tom Bombadil?] Steuard Jensen 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D. Rateliff]] suggested that, at least in terms of Tolkien's early mythology, she should be seen as one of the wide category of [[Fairy|fays]], spirits, and elementals (including the Maia): "Thus [[Melian]] is a 'fay', (as, in all probability, are Goldberry and Bombadil; the one a nymph, the other a ''genius loci'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Rateliff, ''Mr Baggins'' (London 2007) p. 59 and p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
Goldberry and Tom are notably absent from most media adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Filmmakers [[Ralph Bakshi]] and [[Peter Jackson]] stated that the reason the characters were omitted from their films was because, in their view, he (Bombadil) does little to advance the story, and would make their films unnecessarily long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Peter Jackson | title = The Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Extended Edition Appendices | medium = DVD |date = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberry appears in the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. She can be found in "Goldberry's Glade" in the [[Old Forest]]. Her race is referred to as "River-maid". The game also features another member of this race, Goldberry's sister Naruhel, known as the Red Maid, who is of a darker and crueler nature. This is an original character not featured in Tolkien's writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1293">In the south German language (of the [[Alemannic dialects|Alemannic]]-speaking area, or in [[Switzerland]]), a '''''gäu''''' landscape (''gäulandschaft'') refers to an area of open, level countryside. These regions typically have fertile soils resulting from depositions of [[loess]] (an exception is the ''Arme Gäue'' ["Poor Gäus"] of the Baden-Württemberg [[Gäu (Baden-Württemberg)|Gäu]]).

The intensive use of the ''Gäu'' regions for [[crop]]s has displaced the originally wooded countryside (→''[[climax vegetation]]'' – in contrast with the steppe heath theory and disputed megaherbivore hypothesis). The North German equivalent of such landscapes is ''[[börde]].''

The '''Hanson Formation''' is a [[geologic formation]] on [[Mount Kirkpatrick]], [[Antarctica]]. It is one of only two major [[dinosaur]]-bearing rock formations found on the continent of [[Antarctica]] to date; the other is the [[Santa Marta Formation]] from the Late [[Cretaceous]]. The formation has yielded only a handful of [[Mesozoic]] specimens so far and most of it is as yet unexcavated. Part of the [[Victoria Group, Antarctica|Victoria Group]] of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], it is below the [[Prebble Formation]] and above the [[Falla Formation]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, D.H. (1996). ''The Hanson Formation: a new stratigraphical unit in the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.'' Antarctic Science 8(4):389-394.[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=221034&amp;jid=ANS&amp;volumeId=8&amp;issueId=04&amp;aid=221033]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paleofauna ==
The first dinosaur to be discovered from the Hanson Formation was the predator ''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' in 1991, which was then formally described in 1994. Alongside these dinosaur remains were fossilized trees, suggesting that plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. Other finds from the formation include [[tritylodonts]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal|mammal-like]] [[reptile]]s and crow-sized [[pterosaur]]s. Surprisingly were the discovery of [[prosauropod]] remains, which were found commonly on other continents only until the Early Jurassic. However, the bone fragments found at the Hanson Formation were dated until the Middle Jurassic, millions of years later. In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.

''Tritylodon'' was a species of [[tritylodontidae|tritylodont]], one of the most advanced group of [[cynodont]]s. It was small in size and had an [[herbivorous]] diet, something of an anomaly among the mostly carnivorous cynodonts. ''Tritylodon'' had many features of modern [[mammal]]s, but was [[oviparous|egg-laying]].

[[File:Hyperloop all cutaway.png|thumb|Concept art of Hyperloop inner workings|265x265px]]

A '''Hyperloop''' is a proposed mode of [[public transport|passenger]] and/or [[freight transport]]ation, first used to describe an open-source [[vactrain]] design released by a joint team from [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]].&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; Drawing heavily from [[Robert Goddard]]'s vactrain, a hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while being very efficient.

[[Elon Musk|Elon Musk's]] version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012,&lt;ref name="PandoDaily Hyperloop"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pando Monthly presents a fireside chat with Elon Musk |url=https://pando.com/2012/07/12/pandomonthly-presents-a-fireside-chat-with-elon-musk/ |website=pando.com |publisher=PandoDaily |access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on [[air bearing]]s driven by [[linear induction motor]]s and [[axial compressor]]s.&lt;ref name=gm20130822/&gt;

The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and examining a route running from the [[Los Angeles]] region to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], roughly following the [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] corridor. The paper conceived of a hyperloop system that would propel passengers along the {{convert|350|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=2}} route at a speed of {{convert|760|mph|km/h|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for this LA–SF suggested route were included in the white paper—{{US$|6 billion|link=yes}} for a passenger-only version, and {{US$|7.5 billion}} for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers and vehicles&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;—although transportation analysts had doubts that the system could be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that the Hyperloop would be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration construction, development, and operation costs.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPoAstronomical"/&gt;

The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX, and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further develop them.

To that end, a few companies have been formed, and several interdisciplinary student-led teams are working to advance the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/18/11965354/hyperloop-pod-competition-elon-musk-spacex-team-design|title=Here are the Hyperloop pods competing in Elon Musk's big race later this year|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=June 18, 2016 |website=The Verge|access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceX built an approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|-long|adj=mid}} [[scale model|subscale]] track for its [[Hyperloop pod competition|pod design competition]] at its headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=Here's a first look at the SpaceX Hyperloop test track|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/02/heres-a-first-look-at-the-spacex-hyperloop-test-track/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts are skeptical, saying that the proposals ignore the expenses and risks of developing the technology and that the idea is "completely impractical".&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/08/13/wolverton-elon-musks-hyperloop-hype-ignores-practical-problems/ |title=Wolverton: Elon Musk's Hyperloop hype ignores practical problems |first=Troy |last=Wolverton |work=The Mercury News |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims have also been made that the Hyperloop is too susceptible to disruption from a power outage or terror attacks to be considered safe.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;&lt;!--alpha doc covers this on page 53--&gt;

==History==

The general idea of trains or other transportation traveling [[vactrain|through evacuated tubes]] dates back more than a century, although the [[atmospheric railway]] was never a commercial success. &lt;!--[[Elon Musk]]'s Hyperloop uses only partial vacuum, with a compressor to absorb the pressure wave and avoid the Kantrowitz limit, with air-bearing skis, and linear induction motors, very low energy use per passenger-mile or ton-mile, storing energy so as to power the technology from solar over a 24-hour diurnal cycle, etc; however, that technical summary is better left in another section of this article, not History.--&gt;

Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a "fifth mode of transport", calling it the ''Hyperloop'', in July 2012 at a [[PandoDaily]] event in [[Santa Monica, California]]. This hypothetical high-speed mode of transportation would have the following characteristics: immunity to weather, collision free, twice the speed of a plane, low power consumption, and energy storage for 24-hour operations.&lt;ref name="pandovideo"/&gt;&lt;!-- approx. 43 minutes into the video recording --&gt; The name ''Hyperloop'' was chosen because it would go in a loop. Musk envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at [[hypersonic speed]].&lt;ref name="youtube20160131"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2VVp1GfmA |title=Elon Musk speaks at the Hyperloop Pod Award Ceremony |publisher=YouTube.com |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Musk likened the Hyperloop to a "cross between a [[Concorde]] and a [[railgun]] and an [[air hockey]] table".&lt;ref name="atd20130530"/&gt;

From late 2012 until August 2013, a group of engineers from both [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] worked on the conceptual modeling of Hyperloop.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"/&gt; An early system design was published in the Tesla and SpaceX blogs&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlphaTesla"/&gt; which describes one potential design, function, pathway, and cost of a hyperloop system.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; According to the alpha design, pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track on [[air bearings]] through tubes above ground on columns or below ground in tunnels to avoid the dangers of [[grade crossing]]s. An ideal hyperloop system will be more energy-efficient,&lt;ref name=EDS_power_consumption&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.pes-publications.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethpublications/22_Scaling_laws_for_electrodynamic_suspension_Flankl_accepted-version.pdf |title= Scaling laws for electrodynamic suspension in high-speed transportation |last1=Flankl |first1=Michael |last2=Wellerdieck |first2=Tobias |last3=Tüysüz |first3=Arda |last4=Kolar |first4=Johann W. |journal= IET Electric Power Applications |date=November 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018 |doi=10.1049/iet-epa.2017.0480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESC_Hyperloop"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.esc.ethz.ch/news/archive/2017/11/energy-efficiency-of-an-electrodynamically-levitated-hyperloop-pod.html |title=Energy Efficiency of an Electrodynamically Levitated Hyperloop Pod |publisher=Energy Science Center |date=November 29, 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; quiet, and [[vehicular automation|autonomous]] than existing modes of mass transit. Musk has also invited feedback to "see if the people can find ways to improve it". The Hyperloop Alpha was released as an [[open source]] design.&lt;ref name="globemail20130812"/&gt; The word mark "''HYPERLOOP''", applicable to "high-speed transportation of goods in tubes" was issued to SpaceX on April 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Word Mark HYPERLOOP|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4810:6uwa73.2.7|publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muoio|first1=Danielle|title=Everything we know about Elon Musk's ambitious Hyperloop plan|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-hyperloop-plan-boring-company-2017-8|accessdate=September 10, 2017|publisher=Business Insider|date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|-long|adj=mid}} test track to be located next to SpaceX's [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] facility. The track would be used to test pod designs supplied by third parties in the competition.&lt;ref name="CNNmoney-15-6-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFchronicle-6-15-15"/&gt;

By November 2015, with several commercial companies and dozens of student teams pursuing the development of Hyperloop technologies, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' asserted that "The Hyperloop Movement", as some of its unaffiliated members refer to themselves, is officially bigger than the man who started it."&lt;ref name=wsj20151130&gt;{{cite news |last=Chee |first=Alexander |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-race-to-create-elon-musks-hyperloop-heats-up-1448899356 |title=The Race to Create Elon Musk's Hyperloop Heats Up |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=November 30, 2015 |access-date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIT Hyperloop team developed the first Hyperloop pod prototype, which they unveiled at the MIT Museum on May 13, 2016. Their design uses [[electrodynamic suspension]] for levitating and [[eddy current brake|eddy current braking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Dave|title=Magnetic Hyperloop pod unveiled at MIT|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36292467|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=BBC|date=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and operation==
[[File:Hyperloop capsule.svg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Hyperloop capsule: [[Axial compressor]] on the front, passenger compartment in the middle, battery compartment at the back, and [[air caster]] skis at the bottom]]
[[File:Hyperloop.jpg|thumb|A 3D sketch of the Hyperloop infrastructure. The steel tubes are rendered transparent in this image.]]

Developments in [[high-speed rail]] have historically been impeded by the difficulties in managing [[friction]] and [[air resistance]],{{Citation needed|reason=The needed power to overcome drag per person on a long train shouldn't be that much that it eclipses the significance of the suspension, the real problem. Long vehicles have low skin drag coefficients because of the thicker boundary layer.|date=February 2018}} both of which become substantial when vehicles approach high speeds. The [[vactrain]] concept theoretically eliminates these obstacles by employing [[maglev|magnetically levitating]] trains in [[vacuum|evacuated]] (airless) or partly evacuated tubes, allowing for speeds of thousands of miles per hour. However, the high cost of [[maglev]] and the difficulty of maintaining a vacuum over large distances has prevented this type of system from ever being built. The Hyperloop resembles a vactrain system but operates at approximately {{convert|1|mbar|Pa|spell=in|lk=on}} of pressure.&lt;ref name="nova20130813"/&gt;

===Initial design concept===

The Hyperloop concept operates by sending specially designed "capsules" or "pods" through a steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum. In Musk's original concept, each capsule floats on a {{convert|0.5-1.3|mm|in|2|order=flip|abbr=on}} layer of air provided under pressure to [[air caster|air-caster]] "skis", similar to how pucks are levitated above an [[air hockey]] table, while still allowing faster speeds than wheels can sustain. [[Hyperloop One]]'s technology uses passive [[maglev]] for the same purpose. [[Linear induction motor]]s located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the appropriate speed for each section of the tube route. With [[rolling resistance]] eliminated and air resistance greatly reduced, the capsules can [[gliding flight|glide]] for the bulk of the journey. In Musk's original Hyperloop concept, an electrically driven [[ducted fan|inlet fan]] and [[axial compressor]] would be placed at the nose of the capsule to "actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the vessel", resolving the problem of air pressure building in front of the vehicle, slowing it down.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; A fraction of the air is shunted to the skis for additional pressure, augmenting that gain passively from lift due to their shape. Hyperloop One's system does away with the compressor.

In the alpha-level concept, passenger-only pods are to be {{convert|2.23|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; and projected to reach a top speed of {{convert|760|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to maintain aerodynamic efficiency.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt; (Section 4.4)&lt;/sup&gt; The design proposes passengers experience a maximum inertial [[g-force|acceleration]] of 0.5&amp;nbsp;g, about 2 or 3 times that of a commercial airliner on takeoff and landing.

===Proposed routes===
[[File:Interstate5 map.png|thumb|206x206px|Interstate 5]]

A number of routes have been proposed for Hyperloop systems that meet the approximate distance conditions for which a Hyperloop is hypothesized to provide improved transport times. Route ''proposals'' range from speculation described in company releases to [[business case]]s to signed agreements.

====United States====

The route suggested in the 2013 alpha-level design document was from the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. That conceptual system would begin around [[Sylmar, California|Sylmar]], just south of the [[Tejon Pass]], follow [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] to the north, and arrive near [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] on the east side of San Francisco Bay. Several proposed branches were also shown in the design document, including [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Diego]], and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;

No work has been done on the route proposed in Musk's alpha-design; one cited reason is that it would terminate on the fringes of the two major metropolitan areas (Los Angeles and San Francisco), resulting in significant cost savings in construction, but requiring that passengers traveling to and from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and San Francisco, and any other community beyond Sylmar and Hayward, to transfer to another transportation mode in order to reach their final destination. This would significantly lengthen the total travel time to those destinations.&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;

A similar problem already affects present-day air travel, where on short routes (like LAX-SFO) the flight time is only a rather small part of door to door travel time. Critics have argued that this would significantly reduce the proposed cost and/or time savings of Hyperloop as compared to the [[California High-Speed Rail]] project that will serve downtown stations in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/loopy-ideas-are-fine-if-youre-an-entrepreneur |title=Loopy Ideas Are Fine, If You're an Entrepreneur |work=Pedestrian Observations |first=Alon |last=Levy |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stopandmove.blogspot.de/2013/08/hyperloop-proposal-bad-joke-or-attempt.html |title=Hyperloop proposal: Bad joke or attempt to sabotage California HSR project? |work=Stop and Move |first=James |last=Sinclair |date=August 12, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/19848/musks-hyperloop-math-doesnt-add-up |title=Musk's Hyperloop math doesn't add up |work=Greater Greater Washington |first=Matt |last=Johnson |date=August 14, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers travelling financial centre to financial centre are estimated to save about two hours by taking the Hyperloop instead of driving the whole distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/pipedreams |title=Pipedreams |work=Transport and Travel |first=Pat |last=Humphreys |date=March 23, 2016 |access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others questioned the cost projections for the suggested California route. Some transportation engineers argued in 2013 that they found the alpha-level design cost estimates unrealistically low given the scale of construction and reliance on unproven technology. The technological and [[economic feasibility]] of the idea is unproven and a subject of significant debate.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPoAstronomical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;

In November, 2017, [[Arrivo]] announced a plan for a maglev automobile transport system from [[Aurora, Colorado]] to [[Denver International Airport]], the first leg of a system from downtown Denver.&lt;ref name="fm171114"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Aric|title=A Guy Named Brogan BamBrogan Wants to Bring a 200 mph Hyperloop to Denver.

In February 2018, [[Hyperloop Transportation Technologies]] announced a similar plan for a loop connecting [[Chicago]] and [[Cleveland]] and a loop connecting [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/02/whos-ready-to-hyperloop-to-cleveland/554117 |title=Who's Ready to Hyperloop to Cleveland? |work=CityLab |first=Meredith Rutland |last=Bauer |date=February 23, 2018 |access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
[[Hyperloop Transportation Technologies]] are in process to sign a Letter of Intent with the Indian Government for a proposed route between [[Chennai]] and [[Bengaluru]]. If things go as planned, the distance of 345&amp;nbsp;km could be covered in 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/shipping-/-transport/india-in-talks-to-build-hyperloop-two-indian-companies-involved-in-the-project/articleshow/55832973.cms |title=India in talks to build Hyperloop; two Indian companies involved in the project |first=BENGALURU |last=technology |work=ET online |date=December 7, 2016 |accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTT also signed an agreement with [[Andhra Pradesh]] government to build [[India]]'s first Hyperloop project connecting [[Amaravathi]] to [[Vijayawada]] in a 6-minute ride.
On February 22, 2018, [[Hyperloop One]] has entered into a MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with the [[Government of Maharashtra]] to build a hyperloop transportation system between [[Mumbai]] and [[Pune]] that would cut the travel time from the current 180 minutes to just 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/mumbai-pune-25-minute-hyperloop-ride-by-2024-could-be-a-pipe-dream-2512623.html|title=Mumbai-Pune 25-minute Hyperloop ride by 2024 could be a pipe dream|website=Moneycontrol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.brinkwire.com/164660/virgin-hyperloop-one-to-link-pune-to-mumbai/|title=Brinkwire|website=en.brinkwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source design evolution===
In September 2013, [[Ansys]] Corporation ran [[computational fluid dynamics]] simulations to model the aerodynamics of the capsule and [[shear stress]] forces that the capsule would be subjected to. The simulation showed that the capsule design would need to be significantly reshaped to avoid creating [[supersonic]] airflow, and that the gap between the tube wall and capsule would need to be larger. Ansys employee Sandeep Sovani said the simulation showed that Hyperloop has challenges but that he is convinced it is feasible.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNet"/&gt;

In October 2013, the development team of the [[OpenMDAO]] software framework released an unfinished, conceptual open-source model of parts of the Hyperloop's propulsion system. The team asserted that the model demonstrated the concept's feasibility, although the tube would need to be {{convert|4|m|order=flip}} in diameter,&lt;ref name="openmdao"/&gt; significantly larger than originally projected. However, the team's model is not a true working model of the propulsion system, as it did not account for a wide range of technological factors required to physically construct a Hyperloop based on Musk's concept, and in particular had no significant estimations of component weight.&lt;ref name="github-mdao"/&gt;

In November 2013, [[MathWorks]] analyzed the proposal's suggested route and concluded that the route was mainly feasible. The analysis focused on the [[g-force|acceleration]] experienced by passengers and the necessary deviations from public roads in order to keep the accelerations reasonable; it did highlight that maintaining a trajectory along I-580 east of San Francisco at the planned speeds was not possible without significant deviation into heavily populated areas.&lt;ref name="mathworks20131122"/&gt;

In January 2015, a paper based on the NASA [[OpenMDAO]] open-source model reiterated the need for a larger diameter tube and a reduced cruise speed closer to Mach 0.85. It recommended removing on-board heat exchangers based on thermal models of the interactions between the compressor cycle, tube, and ambient environment. The compression cycle would only contribute 5% of the heat added to the tube, with 95% of the heat attributed to radiation and convection into the tube. The weight and volume penalty of on-board heat exchangers would not be worth the minor benefit, and regardless the steady-state temperature in the tube would only reach {{convert|30|-|40|F-change|C-change}} above ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="Chin2015"/&gt;

According to Musk, various aspects of the Hyperloop have technology applications to other Musk interests, including [[surface transportation on Mars]] and [[Musk electric jet|electric jet propulsion]].&lt;ref name=fortune20160131&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=David Z. |url=http://fortune.com/2016/01/31/mit-wins-hyperloop-competition-and-elon-musk-drops-in |title=MIT Wins Hyperloop Competition, And Elon Musk Drops In |work=Fortune |date=January 31, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musk20160130&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2VVp1GfmA|title=Elon Musk speaks at the Hyperloop Pod Award Ceremony|publisher=YouTube.com|first=Elon|last=Musk|date=January 30, 2016|access-date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers associated with MIT's department of Aeronautics and Astronautics published research in June 2017 that verified the challenge of [[aerodynamic]] design near the [[Kantrowitz limit]] that had been theorized in the original SpaceX Alpha-design concept released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hyperloop.mit.edu/uploads/7/6/1/8/76180385/opgenoordcaplan_2017_aerodynamics_hyperloop_online.pdf |title=On the Aerodynamic Design of the Hyperloop Concept |first1=Max M.

===Mars===
According to Musk, Hyperloop would be useful on Mars as no tubes would be needed because Mars' atmosphere is about 1% the density of the Earth's at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.universetoday.com/22603/mars-compared-to-earth/ |title=Mars Compared to Earth |last=Williams |first=Matt |date=July 3, 2017 |website=Universe Today |access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube20160131"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation20150713"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/elon-musks-high-speed-hyperloop-train-makes-more-sense-for-mars-than-california-43686 |title=Elon Musk's high-speed Hyperloop train makes more sense for Mars than California |work=The Conversation |first=Leon |last=Vanstone |date=July 13, 2015 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.techinsider.io/elon-musk-talks-hyperloop-on-mars-2016-2 |title=Elon Musk talks Hyperloop on Mars |first=Danielle |last=Muoio |work=Tech Insider |date=February 6, 2016 |access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Hyperloop concept to work on Earth, low-pressure tubes are required to reduce air resistance. However, if they were to be built on Mars, the lower air resistance would allow a Hyperloop to be created with no tube, only a track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/127356/hyperloop-on-mars |title=Musk Says Hyperloop Could Work On Mars...

The sled was stopped at the end of the test by hitting a pile of sand at the end of the track, because the test was not intended to test braking components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3585662/It-works-Elon-Musk-s-super-fast-Hyperloop-successfully-demonstrated-Las-Vegas.html |title=Elon Musk's Hyperloop is successfully demonstrated in Las Vegas |first1=Ellie |last1=Zolfagharifard |first2=Richard |last2=Gray |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=Australia |date=May 12, 2016 |access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Hyperloop One released a preliminary study that suggested a Hyperloop connection between [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]] would be feasible, reducing the travel time between the cities to half an hour.

A number of student and non-student teams were participating in a [[Hyperloop pod competition]] in 2015–16, and at least 22 of them built hardware to compete on a sponsored hyperloop test track in mid-2016.&lt;ref name=verge20160130&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins |first=Andrew J. |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/30/10877442/elon-musk-spacex-hyperloop-competition-awards |title=MIT wins SpaceX's Hyperloop competition, and Elon Musk made a cameo |work=The Verge |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, [[SpaceX]] announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop pod design competition, and would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California]] for the competitive event in 2016.&lt;ref name="NBChyperloop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hyper-pod-competition"/&gt; SpaceX stated in their announcement, "Neither SpaceX nor Elon Musk is affiliated with any Hyperloop companies. While we are not developing a commercial Hyperloop ourselves, we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop prototype."&lt;ref name="spacexhyperloop"/&gt;

More than 700 teams had submitted preliminary applications by July,&lt;ref name="binsider20150623"/&gt; and detailed competition rules were released in August.&lt;ref name=rules_v20/&gt; ''Intent to Compete'' submissions were due in September 2015 with more detailed tube and technical specification released by SpaceX in October. A preliminary design briefing was held in November 2015, where more than 120 student engineering teams were selected to submit ''Final Design Packages'' due by January 13, 2016.&lt;ref name=gw20151215&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/124-teams-sign-up-for-spacex-founder-elon-musks-hyperloop-pod-race |title=More than 120 teams picked for SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Hyperloop contest |work=Geekwire.com |first=Alan |last=Boyle |date=December 15, 2015 |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Design Weekend'' was held at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] January 29–30, 2016, for all invited entrants.&lt;ref name="tamu201510"/&gt; Engineers from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] were named the winners of the competition.

==Criticism and human factor considerations==
Some critics of Hyperloop focus on the experience—possibly unpleasant and frightening—of riding in a narrow, sealed, windowless capsule inside a sealed steel tunnel, that is subjected to significant [[g-force|acceleration forces]]; high noise levels due to air being compressed and ducted around the capsule at near-sonic speeds; and the vibration and jostling.&lt;ref name="insider20130820"/&gt; Even if the tube is initially smooth, ground may shift with seismic activity. At high speeds, even minor deviations from a straight path may add considerable buffeting.&lt;ref name="verge20130816"/&gt; This is in addition to practical and logistical questions regarding how to best deal with safety issues such as equipment malfunction, accidents, and emergency evacuations.

Other [[maglev]] trains are already in use, which avoid much of the added costs of Hyperloop. The [[SCMaglev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/japans-maglev-train-notches-up-new-world-speed-record-in-test-run|title=Japan's maglev train breaks world speed record with 600km/h test run|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=April 21, 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan has demonstrated {{convert|603|km/h|mph|abbr=on|0}} without a vacuum tube, by using an extremely aerodynamic train design. It also avoids the cost and time required to pressurize and depressurize the exit and entry points of a Hyperloop tube.

There is also the criticism of design technicalities in the tube system. Prof. John Hansman has stated problems, such as how a slight misalignment in the tube would be compensated for and the potential interplay between the air cushion and the low-pressure air. He has also questioned what would happen if the power were to go out when the pod was miles away from a city. Prof. Richard Muller has also expressed concern regarding "[the Hyperloop's] novelty and the vulnerability of its tubes, [which] would be a tempting target for terrorists", and that the system could be disrupted by everyday dirt and grime.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;

==Political and economic considerations==
The alpha proposal projected that cost savings compared with conventional rail would come from a combination of several factors. The small profile and elevated nature of the alpha route would enable Hyperloop to be constructed primarily in the median of [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]]. However, whether this would be truly feasible is a matter of debate. The low profile would reduce tunnel boring requirements and the light weight of the capsules is projected to reduce construction costs over conventional passenger rail. It was asserted that there would be less [[right-of-way]] opposition and environmental impact as well due to its small, sealed, elevated profile versus that of a rail easement;&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; however, other commentators contend that a smaller footprint does not guarantee less opposition.&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt; In criticizing this assumption, [[mass transportation]] writer Alon Levy said, "In reality, an all-elevated system (which is what Musk proposes with the Hyperloop) is a bug rather than a feature. Central Valley land is cheap; pylons are expensive, as can be readily seen by the costs of elevated highways and trains all over the world".&lt;ref name="NationalReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoWonkBlog"/&gt; Michael Anderson, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at [[UC Berkeley]], predicted that costs would amount to around {{US$|100 billion}}.&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;

The Hyperloop white paper suggests that {{US$|20}} of each one-way passenger ticket between Los Angeles and San Francisco would be sufficient to cover initial [[capital (economics)|capital costs]], based on amortizing the cost of Hyperloop over 20 years with ridership projections of 7.4 million per year in each direction and does not include operating costs (although the proposal asserts that electric costs would be covered by solar panels). No total [[fare|ticket price]] was suggested in the alpha design.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; The projected ticket price has been questioned by Dan Sperling, director of the [[Institute of Transportation Studies]] at [[UC Davis]], who stated that "there's no way the economics on that would ever work out."&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;

The early cost estimates of the Hyperloop are a subject of debate. A number of economists and transportation experts have expressed the belief that the {{US$|6 billion}} price tag dramatically understates the cost of designing, developing, constructing, and testing an all-new form of transportation.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoWonkBlog"/&gt; ''The Economist'' said that the estimates are unlikely to "be immune to the [[cost overrun|hypertrophication of cost]] that every other grand infrastructure project seems doomed to suffer."&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

Political impediments to the construction of such a project in California will be very large. There is a great deal of "political and [[reputation capital]]" invested in the existing mega-project of [[California High-Speed Rail]].&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt; Replacing that with a different design would not be straightforward given California's political economy. Texas has been suggested as an alternate for its more amenable political and economic environment.&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

Building a successful Hyperloop sub-scale demonstration project could reduce the political impediments and improve cost estimates. Musk has suggested that he may be personally involved in building a demonstration prototype of the Hyperloop concept, including funding the development effort.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

The solar panels Musk plans to install along the length of the Hyperloop system have been criticized by Prof. Roger Goodall, as not being feasible enough to return enough energy to power the Hyperloop system, arguing that the air pumps and propulsion would require much more power than the solar panels could generate.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;

===Historical===

The concept of transportation of passengers in pneumatic tubes is not new. The first patent to transport goods in tubes was taken out in 1799 by the British mechanical engineer and inventor [[George Medhurst]]. In 1812, Medhurst wrote a book detailing his idea of transporting passengers and goods through air-tight tubes using air propulsion.&lt;ref name="business20130715"/&gt;

In the early 1800s, there were other similar systems proposed or experimented with and were generally known as an [[atmospheric railway]] although this term is also used for systems where the propulsion is provided by a separate pneumatic tube to the train tunnel itself.

One of the earliest was the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] which operated near Dublin between 1844 and 1854.

The [[Crystal Palace pneumatic railway]] operated in London around 1864 and used large fans, some {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, that were powered by a steam engine. The tunnels are now lost but the line operated successfully for over a year.

Operated from 1870 to 1873, the [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] was a one-block-long prototype of an underground tube transport public transit system in [[New York City]]. The system worked at near-atmospheric pressure, and the passenger car moved by means of higher-pressure air applied to the back of the car while somewhat lower pressure was maintained on the front of the car.&lt;ref name="sa18700305"/&gt;

In the 1910s, vacuum trains were first described by American rocket pioneer [[Robert Goddard]].&lt;ref name=economist20130817/&gt; While the Hyperloop has significant innovations over early proposals for reduced pressure or vacuum-tube transportation apparatus, the work of Goddard "appears to have the greatest overlap with the Hyperloop".&lt;ref name="gm20130822"/&gt;

Princeton Physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] wrote about transcontinental trains using magnetic propulsion in his book "2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future". While a work of fiction, this book was an attempt to predict future technologies in everyday life. In his prediction, he envisioned these trains which used magnetic levitation running in underground tunnels which had much of the air evacuated to increase speed and reduce friction. He also demonstrated a scale prototype device that accelerated a mass using magnetic propulsion to high speeds. It was called a mass driver and was a central theme in his non-fiction book on space colonization "The High Frontier".

[[Swissmetro]] was a proposal to run a maglev train in a low-pressure environment. Concessions were granted to Swissmetro in the early 2000s to connect the Swiss cities of St. Gallen, Zurich, Basel, and Geneva. Studies of commercial feasibility reached differing conclusions and the vactrain was never built.&lt;ref name="swissmetro"/&gt;

China was reported to be building a vacuum based {{convert|1000|km/h|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|round=50}} maglev train in August 2010 according to a laboratory at Jiaotong University. It was expected to cost {{CNY|10–20 million|link=yes}} ({{US$|2.95 million}} at the August 2010 exchange rate) more per kilometer than regular high-speed rail.&lt;ref name="engadgetsumohurd20100804"/&gt; {{As of|2017|5}}, it has not been built.

===Current===
The [[ET3 Global Alliance]] (ET3) was founded by Daryl Oster in 1997 with the goal of establishing a global transportation system using passenger capsules in frictionless [[magnetic levitation|maglev]] full-vacuum tubes. Oster and his team met with Elon Musk on September 18, 2013, to discuss the technology,&lt;ref name="futurist20131030"/&gt; resulting in Musk promising an investment in a {{convert|3|mi|km|0|adj=on}} prototype of ET3's proposed design.&lt;ref name="denver20130809"/&gt;{{update after|2015|6|17}}&lt;!-- so what is the status of this? are ET3 building anything? --&gt;

==In popular culture==
There are multiple examples of depressurized tubes in literature and media going back to the 19th century. [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1972 book ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' is an early [[steampunk]] book that give explicit details about how such a system would work both on land and at sea – including the use of underwater bridges to float the tubes across the depths beyond the continental shelf. [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s follow-on to ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'', used a very similar concept – called a "subshuttle" in the program – to quickly move characters from place to place.

[[File:Ice_Volcano_over_Lake_Michigan,_March_2013.jpg|thumb|right|An ice volcano over [[Lake Michigan]].]]
An '''ice volcano''' is a conical mound of ice formed over a terrestrial lake via the eruption of [[water]] and [[slush]] through an [[ice shelf]]. The process is wave-driven, with wind providing the energy for the waves to cut through the ice and form the [[volcano]]es.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune"&gt;{{cite news |last=Swasko |first=Mick |date=2015-02-12 |title='Ice volcanoes' are a frozen Chicago beach phenomenon |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-chicago-beach-ice-volcanoes-20150212-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being ejected into the atmosphere, the liquid water and slush freeze and fall back to the surface, growing the formation. Ice may also be erupted. The phenomenon is most often observed along the southern coast of [[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]], when the temperature is below freezing and the wind blows onshore with a velocity of at least 40&amp;nbsp;km/h. They are known to reduce coastal [[erosion]] there. The formations are temporary — they are frequently destroyed by storms and warm weather, and once the lake wholly freezes over, eruptions are no longer possible.&lt;ref name="Fahnestock1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fahnestock |first1=R. K. |last2=Crowley |first2=D. J. |last3=Wilson |first3=M. |last4=Schneider |first4=H. |date=1973 |title=Ice Volcanoes of the Lake Erie Shore Near Dunkirk, New York, U.S.A. |url=https://www.igsoc.org/journal/12/64/igs_journal_vol12_issue064_pg93-99.pdf |journal=Journal of Glaciology |volume=12 |issue=64 |pages=93–99 |doi= |access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no consensus name for this phenomenon. Due to its similarity to volcanism and particularly [[cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]], the term "ice volcano" is frequently used, but it remains controversial.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fahnestock1973"/&gt; Unlike [[geysers]] and related structures, ice volcanoes are not [[hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]].

The uplifts may attract a number of visitors, but they are dangerous, and experts warn that people may fall through the ice or slip into the cold lake. Ice volcanoes are used by [[snowy owls]] as hunting platforms to search for [[waterfowl]].&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weather"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://weather.com/science/nature/news/great-lakes-oddity-ice-volcanoes-20140301 |title=A Great Lakes Oddity: Ice Volcanoes (PHOTOS) |last1=Burlingame |first1=Liz |last2= |first2= |publisher=The Weather Company |date=2014-03-01 |website=The Weather Channel |access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
These features are distinct from [[pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridges]],&lt;ref name="LeonardBryan1972"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leonard Bryan |first1=M. |last2=Marcus |first2=Melvin G. |last3= |first3= |last4= |first4= |date=September 1972 |title=Physical Characteristics of Near-Shore Ice Ridges |jstor=40508045|journal=Arctic |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=182–192 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are uplifts formed by the compression of ice against a shoreline or another [[ice floe|floe]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jeffries |first=Martin O. |editor1-last=Rafferty |editor1-first=John P. |title=Sea ice |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |date=December 29, 2006 |publisher= |location=Chicago |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ice volcanoes are created by waves colliding with irregularities at the edge of an ice sheet. The abnormalities concentrate the wave energy in a small area, where the ice is eroded to form a V-shaped channel. Spray, ice, and slush splashing out of the feature create a volcanic cone at the channel's shoreward end. This process takes only a few hours.&lt;ref name="Fahnestock1973"/&gt; The lakeward end of the channel may then by sealed by ice, but the volcano may continue to erupt. A wave [[amplitude]] of at least one meter is needed to induce eruptions, so ice volcanoes are rarely active without storm-force winds. Formation near land is suppressed by [[reef]]s and [[shoals]], which absorb the wave energy needed for the phenomenon. Nonetheless, they may produce larger cones further out at sea, where the greater depth makes this possible.&lt;ref name="MTU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/ice/ |title=Ice Volcanoes of Lake Superior's South Shore |last1=Dolan |first1=Michael |last2=Kimberly |first2=Paul |publisher=Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences at Michigan Technological University |date=2011-02-07 |website=Michigan Technological University |access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formation is more thoroughly suppressed by powerful storms, which erode the ice too fast for mound creation.&lt;ref name="Fahnestock1973"/&gt;

One type of ice volcano, known as a cold spot, does not require waves to break against the edge of an ice shelf. Instead, water and slush erupt through a region of weak ice near the coast and form a mound. This is analogous to a [[geological hotspot]].&lt;ref name="MTU"/&gt;

==Appearance and eruptions==
[[Fast ice|Landfast ice]] is required, so the volcanoes normally form near land. They are found in successive rows, and within one row, the features usually have equal height and spacing. However, when comparing two rows, the height and spacing may be drastically different.&lt;ref name="Fahnestock1973"/&gt; Ice volcanoes range in height from less than one meter to ten meters, with the largest ones located far from the shore.&lt;ref name="MTU"/&gt; Eruptions over ten meters high have been observed, but it is believed that the height of the eruptions are proportional to the size of the mounds. A single eruption may increase the height of the volcano by several centimeters.&lt;ref name="Fahnestock1973"/&gt; When an eruption occurs above 0&amp;nbsp;°C, however, the water erodes the uplift instead of expanding it. Spacing is determined by the amplitude and direction of the waves. In general, the appearance and number of ice volcanoes change considerably between winters.&lt;ref name="MTU"/&gt;

Different types of ice volcanoes have been compared to [[shield volcano]]es and [[stratovolcano]]es. They are noted for their symmetry. Cold spot volcanoes are particularly symmetrical, but their eruption has not been observed.&lt;ref name="MTU"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19637">[[File:Voice of Turkey Interval Signal.ogg|thumb|The interval signal of [[Voice of Turkey]] as heard in 2013.]]
An '''interval signal''', or '''tuning signal''', is a characteristic sound or musical phrase used in [[international broadcasting]], [[numbers stations]], and by some domestic broadcasters, played before commencement or during breaks in transmission, but most commonly between programmes in different languages. It serves several purposes:
* It assists a listener to tune his or her radio to the correct frequency of the station. This is because most older and cheaper radio receivers do not have digital frequency readout.
* It informs other stations that the frequency is in use.
* It serves as a station identifier even if the language used in the subsequent broadcast is not one the listener understands.

The practice began in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s and was carried over into [[shortwave]] broadcasts.  The use of interval signals has declined with the advent of digital tuning systems, but has not vanished. Interval signals were not required on commercial channels in the USA, where jingles were used as identification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59949">'''Foreign broadcasting''' is [[broadcasting]] with a foreign element.

The foreign element may be the territory of the audience, its [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or both.
* Foreign country and ethnicity: an [[International broadcasting|external service]] aimed at ''foreign societies'' in general. Its purpose may be information about the country of origin, about the target country from an outside point of view as well as [[Religious broadcasting|missionary]] or [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] purposes.
* Foreign territory: an external service aimed at ''[[expatriate]]s''. A special audience among expatriates is armed forces personnel, for whom broadcasting is often done not only from the home country, but also from within the country of [[Military deployment|deployment]].
* Foreign ethnicity: a service for ''foreign [[community|communities]] within the country of broadcasting'' (like [[Immigration|migrant]]s, [[refugee]]s, [[tourism|tourists]]), which in turn is to be distinguished from broadcasting for indigenous and other non-foreign groups (''see also [[Minority language broadcasting]]'').

===Washington===
[[File:Boulder Glacier 3593.JPG|right|thumb|[[Boulder Glacier (Washington)|Boulder Glacier]], [[Mount Baker]]]]
There are approximately 186 named glaciers in Washington according to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington State Glaciers Feature Query Results|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=132:2:3567307312029887::NO:RP::|work=Geographic Names Information System|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens eliminated nine of its eleven named glaciers and only the new glacier known as Crater Glacier has been reestablished since.

The [[United States]] has 60 [[protected area]]s known as national parks&lt;ref name="NPSAboutus"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm |title=National Park System (U.S. National Park Service) |date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are operated by the [[National Park Service]], an agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]. National parks must be established by an act of the [[United States Congress]]. A bill creating the first national park, [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], was signed into law by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1872, followed by [[Mackinac National Park]] in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then [[Rock Creek Park]] (later merged into [[National Capital Parks]]), [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] in 1890. The [[National Park Service Organic Act|Organic Act]] of 1916 created the National Park Service "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.nps.gov/air/Regs/npsOrganic.cfm|title=NPS Organic Act Overview|date=17 January 2007|website=nature.nps.gov|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=26 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206142738/https://www.nature.nps.gov/air/regs/npsorganic.cfm|archivedate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many current national parks had been previously protected as [[National Monument (United States)|national monuments]] by the president under the [[Antiquities Act]] before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks (including six in [[Alaska]]) are paired with a [[national preserve]], areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate [[List of the United States National Park System official units|units]] and whose areas are not included in the figures below.
Criteria for the selection of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). National monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance. Fourteen national parks are designated [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s (WHS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/?search=&amp;searchSites=&amp;search_by_country=United+States&amp;region=&amp;search_yearinscribed=&amp;themes=&amp;criteria_restrication=&amp;type=&amp;media=&amp;order=country&amp;description= |title=World Heritage List - United States of America |website=whc.unesco.org |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=25 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225001929/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/?search=&amp;searchSites=&amp;search_by_country=United%2BStates&amp;region=&amp;search_yearinscribed=&amp;themes=&amp;criteria_restrication=&amp;type=&amp;media=&amp;order=country&amp;description= |archivedate=25 February 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while 21 national parks are designated UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme#Biosphere reserves|Biosphere Reserves]] (BR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/united-states-of-america/ |title=UNESCO » Biosphere Reserves » United States of America |date=November 2015 |website=unesco.org |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=22 February 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222235151/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/united-states-of-america/ |archivedate=22 February 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight national parks are designated in both UNESCO programs.

Twenty-eight states have national parks, as do the territories of [[American Samoa]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. [[California]] has the most (nine), followed by [[Alaska]] (eight), [[Utah]] (five), and [[Colorado]] (four). The largest national park is [[Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell–St. Elias]] in Alaska: at over {{convert|8|e6acre|km2|0}}, it is larger than each of the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|nine smallest states]]. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is [[Gateway Arch National Park]], [[Missouri]], at approximately {{convert|192.83|acre|km2}}. The total area protected by national parks is approximately {{convert|52.2|e6acre|km2}}, for an average of {{convert|870|e3acre|km2}} but a [[median]] of only {{convert|229|e3acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Index2012-2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Parks: Index 2012–2016|publisher=National Park Service|location=Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/upload/NPIndex2012-2016.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2018|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113065657/https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/upload/NPIndex2012-2016.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The national parks set a visitation record in 2017, with more than 84 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Visitation by Park Type or Region for: 2017 By Park Type|url=https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Annual%20Visitation%20by%20Park%20Type%20or%20Region%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)|website=Irma.NPS.gov|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most-visited national park is [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in North Carolina and Tennessee, with over 11.3 million visitors in 2017, followed by Arizona's [[Grand Canyon National Park]], with over 6.2 million. In contrast, only 11,177 people visited the remote [[Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve]] in Alaska in the same year.&lt;ref name=Visitors/&gt;

A few former national parks are [[List of areas in the United States National Park System#Disbanded national parks|no longer designated as such]], or have been disbanded.

During April 25–28, 2011, the local [[weather forecast office]]s of the [[National Weather Service]] confirmed 359 tornadoes in the [[United States]], and [[Environment Canada]] confirmed another in [[Ontario]]. These tornadoes were part of a major outbreak of tornadoes, the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], in which 360 tornadoes touched down across 21 states in the [[Southern United States|Southern]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]], and [[Northeastern United States]] and in [[Ontario|Ontario, Canada]]. As the outbreak developed on April 25, numerous tornadoes touched down across [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]], with an EF3 near [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas]] that caused significant damage and killed one person and a long-track EF2 tornado in the [[Vilonia, Arkansas]] area that killed four people and injured 16 others after being on the ground for over one hour.&lt;ref name="0425rpt"&gt;{{cite web|title=20110425's Storm Reports (1200 UTC − 1159 UTC)|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110425_rpts.html|work=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014|date=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NWSLittleRockApr25-26"&gt;{{cite web|work=National Weather Service Office in Little Rock, Arkansas|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=May 14, 2011|accessdate=December 30, 2013|title=Heavy Rain/Severe Weather on April 23–27, 2011|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lzk/?n=rain0411yr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; April 26 saw no deaths and mostly weaker tornadoes, with the notable tornadoes of the day being an EF2 tornado that tracked across parts of Texas and into [[Louisiana]] and a brief EF3 that struck [[Campbell Army Airfield]], causing $1 million (2011 [[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage. From the 27th to 28th, a series of devastating, long-tracked, violent tornadoes killed hundreds of people throughout an area extending from [[Mississippi]] to [[Virginia]]. This included eleven EF4s and four EF5s. One particularly devastating and long-lived EF5 wedge tornado tore across northern [[Alabama]] and into [[Tennessee]], killing 72 people and devastating several small towns, particularly [[Hackleburg, Alabama|Hackleburg]], [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]], [[Tanner, Alabama|Tanner]], and [[Harvest, Alabama|Harvest]]. A large, long-tracked EF4 was broadcast live on multiple TV stations as it caused catastrophic damage in densely populated areas of [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama]], killing 64 people. Numerous other small towns including [[Smithville, Mississippi]]; [[Cordova, Alabama]]; [[Rainsville, Alabama]]; [[Ohatchee, Alabama]]; [[Cullman, Alabama]]; [[Trenton, Georgia]]; [[Ringgold, Georgia]]; [[Apison, Tennessee]]; and [[Glade Spring, Virginia]] sustained devastating, direct hits from intense tornadoes, with several producing death tolls well into the double digits. 319 additional tornado-related deaths occurred within those two days before the outbreak came to an end, bringing the total death toll to 324.&lt;ref name="0426rpt"&gt;{{cite web|title=20110426's Storm Reports (1200 UTC − 1159 UTC)|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110426_rpts.html|work=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014|date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NWSShreveportApr25-26"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[National Weather Service]] Office in Shreveport, Louisiana|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=January 4, 2014|title=Severe Weather Hits the Four State Region April 24–27, 2011|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/shv/?n=stormsurveys_april25-27_2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NWSPaducahApr26-3"&gt;{{cite web|work=National Weather Service Office in Paducah, Kentucky|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=January 4, 2014|title=Damage Survey Results For Ft.

Many trees were downed, which brought down power lines and knocked out power, and a mobile home was destroyed. The fatality occurred in the Pisgah area. A [[April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak#Pisgah–Flat Rock–Higdon, Alabama/Trenton, Georgia|violent EF4 tornado]] struck the same area later that day, making the path of this tornado hard to distinguish from that tornado's path. Several eyewitness accounts of the morning damage assisted the storm surveyors in separating the two paths.

|'''7 deaths'''&amp;nbsp;– Violent tornado moved northeast through Elmore County, first causing major damage to several homes, outbuildings, and farm equipment at EF2 intensity before reaching the EF3 threshold south of [[Central, Elmore County, Alabama|Central]] and destroying a mobile home and damaging several site-built homes to the northwest of [[Eclectic, Alabama|Eclectic]]. It then passed through a mobile home park, where ten mobile homes were completely destroyed and four people were killed, and continued northeast, destroying several homes, businesses, two churches, and a [[plant nursery]]. The tornado crossed [[Lake Martin]] in two places, causing significant damage to numerous lake homes before moving into Tallapoosa County and reaching EF4 intensity. Several well-built, multi-story homes were destroyed (many had no walls remaining above the basement level) as the tornado narrowed and moved across the south and east sides of [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]]. Here, two homes were destroyed and a pick-up truck was rolled {{convert|120|yd|m|}}. The tornado began to weaken as it crossed [[U.S. Route 280|U.S. Highway 280]] just southeast of Dadeville, causing significant damage to numerous homes and businesses and causing one fatality before continuing into Chambers County, where it destroyed another home before lifting. Thousands of trees and many power lines and poles, including at least one large metal high-tension truss tower, were downed by the tornado, which injured 30 people along the path.

|'''1 death''' – Strong tornado, the last to be produced from the [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]–[[Birmingham, Alabama]] supercell, touched down in the [[Chattahoochee National Forest]] in northern Lumpkin County, downing thousands of trees and damaging 18 homes, 14 of which sustained major damage. In White County, thousands more trees were downed, and eight homes were damaged, two of which sustained major damage. Moving into Habersham County, the tornado downed many more trees, some of which fell on homes and vehicles. About eight homes sustained minor to moderate roof damage, other homes had porches blown off, and a small cabin was destroyed. The tornado continued northeast through a very remote area into Rabun County as it crossed [[Lake Burton (Georgia)|Lake Burton]], strengthening to EF3 intensity. In this area, a marina was damaged, a fire department building was destroyed, and several large lake homes were completely destroyed, one of which slid off of its foundation and into the lake. The tornado began to weaken as it crossed [[U.S. Route 76 in Georgia|U.S. Highway 76]], downing hundreds of trees before re-intensifying slightly as it moved over a residential area in Mountain City. Half of the roof was blown off a condominium building, and surrounding homes sustained minor to moderate roof damage before the tornado lifted on the north side of Mountain City. This was the first tornado to impact Rabun County since 1983, and the first F3/EF3 tornado in the county's recorded history. One person was injured in Lumpkin County.

The '''Micro-Satellite à traînée Compensée pour l'Observation du Principe d'Equivalence''' ('''MICROSCOPE''') is a {{convert|300|kg|lb|adj=on}} class [[minisatellite]] operated by [[CNES]] to test the universality of [[free fall]] (the [[equivalence principle]]) with a precision to the order of {{10^|-15}}, 100 times more precise than can be achieved on Earth. It was launched on 25 April 2016 alongside [[Sentinel-1B]] and other [[small satellite]]s.

==Experiment==
To test the [[equivalence principle]] (i.e. the similarity of free fall for two bodies of different composition in an identical gravity field), two differential [[accelerometer]]s are used successively. If the equivalence principle is verified, the two sets of masses will be subjected to the same acceleration. If different accelerations have to be applied, the principle will be violated.

The principal experiment is the Twin-Space Accelerometer for Gravity Experiment (T-SAGE), built by [[ONERA]] and composed of two identical accelerometers and their associated, concentric cylindrical masses. One accelerometer serves as a reference and contains two [[platinum]]-[[rhodium]] alloy masses, while the other is the test instrument and contains two masses with different [[neutron–proton ratio]]s: one mass of [[platinum]]-[[rhodium]] alloy and another mass of [[titanium]]-[[aluminium]]-[[vanadium]] alloy (TA6V).  The masses are maintained within their test areas by [[electrostatic repulsion]], designed to render them motionless with respect to the satellite.&lt;ref name="eoportal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/m/microscope |title=MicroSCOPE |work=eoPortal |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnes-tsage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://microscope.cnes.fr/en/MICROSCOPE/t-sage.htm |title=T-SAGE Instrument |publisher=CNES |date=1 July 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is necessary to create a thermally benign environment for the accelerometers. To that end, a [[Sun-synchronous orbit]] provides constant illumination; the experiments are mounted on the end of the satellite bus away from the Sun; and to maintain thermal isolation from the satellite itself, the modes of thermal connection were modelled and wire connections were minimised.&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

==Satellite control==
The satellite employs a [[attitude control|Drag-Free Attitude Control System]] (DFACS), also called the Acceleration and Attitude Control System (AACS), that uses a double-redundant primary and backup set of four microthrusters (sixteen total) to "fly" the satellite around the test masses. This system takes into account the dynamic forces acting on the spacecraft, including aerodynamic forces due to residual atmosphere, solar pressure forces due to photon impacts, electromagnetic forces within the Earth's magnetosphere, and gravitational forces in the Sun-Earth-Moon system.&lt;ref name="cnes-aacs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://microscope.cnes.fr/en/MICROSCOPE/scaa.htm |title=Attitude and acceleration control |publisher=CNES |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20160426"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Space_Microscope_to_test_universality_of_freefall |title=Space Microscope to test universality of freefall |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Markus |last=Bauer |date=26 April 2016 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
On 4 December 2017, the first results were published. The [[equivalence principle]] was measured to hold true within a precision of {{10^|-15}}, improving prior measurements by an order of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Touboul2017"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''MICROSCOPE'' Mission: First Results of a Space Test of the Equivalence Principle |journal=Physical Review Letters |first=Pierre |last=Touboul |display-authors=etal |volume=119 |issue=23 |at=231101 |date=8 December 2017 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.231101 |pmid=29286705|arxiv=1712.01176 |bibcode=2017PhRvL.119w1101T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Mission==
After completing its mission goals MICROSCOPE was de-commisioned on 18 October 2018. The spacecraft was first passivized and then two 4.5 meter inflatable booms of IDEAS (Innovative DEorbiting Aerobrake System) were deployed to passively de-orbit it through drag enhancement. With this innovative de-orbiting method, MICROSCOPE is expected to reenter the Earth's atmosphere within 25 years instead of 73 years.&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EoM_CNES" /&gt;

'''Mediterranean Wetlands'''

==Definition==

Wetlands are everywhere, in all climates and in every country, and they may briefly be defined as transitional spaces between land and water. In a more detailed sense, according to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, wetlands are defined as:

"areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres […..] and may incorporate riparian and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and islands or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at low tide lying within the wetlands".

The Ramsar Classification of wetland types includes 42 types which can be broadly divided into:
• Marine and coastal wetlands
• Inland wetlands
• Human-made wetlands

Among the richest ecosystems in the world, wetlands have an exceptional value, but are also the most threatened. In the Mediterranean, they support high concentrations of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrate species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
 
- Key figures on biodiversity in Med region

Furthermore, these ecosystems insure directly – and for free – services for millions of people. As natural infrastructures, they play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability.

Unfortunately, wetlands continue to be among the world's most threatened ecosystems; 50% of the Mediterranean wetlands disappeared during the 20th century, and those that remain have been degraded or artificialized. There are 15 to 22 million hectares of wetlands in the Mediterranean Region, a fourth of which are artificial, such as dam reservoirs and fish-farming ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Mediterranean Wetlands Outlook 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean region is also a hotspot of global biodiversity, but the greatest direct threat to that biodiversity is the disappearance of these ecosystems. Plants and animals combined, one out of three Mediterranean wetland species is endangered.&lt;ref&gt;First thematic report - Biodiversity: status and trends of species in Mediterranean wetlands
&lt;/ref&gt;

A scientific survey of 314 Mediterranean coastal wetlands shows that human activities, such as agriculture, have converted 71% of Mediterranean natural coastal wetland habitat into farmland, 21% by artificialization, and 8% by urban expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Second thematic report: Land cover spatial dynamics in Mediterranean coastal wetlands from 1975 to 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the greatest threats to the Mediterranean wetlands is water extraction. Irrigated agriculture is the greatest water consumer in the region, accounting for 2/3 of total consumption. Rivers flow rates are falling due to water extraction, retention by dams, and the effects of climate change.

==Types of Mediterranean Wetlands==

Wetlands lie at the interface between land and water, and are thus very diverse. The Ramsar Convention classified wetlands into three main types:

• Marine/coastal
:o Brackish lagoons
:o [[Estuaries]] and [[deltas]]
:o [[Chott]]s
:o [[Sebkha-Chott|Sebkhas]]
:o [[Dayas]]
:o [[Garaet]]

• Continental
:o Salt and [[brackish marsh]]es
:o [[Freshwater Marshes|Freshwater marshes]]
:o [[Natural lake]]s
:o [[Temporary pool]]s
:o [[Riparian woodland]]s
:o [[Peat bog|Peat-bogs]]
:o [[Wadis]]
:o [[Gueltas]]

• Artificial
:o [[Salt evaporation pond|Saltpans]]
:o [[Fishponds]]
:o [[Reservoirs]]
:o [[Temporary pool]]s
:o [[Ricefield]]s
:o [[Oases]]

==Regions in the Mediterranean Basin==

The Mediterranean region is unique because of its special type of climate and its very long history of human use. Wetlands in the Mediterranean Basin are varied, and there are many different types in every country. For example:

* Africa
:o Algeria ([[Chott Ech Chergui]])
:o Egypt ([[Wadi El Rayan Protected Area]])
:o Libya ([[Ain Elzarga]])
:o Morocco ([[Oasis du Tafilalet]])
:o Tunisia (Chott El Jerid)

* Asia
:o Israel (Hula Nature Reserve)
:o Jordan ([[Azraq Oasis]])
:o Lebanon ([[Palm Islands Nature Reserve]])
:o Syrian Arab Republic ([[Sabkhat al-Jabbul Nature Reserve]])

* Europe
:o Albania ([[Lake Shkodra|Lake Shkodra and River Buna]])
:o Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Livanjsko Polje]]: Livno Karst field)
:o Bulgaria ([[Belene Island|Belene Islands Complex]])
:o Croatia ([[Lonjsko polje]] and [[Mokro polje]] including Krapje Dol)
:o Cyprus ([[Larnaca Salt Lake]])
:o France ([[Camargue]])
:o Greece ([[Messolonghi Lagoon|Messolonghi lagoons]])
:o Italy (Valli residue del comprensorio di Comacchio)
:o Macedonia ([[Lake Prespa]])
:o Malta (Ghadira)
:o Monaco (Réserve sous-marine du Larvotto)
:o Montenegro (Skadarsko Jezero)
:o Portugal ([[Estuário do Sado]])
:o Serbia ([[Gornje Podunavlje]])
:o Slovenia ([[Lake Cerknica]] &amp; its environs)
:o Spain ([[Doñana]])
:o Turkey ([[Lake Burdur]])

==Values of Mediterranean Wetlands==

Man benefits from wetlands' natural functions and services, which help to meet the needs of millions of people – to cultivate soil, to fish for food, to cut trees for building, to hunt the waterfowl for leisure activities, to organize ecotourism programs in remarkable sites, to use their water for our domestic or agricultural needs, etc.

* Cultural value

Some cultural values developed in wetland areas are non-material and have become part of the life cycle and livelihood of local residents, such as rituals, beliefs, the seasonal work calendar, and different traditional techniques.

* Ecological value

The Mediterranean wetlands have a high percentage of endemic species. They not only provide breeding and wintering for millions of birds, they also play a role as a stopping place for an even larger number of birds during migration periods.

* Economic value

Environmental economics assumes that by giving a monetary value to nature, it would allow us to better take into account its importance in development choices. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment gave wetlands a value of US$15 trillion in 1997.&lt;br /&gt;
 
* Hydrological value

Wetlands greatly influence the flow and quality of water, thus providing benefits to humans. They store and slowly release surface water, rain, snowmelt and flood waters, maintaining soil humidity during dry periods. But the most important service is the supply of clean water for drinking, agriculture, and industries. Scientists have estimated that a 2,500 acre wetland in Georgia saves $1 million in water pollution control costs annually (OTA 1993).

==Pressures on the Mediterranean Wetlands==

Despite all the services they provide to human societies, Mediterranean wetlands continue to face many pressures from human activities. Their loss and degradation, started centuries ago, are often considered to be an unfortunate but unavoidable effect of the human development process and needs.

These negative impacts result from a number of pressures such as agriculture, urbanization, industry, fishing, tourism development, energy, transport and hunting. Each kind of pressure may impact several types of wetland services. For example, agricultural development may impact wetland surfaces, hydraulic regimes, water quality, and wetland types/ landscapes.

==The Ramsar Convention and the Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative==

The Convention on Wetlands, called the [[Ramsar Convention]], is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources.

Ramsar's 15 regional initiatives support cooperation and capacity-building on wetland-related issues in specific regions or sub-regions. There are two types of regional initiatives: Ramsar Regional Centres for training and capacity building, and networks for regional cooperation. In 2016 there are 15 Ramsar Regional Initiatives covering regions of the Mediterranean, Asia, Africa and South America. Those regional networks provide a platform for collaboration between governments, technical experts, international NGOs, local communities and private companies.

Established in 1991, the Mediterranean Wetlands Regional Initiative brings together 26 Mediterranean and peri-Mediterranean countries that are Parties to the Convention on Wetlands. Palestine and a number of organizations and wetland centres are also part of the MedWet Initiative.
The MedWet Mission is to ensure and support the effective conservation of the functions and values of Mediterranean wetlands and the sustainable use of their resources and services.

The Mediterranean Wetland Observatory (MWO) was established in 2008 at the request of the Mediterranean Wetlands Committee (MedWet/Com) as a multi-partner project coordinated by Tour du Valat (TdV), the Research Institute for the Conservation of Mediterranean Wetlands, based in Arles, France. Founded more than 50 years ago by Luc Hoffmann, the Tour du Valat has since then developed its research activities for the conservation of Mediterranean wetlands with a major mission:  "Better understanding of wetlands for better management".

The main objective of the MWO is to act as a wetland management tool serving the MedWet Initiative's countries. The ultimate aim of this regional tool, in collaboration with MedWet, is to help to improve political decisions regarding the conservation and sustainable management of wetlands, particularly in terms of legislation, governance and best practices.

The '''National Energy Commission''' ('''NEC'''; {{zh|s=国家能源委员会|t=國家能源委員會會|p=guójiā néngyuán wěiyuánhuì}}) is an agency established in 2010 to coordinate the overall energy policies for the [[People's Republic of China]]. The body includes 23 members from other agencies such as environment, finance, central bank, [[National Development and Reform Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;GILLIAN WONG, China sets up energy agency headed by PM, The Associated Press, http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2010911010_apaschinaenergy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of this new commission is to draft a new energy development strategy, evaluate energy security and coordinate international cooperation on climate change, carbon reduction and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2010911010_apaschinaenergy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[China]] had a Ministry of Energy established in 1988 but it was disbanded five years after its portfolio overlapped with existing ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Wan Zhihong, (China Daily), Wen heads 'super ministry' for energy, url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-01/28/content_9388039.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, '''National Energy Bureau''' was created under the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] (NDRC) which reports to the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Chinese State Council]], which has broad administrative and planning control over energy in the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhZzUfOuOOlbe1DJUzwzU52hZuTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, '''National Energy Administration (NEA)''' was established but lacked power to carry out its tasks because the energy sector management was spread between various agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-01/28/content_9388039.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

China has experienced power outages, concerns of growing imported energy demands, energy security and challenges coordinating energy supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;Fu Jing, (China Daily), Tough road ahead of national energy guiding body, url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2010-01/29/content_9395682.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=December 2010}}

As opposed to [[holy water]], water elevated with the [[sacrament]]al [[blessing]] of a [[cleric]] (Altman 2002:131), '''sacred waters''' are characterized by tangible [[topographical]] land formations such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and [[ocean]]s. These organic bodies of water have attained religious significance not from the modern alteration or blessing, but were sanctified through [[mythological]] or [[historical]] figures. Sacred waters have been exploited for cleansing, healing, [[initiations]], and death [[rites]] (Altman 2002:6).

Ubiquitous and perpetual fixations with water occur across religious traditions. It tends to be a central element in the creations accounts of almost every culture with mythological, [[cosmological]], and [[theological]] myths (Altman 2002:3-6,13-20). In this way, many groups characterize water as "living water", or the "water of life" (Varner 2004:19, Altman 2002:2, Strang 2004:83). This means that it gives life and is the fundamental element from which life arises. Each religious or cultural group that feature waters as sacred substances tends to favor certain categorizations of some waters more than others, usually those that are most accessible to them and that best integrate into their rituals (Altman 2002:3).

==Rivers==
===Ganges River ===
While all [[rivers]] are sacred in [[Hinduism]], the [[Ganges River]] is particularly revered. In the [[Vedic mythology|Vedic myths]], the [[goddess]] [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] descended upon the earth to purify and prepare the dead (Alley 2008:171, Haberman 2006:60-61, Narayanan 2001:190-191). The River Ganges (Ganga) in [[India]] is seen as the physical embodiment of this goddess. Since the river waters are as both inherently pure themselves and having major [[Ritual purification|purificatory]] qualities (Alley 2008:173-174, Nelson 2008:102), people come to bathe in them, drink from them, leave offerings for them, and give their physical remains to them.

The Ganges is said to purify the soul of negative ''[[karma]]'', corporeal [[sins]], and even impurities from previous lives (Nelson 2008:102). At sunrise along the Ganges, [[pilgrims]] descend the ''[[ghat]]'' steps to drink of the waters, bathe themselves in the waters and perform [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] where they submerge their entire bodies. These practitioners desire to imbibe and surround themselves with the Ganges’s waters so that they can be purified (Altman 2002:136-138, 181-183, 196-198). Hindu conceptualizations of the sacred are fluid and renewable. Purity and pollution exist upon a continuum where most entities, including people, can become sacred and then become stagnated and full of sin once again (Lamb 2008:341-346). Performing these rituals is also an act to become closer to the [[Hindu deities]], and ultimately the [[Divinity|Divine]].

The Ganges is one of the most highly favored sites for [[funerary]] rituals in India.  It is presumed that if a deceased person is cleansed by the Ganges, it will help liberate their [[soul]], or expedite the number of lives they need to achieve this (Altman 2002:137, McClaymond 2008:315). In the traditional funerary ceremony, a dead person is placed upon a [[funeral pyre]] until the body becomes [[cremated]], then the ashes are sent upon the river (Michaels 2004:136-139). Many Hindus go to great lengths to purify themselves one last time before death. When this is not possible, family members will actually mail the ashes to a [[priest]] so that he can perform the ceremony of entering the waters (Altman 2008:136-137).

[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], the mythic law giver, gave directives and prohibitions regarding the river: “impure objects like urine, feces, spit; or anything which has these elements, blood, or poison should not be cast into the water” (Narayanan 2001:183-184). Few or none of his directives hold forth along most places down the Ganges today. Journalist [[Joshua Hammer]] wrote a very illustrative account of his personal visit to the Ganges in which he described seeing both animal and human [[corpses]] floating down the river or sometimes embedded in heaps of garbage.  People continued to bathe, and children to play in very murky waters; the color in some parts completely changed from [[toxic]] [[sewage]] and [[Surface runoff|runoff]] (Hammer 2007). As the Ganges River remains interwoven into daily existence, Hindus are vulnerable to [[Urban area|urban]] contamination. Irony lies in that this river is venerated for her ability to wash away contaminants, yet is being stagnated.

==Lakes and underground water==
===Lake Titicaca===
[[Lake Titicaca]] is widely known as being a sacred place for the [[Inca]] people. The Inca Empire origins lie in Lake Titicaca. Ancient Incan myths describe the Incas as being blessed by the sun because the sun first emerged from Lake Titicaca. Since then, the sun organizes social order and the movement of the sun organizes rituals and gatherings. The first emergence of people in the time of the sun emergence is said to be the [[elite]] in their [[caste]] system. The origin of the elite was and continues to be contested among the people on the Island of Lake Titicaca. Thus, creating competition to become part of the elite rank (Bauer 1998:240-246). In recent times, the pollution of Lake Titicaca has built up and caused an increase of [[green algae]]. The people of Lake Titicaca Special Projects continuously are creating ways to bring awareness to the importance of a clean lake for their society (Holston 2008:42).

===Chichen Itza===
The ancient [[Mayan civilization|Mayans]] valued social order and their society flourished because of the structure of their order. The ancient Mayans strived and focused their actions on pleasing their many gods. Essentially, the Mayans believed that the world consisted of three layers: the watery [[Xibalba|underworld]], the middle earthly realm, and the sky realm. The Mayans viewed bodies of water as a direct connection to the watery underworld and underground water obtained through a cave as an even better connection to spirits and deities. [[Cenote]]s are very important to the Mayas. The famous cenote at [[Chichen Itza]] proves to be important with the many findings of artifacts and skeletal remains. Sacrifices were common at this site among the ancient Mayans. Different people were sacrificed and findings show that most of the people were men and children (Bruhns 1999:209). Like any archeological site, [[looting]] is problem in preserving and studying the cenote at Chichen Itza.

===Black Mesa===
The [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Hopi]] people have long embraced the water underneath and around the [[Black Mesa (Arizona)|Black Mesa]] area as sacred to their people. The people have long lived around and became dependent on springs and wells of the Black Mesa. These waters are the only source of drinking water, water for livestock, and water for agriculture for the Navajo and Hopi people. In respect for the water, these people carryout religious and ceremonial tributes to the water of the Black Mesa. These waters have organized their people around the Black Mesa and resulted in the reliance of the waters for all aspects of their lives. With the emergence of [[Peabody Energy]] came threats to the preservation of their sacred water. Peabody Energy pumps water out from underneath the Black Mesa to transport their mining minerals. In May 2002 the Navajo and Hopi people from northeastern Arizona joined their people in St. Louis Missouri to fight against Peabody Energy and its shareholders. In January 2002 Peabody proposed and was granted the right to use thirty-two percent more [[Navajo Aquifer]] (Naquifer) water than they had already been using. The significant increase in water pumped out of the Naquifer, dramatically affected the drinkability of the water from the springs and wells connected to the Naquifer. Before the significant increase of pumping, the water was clean enough to drink without any kind of purification. Another result of the pumping is the noticeable drop in the water levels of the springs and wells. The drop in water levels was almost immediately recognized after Peabody was granted permission to pump out more water. This had caused disruption in the ceremonial and cultural lives of the Navajo and Hopi people as well as disruption to their farming (Lee 2010).

'''Shortwave relay stations''' are transmitter sites used by international broadcasters to extend their coverage to areas that cannot be reached easily from their home state. E.g., the BBC operates an extensive net of relay stations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WUO4U8L5N_cC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=BBC+Cyprus+relay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xZ2_zgGDoe&amp;sig=CvCV-2Gyiyhp3edNcWdIhBPelIc&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=4xkZSoOZO9LL_AaUwODrDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA168,M1 BBC Cyprus relay.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

These days the programs are fed to the relay sites by satellite, cable/optical fiber or the Internet. Frequencies, transmitter power and antennas depend on the desired coverage. Some regional relays even operate in the medium wave or FM bands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_listen.shtml How to listen to the BBC.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relay stations are also important to reach listeners in countries that practice [[radio jamming]]. Depending on the effect of the [[shortwave]] dead zone the target countries can jam the programs only locally, e.g. for bigger cities. For this purpose [[Radio Free Europe]]/[[Radio Liberty]] with studios in [[Munich]], Germany operated a relay station in Portugal, in the extreme west of Europe, to reach then-communist Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ8QN69KZQQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA113&amp;lpg=RA1-PA113&amp;dq=Radio+Free+europe+portugal+relay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SRxNpMwTc5&amp;sig=Lw1vvEYB7vrJ0fUJ_03252D7jX8&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=_x4ZSujpBYLK_gab443ZDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Radio Free Europe.] Retrieved 2011-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations in design ==
Two and only one broadcasting technology couples all of the components of a traditional shortwave relay station into one unit: the [[ALLISS]] module. For persons totally unfamiliar with the concepts of how shortwave relay stations operate this design may be the most understandable.

The ALLISS module is a fully rotatable [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] system for high power (typically 500&amp;nbsp;kW only) [[shortwave radio]] [[broadcasting]]—it essentially is a '''self contained shortwave relay station'''.

Most of the world's shortwave relay stations do not use this technology, due to its cost (15m EUR per ALLISS module: Transmitter + Antenna + Automation equipment).

== Planning and design ==
A traditional shortwave relay station—depending on how many transmitters and antennas that it will have—may take up to two years to plan.  After planning is completed, it may take up to five years to construct the relay station.

The historically long design and planning cycle for shortwave relay stations ended in the 1990s. Many advanced software planning tools (not related to the relay station design proper) became available. Choosing a series of  sites for a relay station is about 100 times faster using [[Google Earth]], for example. With the modern graphical version of Ioncap, simplified propagation studies can completed in less than a week for any chosen site.

In some cases, existing relay stations can have their designs more or less duplicated, thus  speeding up development time. However, there is one general exception to this: the [[ALLISS]] Module. From initial planning to deployment of ALLISS Modules may take a mere 1.5 years to 9 months depending on the number of modules deployed at one time in a particular sector of a country.

=== Graphic examples ===
{{clear}}

=== How relay stations operate ===
These are considered general operating parameters:
* 20 hours per day, but geopolitical reasons may dictate some stations run 24 hours per day (a 168-hour week)
* Generally 360 days per year, depending on the number of redundant transmitters and antennas
* Relay Stations generally consume from 250 kilowatts (kW) to 10 megawatts (MW)
* A single 100&amp;nbsp;kW SW transmitter consumes 225&amp;nbsp;kW RMS as a general rule
* A single 300&amp;nbsp;kW SW transmitter consumes 625&amp;nbsp;kW RMS as a general rule
* Modulator efficiency: Class-B modulators have about a 65% efficiency level, but digital (PDM or PSM or hybrid variants) modulators have about an 85% efficiency level as a general rule (for Amplitude Modulation)
* Broadcast times and frequencies are under [[ITU]] regulation

=== How relay stations are designed ===
General requirements of shortwave relay stations:
* Road access (fairly universal)
* HVAC mains access building or transformer in the transmitter building itself
* Staff quarters (if the relay station is not fully automated)
* Incoming audio processing centre, but since the mid-1980s this has evolved into one to five rack units
* Transmitter hall (50&amp;nbsp;kW, 100&amp;nbsp;kW, 250&amp;nbsp;kW, 300&amp;nbsp;kW, 500&amp;nbsp;kW [[shortwave]] transmitter)
* Switch matrix (but these are not typically used by [[ALLISS]] modules)
* [[Balun]]s (but their use is not always required nor universal)
* [[antenna tuner]]s (sometimes called ATUs or [[roller coasters]] because of their appearance)
* Feeder lines (coax cable and open feeder lines are the most common feeders in use)
* HRS-type antennas, or occasionally [[log-periodic]] (horizontal)
* In parts of the developing world [[log-periodic]] (horizontal) antennas are used to provide less directional gain to a target area.

=== Where the broadcast programs go ===
* generally to target areas that are more than 300&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter site
* most shortwave relay station target areas are 1500&amp;nbsp;km to 3500&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter site

=== Mobile relay stations ===
The IEEE Book series "The History of International Broadcasting" (Volume I) describes mobile shortwave relay stations used by the German propaganda ministry during WWII, to avoid them being located by [[radio direction finding]] and bombed by the Allies.    They consisted of a generator truck, transmitter truck and an antenna truck, and are thought to have had a radiated power of about 50&amp;nbsp;kW.  Radio Industry Zagreb (RIZ Transmitters) currently produces mobile shortwave transmitters.

== Notable sites : Issoudun ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The International broadcasting center of TDF (Télédiffusion de France) is at [[Issoudun]]/[[Saint-Aoustrille]].  As of 2011, Issoudun is utilized by [[TDF Group|TDF]] for [[shortwave]] transmissions. The site uses 12 rotary [[ALLISS]] antennas fed by 12 transmitters of 500&amp;nbsp;kW each to transmit shortwave broadcasts by [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI), along with other broadcast services.

The '''Silurian''' is a [[Period (geology)|geologic period and system]] spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the [[Ordovician]] Period, at {{Period start|Silurian}} million years ago ([[annum|Mya]]), to the beginning of the [[Devonian]] Period, {{Period end|Silurian}} Mya.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2015-01.pdf | title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart v.2015/01 | publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] | date=January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other [[Geology|geologic]] periods, the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]] when 60% of marine species were wiped out.

A significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of [[Gnathostomata|jawed fish]] and bony fish. Multi-cellular [[life]] also began to appear on land in the form of small, [[bryophyte]]-like and [[vascular plants]] that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines, and terrestrial [[arthropods]] are also first found on land during the Silurian. However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian.

==History of study==
{{Life timeline}}
The Silurian system was first identified by British geologist [[Roderick Murchison]], who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock [[Stratum|strata]] in south [[Wales]] in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe of Wales, the [[Silures]], inspired by his friend [[Adam Sedgwick]], who had named the period of his study the [[Cambrian]], from the [[Latin]] name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures ([[wiktionary:cf|{{abbr|cf|compare}}]]. [[:File:Geologic map Wales &amp; SW England EN.svg|Geologic map of Wales]], [[:File:Wales.pre-Roman.jpg|Map of pre-Roman tribes of Wales]]). In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title ''On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales,'' which was the germ of the modern [[Geologic time scale|geological time scale]]. As it was first identified, the "Silurian" series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick's "Cambrian" sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship. [[Charles Lapworth]] resolved the conflict by defining a new [[Ordovician]] system including the contested beds. An early alternative name for the Silurian was ''"Gotlandian"'' after the [[Geology of Gotland|strata of the Baltic island of Gotland]].

The French geologist [[Joachim Barrande]], building on Murchison's work, used the term ''Silurian'' in a more comprehensive sense than was justified by subsequent knowledge. He divided the Silurian rocks of [[Bohemia]] into eight stages. His interpretation was questioned in 1854 by [[Edward Forbes]], and the later stages of Barrande, F, G and H, have since been shown to be Devonian. Despite these modifications in the original groupings of the strata, it is recognized that Barrande established Bohemia as a classic ground for the study of the earliest fossils.

==Subdivisions==

===Llandovery===
{{see also|Llandovery Group}}
The Llandovery [[Epoch (geology)|Epoch]] lasted from {{Period span|Llandovery}} mya, and is subdivided into three [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stages]]: the {{Visible anchor|Rhuddanian}},&lt;ref&gt;Named for the Cefn-Rhuddan Farm in the Llandovery area.&lt;/ref&gt; lasting until {{mya|Aeronian}}, the {{Visible anchor|Aeronian}}, lasting to {{mya|Telychian}}, and the {{Visible anchor|Telychian}}. The epoch is named for the town of [[Llandovery]] in [[Carmarthenshire]], Wales.

===Wenlock===
{{see also|Wenlock (Silurian)}}
The [[Wenlock (Silurian)|Wenlock]], which lasted from {{period span|Wenlock}} mya, is subdivided into the {{Visible anchor|Sheinwoodian}} (to {{Ma|Homerian}}) and {{Visible anchor|Homerian}} ages. It is named after [[Wenlock Edge]] in [[Shropshire]], England. During the Wenlock, the oldest-known [[Vascular plant|tracheophytes]] of the genus ''[[Cooksonia]]'', appear. The complexity of slightly later [[Gondwana]] plants like ''[[Baragwanathia]]'', which resembled a modern clubmoss, indicates a much longer history for vascular plants, extending into the early Silurian or even [[Ordovician]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The first terrestrial animals also appear in the Wenlock, represented by air-breathing [[millipedes]] from [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Selden&amp;Read&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.paulselden.net/uploads/7/5/3/2/7532217/seldenread2008.pdf |journal=Bulletin of the British Myriapod &amp; Isopod Group |volume=23 |year=2008 |title=The oldest land animals: Silurian millipedes from Scotland |author=Paul Selden &amp; Helen Read |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludlow===
{{see also|Ludlow Group}}
The Ludlow, lasting from {{period span|Ludlow}} mya, comprises the {{Visible anchor|Gorstian}} stage, lasting until {{Mya|Ludfordian}}, and the {{Visible anchor|Ludfordian}} stage. It is named for the town of [[Ludlow]] (and neighbouring [[Ludford, Shropshire|Ludford]]) in Shropshire, England.

=== Přídolí {{anchor|Pridoli}} ===
The Přídolí, lasting from {{period span|Pridoli}} mya, is the final and shortest epoch of the Silurian. It is named after one locality at the ''Homolka a Přídolí'' nature reserve near the [[Prague]] suburb [[Slivenec]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. ''Přídolí'' is the old name of a [[Cadastre|cadastral]] field area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/art1174 |first1=Štěpán |last1=Manda |first2=Jiří |last2=Frýda |title=Silurian-Devonian boundary events and their influence on cephalopod evolution: evolutionary significance of cephalopod egg size during mass extinctions |journal=Bulletin of Geosciences |volume=85 |year=2010 |issue=3 |pages=513–40 |doi=10.3140/bull.geosci.1174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional stages===
In North America a different suite of regional stages is sometimes used:
* [[Cayugan]] (Late Silurian – Ludlow)
* [[Lockportian]] (Middle Silurian: late Wenlock)
* [[Tonawandan]] (Middle Silurian: early Wenlock)
* [[Ontarian (geology)|Ontarian]] (Early Silurian: late Llandovery)
* [[Alexandrian (geology)|Alexandrian]] (Earliest Silurian: early Llandovery)

In [[Estonia]] the following suite of regional stages is used:&lt;ref&gt;http://stratigraafia.info/materjalid/eesti_strat/Silurian_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ohessaare stage]] (Late Silurian – early Přídolí)
* [[Kaugatuma stage]] (Late Silurian – late Přídolí)
* [[Kuressaare stage]] (Late Silurian – late Ludlow)
* [[Paadla stage]] (Late Silurian – early Ludlow)
* [[Rootsiküla stage]] (Middle Silurian: late Wenlock)
* [[Jaagarahu stage]] (Middle Silurian: middle Wenlock)
* [[Jaani stage]] (Middle Silurian: early Wenlock)
* [[Adavere stage]] (Early Silurian: late Llandovery)
* [[Raikküla stage]] (Early Silurian: middle Llandovery)
* [[Juuru stage]] (Earliest Silurian: early Llandovery)

==Geography==
[[Image:Ordovicium-Silurian.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ordovician]]-Silurian boundary on [[Hovedøya]], [[Norway]], showing brownish late Ordovician [[mudstone]] and later dark deep-water Silurian [[shale]]. The layers have been overturned by the [[Caledonian orogeny]].]]
With the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]] covering the equator and much of the southern hemisphere, a large ocean occupied most of the northern half of the globe.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; The high sea levels of the Silurian and the relatively flat land (with few significant mountain belts) resulted in a number of island chains, and thus a rich diversity of environmental settings.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

During the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian icecaps were less extensive than those of the late-Ordovician glaciation. The southern continents remained united during this period. The melting of icecaps and [[glacier]]s contributed to a rise in sea level, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. The continents of [[Avalonia]], [[Baltica]], and [[Laurentia]] [[Continental drift|drifted]] together near the [[equator]], starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [[Euramerica]].

When the proto-Europe collided with North America, the collision folded coastal sediments that had been accumulating since the Cambrian off the east coast of North America and the west coast of Europe. This event is the [[Caledonian orogeny]], a spate of mountain building that stretched from [[New York (state)|New York State]] through conjoined Europe and Greenland to Norway. At the end of the Silurian, sea levels dropped again, leaving telltale basins of [[evaporite]]s extending from Michigan to West Virginia, and the new mountain ranges were rapidly eroded. The [[Teays River]], flowing into the shallow mid-continental sea, eroded Ordovician Period strata, forming deposits of Silurian strata in northern Ohio and Indiana.

The vast ocean of [[Panthalassa]] covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include two phases of the Tethys, the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean|Proto-Tethys]] and [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleo-Tethys]], the [[Rheic Ocean]], the [[Iapetus Ocean]] (a narrow seaway between Avalonia and Laurentia), and the newly formed [[Ural Ocean]].

==Climate and sea level==

The Silurian period enjoyed relatively stable and warm temperatures, in contrast with the extreme glaciations of the Ordovician before it, and the extreme heat of the ensuing Devonian.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; Sea levels rose from their [[Hirnantian]] low throughout the first half of the Silurian; they subsequently fell throughout the rest of the period, although smaller scale patterns are superimposed on this general trend; fifteen high-stands can be identified, and the highest Silurian sea level was probably around 140&amp;nbsp;m higher than the lowest level reached.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

During this period, the [[Earth]] entered a long, warm [[greenhouse]] phase, supported by high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels of 4500 ppm, and warm shallow seas covered much of the equatorial land masses. Early in the Silurian, [[glacier]]s retreated back into the [[South Pole]] until they almost disappeared in the middle of Silurian. The period witnessed a relative stabilization of the Earth's general climate, ending the previous pattern of erratic climatic fluctuations. Layers of broken shells (called [[coquina]]) provide strong evidence of a climate dominated by violent storms generated then as now by warm sea surfaces. Later in the Silurian, the climate cooled slightly, but closer to the Silurian-Devonian boundary, the climate became warmer.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Perturbations ===
The climate and carbon cycle appears to be rather unsettled during the Silurian, which has a higher concentration of isotopic excursions than any other period.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; The [[Ireviken event]], [[Mulde event]] and [[Lau event]] each represent isotopic excursions following a minor mass extinction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Samtleben | first1 = C.| last2 = Munnecke | first2 = A.| last3 = Bickert | first3 = T.| title = Development of facies and C/O-isotopes in transects through the Ludlow of Gotland: Evidence for global and local influences on a shallow-marine environment| journal = Facies| volume = 43| pages = 1–38| year = 2000| doi = 10.1007/BF02536983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with rapid sea-level change, in addition to the [[Lau event|larger extinction at the end of the Silurian]].&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt; Each one leaves a similar signature in the geological record, both geochemically and biologically; pelagic (free-swimming) organisms were particularly hard hit, as were [[brachiopods]], [[corals]] and [[trilobites]], and extinctions rarely occur in a rapid series of fast bursts.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The Silurian was the first period to see megafossils of extensive terrestrial biota, in the form of [[moss]]-like miniature forests along lakes and streams. However, the land fauna did not have a major impact on the Earth until it diversified in the Devonian.&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2010.08.001 |title=Ordovician and Silurian sea–water chemistry, sea level, and climate: A synopsis |year=2010 |last1=Munnecke |first1=Axel |last2=Calner |first2=Mikael |last3=Harper |first3=David A.T. |authorlink3 = David Harper (palaeontologist)|last4=Servais |first4=Thomas |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=296 |issue=3–4 |pages=389–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fossil records of [[vascular plant]]s, that is, land plants with tissues that carry water and food, appeared in the second half of the Silurian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rittner|first=Don|title=Encyclopedia of Biology|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=le1MJfA63KUC&amp;pg=PA338 |isbn=9781438109992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest-known representatives of this group are ''[[Cooksonia]]''. Most of the sediments containing ''Cooksonia'' are marine in nature. Preferred habitats were likely along rivers and streams. ''[[Baragwanathia]]'' appears to be almost as old, dating to the early Ludlow (420 million years) and has branching stems and needle-like leaves of 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm.

The concept of a spherical Earth displaced earlier beliefs in a [[flat Earth]]: In early [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean with a hemispherical sky-dome above,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered [[ziggurat]] or [[cosmic mountain]], alluded to in the [[Avesta]] and ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] writings (see [[seven climes]]).

The realization that the [[figure of the Earth]] is more accurately described as an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] dates to the 17th century, as described by [[Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[George Everest|Everest]]). The modern value as determined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] [[World Geodetic System]] since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.&lt;ref&gt;See [[figure of the Earth]] and [[Earth radius#Mean radii|Earth radius]] for details. Recent measurements from [[satellite]]s suggest that the Earth is, in fact, slightly [[pear]]-shaped.

==Cause==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

The Earth is massive enough that [[gravity]] maintains it as a roughly spherical shape. Its formation into a sphere was made easy by its primordial hot, liquid phase.

===Formation===

The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formed]] from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more [[supernova]]s that created heavy elements by [[nucleosynthesis]]. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the [[potential energy]] of their collisions and in-falling as [[heat]]. The [[protoplanetary disk]] also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than the Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to [[Earth's internal heat budget]]. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.

A sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by the Earth's rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an [[ellipsoid]], which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth's shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.

The liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as [[planetary differentiation]]. This event is known as the [[iron catastrophe]]; the most abundant heavier elements were [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which now form the [[Earth's core]].

{{further|History of Earth}}

===Later shape changes and effects===

Though the surface rocks of the Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the [[outer core]] of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; [[volcano|volcanic]] and [[tectonic]] activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of [[caldera]]s. [[Meteor]]s also create [[impact crater]]s and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release ceases from these processes, then they tend to [[Erosion|erode]] away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. [[Weather]] powered by [[solar energy]] can also move water, rock, and soil to make the Earth slightly out of round.

Earth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to the Earth. This is what causes [[tides]] in the [[ocean]]s' water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.

===Shapes of other bodies===
[[File:Eros, Vesta and Ceres size comparison.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]; the slightly smaller, mostly round [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]; and the much smaller, much lumpier [[433 Eros|Eros]]]]
[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|The amorphous nucleus of the comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]]]]

The [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions of planet]] and [[dwarf planet]] require that a Sun-orbiting body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The same spheroidal shape can be seen from smaller rocky planets like [[Mars]] to [[gas giant]]s like [[Jupiter]].

Any natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [[small Solar System body]] (SSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [[bedrock]]. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [[4 Vesta]] is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.

Stars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is a free-flowing [[fluid]]. Ongoing [[stellar fusion]] is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during formation.

==Effects and empirical confirmation==

The roughly spherical shape of the Earth can be confirmed by many different types of observation from ground level, aircraft, and spacecraft.  The shape causes a number of phenomena that a flat Earth would not.  Some of these phenomena and observations would be possible on other shapes, such as a curved [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] or [[torus]], but no other shape would explain all of them.

===Spacecraft===

Many pictures have been taken of the entire Earth by satellites launched by a variety of governments and private organizations. From high orbits, where half the planet can be seen at once, it is plainly spherical.  The only way to piece together all the pictures taken of the ground from lower orbits so that all the surface features line up seamlessly and without distortion is to put them on an approximately spherical surface.

Astronauts in [[low Earth orbit]] can personally see the curvature of the planet, and travel all the way around several times a day.

The astronauts who travelled to the Moon have seen the entire Moon-facing half at once, and can watch the sphere rotate once a day (approximately; the Moon is also moving with respect to the Earth).

===Aircraft===

People in high-flying aircraft or skydiving from high-altitude balloons can plainly see the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnJCqtTxsA James May Witnesses Curvature of Earth] (at {{convert|70000|ft}})&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial aircraft do not necessarily fly high enough to make this obvious.  Trying to measure the curvature of the horizon by taking a picture is complicated by the fact that camera lenses can produce distorted images depending on the angle used.  An extreme version of this effect can be seen in the [[fisheye lens]].  Scientific measurements would require a carefully calibrated lens.

The fastest way for an airplane to travel between two distant cities is a [[great circle]] route, which deviates significantly from what would be the fastest straight-line travel path on a flat Earth.

Photos of the ground taken from airplanes over a large enough area also do not fit seamlessly together on a flat surface, but do fit on a roughly spherical surface. Aerial photographs of large areas must be corrected to account for curvature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/pers/1958journal/dec/1958_dec_751-756.pdf The Effects of Earth's Curvature and Refraction on the Mensuration of Vertical Photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility of distant objects===

{{main|Horizon#Distance to the horizon}}

On a completely flat Earth with no visual interference (such as trees, hills, or atmospheric haze) the ground itself would never obscure distant objects; one would be able to see all the way to the edge of the surface.  A spherical surface has a [[horizon]] which is closer when viewed from a lower altitude.&lt;ref name="smarter"&gt;[https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round 10 easy ways you can tell for yourself that the Earth is not flat]&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, a person standing on the surface with eyes {{convert|1.8|m}} above the ground can see the ground up to about {{convert|4.79|km}} away, but a person at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] at {{convert|273|m}} can see the ground up to about {{convert|58.98|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/june32012/index.html Consequences of a living on a sphere]&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon would seem to present a method to verify that the Earth's surface is locally [[wikt:convex|convex]].  If the degree of curvature was determined to be the same everywhere on the Earth's surface, and that surface was determined to be large enough, it would show that the Earth is spherical.

In practice, this turns out to be an unreliable method of measurement, due to variations in atmospheric [[refraction]].  This additional effect can give the impression that the earth's surface is flat, curved more convexly than it is, or even that it is [[wikt:concave|concave]], by bending light travelling near the surface of the earth (as happened in various trials of the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]]).

The phenomenon of variable atmospheric bending can be empirically confirmed by noting that sometimes the refractive layers of air can cause the image of a distant object to be broken into pieces or even turned upside down.  This is commonly seen at sunset, when the sun's shape is distorted, but has also been photographed happening for ships, and has caused the city of Chicago to appear normally, upside down, and broken into pieces from across Lake Michigan (from where it is normally below the horizon).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/the-perfectly-scientific-explanation-for-why-chicago-appeared-upside-down-in-michigan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc57.com/story/28925566/mirage-of-chicago-skyline-seen-from-michigan-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their longer wavelengths, radio waves are even more susceptible to atmospheric refraction and reflection, which can cause radio and television signals to be received from towers thousands of miles away which cannot be seen with visible light.

When the atmosphere is relatively well-mixed, the visual effects generally expected of a spherical Earth can be observed.  For example, ships travelling on large bodies of water (such as the ocean) disappear over the horizon progressively, such that the highest part of the ship can still be seen even when lower parts cannot, proportional to distance from the observer.  The same is true of the coastline or mountain when viewed from a ship or from across a large lake or flat terrain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU A video showing the curvature of the Earth] (using island coastline)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Lunar eclipses ===

The shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is always a dark circle that moves from one side of the moon to the other (partially grazing it during a partial eclipse).  This could be produced by a flat disc that always faces the Moon head-on during the eclipse, but this is inconsistent with the fact that the Moon is only rarely directly overhead during an eclipse. For each eclipse, the local surface of the Earth is pointed in a somewhat different direction.  The shadow of a circular disc held at an angle is an oval, not a circle as is seen during the eclipse.  The idea of the Earth being a flat disc is also inconsistent with the fact that a given lunar eclipse is only visible from half of the Earth at a time.

The only shape that casts a round shadow no matter which direction it is pointed is a sphere, and the ancient Greeks deduced that this must mean the Earth is spherical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation of the stars at altitude===

On a perfectly spherical Earth, flat terrain or ocean, when viewed from the surface, blocks exactly half the sky - a hemisphere of 180°. Moving away from the surface of the Earth means that the ground blocks less and less of the sky.  For example, when viewed from the Moon, the Earth blocks only a small portion of the sky, because it is so distant.  This phenomenon of geometry means that when viewed from a high mountain, flat ground or ocean blocks less than 180° of the sky. The rate of change in the angle blocked by the sky as altitude increases is different for a disc than a sphere, and values observed show that the Earth is locally convex.  (The angles blocked would also be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, and this is not observed.)  In theory, measurements of this type from all around the Earth would confirm that it is a complete sphere (as opposed to some other shape with convex areas) though actually taking all those measurements would be very expensive.

Using other evidence to hypothesize a spherical shape, the medieval Iranian scholar [[Al-Biruni]] used this phenomenon to calculate the Earth's circumference to within {{convert|16.8|km}} of the correct value.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt;

===Observation of the fixed stars from different locations===

The [[fixed stars]] can be demonstrated to be very far away, by [[diurnal parallax]] measurements (a technique known at least as early as Ancient Greece).  Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another (at least not perceptibly over the span of a human lifetime); the shapes of the [[constellation]]s are always the same.  This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of the Earth.  Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of the Earth's size.

The fact that different stars are visible from different locations on the Earth was noticed in ancient times. [[Aristotle]] wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe.&lt;ref name="headsup"&gt;[http://headsup.boyslife.org/ten-reasons-we-know-earth-is-round/ How We Know the Earth Is Actually Round]&lt;/ref&gt; This would not be possible if the Earth was flat.&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt;

At the [[North Pole]] it is continuously nighttime for six months of the year and the same hemisphere of stars (a 180° view) are always visible making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star [[Polaris]] (the "North Star") is almost at the center of this rotation (which is directly overhead). Some of the [[88 modern constellations]] visible are [[Ursa Major]] (including the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. The other six months of the year, it is continuously daytime and the light from the Sun mostly blots out the stars.  (The location of the poles can be defined by these phenomena, which only occur there; more than 24 hours of continuous daylight can occur north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].)

At the [[South Pole]], a completely non-overlapping set of constellations are visible during the six months of continuous nighttime, including [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Crux]], and [[Centaurus]].  This 180° hemisphere of stars rotate clockwise once every 24 hours, around a point directly overhead (where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars).

The fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of the Earth, which is not possible if the Earth is a single-sided disc, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell).

From any point on the [[equator]], 360° of stars are visible over the course of the night, as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south (which could be defined as "the directions to walk to get to the poles in the shortest amount of time").  When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right.  This means the equator must be facing at a 90° angle from the poles.

The direction any intermediate spot on the Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles of the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible.  For example, [[New York City]] is about 40° north of the equator.  The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280° (360° - 80°).  So for example, both [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Big Dipper]] are visible during at least part of the year.

Making stellar observations from a representative set of points across the Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for the Earth.

Knowing the difference in angle between two points on the Earth's surface and the surface distance between them allows a calculation of the Earth's size.  Using observations at [[Rhodes]] (in Greece) and [[Alexandria]] (in Egypt) and the distance between them, the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Posidonius#Geography, ethnology, and geology|Posidonius]] actually did use this technique to calculate the circumference of the planet to within perhaps 4% of the correct value (though modern equivalents of his units of measure are not precisely known).

===Surface circumnavigation===

Since the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around the world in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier.  (See [[Circumnavigation]], [[Arctic exploration]], and [[History of Antarctica]].)

Some flat Earth theories that propose the world is a north-pole-centered disc, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.testingtheglobe.com/quest2.html&lt;/ref&gt; This disc model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disc in a circle.  (East-west paths form a circle in both disc and spherical geometry.)  It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it is not possible to perform a circumnavigation that includes the South Pole (which it posits does not exist).

Explorers, government researchers, commercial pilots, and tourists have been to [[Antarctica]] and found that it is not a large ring that encircles the entire world, but actually a roughly disc-shaped continent smaller than South America but larger than Australia, with an interior that can in fact be traversed in order to take a shorter path from e.g. the tip of South America to Australia than would be possible on a disc.

The first land crossing of the entirety of Antarctica was the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1955-58, and many exploratory airplanes have since passed over the continent in various directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2300322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2372669/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observing the Sun===

On a flat Earth, an omnidirectional Sun (emitting light in all directions, as it does) would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at the same time (with some small variations due to mountains and valleys). With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time (the hemisphere facing the Sun) and the other half is experiencing nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its [[antipodes|antipode]] - the location exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is always experiencing nighttime. The spherical shape of the Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight each day. 

In order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth theorists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time.&lt;ref&gt;claimed by http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="takes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is not consistent with observation; at sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming light travels in straight lines, actual measurements of the Sun's angle in the sky from locations very distant from each other are only consistent with a geometry where the Sun is very far away and is being seen from a hemispherical surface (the daylight half of the Earth).  These two phenomena are related: a low-altitude spotlight Sun would spent most of the day near the horizon for most locations on Earth (which is not observed), but rise and set fairly close to the horizon.  A high-altitude Sun would spend more of the day away from the horizon, but rise and set fairly far from the horizon (which is not observed).

====Local solar time and time zones====

{{main|Time zone}}

Ancient timekeeping reckoned "noon" as the time of day when the sun is highest in the sky, with the rest of the hours in the day measured against that.  During the day, the [[apparent solar time]] can be measured directly with a [[sundial]].  In ancient Egypt, the first known sundials divided the day into 12 hours, though because the length of the day changed with the season, the length of the hours also changed.  Sundials that defined hours as always being the same duration appeared in the [[Renaissance]].  In Western Europe, [[clock tower]]s and [[striking clock]]s were used in the Middle Ages to keep people nearby appraised of the local time, though compared to modern times this was less important in a largely agrarian society.

Because the Sun reaches its highest point at different times for different [[longitude]]s (about four minutes of time for every degree of longitude difference east or west), the local solar noon in each city is different except for those directly north or south of each other.  This means that the clocks in different cities could be offset from each other by minutes or hours.  As clocks became more precise and industrialization made timekeeping more important, cities switched to [[mean solar time]], which ignores minor variations in the timing of local solar noon over the year, due to the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, and its tilt.

The differences in clock time between cities was not generally a problem until the advent of [[railroad]] travel in the 1800s, which both made travel between distant cities much faster than by walking or horse, and also required passengers to show up at specific times to meet their desired trains.  In the [[United Kingdom]], railroads gradually switched to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone.  In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour.  At first railroad time was synchronized by portable [[Railroad chronometer|chronometer]]s, and then later by [[telegraph]] and [[radio]] signals.

[[San Francisco]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/richmond-virginia.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 122.41°W longitude and [[Richmond, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/san-francisco-california.html&lt;/ref&gt; is at 77.46°W longitude.  They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°).  The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example.  San Francisco is in the [[Pacific Time]] zone, and Richmond is in the [[Eastern Time]] zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.  But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California.

====Length of the day====

On a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time.  Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter.  Places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year.  Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times.

The movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  The imaginary line around which the Earth spins, which goes between the North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun.  The Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year ([[summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of the Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt).  For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the [[autumnal equinox]] and [[vernal equinox]], when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

The length of the day varies because as the Earth rotates some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle.

The length of [[twilight]] would be very different on a flat Earth. On a round Earth, the atmosphere above the ground is lit for a while before sunrise and after sunset are observed at ground level, because the Sun is still visible from higher altitudes.  Longer twilights are observed at higher latitudes (near the poles) due to a shallower angle of the Sun's apparent movement compared to the horizon.  On a flat Earth, the Sun's shadow would reach the upper atmosphere very quickly, except near the closest edge of the Earth, and would always set at the same angle to the ground (which is not what is observed).  The "spotlight Sun" theory is also not consistent with this observation, since the air cannot be lit without the ground below it also being lit (except for shadows of mountains and other surface obstacles).

====Determining the shape of the Earth====

On a given day, if many different cities measure the angle of the Sun at local noon, the resulting data, when combined with the known distances between cities, shows that the Earth has 180 degrees of north-south curvature.  (A full range of angles will be observed if the north and south poles are included, and the day chosen is either the autumnal or spring equinox.)  This is consistent with many rounded shapes, including a sphere, and is inconsistent with a flat shape.

Some claim that this experiment assumes a very distant Sun, such that the incoming rays are essentially parallel, and if a flat Earth is assumed, that the measured angles can allow one to calculate the distance to the Sun, which must be small enough that its incoming rays are not very parallel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ&lt;/ref&gt; However, if more than two relatively well-separated cities are included in the experiment, the calculation will make clear whether the Sun is distant or nearby.  For example, on the equinox, the 0 degree angle from the North Pole and the 90 degree angle from the equator predict a Sun which would have to be located essentially next to the surface of a flat Earth, but the difference in angle between the equator and New York City would predict a Sun much further away if the Earth is flat.  Because these results are contradictory, the surface of the Earth cannot be flat; the data ''is'' consistent with a nearly spherical Earth and a Sun which is very far away compared with the diameter of the Earth.

====Determining the size of the Earth====

Using the knowledge that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer Eratosthenes [[Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference|performed an experiment]] using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Though modern telecommunications and timekeeping were not available, he was able to make sure the measurements happened at the same time by having them taken when the Sun was highest in the sky (local noon) at both locations. Using slightly inaccurate assumptions about the locations of two cities, he came to a result within 15% of the correct value.

====Watching the sun set twice====

On level ground, the difference in the distance to the horizon between lying down and standing up is large enough to watch the Sun set twice by quickly standing up immediately after seeing it set for the first time while lying down.  This also can be done with a [[cherry picker]]&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/06/a-date-idea-analyzed/&lt;/ref&gt; or a tall building with a fast elevator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5917230/did-you-know-that-the-burj-khalifa-is-so-tall-that-you-can-watch-two-sunsets-on-the-same-day Did You Know That the Burj Khalifa Is So Tall That you Can Watch Two Sunsets On the Same Day?]&lt;/ref&gt; On a flat Earth, one would not be able to see the Sun again (unless standing near the edge closest to the Sun) due to a much faster-moving Sun shadow.&lt;ref name="headsup" /&gt; 

When the supersonic [[Concorde]] took off not long after sunset from London and flew westward to New York faster than the sunset was advancing westward on the ground, passengers observed a sunrise in the west. After landing in New York, passengers saw a second sunset in the west.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the speed of the Sun's shadow is slower in polar regions (due to the steeper angle), even a subsonic aircraft can overtake the sunset when flying at high latitudes. One photographer used a roughly circular route around the North Pole to take pictures of 24 sunsets in the same 24-hour period, pausing westward progress in each time zone to let the shadow of the Sun catch up.&lt;ref name="twenty_four"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2788267/here-comes-suns-photographer-travels-time-zone-capture-24-sunsets-one-day.html Here comes the suns! Photographer travels through every time zone to capture 24 sunsets in ONE DAY]&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the Earth rotates at {{convert|180.17|mph}} at 80° north or south, and {{convert|1040.4|mph}} at the equator.&lt;ref name="twenty_four" /&gt;

===Spherical vs. flat triangles===
[[Image:Triangles (spherical geometry).jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram showing how the interior angles of triangles add up to about 180° when plotted on a small, nearly flat area of the Earth, but add up to more than 180° (in this case 230°) when plotted on a large area with significant curvature]]
Because the Earth is spherical, long-distance travel sometimes requires heading in different directions than one would head on a flat Earth.

For example, consider an airplane that travels {{convert|10000|km}} in a straight line, takes a 90-degree right turn, travels another {{convert|10000|km}}, takes another 90-degree right turn, and travels {{convert|10000|km}} a third time.  On a flat Earth, the aircraft would have travelled along three sides of a square, and arrive at a spot about {{convert|10000|km}} from where it started. But because the Earth is spherical, in reality it will have travelled along three sides of a triangle, and arrive back very close to its starting point.  If the starting point is the North Pole, it would have travelled due south from the North Pole to the equator, then west for a quarter of the way around the Earth, and then due north back to the North Pole.

In [[spherical geometry]], the sum of angles inside a triangle is greater than 180° (in this example 270°, having arrived back at the north pole a 90° angle to the departure path) unlike on a flat surface, where it is always exactly 180°.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/tripleright.jpg Triple-right triangle on a sphere (image)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grids are distorted by spherical ground===

A [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[longitude]] is a line where local solar noon occurs at the same time each day.  These lines define "north" and "south".  These are perpendicular to lines of [[latitude]] that define "east" and "west", where the Sun is at the same angle at local noon on the same day.  If the Sun were travelling from east to west over a flat Earth, meridian lines would always be the same distance apart - they would form a square grid when combined with lines of latitude. In reality, meridian lines get farther apart as one travels toward the equator, which is only possible on a round Earth.  In places where land is plotted on a grid system, this causes discontinuities in the grid.  For example, in areas of the [[Midwestern United States]] that use the [[Public Land Survey System]], the northernmost and westernmost sections of a [[township]] deviate from what would otherwise be an exact square mile.  The resulting discontinuities are sometimes reflected directly in local roads, which have kinks where the grid cannot follow completely straight lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/gerco-de-ruijter-grid-corrections-highways-driving-wichita Mysterious Detour While Driving? It Could Be Due to the Curvature of the Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weather systems===

Low-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a [[hurricane]]) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator.  This is due to the [[Coriolis force]], and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of the Earth are angled in opposite directions (e.g. the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).

===Gravity===

The laws of [[gravity]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] that explain the formation and rounding of the Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks.

From these laws, we know the amount of mass the Earth contains, and that a non-spherical planet the size of the Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.  A flat disc the size of the Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape.  On a disc strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disc,&lt;ref name="smarter" /&gt; contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would create major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk).

Ignoring the other concerns, some flat Earth theorists explain the observed surface "gravity" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards.&lt;ref name="takes" /&gt; Such a theory would also leave open for explanation the [[tide]]s seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.

===Technology===

Observation of [[Foucault pendulum]]s, popular in science museums around the world, demonstrate both that the world is spherical and that it rotates (not that the stars are rotating around it).

The mathematics of navigation by [[GPS]] assume that satellites are moving in known orbits around an approximately spherical surface.  The accuracy of GPS navigation in determining latitude and longitude and the way these numbers map onto locations on the ground show that these assumptions are correct.  The same is true for the operational [[GLONASS]] system run by Russia, and the in-development European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]], and Indian [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|IRNSS]].

Satellites, including communications satellites used for television, telephone, and Internet connections, would not stay in orbit unless the modern theory of gravitation were correct.  The details of which satellites are visible from which places on the ground at which times prove an approximately spherical shape of the Earth.  (Undersea cables are also used for intercontinental communications.)

Radio transmitters are mounted on tall towers because they generally rely on [[line-of-sight propagation]]. The distance to the [[horizon]] is further at higher altitude, so mounting them higher significantly increases the area they can serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/bob-released-neil-degrasse-tyson-diss-track&lt;/ref&gt; Some signals can be transmitted at much longer distances, but only if they are at frequencies where they can use [[groundwave propagation]], [[tropospheric propagation]], [[tropospheric scatter]], or [[ionospheric propagation]] to reflect or refract signals around the curve of the Earth.

===Architecture===

The design of some large structures needs to take the shape of the Earth into account.  For example, the towers of the [[Humber Bridge]], although both vertical with respect to gravity, are {{convert|36|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the local curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgrimsby.co.uk/humber.htm|publisher=Visit Grimsby|title=The Humber Bridge|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was discovered.&lt;ref name="evans47"&gt;James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 47, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible explanation is that it was "the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable [[altitude]] of the pole and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between [[Greek colonies|Greek settlements]]"&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"/&gt; around the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], particularly those between the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name="Neugebauer.575–6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy|author=Otto E.

In ''The Histories'', written 431–425&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north.

To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians' report and even open the possibility that the Phoenicians knew about the spherical model. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friis|first=Herman Ralph|title=The Pacific Basin: A History of Its Geographical Exploration|date=1967|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veuwAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Plato=====
[[Plato]] (427–347&amp;nbsp;BC) travelled to southern [[Italy]] to study [[Pythagorean mathematics]]. When he returned to [[Athens]] and established his school, Plato also taught his students that Earth was a sphere, though he offered no justifications. "My conviction is that the Earth is a round body in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or of any similar force to be a support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Phaedo]]|author=Plato|page=108|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; If man could soar high above the clouds, Earth would resemble "one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on Earth are in a manner samples."&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], his one work that was available throughout the Middle Ages in Latin, we read that the Creator "made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures",&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Timaeus|author=Plato|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word "world" here refers to the heavens.

=====Aristotle=====
[[File:20080816eclipsed2.jpg|thumb|150px|Round Earth umbra during the [[August 2008 lunar eclipse]]]]
[[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) was Plato's prize student and "the mind of the school".&lt;ref&gt;David Johnson and Thomas Mowry, ''Mathematics: A Practical Odyssey'', [[Cengage Learning]], 2011, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed "there are [[star]]s seen in [[Egypt]] and [...] [[Cyprus]] which are not seen in the northerly regions." Since this could only happen on a curved surface, he too believed Earth was a sphere "of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent." (''De caelo'', 298a2–10)

Aristotle provided physical and observational arguments supporting the idea of a spherical Earth:

* Every portion of the Earth tends toward the centre until by compression and convergence they form a sphere. (''De caelo'', 297a9–21)
* Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and
* The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round. (''De caelo'', 297b31–298a10).

The concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|''Meteorology'']] he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the [[equator]], and two cold inhospitable regions, "one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the [[...]] southern pole," both impenetrable and girdled with ice (''Meteorologica'', 362a31–35). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.

[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotle's theory of natural place]] relied on a spherical Earth to explain why [[Earth (classical element)|heavy things]] go down (toward what Aristotle believed was the center of the Universe), and things like [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] go up. In this [[geocentric model]], the structure of the universe was believed to be a series of perfect spheres. The Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars were believed to move on [[celestial spheres]] around a stationary Earth.

Though Aristotle's theory of physics survived in the Christian world for many centuries, the [[heliocentric model]] was eventually shown to be a more correct explanation of the [[Solar System]] than the geocentric model, and [[atomic theory]] was shown to be a more correct explanation of the nature of matter than [[classical element]]s like earth, water, air, fire, and aether.

=====Archimedes=====
In proposition 2 of the First Book of his treatise "On floating bodies," [[Archimedes]] demonstrates that "The surface of any fluid at rest is the surface of a sphere whose centre is the same as that of the earth,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | translator-last = Heath | translator-first = T.

=====Eratosthenes=====
[[Eratosthenes]], a Greek [[Hellenistic astronomy|astronomer]] from [[Hellenistic]] [[Cyrenaica]] (276–194&amp;nbsp;BC), estimated [[Earth]]'s circumference around 240&amp;nbsp;BC. He had heard that in [[Syene]] the [[Sun]] was directly overhead at the summer [[solstice]] whereas in [[Alexandria]] it still cast a shadow. Using the differing angles the shadows made as the basis of his trigonometric calculations he estimated a circumference of around 250,000 ''[[Ancient Greek units of measurement|stades]]''. The length of a 'stade' is not precisely known, but Eratosthenes's figure only has an error of around five to fifteen percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Albert | last = Van Helden | title = Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 1985 | pages = 4–5 | isbn = 0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_JSC_NES_School_Measures_Up.html|title=JSC NES School Measures Up|publisher=NASA|date=11 April 2006|accessdate=7 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scolumb.htm|title=The Round Earth|publisher=NASA|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eratosthenes used rough estimates and round numbers, but depending on the length of the [[stadia (length)|stadion]], his result is within a margin of between 2% and 20% of the actual [[meridional]] [[circumference]], {{convert|40008|km}}. Note that [[Eratosthenes]] could only measure the circumference of the Earth by assuming that the [[distance to the Sun]] is so great that the rays of [[sunlight]] are practically [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G.

Seventeen hundred years after Eratosthenes, Christopher Columbus studied Eratosthenes's findings before sailing west for the Indies. However, ultimately he rejected Eratosthenes in favour of other maps and arguments that interpreted Earth's circumference to be a third smaller than reality. If, instead, Columbus had accepted Eratosthenes findings, then he may have never gone west, since he didn't have the supplies or funding needed for the much longer voyage.&lt;ref&gt;

=====Seleucus of Seleucia=====
[[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (c.&amp;nbsp;190&amp;nbsp;BC), who lived in the city of [[Seleucia]] in [[Mesopotamia]], wrote that the Earth is spherical (and actually orbits the [[Sun]], influenced by the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of [[Aristarchus of Samos]]).

=====Posidonius=====
[[Posidonius]] (c. 135 – 51 BC) put faith in Eratosthenes's method, though by observing the star [[Canopus]], rather than the sun in establishing the Earth's circumference. In Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', his result was favoured over that of Eratosthenes. Posidonius furthermore expressed the distance of the sun in earth radii.

====Roman Empire====
From its Greek origins, the idea of a spherical earth, along with much of [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomical thought]], slowly spread across the globe and ultimately became the adopted view in all major astronomical traditions.&lt;ref name="Krüger: Roman and medieval continuation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ragep: Islamic adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pingree: Indian adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martzloff, Cullen: Chinese adoption"/&gt;

In the West, the idea came to the Romans through the lengthy process of cross-fertilization with [[Hellenistic civilization]]. Many Roman authors such as [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] refer in their works to the rotundity of the earth as a matter of course.&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"&gt;Krüger, Reinhard: [https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/5268/1/ReinhardKrueger.pdf "Ein Versuch über die Archäologie der Globalisierung.

=====Strabo=====
[[File:Shiphorp.jpg|thumb|When a ship is at the horizon, its [[Hull-down|lower part is obscured]] by the Earth's curvature. This was one of the first arguments favouring a round-Earth model.]]
It has been suggested that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that the Earth was not flat, based on observations of the [[horizon]]. This argument was put forward by the geographer [[Strabo]] (c.&amp;nbsp;64&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 24&amp;nbsp;AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of the Earth was probably known to seafarers around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] since at least the time of [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=strabo&gt;Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 118. {{ISBN|0-387-94107-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a line from the ''[[Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', Bk. 5 393: "As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near." [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler's]] translation is [http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/odyssey.5.v.html#284 available online].&lt;/ref&gt; as indicating that the poet [[Homer]] knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. [[Strabo]] cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that the Earth was spherical. He observed that elevated lights or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= The Geography of Strabo, in Eight Volumes | author= Strabo | others= Loeb Classical Library edition, translated by Horace Leonard Jones, A.M., Ph.D. | date= 1960 | origyear= 1917 | location= London | publisher= William Heinemann }}, Vol.I Bk. I para. 20, pp.41, 43. An earlier edition is [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/1A*.html#1.20 available online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Claudius Ptolemy=====
[[Claudius Ptolemy]] (90–168&amp;nbsp;AD) lived in [[Alexandria]], the centre of scholarship in the 2nd century. In the ''[[Almagest]],'' which remained the standard work of astronomy for 1,400 years, he advanced many arguments for the spherical nature of the Earth. Among them was the observation that when a ship is sailing towards [[mountain]]s, observers note these seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea. He also gives separate arguments that the Earth is curved north-south and that it is curved east-west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ptolemy | title = Almagest | pages = I.4}} as quoted in {{Cite book| first = Edward | last = Grant | title = A Source Book in Medieval Science | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1974 | pages = 63–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He compiled an eight-volume ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' covering what was known about the earth. The first part of the ''Geographia'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]] (the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the [[polar circle]]). He put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the [[Canary Islands]].

''Geographia'' indicated the countries of "[[Seres|Serica]]" and "Sinae" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of "Taprobane" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the "Aurea Chersonesus" ([[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian peninsula]]).

Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''oikoumenè'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geographia,'' he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumenè'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[China]], and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the [[East Indies]] and deep into [[Africa]]. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.

=====Late Antiquity=====
Knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth was received in scholarship of [[Late Antiquity]] as a matter of course, in both [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Early Christianity]]. [[Calcidius]]'s fourth-century [[Latin language|Latin]] commentary on and translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'', which was one of the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages in Western Europe, discussed [[Hipparchus]]'s use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the [[On Sizes and Distances|relative diameters]] of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | title = Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1998 | pages = 119–120 | isbn = 978-0-521-77852-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Calcidius | author-link = Calcidius | editor-last = Klibansky| editor-first = Raymond| editor-link = Raymond Klibansky| date = 1962 | title = Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus | series = Corpus Platonicum Medii Aevi, Plato Latinus | volume = 4 | publisher = Brill / Warburg Institute| publication-place = Leiden / London | pages = 141–144 | isbn = 9780854810529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theological doubt informed by the [[flat Earth]] model implied in the [[Hebrew Bible]] inspired some early Christian scholars such as [[Lactantius]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], but this remained an eccentric current. Learned Christian authors such as [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Ambrose]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] were clearly aware of the sphericity of the Earth. "Flat Earthism" lingered longest in [[Syriac Christianity]], which tradition laid greater importance on a literalist interpretation of the Old Testament. Authors from that tradition, such as [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], presented the Earth as flat as late as in the 6th century. This last remnant of the ancient model of the cosmos disappeared during the 7th century. From the 8th century and the beginning [[Early Middle Ages|medieval period]], "no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Anselm Vogel, "Sphaera terrae – das mittelalterliche Bild der Erde und die kosmographische Revolution," PhD dissertation Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, 1995, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Greek ethnographer [[Megasthenes]], c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC, has been interpreted as stating that the contemporary Brahmans believed in a spherical earth as the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of [[Hellenistic period|Greek culture]] in the east, [[Hellenistic astronomy]] filtered eastwards to [[ancient India]] where its profound influence became apparent in the early centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Pingree (1978), 533, 554f."/&gt; The Greek concept of an Earth surrounded by the spheres of the planets and that of the fixed stars, vehemently supported by astronomers like [[Varahamihir]] and [[Brahmagupta]], strengthened the astronomical principles. Some ideas were found possible to preserve, although in altered form.&lt;ref name="Pingree (1978), 533, 554f."&gt;D.

The works of the classical [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] and [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]], [[Aryabhatta]] (476–550 AD), deal with the sphericity of the Earth and the motion of the planets. The final two parts of his [[Sanskrit]] magnum opus, the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', which were named the ''Kalakriya'' ("reckoning of time") and the ''Gol'' ("sphere"), state that the Earth is spherical and that its circumference is 4,967 [[yojana]]s.

===Middle Ages===
Knowledge of the sphericity of the Earth survived into the medieval corpus of knowledge by direct transmission of the texts of Greek antiquity ([[Aristotle]]), and via authors such as [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Beda Venerabilis]].
It became increasingly traceable with the rise of [[scholasticism]] and [[Medieval university|medieval learning]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;
Spread of this knowledge beyond the immediate sphere of Greco-Roman scholarship was necessarily gradual, associated with the pace of [[Christianisation]] of Europe. For example, the first evidence of knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth in [[Scandinavia]] is a 12th-century [[Old Icelandic]] translation of ''[[Elucidarius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Simek, ''Altnordische Kosmographie'', Berlin, 1990, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-exhaustive list of more than a hundred [[Latin]] and vernacular writers from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] who were aware that the earth was spherical has been compiled by Reinhard Krüger, professor for Romance literature at the [[University of Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Reinhard Krüger"/&gt;{{seemore|message=Krüger's list of the 79 authors known by name can be studied by clicking on}}

;Isidore of Seville
Bishop [[Isidore of Seville]] (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, ''The [[Etymologiae|Etymologies]],'' that the Earth was "round".&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.ii.1 [3].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop's confusing exposition and choice of imprecise Latin terms have divided scholarly opinion on whether he meant a sphere or a disk or even whether he meant anything specific.&lt;ref&gt;Referring to Isidore's five circles in ''De Natura Rerum'' X 5, ERnest Brehaut wrote: "The explanation of the passage and of the figure which illustrates it seems to be that Isidore accepted the terminology of the spherical earth from Hyginus without taking the time to understand it—if indeed he had the ability to do so—and applied it without compunction to the flat earth." {{cite book|title=Encyclopedist of the Flat Earth|author=Ernest Brehaut|page=30|date=1912}} Similarly, J. Fontaine refers to this passage as a "scientific absurdity".{{cite book|title=Traité de la Nature|author=Isidore of Seville|editor=J. Fontaine|date=1960|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable recent scholars claim that he taught a spherical earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley M. Stevens, "The Figure of the Earth in Isidore's 'De natura rerum," ''Isis'', 71(1980): 268–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore did not admit the possibility of people dwelling at the antipodes, considering them as legendary&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' XIV.v.17 [4].&lt;/ref&gt; and noting that there was no evidence for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologiae,'' IX.ii.133 [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bede the Venerable

The monk [[Bede]] (c.&amp;nbsp;672–735) wrote in his influential treatise on computus, ''The Reckoning of Time'', that the Earth was round. He explained the unequal length of daylight from "the roundness of the Earth, for not without reason is it called 'the orb of the world' on the pages of Holy Scripture and of ordinary literature. It is, in fact, set like a sphere in the middle of the whole universe." (De temporum ratione, 32). The large number of surviving manuscripts of ''The Reckoning of Time,'' copied to meet the Carolingian requirement that all priests should study the computus, indicates that many, if not most, priests were exposed to the idea of the sphericity of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans., ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time,'' (Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004), pp. lxxxv–lxxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] paraphrased Bede into Old English, saying, "Now the Earth's roundness and the Sun's orbit constitute the obstacle to the day's being equally long in every land."&lt;ref&gt;Ælfric of Eynsham, ''On the Seasons of the Year,'' Peter Baker, trans&lt;/ref&gt;

Bede was lucid about earth's sphericity, writing "We call the earth a globe, not as if the shape of a sphere were expressed in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth's circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe... For truly it is an orb placed in the centre of the universe; in its width it is like a circle, and not circular like a shield but rather like a ball, and it extends from its centre with perfect roundness on all sides."&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;Russell, Jeffrey B. 1991. ''Inventing the Flat Earth''. New York: Praeger Publishers. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Anania Shirakatsi
The 7th-century [[Armenia]]n scholar [[Anania Shirakatsi]] described the world as "being like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hewsen |first1=Robert H. |authorlink1=Robert H.

====Islamic astronomy====
[[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] was developed on the basis of a spherical earth inherited from [[Hellenistic astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"&gt;Ragep, F. Jamil: "Astronomy", in: Krämer, Gudrun (ed.) et al.: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Brill 2010, without page numbers&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic theoretical framework largely relied on the fundamental contributions of [[Aristotle]] (''[[De caelo]]'') and [[Ptolemy]] (''[[Almagest]]''), both of whom worked from the premise that the earth was spherical and at the centre of the universe ([[geocentric model]]).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam: Astronomy"/&gt;

Early Islamic scholars recognized Earth's sphericity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]]. ''L'Islam et son impulsion scientifique originelle'', Tiers-Monde, 1982, vol. 23, n° 92, p. 789.&lt;/ref&gt; leading [[Islamic mathematics|Muslim mathematicians]] to develop [[spherical trigonometry]]&lt;ref&gt;David A. King, ''Astronomy in the Service of Islam'', (Aldershot (U.K.): Variorum), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to further mensuration and to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]]. This determined the ''[[Qibla]],'' or Muslim direction of prayer.

;Al-Ma'mun
Around 830&amp;nbsp;AD, Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] commissioned a group of [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] and [[Islamic geography|geographers]] to measure the distance from Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]) to [[Raqqa]] in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of [[latitude]] and the [[meridian arc]] distance between them to be 66{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;miles and thus calculated the Earth's circumference to be 24,000&amp;nbsp;miles.&lt;ref&gt;''Gharā'ib al-funūn wa-mulah al-`uyūn'' (The Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes), 2.1 "On the mensuration of the Earth and its division into seven climes, as related by Ptolemy and others," (ff. 22b–23a)[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/bookofcuriosities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another estimate given by his astronomers was 56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles (111.8&amp;nbsp;km) per degree, which corresponds to a circumference of 40,248&amp;nbsp;km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3&amp;nbsp;km per degree and 40,068&amp;nbsp;km circumference, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Kennedy, ''Mathematical Geography'', pp=187–8, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ibn Hazm
[[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[polymath]] [[Ibn Hazm]] stated that the proof of the Earth's sphericity "is that the Sun is always vertical to a particular spot on Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-6106905.html "How Islamic inventors changed the world"].

[[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|Al-Farghānī]] (Latinized as Alfraganus) was a Persian astronomer of the 9th century involved in measuring the diameter of the Earth, and commissioned by Al-Ma'mun. His estimate given above for a degree (56{{frac|2|3}} Arabic miles) was much more accurate than the 60{{frac|2|3}} Roman miles (89.7&amp;nbsp;km) given by Ptolemy. [[Christopher Columbus]] uncritically used Alfraganus's figure as if it were in Roman miles instead of in Arabic miles, in order to prove a smaller size of the Earth than that propounded by Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''Columbus and the Conquest of the Impossible'', pp. 20–1, Phoenix Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Biruni
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|Biruni's method for calculation of Earth's radius]]
[[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (973–1048) used a new method to accurately compute the Earth's [[circumference]], by which he arrived at a value that was close to modern values for the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Aber (2003). Alberuni calculated the Earth's circumference at a small town of Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan.[http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm Abu Rayhan al-Biruni], [[Emporia State University]].&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.6&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 31.4&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using [[Trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top. This yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location.&lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 31, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savizi&gt;

Biruni's method was intended to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts," and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India. From the top of the mountain, he sighted the angle to the horizon which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), allowed him to calculate the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-31635-2| pages = 182–184| editor = J.

According to John J. O'Connor and Edmund F. Robertson,
{{quote|Important contributions to [[geodesy]] and [[Islamic geography|geography]] were also made by Biruni. He introduced techniques to measure the earth and distances on it using [[triangulation]]. He found the [[Earth radius|radius of the earth]] to be 6339.6 km, a value not obtained in the West until the 16th century.

;Applications
Muslim scholars who held to the round Earth theory used it for a quintessentially Islamic purpose: to calculate the distance and direction from any given point on the Earth to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 11th century, [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] used spherical trigonometry to find the direction of Mecca from many cities and published it in ''The Determination of the Co-ordinates of Cities''. See Lyons, 2009, p85&lt;/ref&gt; This determined the [[Qibla]], or Muslim direction of prayer.

A terrestrial globe (Kura-i-ard) was among the presents sent by the Persian Muslim astronomer [[Jamal ad-Din (astronomer)|Jamal-al-Din]] to [[Kublai Khan]]'s [[China|Chinese]] court in 1267. It was made of wood on which "seven parts of water are represented in green, three parts of land in white, with rivers, lakes etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1959|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho Peng Yoke remarks that "it did not seem to have any general appeal to the Chinese in those days".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Ho Peng Yoke|title=Li, Qi and Shu, An introduction to Science and Civilisation in China|date=1985|publisher=New York, Dover Publications|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High and late medieval Europe====

[[File:John Gower world Vox Clamantis.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Gower]] prepares to shoot the world, a sphere with compartments representing earth, air, and water (''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', around 1400)]]
During the [[High Middle Ages]], the astronomical knowledge in Christian Europe was extended beyond what was transmitted directly from ancient authors by transmission of learning from [[Medieval Islamic astronomy]]. An early student of such learning was Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later [[Pope Sylvester II]].

Saint Hildegard ([[Hildegard von Bingen]], 1098–1179), depicted the spherical earth several times in her work ''Liber Divinorum Operum''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/galileopalazzostrozzi/object/HildegardOfBingenLiberDivinorumOperum.html Hildegard of Bingen, Liber divinorum operum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes de Sacrobosco]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1195 – c.&amp;nbsp;1256&amp;nbsp;AD) wrote a famous work on Astronomy called ''[[Tractatus de Sphaera]],'' based on Ptolemy, which primarily considers the sphere of the sky. However, it contains clear proofs of the earth's sphericity in the first chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Pedersen, "In Quest of Sacrobosco", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 16(1985): 175–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Sphere of Sacrobosco|others=trans. Lynn Thorndike|date=1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentators on Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]'' and Sacrobosco's ''Treatise on the Sphere'' unanimously agreed that the earth is spherical or round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200–1687 | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1996 | pages = 620–622, 737–738 | isbn = 0-521-56509-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant observes that no author who had studied at a [[medieval university]] thought that the earth was flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | title = God and Reason in the Middle Ages | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2001 | page = 339 | isbn = 0-521-00337-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Elucidarium'' of [[Honorius Augustodunensis]] (c. 1120), an important manual for the instruction of lesser clergy, which was translated into [[Middle English]], [[Old French]], [[Middle High German]], [[Old Russian]], [[Middle Dutch]], [[Old Norse]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that [[Bertold von Regensburg]] (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth as an illustration in a [[sermon]] shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was preached in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.

Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' written in Italian in the early 14th century, portrays Earth as a sphere, discussing implications such as the different stars visible in the [[southern hemisphere]], the altered position of the [[sun]], and the various [[timezone]]s of the Earth.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] exploration of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s voyage to the [[Americas]] (1492) and, finally, [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s circumnavigation of the earth (1519–21) provided practical evidence of the global shape of the earth.

===Early Modern period===

====Circumnavigation of the globe====
{{further|Age of Discovery}}
[[File:Behaims Erdapfel.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''[[Erdapfel]]'', the oldest surviving terrestrial globe (1492/93)]]

The first direct demonstration of Earth's sphericity came in the form of the first circumnavigation in history, an expedition captained by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nowell, Charles E. ed. (1962). Magellan's Voyage around the World: Three Contemporary Accounts. Evanston: NU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was financed by the Spanish Crown. On August 10, 1519, the five ships under Magellan's command departed from [[Seville]]. They crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], passed through what is now called the [[Strait of Magellan]], crossed the Pacific, and arrived in [[Cebu]], where Magellan was killed by Philippine natives in a battle. His second in command, the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], continued the expedition and, on September 6, 1522, arrived at Seville, completing the circumnavigation. [[Charles I of Spain]], in recognition of his feat, gave Elcano a [[coat of arms]] with the motto ''Primus circumdedisti me'' (in Latin, "You went around me first").&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs(2006), "The story of geographical discovery" p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

A circumnavigation alone does not prove that the earth is spherical. It could be cylindric or irregularly globular or one of many other shapes. Still, combined with trigonometric evidence of the form used by Eratosthenes 1,700 years prior, the Magellan expedition removed any reasonable doubt in educated circles in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = ICSE Geography IX|author = RK Jain|publisher = Ratna Sagar|page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Transglobe Expedition]] (1979–1982) was the first expedition to make a circumpolar circumnavigation, traveling the world "vertically" traversing both of the poles of rotation using only surface transport.

====Ming China====
In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth, now considerably advanced by [[Scientific revolution|Western astronomy]], ultimately spread to [[Ming China]], when [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]], who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court, successfully challenged the Chinese belief that the Earth was flat and square.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|title=Jean-Claude Martzloff, "Space and Time in Chinese Texts of Astronomy and of Mathematical Astronomy in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries", ''Chinese Science'' 11 (1993–94): 66–92 (69)|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305205943/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs11/cs11-4-martzloff.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1980)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, “Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy”, ''Past and Present'', No. 87. (May, 1980), pp. 39–53 (42 &amp; 49)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cullen (1976)"&gt;Christopher Cullen, "A Chinese Eratosthenes of the Flat Earth: A Study of a Fragment of Cosmology in Huai Nan Tzu 淮 南 子", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', Vol. 39, No. 1 (1976), pp. 106–127 (107–109)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ge zhi cao'' (格致草) treatise of Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇) published in 1648 showed a printed picture of the Earth as a spherical globe, with the text stating that "the round Earth certainly has no square corners".&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. pp. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; The text also pointed out that sailing ships could return to their port of origin after circumnavigating the waters of the Earth.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt;

The influence of the map is distinctly Western, as traditional maps of Chinese cartography held the graduation of the sphere at 365.25 degrees, while the Western graduation was of 360 degrees. Also of interest to note is on one side of the world, there is seen towering [[Chinese pagoda]]s, while on the opposite side (upside-down) there were European [[cathedral]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 499"/&gt; The adoption of European astronomy, facilitated by the failure of indigenous astronomy to make progress, was accompanied by a [[sinocentric]] reinterpretation that declared the imported ideas Chinese in origin:

&lt;blockquote&gt;European astronomy was so much judged worth consideration that numerous Chinese authors developed the idea that the Chinese of antiquity had anticipated most of the novelties presented by the missionaries as European discoveries, for example, the rotundity of the Earth and the "heavenly spherical star carrier model." Making skillful use of philology, these authors cleverly reinterpreted the greatest technical and literary works of Chinese antiquity. From this sprang a new science wholly dedicated to the demonstration of the Chinese origin of astronomy and more generally of all European science and technology.&lt;ref name="Jean-Claude Martzloff 69"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although mainstream Chinese science until the 17th century held the view that the earth was flat, square, and enveloped by the [[celestial sphere]], this idea was criticized by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin-dynasty]] scholar [[Yu Xi]] (fl. 307–345), who suggested that the Earth could be either square or round, in accordance with the shape of the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 220, 498–499.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] mathematician [[Li Ye (mathematician)|Li Ye]] (c. 1192–1279) firmly argued that the Earth was spherical, just like the shape of the heavens only smaller, since a square Earth would hinder the movement of the heavens and celestial bodies in his estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century ''Ge zhi cao'' treatise also used the same terminology to describe the shape of the Earth that the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] scholar [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 AD) had used to describe the shape of the sun and moon (i.e. that the former was as round as a [[crossbow]] bullet, and the latter was the shape of a ball).&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Wang, Ling. (1995) [1959]. ''Science and Civilization in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'', vol. 3, reprint edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-05801-5}}, pp. 227, 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and representation==
{{Main|Geodesy}}
[[Geodesy]], also called geodetics, is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the Earth, its [[gravitation]]al field and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]], Earth [[tide]]s, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional time-varying space.

Geodesy is primarily concerned with positioning and the gravity field and geometrical aspects of their temporal variations, although it can also include the study of Earth's [[magnetic field]]. Especially in the [[German language|German]] speaking world, geodesy is divided into [[geomensuration]] ("Erdmessung" or "höhere Geodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on a global scale, and [[Geophysical survey|surveying]] ("Ingenieurgeodäsie"), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.

The Earth's shape can be thought of in at least two ways;
* as the shape of the [[geoid]], the mean sea level of the world ocean; or
* as the shape of Earth's land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.

As the science of [[geodesy]] measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]], a specific type of [[ellipsoid]]. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s beneath Earth's surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2056">'''Stellar mass loss''' is a phenomenon observed in some massive [[star]]s. It occurs when a triggering event causes the ejection of a large portion of the star's mass. Stellar mass loss can also occur when a star gradually loses material to  a binary companion or into interstellar space. 

==Causes==
A number of factors can contribute to the loss of mass in giant stars, including:
*Gravitational attraction of a binary companion
*[[Coronal mass ejection]]-type events
*Ascension to [[red giant]] or [[red supergiant]] status

===Gravitational mass loss===
Often when a star is a member of a pair of close-orbiting [[binary star]]s, the tidal attraction of the gasses near the center of mass are sufficient to pull gas from one star onto its partner. This effect is especially prominent when the partner is a [[white dwarf]], [[neutron star]], or [[black hole]].

===Mass ejection===
Certain classes of stars, especially [[Wolf-Rayet stars]] are sufficiently massive and distended that their hold on their upper layers is rather weak. Often, events such as [[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]] will then be sufficiently powerful to blast some of the upper material into space.

===Red giant mass loss===
Stars which have entered the red giant phase are notorious for rapid mass loss. As above, the gravitational hold on the upper layers is weakened, and they may be shed into space by violent events such as the beginning of a [[helium flash]] in the core. The final stage of a red giant's life will also result in prodigious mass loss as the star loses its outer layers to form a [[planetary nebula]].

'''Triglav''' ({{Lang-cu|Триглав|lit=three-headed one}}; {{Lang-la|Triglau}}), also sometimes called ''Troglav'', is a deity in [[Slavic mythology|Slavic theology]].

[[Triglav|Mount Triglav]], the highest mountain in [[Slovenia]], is unlikely to have any connection to the Slavic deity Triglav.&lt;ref&gt;Snoj, Marko. 2009. ''Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen''. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a claim is made{{by whom|date=March 2013}} for Mount [[Troglav (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Troglav]], the highest peak of [[Dinara]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{cn|date=March 2013}}

Triglav is allegedly{{by whom|date=December 2016}} depicted as representation of three major Slavic gods that vary from one Slavic tribe to others that serve as the representatives of the above-mentioned realms. An early variation included [[Svarog]], [[Perun]], and [[Dazhbog]]. Later, Dazhbog was replaced by [[Svetovid]] or [[Veles (god)|Veles]]. Triglav is usually described as a fusion of these gods.
{{by whom|date=March 2016}} 
Triglav is depicted as a [[multi-headed animal|three-headed man]] sometimes with bands of (gold) blindfolds over his eyes, or a man with three goat heads. Several temples dedicated to Triglav existed near present-day [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]. The Polish village of [[Trzygłów]] ({{lang-de|Trieglaff}}) is where, according to [[Johannes Bugenhagen]] in his ''Pomerania'' (1517) an image of Triglav was buried in the village to protect it from the priests of [[Otto of Bamberg]] in the 1120's.&lt;ref name="Thadden"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thadden |first1=Rudolf von |title=Trieglaff: Balancing Church and Politics in a Pomeranian World, 1807-1948 |date=2013 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9780857459282 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7eTTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=%22trieglaff%22+slavic+god&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4tSyO-NeQD&amp;sig=LfThZvkPdY5WREfk7SQ3hZaVYKU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifhv2OqrXcAhWoIcAKHdLOAQ0Q6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trieglaff%22%20slavic%20god&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of Christianization, such temples and statues of Triglav were generally completely destroyed.

==Three heads==
According to the writing of [[Ebbo]], Triglav's heads were believed to represent sky, earth and the [[underworld]]. It was  believed that Triglav has three heads because he ruled these three kingdoms  and had a golden binding over his eyes and lips so he could not see people's sins nor speak about them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ebbo]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vita++episcopi+Bambergensis&amp;ei=opB6TaalH4WmsQOJuvmFAw&amp;ct=result&amp;pg=PA6&amp;id=n5lDAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vita Ottonts episcopi Bambergensis]''.

[[Image:Triody var.jpg|thumb|Examples of low power triodes from 1918 ''(left)'' to miniature tubes of the 1960s ''(right)'']]

A '''triode''' is an electronic [[amplifier|amplifying]] [[vacuum tube]] (or ''thermionic valve'' in British English) consisting of three [[electrode]]s inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated [[Electrical filament|filament]] or [[cathode]], a [[control grid|grid]], and a [[Plate electrode|plate]] ([[anode]]). Developed from [[Lee De Forest]]'s 1906 [[Audion]], a partial vacuum tube that added a grid electrode to the [[thermionic diode]] ([[Fleming valve]]), the triode was the first practical [[electronic amplifier]] and the ancestor of other types of vacuum tubes such as the [[tetrode]] and [[pentode]]. Its invention founded the [[electronics]] age, making possible amplified [[radio technology]] and long-distance [[telephony]]. Triodes were widely used in [[consumer electronics]] devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when [[transistor]]s replaced them. Today, their main remaining use is in high-power [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifiers in [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]] and industrial RF heating devices.  In recent years there has been a resurgence in demand for low power triodes due to renewed interest in tube-type audio systems by audiophiles who prefer the sound of tube-based electronics.

The name "triode" was coined by British physicist [[William Eccles]]&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book

By 1913 improved versions with higher vacuum were developed by Harold Arnold at [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]], which had purchased the rights to the Audion from De Forest, and [[Irving Langmuir]] at [[General Electric]], who named his tube the "Pliotron",&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nebeker" /&gt; These were the first [[vacuum tube]] triodes.&lt;ref name="Okamura" /&gt; The name "triode" appeared later, when it became necessary to distinguish it from other kinds of vacuum tubes with more or fewer elements (e.g. [[diode]]s, [[tetrode]]s, [[pentode]]s, etc.). There were lengthy lawsuits between De Forest and von Lieben, and De Forest and the [[Marconi Company]], who represented [[John Ambrose Fleming]], the inventor of the diode.

===Wider adoption===
The discovery of the triode's amplifying ability in 1912 revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of ''[[electronics]]'', the technology of [[passivity (engineering)|active]] ([[amplifier|amplifying]]) electrical devices. The triode was immediately applied to many areas of communication. Triode "[[continuous wave]]" [[transmitter|radio transmitters]] replaced the cumbersome inefficient "[[damped wave]]" [[spark gap transmitter]]s, allowing the transmission of sound by [[amplitude modulation]] (AM). Amplifying triode [[radio receiver]]s, which had the power to drive [[loudspeaker]]s, replaced weak [[crystal radio]]s, which had to be listened to with [[earphones]], allowing families to listen together. This resulted in the evolution of radio from a commercial message service to the first [[mass communication]] medium, with the beginning of [[radio broadcasting]] around 1920. Triodes made transcontinental telephone service possible. Vacuum tube triode [[repeater]]s, invented at [[AT&amp;T|Bell Telephone]] after its purchase of the Audion rights, allowed telephone calls to travel beyond the unamplified limit of about 800 miles. The opening by Bell of the first transcontinental telephone line was celebrated 3 years later, on January 25, 1915. Other inventions made possible by the triode were [[television]], [[public address system]]s, electric [[phonograph]]s, and [[talking motion picture]]s.

The triode served as the technological base from which later vacuum tubes developed, such as the [[tetrode]] ([[Walter Schottky]], 1916) and [[pentode]] (Gilles Holst and Bernardus Dominicus Hubertus Tellegen, 1926), which remedied some of the shortcomings of the triode detailed below.

The triode was very widely used in [[consumer electronic]]s such as radios, televisions, and [[audio system]]s until it was replaced in the 1960s by the [[transistor]], invented in 1947, which brought the "vacuum tube era" introduced by the triode to a close.  Today triodes are mostly used in high-power applications for which solid state [[semiconductor device]]s are unsuitable, such as radio transmitters and industrial heating equipment. However, more recently the triode and other vacuum tube devices have been experiencing a resurgence and comeback in high fidelity audio and musical equipment.  They also remain in use as vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs), which come in a variety of implementations but all are essentially triode devices.

== Construction ==
[[Image:Triode-english-text.svg|right|thumb|Structure of a modern low-power triode vacuum tube.  The glass and outer electrodes are shown partly cut away to reveal the construction.]]
[[File:Triode schematic labeled.svg|thumb|[[Schematic symbol]] used in [[circuit diagram]]s for a triode, showing symbols for electrodes.]]

All triodes have a hot [[cathode]] electrode heated by a [[electrical filament|filament]], which releases electrons, and a flat metal [[plate electrode|plate]] electrode to which the electrons are attracted, with a [[Control grid|grid]] consisting of a screen of wires between them to control the current.  These are sealed inside a glass container from which the air has been removed to a high vacuum, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; atm.  Since the filament eventually burns out, the tube has a limited lifetime and is made as a replaceable unit; the electrodes are attached to terminal pins which plug into a socket.  The operating lifetime of a triode is about 2000 hours for small tubes and 10,000 hours for power tubes.

=== Low power triodes ===
Low power triodes have a concentric construction ''(see drawing right)'', with the grid and anode as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode.   The [[cathode]] is a narrow metal tube down the center.  Inside the cathode is a [[electrical filament|filament]] called the "heater" consisting of a narrow strip of high resistance [[tungsten]] wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000&amp;nbsp;°C).  This type is called an "[[Hot cathode|indirectly heated cathode]]"  The cathode is coated with a mixture of [[alkaline earth]] oxides such as calcium and [[thorium oxide]] which reduces its [[work function]] so it produces more electrons.  The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode.  The anode is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid.  It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat-radiating fins.   The electrons travel in a radial direction, from cathode through the grid to the anode.   The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic [[electrical insulator|insulators]] and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to connecting pins.    A "[[getter]]", a small amount of shiny [[barium]] metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.

=== High-power triodes ===
High-power triodes generally use a [[electrical filament|filament]] which serves as the cathode (a directly heated cathode) because the emission coating on [[Hot cathode|indirectly heated cathodes]] is destroyed by the higher ion bombardment in power tubes. A [[thoriated tungsten]] filament is most often used, in which [[thorium]] in the tungsten forms a monolayer on the surface which increases electron emission. These generally run at higher temperatures than indirectly heated cathodes. The envelope of the tube is often made of more durable ceramic rather than glass, and all the materials have higher melting points to withstand higher heat levels produced. Tubes with anode power dissipation over several hundred watts are usually actively cooled; the anode, made of heavy copper, projects through the wall of the tube and is attached to a large external finned metal [[heat sink]] which is cooled by forced air or water.

=== Lighthouse tubes ===
[[Image:Scheib3.jpg|thumb|Soviet lighthouse tube '''6С5Д''' (6S5D)]]
A type of low power triode for use at [[Ultrahigh frequency|ultrahigh frequencies]] (UHF), the "lighthouse" tube, has a planar construction to reduce interelectrode [[capacitance]] and lead [[inductance]], which gives it the appearance of a "lighthouse".  The disk-shaped cathode, grid and plate form planes up the center of the tube - a little like a sandwich with spaces between the layers.  The cathode at the bottom is attached to the tube's pins, but the grid and plate are brought out to low inductance terminals on the upper level of the tube: the grid to a metal ring halfway up, and the plate to a metal button at the top. These are one example of "disk seal" design. Smaller examples dispense with the octal pin base shown in the illustration and rely on contact rings for all connections, including heater and D.C. cathode.

As well, high-frequency performance is limited by transit time: the time required for electrons to travel from cathode to anode. Transit time effects are complicated, but one simple effect is input conductance, also known as grid loading. At extreme high frequencies, electrons arriving at the grid may become out of phase with those departing towards the anode. This imbalance of charge causes the grid to exhibit a reactance that is much less than its low-frequency "open circuit" characteristic.

Transit time effects are reduced by reduced spacings in the tube. Tubes such as the 416B (a Lighthouse design) and the 7768 (an all-ceramic miniaturised design) are specified for operation to 4&amp;nbsp;GHz. They feature greatly reduced grid-cathode spacings in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm.

These greatly reduced grid spacings also give a much higher amplification factor than conventional axial designs. The 7768 has an amplification factor of 225, compared with 100 for the 6AV6 used in domestic radios and about the maximum possible for an axial design.

Anode-grid capacitance is not especially low in these designs. The 6AV6 anode-grid capacitance is 2 picofarads (pF), the 7768 has a value of 1.7 pF. The close electrode spacing used in microwave tubes ''increases'' capacitances, but this increase is offset by their overall reduced dimensions compared to lower-frequency tubes.

In the triode, [[electron]]s are released into the tube from the metal [[cathode]] by heating it, a process called [[thermionic emission]].  The cathode is heated red hot by a separate current flowing through a thin metal [[electrical filament|filament]].   In a few triodes, the filament itself is the cathode, while in most the filament heats a separate cathode electrode.  Virtually all the air is removed from the tube, so the electrons can move freely. The negative electrons are attracted to the positively charged [[anode]], and flow through the spaces between the grid wires to it, creating a current through the tube from cathode to anode.

The magnitude of this current can be controlled by a voltage applied between the cathode and the grid. The grid acts like a gate for the electrons.   A more negative voltage on the grid will repel some of the electrons, so fewer get through to the anode, reducing the anode current.  A positive voltage on the grid will attract more electrons from the cathode, so more reach the anode, increasing the anode current. Therefore, a low power varying (AC) signal applied to the grid can control a much more powerful anode current, resulting in [[amplifier|amplification]]. Variation in the grid voltage will cause identical proportional variations in the anode current.  By placing a suitable load resistance in the anode circuit, the varying current will cause a varying voltage across the resistance which can be much larger than the input voltage variations, resulting in [[voltage gain]].

The triode is a normally "on" device; and current flows to the anode with zero voltage on the grid.  The anode current is progressively reduced as the grid is made more negative with respect to the cathode.   Usually a constant DC voltage ("bias") is applied to the grid to set the DC current through the tube, and the varying signal voltage is superimposed on it.   A sufficiently negative voltage on the grid, usually around 3-5 volts in small tubes such as the 6AV6, but as much as –130 volts in early audio power devices such as the '45, will prevent any electrons from getting through to the anode, turning off the anode current.   This is called the "cutoff voltage". Since below cutoff the anode current ceases to respond to the grid voltage, the voltage on the grid must remain above the cutoff voltage for faithful (linear) amplification.

The triode is very similar in operation to the n-channel [[JFET]]; it is normally on, and progressively switched off as the grid/gate is pulled increasingly negative of the source/cathode. Cutoff voltage is equivalent to the JFET's pinch-off voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)or VGS(off); the point at which current stops flowing entirely.

== Applications ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
Although S.G. Brown's Type G Telephone Relay (using a magnetic "earphone" mechanism driving a carbon microphone element) was able to give power amplification and had been in use as early as 1914, it was a purely mechanical device with limited frequency range and fidelity. It was suited only to a limited range of audio frequencies - essentially voice frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Tyne, Gerald F.J., Saga of the Vacuum Tube, 1977, Howard W. Sams, pp 201~202&lt;/ref&gt;

The triode was the first non-mechanical device to provide power gain at audio and radio frequencies, and made [[radio]] practical. Triodes are used for amplifiers and oscillators. Many types are used only at low to moderate frequency and power levels. Large water-cooled triodes may be used as the final amplifier in radio transmitters, with ratings of thousands of watts. Specialized types of triode ("lighthouse" tubes, with low capacitance between elements) provide useful gain at microwave frequencies.

Vacuum tubes are obsolete in mass-marketed [[consumer electronics]], having been overtaken by less expensive transistor-based [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices. However, more recently, vacuum tubes have been making somewhat of a comeback. Triodes continue to be used in certain high-power [[Radio frequency|RF]] amplifiers and [[transmitter]]s. While proponents of vacuum tubes claim their superiority in areas such as [[high-end audio|high-end]] and [[professional audio]] applications, empirical evidence shows that the solid-state MOSFET is virtually identical in performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electronicdesign.com/analog/tubes-versus-solid-state-audio-amps-last-word-or-house-fire-part-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[Image:TriodeECC83Characteristic1.png|right|ECC83 triode operating characteristic.|thumb]]
In triode datasheets, characteristics linking the anode current (I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) to anode voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and grid voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) are usually given. From here, a circuit designer can choose the [[biasing|operating point]] of the particular triode.

In the example characteristic shown on the image, if an anode voltage V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 200{{nbsp}}V and a grid [[voltage bias]] of −1 volt are selected, a plate (anode) current of 2.25{{nbsp}}mA will be present (using the yellow curve on the graph). Changing the grid voltage will change the plate current; by suitable choice of a plate load resistor, amplification is obtained.

In the [[class-A amplifier|class-A]] triode amplifier, an anode resistor would be connected between the anode and the positive voltage source. For example, with R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000 ohms, the voltage drop on it would be

V&lt;sub&gt;Ra&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; × R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 22.5{{nbsp}}V if an anode current of I&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.25{{nbsp}}mA is chosen.

If the input voltage amplitude (at the grid) changes from −1.5{{nbsp}}V to −0.5{{nbsp}}V (difference of 1{{nbsp}}V), the anode current will change from 1.2 to 3.3{{nbsp}}mA (see image). This will change the resistor voltage drop from 12 to 33{{nbsp}}V (a difference of 21{{nbsp}}V).

Since the grid voltage changes from −1.5{{nbsp}}V to −0.5{{nbsp}}V, and the anode resistor voltage drops from 12 to 33 V, an amplification of the signal resulted. The amplification factor is 21: output voltage amplitude divided by input voltage amplitude.

'''USS ''Peacock''''' was a [[sloop-of-war]] in the [[United States Navy]] during the [[War of 1812]].

The ''Peacock'' was authorized by Act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] 3 March 1813, laid down 9 July 1813, by [[Adam and Noah Brown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[New York Navy Yard]], and launched 19 September 1813. She served in the War of 1812, capturing twenty ships.  Subsequently, she served in the Mediterranean Squadron, and in the "Mosquito Fleet" suppressing Caribbean piracy.  She patrolled the South American coast during the colonial wars of independence.  She was decommissioned in 1827 and broken up in 1828 to be rebuilt as the '''USS ''Peacock'' (1828)''', intended as an exploration ship.  She sailed as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1838. The ''Peacock'' ran aground and broke up on the [[Columbia Bar]] without loss of life in 1841.

==War of 1812==
During the [[War of 1812]], the ''Peacock'' made three cruises under the command of [[Master Commandant]] [[Lewis Warrington]]. Departing New York 12 March 1814, she sailed with supplies to the naval station at [[St. Mary's, Georgia]]. Off [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]] 29 April, she captured her an enemy warship, the British [[brig]] {{HMS|Epervier|1812|6}}, which the ''Peacock'' sent to Savannah, and which the United States Navy took into service as the USS ''Epervier''.

{{see also|Capture of HMS Epervier}}

The ''Peacock'' departed Savannah on 4 June on her second cruise; proceeding to the [[Grand Banks]] and along the coasts of Ireland and Spain, she returned via the [[West Indies]] to New York. She captured 14 enemy vessels of various sizes during this journey. On 14 August the ''Peacock'' captured the ''William'', Whiteway, master, of Bristol, and scuttled her.&lt;ref&gt;Farr (1950), p.255.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Peacock'' departed New York 23 January 1815 with the {{USS|Hornet|1805 brig|2}} and {{USS|Tom Bowline|1814|2}} and rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] into the Indian Ocean, where she captured three valuable prizes.

===Last action of the War of 1812===
{{main|Capture of East India Company ship Nautilus}}
On 30 June she captured the 16-gun brig ''Nautilus'', which was under the command of Lieutenant Charles Boyce of the [[Bombay Marine]] of the British [[East India Company]] in the [[Straits of Sunda]], in the final naval action of the war. Boyce informed Warrington that the war had ended.&lt;ref name=James/&gt; Warrington suspected a ruse and ordered Boyce to surrender. When Boyce refused, Warrington opened fire, killing one seaman, two European invalids, and three [[lascar]]s, wounding Boyce severely, as well as mortally wounding the first lieutenant, and also wounding five lascars. American casualties amounted to some four or five men wounded.&lt;ref name=James/&gt; When Boyce provided documents proving that the [[Treaty of Ghent]] ending the war had been ratified, Warrington released his victims,&lt;ref&gt;Malcomson (2006), p.363.&lt;/ref&gt; though at no point did he in any way inquire about the Boyce's condition or that of any of the injured on the ''Nautilus''.&lt;ref name=James/&gt; The ''Peacock'' returned to New York on 30 October. A court of inquiry in Boston a year later exonerated Warrington of all blame. In his report on the incident, Warrington reported that the British casualties had only been lascars.&lt;ref name=James&gt;James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.266-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
The ''Peacock'' left New York on 13 June 1816, bound for France, with the Honorable [[Albert Gallatin]] and party aboard. After pulling into [[Le Havre|Havre de Grâce]] 2 July, she proceeded to join the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]]. But for a year of Mediterranean–United States—and return transits, 15 November 1818 – 17 November 1819, the sloop remained with this squadron until 8 May 1821, when she departed for home; she then went into ordinary at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] 10 July.

==Fighting pirates==
Pirates were ravaging West Indian shipping in the 1820s and on 3 June 1822, the ''Peacock'' became flagship of Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]’s West India Squadron, that rooted out the pirates. The ''Peacock'' served in the expedition that included the [[U.S. Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue Marine]] schooner [[USRC Louisiana (1819)|''Louisiana'']] and the British schooner [[HMS Speedwell (1815)|HMS ''Speedwell'']]. The trio broke up a pirate establishment at [[Bahia Honda Key]] , 28–30 September capturing four vessels. They burnt two and [[prize crew]]s took the other two to New Orleans. Eighteen of the captured pirate crew members were sent to New Orleans for trial.&lt;ref name=King71&gt;King, P 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RoM77&gt;Record of Movements, p 77&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Peacock'' captured the schooner ''Pilot'' on 10 April 1823 and another sloop 16 April. In September, "malignant fever" necessitated a recess from activities, and the ''Peacock'' pulled into [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 28 November.

==South Pacific coast and Hawaiʻi==
In July 1823, the sloop was involved in the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] and Mr. Peter Storms decided to join the Independentist cause, who won their independence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheguaco.org/rastrojeo.pdf Rastrogeo Margariteño, (spanish) (pdf) (page 40-41)]&lt;/ref&gt; on 3 August. Later, in March 1824, the sloop proceeded to the Pacific and for some months cruised along the west coast of South America, where the colonies were struggling for independence. In September 1825, the ''Peacock'' under the command of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones#Between Wars|Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], sailed to the [[Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]], where a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation was negotiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Returning to South America from Hawaii, the ship was struck by a whale, suffering serious damage. Nevertheless, she reached [[Callao]], from which she departed 25 June for New York.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |author= Gene A.

==USS ''Peacock'' (1828)==
[[File:USS Peacock 1813.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''A sketch of the USS Peacock during the [[United States Exploring Expedition|Wilkes Expedition]] in 1838.'']]
the ''Peacock'' returned to  New York in October 1827 to be decommissioned, broken up and rebuilt in 1828  for a planned expedition of exploration. Her size and configuration stayed about the same, but her guns were reduced to ten: eight long 24-pounders and two long 9-pounders. When plans for the exploratory voyage stalled in Congress, she re-entered regular service in the West Indies from 1829–31. Following refit, both the ''Peacock'' and the newly commissioned ''[[USS Boxer (1832)|Boxer]]'', a 10-gun [[schooner]],  were ordered to assist the [[frigate]] [[USS Potomac (1822)|''Potomac'']], which had just sailed on the [[first Sumatran Expedition]]. The two ships were also charged with diplomatic missions.  ''Boxer'' left [[Boston Harbor]] about the middle of February 1832, with orders to proceed to [[History of Liberia|Liberia]] and from thence to join the ''Peacock'' off the coast of [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]]; The ''Peacock'' sailed on 8 March 1832 under [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[David Geisinger]].

===Diplomatic missions===
The ''Peacock'' conveyed Mr. [[Francis Baylies]] and family to the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] (Argentina) to assume the post of United States [[chargé d’affaires]] in the wake of the [[History of the Falkland Islands#USS Lexington raid|USS ''Lexington'' raid on the Falkland Islands]] in 1831. On arrival both the [[HMS Plantagenet (1801)|British line-of-battle ship ''Plantagenet'']] and  H. B. M. frigate ''Druid''&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pbtyc/18-1900/D/01478.html Druid, 1825]&lt;/ref&gt; complimented her flag by playing ''[[Hail, Columbia]]''.&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|pp.25,26}}  Also aboard was

25{{nbsp}}June 1832, having left orders for the ''Boxer'' to follow to [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]], the ''Peacock'' departed [[Montevideo#19th century|war-stricken Montevideo]] for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. After taking water at [[Tristan da Cunha]] and rounding the Cape, then trying to keep about latitude 38° or 39°, on 9 or 10 August a [[Rogue wave|sea of uncommon height and volume]] struck the ship, and threw her nearly on her beam ends, completely overwhelmed the gig in the starboard-quarter, crushed it into atoms in a moment, and buried the first three [[ratlines]] of the mizen-[[Shroud (sailing)|shroud]]s under water.&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p.31}}

Picking up the southeast [[trade wind]] around ({{coord|16|00|N|102|00|E}},) on 28 August 1832, the ''Peacock'' sailed to Bencoolen where the Dutch [[Resident (title)|Resident]] reported that the ''Potomac'' had completed her mission.&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p.32}} Under orders to gather information before going to [[Cochin-China]], The ''Peacock'' sailed for [[Manila]] by way of Long Island and 'Crokatoa' ([[Krakatoa]]), where [[hot spring]]s found on the eastern side of the islands one hundred and fifty feet from the shore boiled furiously up, through many fathoms of water. Her [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]s proving useless, the ''Peacock'' threaded the [[Sunda Strait]] by [[Dead reckoning#Marine navigation|dead reckoning]]. [[Diarrhea|Diarrhoea]] and [[dysentery]] prevailed among the crew from [[Anjer|Angier]] to Manila; after a fortnight there, [[Cholera#History|cholera]] struck despite the overall cleanliness of the ship. The ''Peacock'' lost seven crewmen, and many who did recover died later in the voyage of other diseases. No new case of cholera occurred after 2 November 1833 while the ''Peacock'' was under way for [[Macao]]. Within two [[league (unit)#English-speaking world|league]]s of the [[Lamma Island|Lemma]] or [[Wanshan Archipelago|Ladrone islands]], she took aboard a [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] after settling on a fee of thirteen dollars and a bottle of rum.&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p.65}}

After six weeks in the vicinity of [[Guangzhou#17th through 19th centuries|Canton City, China]], with the onset of the winter [[East Asian Monsoon|northeast monsoon]] and no sign of the ''Boxer'', the ''Peacock'' sailed from [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] estuary for the bay of Turan (modern [[Danang]]) as best for access to [[Hué]], capital of Cochin-China {{ndash}} her task was to explore the possibilities of expanding trade with the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=China|work=[[The Morning Post]]|date=12 April 1833 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18330412/015/0003| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary winds from the northwest rather than the expected northeast quarter, coupled with a strong southward current, caused her to lose ground on every tack until, on 6 January 1833, she entered what enquiries disclosed to be the Vung-lam harbour of [[Phu Yen province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnvietnamtours.com/2011/09/dossier-of-xuan-dai-bay-phu-yen-province-submitted-to-unesco.html|title=Dossier of Xuan Dai Bay (Phu Yen Province) submitted to UNESCO|author=|authorlink=|date=21 September 2011|work=|publisher=Vietnam Tours|accessdate=26 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025141731/http://www.vnvietnamtours.com/2011/09/dossier-of-xuan-dai-bay-phu-yen-province-submitted-to-unesco.html|archivedate=25 October 2011|quote=Vung Lam bay used to be the most bustling trading port of Phu Yen in the past, the door connecting Phu Yen to the outer trading worlds.|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February, Roberts having failed to gain permission to proceed to Hué due to miscommunication, the ''Peacock'' weighed anchor for the [[Gulf of Thailand|gulf of Siam]], where on the 18th she anchored about {{convert|15|mi}} from the [[Samut Prakan Province#Geography|mouth of the river Menam]] at {{coord|13|26|N|100|33|E}}, as was ascertained by frequent [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar observations]] and by four chronometers.&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p.229}}

On 20 March 1833 Roberts concluded the [[Siamese-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the minister representing [[Jessadabodindra|King Rama III]], and the ''Peacock'' departed on 5 April to call on Singapore, where she stayed between 1 and 11 May.

On 29 August in the [[Red Sea]], while bound to [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], the ''Peacock'' encountered the ''Nautilus'', the same brig the ''Peacock'' had attacked after the end of the War of 1812 with Great Britain. The ''Nautilus'' was sailing to [[Surat]] as escort to four brigs crowded with [[Moslem|mussulman]] pilgrims returning from [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p.341}} This time the ''Peacock'' did not attack the ''Nautilus''.

Arriving 13 September off [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], Roberts concluded a treaty with [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sultan Said bin Sultan]], and departed on 7 October 1833. On the voyage from Muscat to [[Mozambique]], Roberts omitted the particulars of each day, but stated that what he had written served "to show the absolute necessity of having first-rate chronometers, or the lunar observations carefully attended to; and never omitted to be taken when practicable."&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p.366}}

The ''Peacock'' returned Roberts to Rio de Janeiro on 17 January 1834, where on 1 March 1834 he boarded the ''Lexington'' to return to Boston.&lt;ref name = "Roberts" /&gt;{{rp|p. 400}}&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book |last= Roberts|first= Edmund |authorlink= Edmund Roberts (diplomat) |title= Embassy to the Eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat: in the U.S. sloop-of-war Peacock ... during the years 1832-3-4 |url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=aSgPAAAAYAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8 |date=12 October 2007 |origyear= First published in 1837 |publisher=   Harper &amp; brothers |accessdate=  25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return mission===
On 23 April 1835, the ''Peacock'', under the command of [[Cornelius Stribling|C. K. Stribling]], and accompanied by the [[USS Enterprise (1831)|U.S. Schooner ''Enterprise'']], [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commanding]] A. S. Campbell, departed [[New York Harbor]]. Roberts was once again aboard the ''Peacock'', and the two vessels were under the command of Commodore [[Edmund P. Kennedy]]. The mission first sailed to Brazil, then round the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Zanzibar, for Roberts to return ratifications of the two treaties.

==== Masirah incident ====
On 21 September 1835 at 2&amp;nbsp;am southeast of [[Masirah Island]] about four hundred miles from Muscat, ''Peacock'' grounded on a coral reef in about 2 1/4 [[fathom]]s. Mr. Roberts, and six men under the command of Passed Midshipman William Rogers, left in a small boat to effect a rescue. The crew hove overboard 11 of 22 guns, re-floated the ship on the 23rd, and repelled Arab marauders before making sail the next day. On the 28th the ''Peacock'' was off Muscat when she encountered the sloop-of-war ''Sultan'' under the Muscat flag, and under the command of Mr. Taylor.&lt;ref name = "Rusch"/&gt;{{rp|p.58}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=|last=Richardson|first=Alan|date=December 1979|title=Richardson|journal=Our Illustrious Ancestors|volume=|issue=|pages=|at=Voyage via the Orient: Letters to Home by Charles Richardson|publisher=Katharine's Web|format=|id=|doi=|url=http://katharinesweb.net/Ancestors/Richardson/Richrdson.htm#Anchor-Voyag-4337|accessdate=8 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328041922/http://katharinesweb.net/Ancestors/Richardson/Richrdson.htm#Anchor-Voyag-4337|archivedate=28 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For a full account of the Masirah incident, see Coupland (1938; pp.370–2).&lt;/ref&gt; Said bin Sultan later recovered the guns that had been thrown overboard and shipped them to Roberts free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gilbert| first= Wesley John |title= Our Man in Zanzibar: Richard Waters, American Consul (1837–1845) | url= http://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1674&amp;context=etd_hon_theses | format= free |accessdate= 3 May 2012 |type= B.A. Thesis |series= Departmental Honors in History |date= April 2011 |publisher= [[Wesleyan University]] |location= Middletown, Connecticut | page= | pages= | nopp = | at= | quote= }})&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Peacock'' later obtained this letter:&lt;ref name = "Rusch"/&gt;{{rp|pp.61–62}}&lt;blockquote&gt;I certify that during the period I have navigated the Arabian coast, and been employed in the trigonometrical survey of the same, now executing by order of the Bombay government, that I have ever found it necessary to be careful to take nocturnal as well as diurnal observations, as frequent as possible, owing to the rapidity and fickleness of the currents, which, in some parts, I have found running at the rate of three and four knots an hour, and I have known the ''Palinurus'' set between forty and fifty miles dead in shore, in a dead calm, during the night. 
It is owing to such currents, that I conceive the United States ship of war ''Peacock'' run aground, as have many British ships in previous years, on and near the same spot; when at the changes of the monsoons, and sometimes at the full and change, you have such thick weather, as to prevent the necessary observations being taken with accuracy and the navigator standing on with confidence as to his position, and with no land in sight, finds himself to his sorrow, often wrong, owing to a deceitful and imperceptible current, which has set him with rapidity upon it. The position of Mazeira Island, is laid down by Owen many miles too much to the westward.

Given under my hand this 10th day of November, 1835.

S. B. Haines. 
Commander of the 
Honourable East India Company's 
surveying brig ''Palinurus.''

A second attempt at negotiation with Cochin-China failed as Roberts fell desperately ill of dysentery; he withdrew to Macao where he died 12 June 1836.

==Exploration expedition and fate==
[[Image:Wreck of the Peacock.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Peacock'' after hitting the bar of the Columbia River.]]
The ''Peacock'' joined the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1838, where she did good service before getting stuck on a bar of the [[Columbia River]] in Oregon. She broke up on 17–19 July 1841 after all the crew and much of the scientific data had been taken off, though [[Titian Peale]] lost most of his notes.&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Lundeberg, "Characteristics of Selected Exploring Vessels," appendix 1 of ''Magnificent Voyagers: The U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838–1842'', edited by Herman J. Viola and Carolyn Margolis (Smithsonian Institution: 1985), p255.&lt;/ref&gt;
