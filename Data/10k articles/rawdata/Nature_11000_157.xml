'''2013 PDC-E''' is a fictitious [[Near-Earth object|near earth object]] developed by [[Don Yeomans]] and others as the target of a table top emergency response drill at the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] [http://www.iaaconferences.org/pdc2013/ 2013 Planetary Defense Conference]. The drill was intended to give astronomers and other experts in asteroid and comet impact studies practice in responding to a hypothetical immanent impact with global consequences.

The name 2013 PDC-E is a parody on [[Astronomical naming conventions#Minor planets|minor planet naming conventions]], ''PDC'' for Planetary Defense Conference, ''-E'' for exercise.

The object is modeled after [[2012 DA14]].&lt;ref&gt;"Asteroid 2012 DA14 - Flyby Reality Check" jpl.nasa.gov accessed 4-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is notionally a 300-meter-diameter stony asteroid that is part of the Aten dynamical family in 2013, when it is hypothetically observed by the Pan-STARRS telescope at a magnitude of 22.5. It migrates to the Apollo dynamical family over time. 2013 PDC-E is predicted in the exercise to pass through a dynamical keyhole of 1.2&amp;nbsp;km diameter in 2023 with a probability of 8%. If it did, it would strike Earth in 2028 with an impact velocity of 12.4&amp;nbsp;km/s, and an impact energy of approximately 700 megatons.

'''Adam's Peak''' is a {{convert|2243|abbr=on|m|ft|0}} tall conical [[mountain]] located in central [[Sri Lanka]]. It is well known for the '''Sri Pada''', i.e.,  "sacred footprint", a  {{Convert|1.8|abbr=on|m}} rock formation near the summit, which in [[Buddhist]] tradition is held to be the [[footprint of the Buddha]], in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition that of [[Shiva]] and in [[Islamic]] and [[Christian]] tradition that of [[Adam]], or that of St. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5531/|title=Seruwila to Sri Pada (Sacred Foot Print Shrine)|publisher = UNESCO.org|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ricci&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ricci|first1=Ronit|title=LITERATURE, CONVERSION, AND THE ARABIC COSMOPOLIS OF SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71088-4|page=136|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3OsbFW2KWtEC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=Arab+%22Adam%27s+bridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2syBVNHXHIrC7Aa25oHgCQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%22Adam's%20bridge%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:UG-LK Photowalk - 2018-03-24 - Maskeliya Reservoir (3).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Adam's Peak from Maskeliya, in March 2018.]]

The mountain is located in the southern reaches of the Central Highlands in the [[Ratnapura District]] and [[Nuwara Eliya district]] of the [[Sabaragamuwa Province]] and [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|Central Province]] —lying about 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the city of [[Ratnapura]] and 32&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the city of Hatton. The surrounding region is largely forested hills, with no mountain of comparable size nearby. The region along the mountain is a wildlife reserve, housing many species varying from elephants to leopards, and including many endemic species.

Adam's Peak is important as a watershed.  The districts to the south and the east of Adam's Peak yield precious stones—emeralds, rubies and sapphires, for which the island has been famous, and which earned for its ancient name of Ratnadvipa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palihapitiya|title=P.G.G.|url=http://sripada.org/palihapitiya.htm|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trails ==
[[File:Sri Pada - The Holy Mountain.jpg|thumb|The Holy peak viewed at Adiyamalatenna Ambalama – Kuruwita-Erathna trail]]
[[File:Sri pada road.jpg|thumb]]

Access to the mountain is possible by 6 trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte and Malimboda. The Nallathanni &amp; Palabaddala routes are most favored by those undertaking the climb, while the Kuruwita-Erathna trail is used less often; these trails are linked to major cities or town by bus, accounting for their popular use. The Murraywatte, Mookuwatte and Malimboda routes are hardly used, but do intersect with the Palabaddala road midway through the ascent. The usual route taken by most pilgrims is ascent via Hatton and descent via Ratnapura; although the Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also shorter than any of the other trails by approximately five kilometers.

Once one of the starting 'nodes' of Palabadalla, Nallathanni or Erathna are reached, the rest of the ascent is done on foot through the forested mountainside on the steps built into it. The greater part of the track leading from the base to the summit consists of thousands of steps built in cement or rough stones. The trails are illuminated with electric light, making night-time ascent possible and safe to do even when accompanied by children. Rest stops and wayside shops along the trails serve refreshments and supplies.

Whilst there are many ancient monuments on the mountain, there is an important [[Peace Pagoda]] located halfway up, built by [[Nipponzan Myohoji]] in 1978.

== Nomenclature ==
[[File:Mahagiri Dambaya.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Mahagiri Dambaya]]
Due to its significance to the various people that inhabit the country, the mountain is referred to by a variety of names.

The often used ''Sri Pada'' is derived from [[Sanskrit]], used by the [[Sinhalese people]] in a religious context; this name also has meaning in [[Pali|Pāli]], and may be translated roughly as "the sacred foot". It refers to the footprint-shaped mark at the summit, which is believed by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] to be that of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Christian and Islamic traditions assert that it is the footprint of [[Adam]], left when first setting foot on Earth after having been cast out of paradise, giving it the name "Adam's Peak".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Hindu tradition refers to the footprint as that of the [[Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]], and thus names the mountain ''Shiva padam'' (Shiva's foot) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Tamils may also use the name ''Shivanolipatha Malai'' to refer to the mountain.

Another [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] name for the mountain is ''Samanalakanda'', which refers either to the deity [[Saman (deity)|Saman]], who is said to live upon the mountain, or to the butterflies (''samanalayā'') that frequent the mountain during their annual migrations to the region. The name Sri Paada, however, is the more commonly used.

Other local and historic names include ''Ratnagiri'' ("jewelled hill"), ''Samantakuta'' ("Peak of Saman"), ''Svargarohanam'' ("the climb to heaven"), ''Mount Rohana'' and other variations on the root ''Rohana''.

== History ==
Sri Pada is first mentioned (as `Samanthakuta') in the Deepawamsa,{{cn|date=February 2018}} the earliest Pali chronicle, (4th century), and also in the 5th century chronicle [[Mahawamsa]], where it is stated that the Buddha visited the mountain peak. The chronicle ''Rajavaliya'' states that the  King Valagamba (1st century BCE) had taken refuge in the forests of Adam's Peak against invaders from India, and later returned to Anuradhapura. The Mahawamsa again mentions the visit of [[King Vijayabahu I]] (1058–1114) to the mountain. The famous Chinese pilgrim and Buddhist traveler [[Fa Hien]] stayed in Sri Lanka in 411–12 CE and mentions Sri Pada  although it is not made clear whether he actually visited it.

The Italian merchant [[Marco Polo]] in his ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'' of 1298&amp;nbsp;CE noted that Adam's Peak was an important place of pilgrimage but did not mention a footprint in the rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Yule | first1=Henry | author1-link=Henry Yule | last2=Cordier | first2=Henri | author2-link=Henri Cordier | year=1903 | title=The Book of Ser Marco Polo (Volume 2) | edition=3rd | publisher=John Murray | place=London | pages=316–330 | url=https://archive.org/stream/bookofsermarcopo02polouoft#page/316/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] climbed to the summit of the mountain which he called ''Sarandīb'' in 1344&amp;nbsp;CE. In his description he mentions a stairway and iron stanchions with chains to help the pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Defrémery | first1=C. | last2=Sanguinetti | first2=B.R. trans. and eds. | year=1858 | title=Voyages d'Ibn Batoutah (Volume 4) | publisher=Société Asiatic | place=Paris | language=French, Arabic | pages=179–182 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AdUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gibb | first = H.A.R. | author1-link=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb | last2 = Beckingham | first2 = C.F. trans. and eds. | year = 1994 | title = The Travels of Ibn Baṭṭūṭa, A.D. 1325–1354  (Volume 4) | place = London| publisher = Hakluyt Society | isbn = 978-0-904180-37-4 | pages=853–854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunn | first = Ross E. | authorlink=Ross E.

He recorded observing an oversized foot print carved in stone and ornamented with a single margin of brass and studded with gems.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Davy | first=John | author-link=John Davy (chemist) | year=1818 | title=A description of Adam's Peak.

== The Sacred Mountain ==
[[File:Maskeliya 01.jpg|thumb|200px|The village of Nallathanniya at the feet of the mountain, where the stairs begin]]
It is revered as a holy site by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], some [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christians]]. It has specific qualities that cause it to stand out and be noticed; including its dominant and outstanding profile,  and the boulder at the peak that contains an indentation resembling a footprint. As the 1910, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] notes&lt;ref name ="EB1911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chisolm|first=Hugh|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica (Vol. 5)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KjUEAAAAYAAJ| publisher=University press|year=1910|page=778}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For a long period Sri Pada was supposed to be the highest mountain in Ceylon, but actual survey makes it only 7353 ft. above sea-level. This elevation is chiefly remarkable as the resort of pilgrims from all parts of the East. The hollow in the lofty rock that crowns the summit is said by the [[Buddhist]]s of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], by the [[Hinduism|Hindus]] to be the footstep of [[Shiva|Siva]], by some [[Islam|Muslims]] of [[Adam]], whilst the Portuguese Christians were divided between the conflicting claims of [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]] and the [[eunuch]] of [[Candace]], queen of [[Ethiopia]]. The footstep is covered by a handsome roof, and is guarded by the priests of a rich monastery half-way up the mountain, who maintain a shrine on the summit of the peak."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is an important pilgrimage site, especially for Buddhists. Pilgrims walk up the mountain, following a variety of difficult routes up thousands of steps. The journey takes several hours at least.

The mountain is most often scaled from December to May. During other months it is hard to climb the mountain due to very heavy rain, extreme wind, and thick mist.The peak [[pilgrimage]] season is in April, and the goal is to be on top of the mountain at sunrise, when the distinctive shape of the mountain casts a triangular shadow on the surrounding plain and can be seen to move quickly downward as the sun rises.

=== Legends ===
[[File:Sri Paada1.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A view of Adam's peak from [[Maskeliya]] town]]
For Buddhists, the footprint mark is the left foot of the Buddha, left behind when Buddha visited Sri Lanka, as a symbol for worship at the invitation of Buddhist God Saman.

Tamil Hindus consider it as the footprint of Lord [[Shiva]]. It is also fabled that the mountain is the legendary mount [[Trikuta]] the capital of [[Ravana]] during the [[Ramayana]] times from where he ruled Lanka.

Some Muslims and Christians in Sri Lanka ascribe it to where [[Adam]], the first Ancestor, set foot as he was exiled from the Garden of Eden {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The legends of Adam are connected to the idea that Sri Lanka was the original [[Garden of Eden|Eden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam's Peak|url=https://sacredsites.com/asia/sri_lanka/adams_peak.html|website=Places of Peace and Power|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam's Peak: Myth, Legend and Geography|url=http://www.hiddenmysteries.org/mysteries/terra/adampeak.html|website=hiddenmysteries.org|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Muslim tradition that Adam was 30&amp;nbsp;ft tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam’s Peak, Sri Lanka|url=http://www.islamiclandmarks.com/various/adams-peak|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A shrine to Saman, a Buddhist "deity" (People who have spent spiritual life during their life on earth and done pacificism service to regions are deified by Sri Lankan Buddhists) charged with protecting the mountain top, can be found near the footprint.

'''''Birds of the World: Recommended English Names''''' is a [[paperback]] book, written by [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]] and [[Minturn Wright]] on behalf of the [[International Ornithologists' Union]]. The book is an attempt to produce a standardized set of [[Common name|English names]] for all bird species, and it is the product of a project set in motion at the 1990 International Ornithological Congress. It is supplemented by a website, the '''IOC World Bird List''', giving updates to the published material.

An 11-page introduction deals with a number of issues which relate to the naming of birds. This is followed by a systematic list, from pages 12 to 211, and a 46-page index. The [[Family (biology)|family]] sequence is that of the third edition of the ''[[Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World]]''.  The book's cover is illustrated with a photo of a [[helmet vanga]], a bird [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name = "BotW"&gt;Gill, Frank, and Minturn Wright, ''Birds of the World: Recommended English Names''; Princeton University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|back cover}}

==Background==
Since the pioneering work of [[Linnaeus]], species of organisms have had recognized [[scientific names]] in Latin, Greek, or a modernized derivative of one or both of those languages.  In most groups of organisms, the scientific names are sufficient, enjoying widespread use among academics and amateurs alike.  By contrast, non-scientific (vernacular) names for birds are extensively used in scientific communication as well as in the large community of amateur enthusiasts.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni"&gt;Burger, Alan E., "Birds of the World: Recommended English Names", ''Marine Ornithology'' 35:86 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, vernacular names change frequently and often vary from place to place.&lt;ref name = "BotW"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Consequently, there is a need to have a degree of consistency in the vernacular names used around the world.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni" /&gt;

In the late 19th century, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] (AOU) made an attempt to standardize the English names of birds; its effort covered the United States and Canada.  This work's most recent edition, the seventh, covers North America as far south as Panama, but this omits some 80% of the world's species and is still sometimes controversial.  A number of authors have come up with lists of birds of the world, but none had as its primary goal the standardization of names.  As a result, the field of English names of birds was left "a swirling sea of polylexy and polysemy, where one bird may have many names and one name may apply to many birds."&lt;ref name="BNJ"&gt;Wright, Rick, [http://birdaz.com/blog/2006/08/28/gill-and-wright-birds-of-the-world-recommended-english-names/ Gill and Wright, Birds of the World: Recommended English Names] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614045954/http://birdaz.com/blog/2006/08/28/gill-and-wright-birds-of-the-world-recommended-english-names/ |date=June 14, 2010 }}, Birding New Jersey, Aug. 28, 2006; accessed 2012.03.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the [[International Ornithological Congress]] (IOC) sought to reach consensus in standardized vernacular names for commonly used languages.  Standardized names were published for French&lt;ref&gt;Devillers, P. &amp; Ouellet, H. 1993. ''Noms français des oiseaux du monde avec les équivalents latins et anglais''. Sainte-Foy, Quebec, and Chabaud, Bayonne, France: Éditions MultiMondes. 452 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 and Spanish&lt;ref&gt;Bernis, F. 1995. ''Diccionario de nombres vernaculos de aves''. Madrid: Editorial Gredos. 232 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995.&lt;!--Swedish: 2015: see https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/02/24/out-of-fear-of-racism-sweden-changes-the-names-of-bird-species/ --&gt;  English names proved particularly challenging: the task took more than fifteen years.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  Even so, the authors acknowledged that reaching complete global consensus on names and spelling is unlikely, and they presented this work as a first phase of an ongoing process.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni" /&gt;

The English names project began in 1990, when the IOC appointed a committee of prominent ornithologists, chaired by [[Burt Monroe|Burt L. Monroe, Jr.]], to consider the issue.  The work "proved to be more difficult and time-consuming" than expected.  Monroe's death brought the project to a halt.  Not until 1994 was the project revived, by Gill and Walter Bock.  Gill invited Wright to become recording secretary and organizer of the process; the two were named co-chairs of the revitalized committee.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Authors and committee==

The standardization effort was undertaken by a committee of the IOC (the Standing Committee on English Names&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|11}}), with regional subcommittees.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni"/&gt;  The Standing Committee was co-chaired by [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]], a professional ornithologist with worldwide research interests and experience, and Minturn Wright, a lawyer and international birder with an interest in nomenclature; these two were the authors of the book and supervised the overall task.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|back cover}}  G. Stuart Keith, [[Christopher Perrins]], Nigel Redman, [[Robert S. Ridgely]], Stephen M. Russell, Peter G. Ryan, and [[Richard Schodde]] served as regional chairs.  David B. Donsker was taxonomic editor.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Twenty-eight committee members worked to formulate the rules and apply them to the task: Per Alström, Mark Beaman, Aldo Berutti, Clive Barlow, David Bishop, Murray Bruce, Paul Coopmans, W. Richard J. Dean, Brian Gill, Simon Harrap, Steven Hilty, Steve N. G. Howell, Tim Inskipp, Michael Irwin, [[Kenn Kaufman]], G. Stuart Keith, Ben King, David Parkin, [[Christopher Perrins]], [[H. Douglas Pratt]], Nigel Redman, Peter G. Ryan, [[Robert Ridgely (ornithologist)|Robert S. Ridgley]], Phillip Round, Stephen M. Russell, [[Richard Schodde]], Donald Turner, and [[Harrison B. Tordoff]].  The committee members received abundant assistance from others as well.  As the authors noted, the compilation of the list was an all-volunteer effort.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Criteria==

As part of the name standardization, it was also necessary to develop a set of rules for spelling, capitalization, the use of derivative names, and the like.  While the rules occupy several pages of the book, they may be briefly summarized:&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|5–9}}

*Official English names of species are capitalized (as was already the practice among ornithologists)
*Patronyms (names of people) are used in the possessive form, e.g., "[[Ross's gull|Ross's Gull]]"
*Names used do not include diacriticals or inflection marks &lt;!--(Ñöńè ǒf ťħîş șţüff)--&gt;
*Compromises are made between British and American spellings
*Users are encouraged to spell and use pronunciation marks according to their preference
*Geographical names may be the noun or adjective form, but must be consistent for the location, e.g., ''Canada'' (as in "[[Canada goose|Canada Goose]]" and "[[Canada warbler|Canada Warbler]]"), not ''Canadian'', but ''African'' (as in "[[African piculet|African Piculet]]" or "[[African wood owl|African Wood Owl]]"), not ''Africa''
*Compound words adhere to a set of rules designed to be consistent in their balancing of readability and the relationships of the words
*Hyphens are minimized, but for compound group names, hyphens are used only to connect two names that are themselves bird species or families, e.g., "[[Horned owl|Eagle-Owl]]", "[[Old World babbler|Wren-Babbler]]", or when the combined name would be difficult to read, e.g., "[[Silky-flycatcher]]"

The committee began consideration of each species's name with reference to existing usage: if a name was in long-standing or widespread usage, it was not changed simply to correct a perceived inaccuracy.  Names using such widespread words as "warbler" for multiple groups of unrelated species were let stand.  Local names, however, were dropped in favor of already-established formal names.  Names that were seen as offensive to a "substantial" group of people were changed.  Many old geographical names were also updated.  A strong preference for English words in names was expressed, although long-standing terms from other languages were generally left standing.  The most important criterion was that each species was to have only one English name throughout the world, which was to be different from all other names.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The result, published in 2006, was a 199-page list of species,&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|12–211}} arranged taxonomically,&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2}} and a 46-page index,&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|213–259}} giving both English and scientific names, primarily of genera and families.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|10}}  The taxonomy generally follows the lines set out in the third edition of Howard and Moore's ''Checklist of Birds of the World''.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2}}   A compact disk bundled with the book contains spreadsheet files that list all 10,068 species and provide additional information on their ranges.&lt;ref name = "BNJ" /&gt;

==Reception==

As the authors acknowledged, "Passions about bird names run high."&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  Reviews of the book were generally favorable.&lt;ref name = "BNJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauers, Sandy, "To decide bird names, authors had to wrestle with loons", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', September 10, 2006: "a Solomonlike endeavor".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audubon.org/bird/pdf/ScienceNewsletterFall2006.pdf Speaking Out], ''Audubon Science News'', Fall 2006, p.5: “developed by leading ornithologists worldwide and endorsed by members of the preeminent International Ornithological Congress”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheke, A., Birds of the World: Recommended English Names. ''Ibis'' 149(2):429-431 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustafson, M., Birds of the World: Recommended English Names. ''Wilson Journal of Ornithology'' 119:322-323 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaestner, P., Birds of the World: Recommended English Names. ''Birding'' 39(3):84-88 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson. D., Birds of the World: Recommended English Names. ''Bull. African Bird Club'' 14(2):232-233 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M., Birds of the World: Recommended English Names.

''British Birds'' 101:264-268 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ted Floyd, editor of ''Birding'' magazine, called the book "[a] very valuable resource."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Ted, [https://www.amazon.com/Birds-World-Recommended-English-Names/dp/0691128278 Book Description: Birds of the World: Recommended English Names], on Amazon.com, July 31, 2006; accessed 2013.01.31.&lt;/ref&gt;
S.N.G. Howell called the work a "handy little book" and "a good starting point [which] deserves serious consideration by persons interested in communicating" about birds, although the review mentions the inconsistency between this list and the AOU's names.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, S.N.G., [http://www.worldbirdnames.org/history/reviews/a-review-by-steve-howell/  Birds of the World: Recommended English Names] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413105313/http://www.worldbirdnames.org/history/reviews/a-review-by-steve-howell/ |date=April 13, 2013 }}; ''Western Birds'' 37:239-240 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
Rick Wright, while acknowledging that "[c]onsistency is a slippery goal," called the list "a spectacularly useful resource for anyone who writes, reads, or thinks about birds outside of his or her own region" and concluded that "the committee and the editors are to be congratulated for producing a useful and useable (sic) work."&lt;ref name = "BNJ" /&gt;

However, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] (AOU) castigated the authors for not using the AOU's guidelines and policies, particularly in the treatment of hyphens. The AOU argued that "hyphens in compound group names indicate relationships and separate the members of the groups from less closely related forms," stating as examples that the hyphen in "[[Whistling duck|Whistling-Duck]]s" distinguishes this bird from other ducks and the hyphen in "[[Storm petrel|Storm-Petrel]]s" separates it from other petrels in the family [[Procellariidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Classification and Nomenclature of Birds (North and Middle America) policy on English names of birds, [http://www.aou.org/auk/content/124/1472.pdf], ''The Auk'' 124(4):1472 (2007): "The AOU Committee has unanimously rejected the proposal to adopt the IOC guidelines and spelling rules for English names of North American birds. We will continue to follow the guidelines and policies outlined in the 6th and 7th editions of the Check-list of North American Birds."&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors felt the need to respond.&lt;ref&gt;Frank B. Gill, Stephen M. Russell, and Minturn T. Wright III, "[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/auk.2008.21008.3 Hyphenated Bird Names: A Response To The American Ornithologists' Union's Rejection Of International Ornithological Congress Guidelines]" ''The Auk'', 125(4):986–986, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  They pointed out that hyphens are not used in this fashion in fields such as [[herpetology]] and suggested that "well-intentioned hyphenation practices misrepresent [[phylogenetic]] relationships too often to be helpful." They repeated their recommendation that hyphens should be used "sparingly," and urged their fellow ornithologists to "work together to simplify the use of hyphens as one small step towards improved standardization of English bird names."&lt;ref&gt;Frank B. Gill, Minturn T. Wright, III, Sally B. Conyne, Robert Kirk, "[http://www.worldbirdnames.org/On%20hyphens%20and%20phylogeny%20WJO%202009.pdf On hyphens and phylogeny] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025091500/http://www.worldbirdnames.org/On%20hyphens%20and%20phylogeny%20WJO%202009.pdf |date=October 25, 2012 }}"; ''The Wilson Journal of Ornithology'' 121(3):652(4), September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Capitalization presented another dispute, and still has not reached a uniform resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Harbison, [http://www.audubon.org/news/case-history Case History: The long and torturous tale of how a style guide came to be.] ''Audubon'', June 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and legacy==
The book sold well, but it quickly became apparent that revisions would be needed, particularly as new species were described.  Although the authors stressed that their work was "a first edition",&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|11}} in 2009&lt;!--still working on this date--&gt;, the IOC decided not to supplement the book with a revised print edition.  Instead, the list of English names is now published electronically on the ''IOC World Bird List'' website.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, F., &amp; D. Donsker (Eds.), ''IOC World Bird Names'' (v. 3.3). Available at http://www.worldbirdnames.org; accessed 2013.01.31.&lt;/ref&gt;  A page on the website tabulates the spread of the list.&lt;ref&gt;IOC World Bird List, [http://www.worldbirdnames.org/the-project/reactions/ Adoptions &amp; Applications]; accessed 2013.01.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Castalia''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|l|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Κασταλία), in [[Greek mythology]], was a [[nymph]] whom [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] transformed into a fountain at [[Delphi]], at the base of Mount [[Parnassos]], or at [[Mount Helicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=Castalia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98355/Castalia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castalia could inspire the genius of [[poetry]] to those who drank her waters or listened to their quiet sound; the sacred water was also used to clean the Delphian temples. Apollo consecrated Castalia to the [[Muses]] (''Castaliae Musae'').

The 20th century [[Germany|German]] writer [[Hermann Hesse]] used Castalia as inspiration for the name of the futuristic fictional utopia in his 1943 [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]''. Castalia is home to an austere order of [[intellectual]]s with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools for boys, and to nurture and play the Glass Bead Game.

'''Saint George of Samatya''' or '''Surp Kevork''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: ''Սամաթիոյ Սուրբ Գէորգ Եկեղեցի''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name: ''Sulu Manastır'', meaning: "Water Monastery") is an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] church in [[Istanbul]].

The edifice, built between 1866 and 1887, has been erected above the substructure of a Byzantine church and monastery built in the eleventh century. The complex, dedicated to '''St. Mary Peribleptos''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Μονὴ τῆς Θεοτòκου τῆς Περιβλὲπτου}}}}, ''Monì tis Theotókou tis Perivléptou'') was one of the most important [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monasteries in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=ja227&gt;Janin (1953), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Conquest of Constantinople|conquest of the city]] in 1453 it was ceded to the [[Armenian People|Armenian]] community in Istanbul, and became for a period the seat of the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=mw200&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977) pg. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The church is located in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighbourhood of Kocamustafapaşa (historically [[Samatya]]), at ''Marmara Caddesi 79''.&lt;ref name=ro443&gt;Ronchey (2010), p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; It lies inside the [[walls of Constantinople|walled]] city, at a short distance from the shore of the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The building is protected by a high wall, and surrounded by other edifices.

[[File:Constantinople mediaeval map.jpg|200px|thumb|Map of Constantinople around 1420, after [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]]. The Church of Peribleptos is the domed building on the lower left part of the map. The creek shown in the picture originates from the holy source.]]
In the fifth century on this place stood the church of ''Hagios Stephanos en tais Aurelianai''. This church was located near the ''Helenianai Palace'' and the monastery of [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|St. Dalmatios]],&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; close to an abundant [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water source]] ({{lang-el|Hagiasma|script=Latn}}). From this source, still existing, originates the Turkish name of the complex ("Water Monastery").&lt;ref name=ro443/&gt;

Not far from these buildings and from the [[Walls of Constantinople#Sea Walls|sea walls]], on a small plateau on the southern slope of the seventh hill of [[Constantinople]], in the ''Xerolophos'' quartier,&lt;ref name=mw187&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977) pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Romanos III Argyros]] (r. 1028–1034) founded a large monastery dedicated to the ''Theotokos Peribleptos'' after his unlucky expedition to Syria.&lt;ref name=ja227/&gt; The appellation, meaning "conspicuous", "easy to see", originates from its dominating and isolated position.&lt;ref name=ro443/&gt; The Emperor spent a great deal of money to erect the building, and was harshly criticized for that.&lt;ref name=ja227/&gt; Romanos was buried here in 1034. Emperor [[Nikephoros III Botaneiates]] (r. 1078–1081) repaired the complex in 1080.&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; After his deposition, Nikephoros was obliged by his successor, [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081–1118) to become a monk here, and was buried in the church as well.&lt;ref name=ja227/&gt;

In the 11th-12th centuries, it was usual for the court to come to the Peribleptos each year to celebrate the [[candlemas]].&lt;ref name=ma306&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin sack of 1204]], the church remained for a short time under Greek control, but was later given to [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Benedictine]] monks.&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; After the end of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1261–1282) restored the church and added in the refectory a [[mosaic]] representing himself with his wife [[Theodora Doukaina Vatatzina|Theodora]] and their son Constantine.&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; This mosaic was destroyed in the great fire of Samatya in 1782.&lt;ref name=ja227/&gt;

At the end of the thirteenth century a young monk of the monastery, Hylarion, sent to [[Elegmoi]] in [[Bythinia]] to look after the possessions of the monastery, found the region ravaged by the [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]]. He successfully organised the population against the raiders and after confronting them made the area safe again, but that caused a great scandal in Constantinople, since monks were not allowed to fight. After he was forced to go back to the capital, the Turkish pillaging started again, until the inhabitants of Elegmoi sent a petition to Constantinople asking for his return. At the end the [[Hegumen]] of the monastery was forced to give his consent.&lt;ref name=ja227/&gt;

The building was damaged in 1402 by fire and lighting. In 1422, Emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] (r. 1391–1425) lived in this monastery during an epidemic and the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|siege]] of the city by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Murad II]].&lt;ref name=ja228&gt;Janin (1953), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman period ===
Immediately after the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the church continued to belong to the Greek Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name=ja228/&gt; According to [[Wolfgang Müller-Wiener|Müller-Wiener]], between 1461 and 1480 (the resettling of Armenians in Samatya occurred in 1458/862 [[Hijri year|AH]]), Sultan [[Mehmed II]] (r. 1444–46, 1451–81) ceded the church to the Armenian community,&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; and until 1643/44 the complex was the seat of the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; Other sources report that the building was given to the Armenians in 1643 because of the intercession of an Armenian woman, named Şivekâr, who was a favourite of Sultan [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim I]] (r. 1640–1648).&lt;ref name=ja228/&gt;&lt;ref name=ey93&gt;Eyice (1955), p.93.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period several churches were built here.&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt; By the middle of the seventeenth century the only [[Byzantine]] building still visible was the refectory.&lt;ref name=ro443/&gt;

In 1722 the complex was renovated by the Armenian architect [[Meldon (Architect)|Meldon]], but in 1782 everything was destroyed by the great fire of Samatya. The reconstruction took place in 1804.&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt;

Between 1866 and 1887 (after another fire in 1877&lt;ref name=ey93/&gt;), the church was rebuilt as endowment of [[Michael Hagopian (19th Century)|Michael Hagopian]], and only the foundations of the Byzantine church and remains of the source building were kept in place. Moreover, two large schools were built near the church.&lt;ref name=mw200/&gt;

== Description ==

Spanish ambassador [[Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo]] (practically the only extant source about the complex in the Byzantine period&lt;ref name=ja229&gt;Janin (1953), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;), who visited Constantinople in 1402, writes that the plan of St. Mary was a central one, with a square nave surmounted by a dome with an [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] and side rooms, similar to the contemporary churches of [[Hosios Loukas]] and [[Daphni Monastery]] in Greece.&lt;ref name=ey93/&gt; The hemispherical dome – decorated with a mosaic – rested upon eight columns of [[Jasper|polychrome Jasper]]&lt;ref name=ja229/&gt; which sustained four [[squinch]]es.&lt;ref name=ro444&gt;Ronchey (2010), p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; These made a transition from the octagonal base to the square defined by the walls.&lt;ref name=ro444/&gt;  Recent excavations confirmed the description of Clavijo.&lt;ref name=ro444/&gt; The church, whose walls and floor were also covered with jasper slabs, contained several imperial tombs, placed in two side rooms. Its outer walls were richly decorated with paintings representing towns and castles which were endowed to the monastery.&lt;ref name=ja229/&gt; A large refectory adorned with a [[fresco]] depicting the [[Last Supper]], rooms for the monks, gardens and vineyards were part of the complex.&lt;ref name=ja230&gt;Janin (1953), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; In the church were also exhibited several [[relic]]s, among them the body of [[Saint Gregory]].&lt;ref name=ja230/&gt;

The present church is a rectangular building, whose sides are about twenty and thirty meters long. It is oriented in SW – NE direction. The church has an apse on the NE side and a [[Bell-gable]]. The interior is covered with a [[Barrel Vault]] and is lavishly decorated. Over the Ayazma, considered to be one of the most beautiful in Istanbul,&lt;ref name=ro443/&gt; is built a chapel dedicated to [[Saint John the Forerunner]].

This work has involved satellite data set generation and analysis, including the determination of decreases in Arctic sea ice coverage since the 1970s and examination of their regional and interannual variabilities and impacts, plus the quantification and analysis of the very different time series of sea ice changes in the Antarctic. Dr. Parkinson is the Project Scientist for the [[Aqua satellite]] mission, which launched in May 2002 and continues to transmit data on many atmospheric, ocean, land, and ice variables.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/aqua |title=Aqua |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthzine.org/2016/09/12/claire-parkinson-a-scientist-who-goes-beyond/|title=Bio - Claire Parkinson: A Scientist Who Goes Beyond |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aqua data have been used in thousands of research publications by scientists worldwide and in numerous practical applications, including weather forecasting and forest fire detection. 

Parkinson has developed a computer model of sea ice, has done field work in both the Arctic and the Antarctic.  She has authored more than 100 scientific publications and author or editor of 15 books, among them she is the lead author of an atlas of Arctic sea ice from satellite data and a coauthor of two other sea ice atlases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C21&amp;q=Claire+Parkinson&amp;btnG=|title=Claire Parkinson |access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386a/pdf/pp1386a-4-web.pdf | title = Parkinson, C.

In the fields of horticulture and botany, the term '''''deciduous''''' (/dɪˈsɪdʒuəs/)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/deciduous|title=deciduous (adjective)|work=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; means "falling off at maturity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA1484 | title =The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia: Dictionary | author =William Dwight Whitney | author2 =''[[Century Dictionary]]'' | page =1484 | publisher =books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "tending to fall off",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Pqgtn89ad-wC&amp;pg=PT9 | title =Ecosystems | author =Debra J. Housel | author2 =''[[Capstone Publishers]]'' | isbn =9780756540685 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s that seasonally shed [[Leaf|leaves]], usually in the [[autumn]]; to the shedding of [[petal]]s, after flowering; and to the shedding of ripe [[fruit]].

Generally, the term ''deciduous'' means "the dropping of a part that is no longer needed" and the "falling away [of a part] after its purpose is finished". In plants, it is the result of natural processes. "Deciduous" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous [[antler]]s in [[deer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gause |first=John Taylor |year=1955 |title=The Complete Word Hunter |series=A Crowell reference book |location=New York |publisher=Crowell |page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[deciduous teeth]] (baby teeth) in some mammals (including humans); or [[decidua]], the uterine lining that sheds off after birth.

Wood from deciduous trees is used in a variety of ways in several industries including lumber for furniture, construction and flooring (oak), ornamental, bowling pins and baseball bats (maple) and furniture, cabinets, plywood and paneling (birch).{{Relevance inline|date=July 2018}}

== Botany ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Autumn leaf color]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
In [[botany]] and [[horticulture]], '''deciduous [[plant]]s''', including [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[herbaceous]] perennials, are those that lose all of their [[Leaf|leaves]] for part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/ecotree/leaves/decidu.htm |title=Trees that lose their leaves |author=''[[University of the Western Cape]]'' |publisher=botany.uwc.ac.za |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325032527/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/ecotree/leaves/decidu.htm |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called [[abscission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/service/library/for99-025/for99-025.pdf |title=Falling Tree Leaves: Leaf Abscission |author=Dr. Kim D.

The converse of deciduous is [[evergreen]], where foliage is shed on a different schedule from deciduous trees, therefore appearing to remain green year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/sc229.pdf | title =Evergreen Shrubs and Trees for Pennsylvania | author =J. Robert Nuss | author2 =''[[Pennsylvania State University]]'' | publisher =psu.edu | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants that are intermediate may be called [[semi-deciduous]]; they lose old foliage as new growth begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/openkey/intkey/web/glossary.pdf |title=The Illinois - North Carolina Collaborative Environment for Botanical Resources: Openkey Project. Glossary of Botanical Terms. Page 22. |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plants are semi-evergreen and lose their leaves before the next growing season, retaining some during winter or dry periods.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, William. 2001. ''African rain forest ecology and conservation an interdisciplinary perspective''. New Haven: Yale University Press. page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees, including a few species of [[oak]], have desiccated leaves that remain on the tree through winter; these dry persistent leaves are called [[marcescent]] leaves and are dropped in the spring as new growth begins.

[[File:Forsythia turin.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Flowering branch of forsythia amid bare trees|Like a number of other deciduous plants, ''[[Forsythia]]'' flowers during the leafless season]]

Many deciduous plants [[flower]] during the period when they are leafless, as this increases the effectiveness of [[pollination]]. The absence of [[leaf|leaves]] improves wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants and increases the visibility of the flowers to [[insect]]s in insect-pollinated plants. This strategy is not without risks, as the flowers can be damaged by frost or, in dry season regions, result in water stress on the plant. Nevertheless, there is much less branch and trunk breakage from glaze ice storms when leafless, and plants can reduce water loss due to the reduction in availability of liquid water during cold winter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lemon |first=P. C. |year=1961 |title=Forest ecology of ice storms |journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club |volume=88 |issue=21 |page= 21|doi=10.2307/2482410 |publisher=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Vol. 88, No. 1 |jstor=2482410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaf drop or [[abscission]] involves complex physiological signals and changes within plants. The process of photosynthesis steadily degrades the supply of chlorophylls in foliage; plants normally replenish chlorophylls during the summer months. When [[autumn]] arrives and the days are shorter or when plants are drought-stressed,&lt;ref name="Pessarakli2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Pessarakli|title=Handbook of photosynthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_3XqlcKPpwC&amp;pg=PA725|accessdate=9 October 2010|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5839-4|pages=725–}}&lt;/ref&gt; deciduous trees decrease chlorophyll pigment production, allowing other pigments present in the leaf to become apparent, resulting in non-green colored foliage. The brightest leaf colors are produced when days grow short and nights are cool, but remain above freezing.&lt;ref name="Linzey2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald W. Linzey|title=A natural history guide to Great Smoky Mountains National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcGn0f7LiJsC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=9 October 2010|date=1 April 2008|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|isbn=978-1-57233-612-4|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These other pigments include [[carotenoid]]s that are yellow, brown, and orange. [[Anthocyanin]] pigments produce red and purple colors, though they are not always present in the leaves. Rather, they are produced in the foliage in late summer, when sugars are trapped in the leaves after the process of abscission begins. Parts of the world that have showy displays of bright autumn colors are limited to locations where days become short and nights are cool. In other parts of the world, the leaves of deciduous trees simply fall off without turning the bright colors produced from the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments.

The beginnings of leaf drop starts when an abscission layer is formed between the leaf [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] and the stem. This layer is formed in the spring during active new growth of the leaf; it consists of layers of cells that can separate from each other. The cells are sensitive to a [[plant hormone]] called [[auxin]] that is produced by the leaf and other parts of the plant. When auxin coming from the leaf is produced at a rate consistent with that from the body of the plant, the cells of the abscission layer remain connected; in autumn, or when under stress, the auxin flow from the leaf decreases or stops, triggering cellular elongation within the abscission layer. The elongation of these cells break the connection between the different cell layers, allowing the leaf to break away from the plant. It also forms a layer that seals the break, so the plant does not lose sap.

A number of deciduous plants remove nitrogen and carbon from the [[foliage]] before they are shed and store them in the form of proteins in the vacuoles of [[parenchyma]] cells in the roots and the inner bark. In the spring, these proteins are used as a nitrogen source during the growth of new leaves or flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Srivastava |first=Lalit M. |year=2002 |title=Plant growth and development.

=== Function ===

[[File:Autumn Leaf 08Nov17.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Fallen leaves covering a patch of ground|Deciduous plants in mid- to high [[latitude]]s shed their leaves as temperatures drop in [[autumn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonan|first1=Gordon|title=Ecological Climatology: Concepts and Applications|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316425190|page=294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kq8kDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Plants with deciduous foliage have advantages and disadvantages compared to plants with evergreen foliage. Since deciduous plants lose their leaves to conserve water or to better survive winter weather conditions, they must regrow new foliage during the next suitable growing season; this uses resources which evergreens do not need to expend. Evergreens suffer greater water loss during the winter and they also can experience greater predation pressure, especially when small. Losing leaves in winter may reduce damage from insects; repairing leaves and keeping them functional may be more costly than just losing and regrowing them.&lt;ref name=Labandeira1994&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing leaves also reduces [[Cavitation#Vascular plants|cavitation]] which can damage [[xylem]] vessels in plants. This then allows deciduous plants to have xylem vessels with larger diameters and therefore a greater rate of [[transpiration]] (and hence CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake as this occurs when [[stomata]] are open) during the summer growth period.

==== Deciduous woody plants ====

The deciduous characteristic has developed repeatedly among woody plants. Trees include [[maple]], many [[oak]]s and [[nothofagus]], [[elm]], [[aspen]], and [[birch]], among others, as well as a number of [[conifer]]ous [[genus|genera]], such as [[larch]] and ''[[Metasequoia]]''. Deciduous shrubs include [[honeysuckle]], [[viburnum]], and many others. Most temperate woody vines are also deciduous, including [[Vitis|grape]]s, [[poison ivy]], [[Virginia creeper]], [[wisteria]], etc. The characteristic is useful in plant identification; for instance in parts of [[Southern California]] and the [[American Southeast]], deciduous and [[evergreen oak]] species may grow side by side.

Periods of leaf fall often coincide with seasons: winter in the case of cool-climate plants or the dry-season in the case of tropical plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cundall |first=Peter |year=2005 |title=Flora: The Gardener’s Bible: Over 20,000 Plants |location=Ultimo, NSW, Australia |publisher=ABC Publishing |isbn=0-7333-1094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there are no deciduous species among tree-like [[monocotyledonous]] plants, e.g. [[Arecaceae|palms]], [[yucca]]s, and [[Dracaena (plant)|dracaenas]]. The [[hydrangea hirta]] is a deciduous woody shrub found in [[Japan]].

=== Regions ===
Forests where a majority of the trees lose their foliage at the end of the typical growing season are called deciduous forests. These forests are found in many areas worldwide and have distinctive ecosystems, understory growth, and [[soil]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Röhrig |editor1-first=Ernst |editor2-last=Ulrich |editor2-first=Bernhard |year=1991 |title=Temperate deciduous forests |series=Ecosystems of the world, 7 |location= Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-444-88599-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two distinctive types of deciduous forest are found growing around the world.

'''[[Temperate deciduous forest]]''' biomes are plant communities distributed in North and South America, Asia, Southern slopes of the Himalayas, Europe and for cultivation purposes in Oceania. They have formed under climatic conditions which have great seasonable temperature variability with growth occurring during warm summers and leaf drop in autumn and dormancy during cold winters. These seasonally distinctive communities have diverse life forms that are impacted greatly by the seasonality of their climate, mainly temperature and precipitation rates. These varying and regionally different ecological conditions produce distinctive forest plant communities in different regions.

'''[[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical and subtropical deciduous forest]]''' biomes have developed in response not to seasonal temperature variations but to seasonal rainfall patterns. During prolonged dry periods the foliage is dropped to conserve water and prevent death from drought. Leaf drop is not seasonally dependent as it is in temperate climates, and can occur any time of year and varies by region of the world. Even within a small local area there can be variations in the timing and duration of leaf drop; different sides of the same mountain and areas that have high water tables or areas along streams and rivers can produce a patchwork of leafy and leafless trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephen H. |last=Bullock |author2=J.

The '''Energy Community''', also referred to in the past as the Energy Community of South East Europe is an international organisation established between the [[European Union]] (EU) and a number of third countries to extend the [[Energy policy of the European Union|EU internal energy market]] to Southeast Europe and beyond. With their signatures, the Contracting Parties commit themselves to implement the relevant EU energy ''[[acquis communautaire]]'', to develop an adequate regulatory framework and to liberalise their energy markets in line with the ''acquis'' under the Treaty.

==Aim==
The Energy Community aims at establishing a Pan-European energy market by extending the energy ''[[acquis]]'' of the European Union to the territories of third countries. The Energy Community legal framework covers legislation in the fields of energy, environment, and competition of the EU legislation.

After entry into force, the treaty ''acquis'' has been extended on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy-community.org/legal/treaty.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It now also includes legislation in relation to security of supply, energy efficiency, oil, renewable energy and statistics. In line with the update at the EU level, the Energy Community transposes and implements the EU's [[Third Energy Package]] since September 2011.

Timetable for implementation of the treaty is the following:
* by 1 July 2007 implement the two EU energy market [[EU directive|directives]] and the [[EU regulation|regulation]] on cross-border network access.
* from 1 January 2008 [[liberalisation]] of the electricity and gas markets for all non-household customers.
* by 31 December 2011 reduction in the [[sulphur]] content of certain [[liquid fuels]].
* by 30 June 2013 complete [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]]s, by 1 January 2014 transpose the [[Renewables Directive]] and to have thereby a binding share of renewable energy as part of the overall consumption in 2020, as determined by Decision D/2012/03/MC-Enc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy-community.org/dam/jcr:f2d4b3b8-de85-41b2-aa28-142854b65903/Decision_2012_04_MC_RE.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* from 1 January 2015 [[liberalisation]] of the electricity and gas markets for all customers.
* by 31 December 2016 to implement Regulation (EU) 431/2014 regards the implementation of annual statistics on energy consumption in households.
* by 1 January 2017 to implement Regulation (EU) 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure the electricity and gas markets.
* by 15 October 2017 to implement Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and set an indicative national energy efficiency target.
* by 31 December 2017 limitation of [[air pollutants|emissions]] of certain [[pollutant]]s into the air from large [[combustion]] plants.
* by 1 January 2023 to maintain minimum stocks of crude oil and/or petroleum products.

After having obtained the observer status, Moldova and Ukraine formally expressed their interest in full membership. Mandated by the Ministerial Council, the European Commission had the first round of formal negotiations with Moldova and Ukraine in late 2008. After three negotiation rounds, the technical negotiations were concluded in 2009. The Ministerial Council, however, made the membership conditional on legislative amendments. In concrete terms, it requested both countries to revise their gas laws and to align them with the EU's Gas Directive 2003/55/EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0055:EN:HTML |title=Directive 2003/55/EC of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas, L 176 |date=15 July 2003 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Moldova became a full-fledged member as of 1 May 2010, Ukraine officially acceded to the Energy Community on 1 February 2011. Georgia applied for full membership in 2014 and joined the organization as a fully-fledged member on 1 July 2017.

=== Observers ===
Any other neighbouring third country can obtain an observer status upon approval of a reasoned request by the Ministerial Council. A separate Procedural Act regulates the rights and obligations of the observers to the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/296181.PDF |title=Ministerial Council Decision on adoption of Procedural Rules on Acceptance of Countries as Observers to the Energy Community |format=PDF |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218171314/http://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/296181.PDF |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observers to the treaty are:

Following their accession to the European Union, three of the original treaty signatories, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, have matured from a Contracting Party to a Participant.

==Institutions==
The main institutions established by the treaty are:
* Ministerial Council
* Permanent High Level Group
* Energy Community Regulatory Board (ECRB)
* Fora
* Secretariat

=== Ministerial Council ===
The Ministerial Council is the principal decision-making institution of the Energy Community. It takes the key policy decisions and adopts the Energy Community's rules and procedures. The Ministerial Council is composed of one representative from each Contracting Party, usually the Minister responsible for energy, and of two representatives from the European Union, the European Commissioner for Energy and a high-level representative of the Presidency of the European Union.

Following a decision in December 2009, the Ministerial Council meets once a year. Moreover, the Presidency of the Council is held in turn by each contracting party for a term of 12 months. For the period of 1 January to 31 December 2018, Macedonia holds the presidency in office and chairs the key institutional meetings.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Energy Community Ministerial Council Tirana Oct 2015.jpg|center|Family photo of the 13th Ministerial Council in Tirana on 16 October 2015]] --&gt;

=== Permanent High Level Group ===
The Permanent High Level Group brings together senior officials from each Contracting Party and two representatives of the European Commission. It ensures the continuity of and follow-up to the political meetings by the ministers and decides, in certain cases, on implementing measures.

=== Energy Community Regulatory Board ===
The Regulatory Board is composed of high level representatives from the national energy regulatory agencies of the Energy Community Contracting Parties, Observers and Participants. It advises the Energy Community Ministerial Council and Permanent High Level Group (PHLG) on details of statutory, technical and regulatory rules and makes recommendations in the case of cross-border disputes between regulators. The Board can take regulatory measures when empowered by the Energy Community Ministerial Council.

The Board is currently chaired by its President (2018-2019), Mr Giorgi Pangani, Commissioner at Georgian National Energy and Water Regulatory Commission. The European Union, represented by the European Commission, acts as Vice-President and is assisted by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Regulatory Board meets in Athens. Its work is supported by the Energy Community Secretariat.

=== Fora ===
The fora have the task to advise the Energy Community. Chaired by the European Commission, a forum brings together all interested stakeholders from the industry, regulators, industry associations and consumers. Their conclusions, agreed by consensus, are addressed to the Permanent High Level Group.

The establishment of the fora reflects the process leading to the creation of the Energy Community. The Athens Electricity Forum, previously known as South East Europe Energy Regulation Forum, met for the first time in 2002. The terms governing the Gas Forum were established in 2006. It was decided that the Gas Forum shall convene in Slovenia. The first Social Forum took place in November 2008. At its December 2008 meeting, the Ministerial Council decided to adopt oil stock legislation  and to establish the Oil Forum. The first Oil Forum convened in 2009 in [[Belgrade]], Serbia.

===Secretariat===
The day-to-day activities of the Energy Community are administered by the Secretariat. The Secretariat assists the Contracting Parties in their implementation of the acquis. The Secretariat supports the Contracting Parties in the drafting of legislation and conducts expert missions when requested by the national authorities. The Secretariat organizes annually over 60 events, including institutional meetings and expert workshops.

Each year the Secretariat submits an Annual Implementation Report to the Ministerial Council of the Energy Community, which assesses the compliance of each Contracting Party with respect to its obligations under the treaty.   If a Contracting Party fails to comply with its treaty obligations, the Secretariat may open an infringement procedure.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Energy Community Implementation Rreport Covers.jpg|center|Secretariat's Implementation Reports 2015 - 2010]] --&gt;

Moreover, the Secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the Energy Community budget – to which all Parties contribute – is correctly spent and accounted for. As of 2017, the Secretariat has 31 staff members holding 19 nationalities. Since 1 December 2012, the Director of the Secretariat is Mr Janez Kopač (2012 - 2019). The Secretariat has its seat in Vienna, Austria.

===Role of the European Union===
Represented by the European Commission, the European Union holds the permanent Vice-Presidency of the Energy Community.  The European Commission assists the Presidency in the chairing of the Permanent High Level Group and the Ministerial Council and the preparation of agendas of all institutional meetings. At the annual Ministerial Council meeting, the European Commission is represented by the Commissioner for Energy. The European Union is the largest contributor to the Energy Community budget. Its contribution is nearly 95 percent.

==History==
The roots of the Energy Community Treaty go back to the South-East Europe Regional Energy Market for electricity and natural gas formed originally in the framework of the [[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]] through the Athens Memorandum. To this end, the ''establishment of the Energy Community represents a very important political step in a key economic sector before the accession of the SEE countries to the EU''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/10912/EUI%20RSCAS%202009_12.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Florence School of Regulation, EUI working paper on the Energy Community, Rozeta Karova, p.18, RSCAS 2009/12 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institutional setting of the Energy Community shows great parallels to the structures of the European Union. ''It was in the negotiations for this treaty that the Commission "reproduced" the institutions that were created by the founding fathers of the European Communities and reproduced its own institutions outside its borders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/index.php/eiop/article/view/2009_001a/ |title=EIoP, The Energy Community of Southeast Europe: A neo-functionalist project of regional integration, Stephan Renner, p. 11 |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=Eiop.or.at |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522120913/http://eiop.or.at/eiop/index.php/eiop/article/view/2009_001a |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the signing of the Treaty, the European Commission stated that ''the Energy Community Treaty is consciously modelled on the European Steel and Coal Community that was the genesis for the European Union''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/05/1346&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=The EU and South East Europe sign a historic treaty to boost energy integration, IP/05/1346|date=25 October 2005 |publisher=Europa.eu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athens Memorandum===
The 'Athens Memorandum' refers to the memorandum of understanding of 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/electricity/south_east/doc/2002_memo_en.pdf |title=Athens Memorandum of Understanding 2002 |format=PDF |date= }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its revision of 2003, signed in Athens. It was proposed by the European Union and it outlined the principles and the institutional necessities for regional electricity market development in South East Europe. Following intense discussions, an agreement was reached at the first South East Europe Electricity Regulation Forum in June 2002. The signing of the memorandum took place in November 2002 by Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and Turkey.

The 2003 revision added natural gas to the scope of work. Under the Athens Memorandum a South-East Europe Regional Energy Market (SEEREM) was envisioned to form part of the EU's internal energy market. The Athens Memorandum also set up a number of institutions, which collectively are known as the 'Athens Process'. In 2004, the Athens Forum meeting decided to name the process 'Energy Community'. at the same time the location of future institutions was agreed.

===Energy Community Treaty===
In May 2004, the European Union opened negotiations with the countries of the south-eastern European region to conclude a legal agreement. The negotiations took place between the European Community on one side, and Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Macedonia, Republic of Montenegro, Serbia, Romania, Turkey and UNMIK on behalf of Kosovo on the other side. The treaty establishing the Energy Community was signed in Athens, Greece, on 25 October 2005 . Signature of the treaty was approved by the [[European Parliament]] on 29 May 2006. The treaty subsequently entered into force on 1 July 2006.

In October 2013, the Energy Community Ministerial Council unilaterally decided to extend the duration of the treaty by ten years, to 2026. On this occasion, the Ministerial Council also established a High Level Reflection Group, which was mandated to assess the adequacy of the institutional set up and working methods of the Energy Community in achieving the objectives of the Treaty. The Reflection Group published on 11 June 2014 its final report “''An Energy Community for the Future''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy-community.org/portal/page/portal/0633975AD9F97B9CE053C92FA8C06338|title=High Level Reflection Group Report|format=PDF|date=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlining recommendations on how the Energy Community could be improved. A roadmap has been adopted as to how these proposals should be taken forward.

==Critics==
The treaty has been criticised by the European Public Service Union as it lacks a social dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsu.org/a/6027 |title=EPSU Press Release, Energy Community Ministerial Council urged to strengthen social dimension |date=17 December 2009 |publisher=Epsu.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Community ''acquis'' makes an explicit reference to public service obligations and customer protection. Whilst the Treaty may lack a legally binding ''acquis'' on social dialogue, the Contracting Parties have a legally binding obligation to foster social dimension within the process. In October 2007, the Parties signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Social Issues in the context of Energy Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/296209.PDF |title=layout.indd |format=PDF |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030430/https://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/296209.PDF |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Memorandum recognises that economic development and social progress are mutually linked and should go hand in hand. It also spells out the importance and the necessity to involve social partners in the reform process. Ukraine and Moldova signed the Declaration of Memorandum of Understanding on Social Issues in October 2011.

Environmental organisations from south-eastern Europe criticised the process in December 2008 as they believed that the ECSEE contains insufficient safeguard mechanisms to ensure that the well-intentioned promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy is not drowned out by the promotion of large and often environmentally harmful coal and hydropower plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankwatch.org/documents/seedw_ener_gy_futures.pdf |title=South-East Europe Development Watch position paper, South-east Europe energy policies |date=8 December 2008 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Community Ministerial Council decided to establish a task force in energy efficiency in 2007. The Energy Community Energy Efficiency Task Force has been operational since January 2008. It now operates under its fifth mandate (2017-2018).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energy-community.org/dam/jcr:62af77a0-bbfa-4025-bcc8-b78aaab79c79/WP_EECG_2017.pdf]{{Cite book|title=EECG Work Programme 2017-2018|last=|first=|publisher=Energy Community Secretariat|year=March 2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the ministers also adopted the core EU energy efficiency ''acquis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/488184.PDF |title=Ministerial Council Decision on the implementation of certain Directives on Energy Efficiency |format=PDF |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306132603/https://www.energy-community.org/pls/portal/docs/488184.PDF |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of renewable energy the discussion to adopt the EU [[Renewables Directive|renewable energy directive]] started already in 2008. The Ministerial Council established a renewable energy task force in 2009 and adopted the Directive 2009/28/EC with binding renewable energy targets for 2020 in October 2012. In October 2015, the ministers decided to re-establish the renewable energy task force. The Energy Community Task Force on Environment has been operational since Spring 2011.

Senegal's major source of electricity is mostly [[diesel fuel|diesel]] and gas, with an installed capacity of 633&amp;nbsp;MW.

== Electricity sector ==
Following institutional reform in 1998, [[Senegal]]'s [[electricity]] sector was split into three entities: '''[[Senelec]]''', the national utility, the Agency for Rural Electrification (Agence Sénégalaise d'Electrification Rurale, ASER) and the Electricity Regulatory Board (Commission de Régulation au Secteur de l'Electricité, CRSE).&lt;ref name=ccg&gt;[http://www.buyusa.gov/westafrica/en/senegal_ccg.pdf Senegal Country Commercial Guide 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507200048/http://www.buyusa.gov/westafrica/en/senegal_ccg.pdf |date=7 May 2009 }}. [[U.S. Commercial Service]] (2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loi98&gt;[http://www.crse.sn/pdf/Loi-1998-29.pdf Loi n° 98-29 du 14 avril 1998 relative au secteur de l’électricité] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity generation, mainly on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis, is open to the private sector. [[Senelec]], the sole buyer, signs power purchase contracts with independent power producers (IPPs).

==Electricity production==
[[File:Manantali dam.jpg|thumb|450px|The [[Manantali Dam]] in [[Mali]] generates some of Senegal's electricity needs.]]

Senegal's major source of electricity is mostly [[diesel fuel|diesel]] and gas, with an installed capacity of 633&amp;nbsp;MW.

* The [[General Electric]]/GTI Dakar [[Independent Power Producer|IPP]], which supplies approximately 20 percent of Senelec’s electrical needs, was commissioned in 1998. It has an installed capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]].
* On-line since January 2008, the second IPP Kounoune 1 – 67.5&amp;nbsp;MW - was partially funded by the [[International Finance Corporation]], with [[Mitsubishi]] and Matelec S.A.L, a division of the Doumet group from [[Lebanon]], as strategic partners.&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;
* Some [[hydroelectricity]] generated from the [[Manantali Dam]] in [[Mali]] is split between Senegal, Mali and [[Mauritania]]. Manantali has an installed capacity of 200&amp;nbsp;MW dispatched as follows: 52% for Mali, 15% for Mauritania and 33% for Senegal (66&amp;nbsp;MW).&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;
* In 2016 another IPP operator, ContourGlobal commissioned an 88 MW diesel power plant with Wartsila engines and a steam turbine at Cap des Biches.

== Electricity demand and supply gaps ==
Senelec is dealing with a chronic electricity production gap. which has worsened due to growing demand for electricity – the average demand increase during 2005-2009 is estimated at 7%, representing an electricity consumption of 1.933&amp;nbsp;[[TWh]] in 2005 to an estimated 2.66&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2009. The company is experiencing declining reliability of aging [[power plants]].&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;

Senegal's [[GDP]] growth was hindered in 2007 by frequent [[electricity outage]]s, which caused a slowdown of the economic and manufacturing activities. The GDP growth rate decreased to 2.1% in 2006 from 5.5% in 2005. According to local reports, the outages have contributed to the closure of many [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in the [[food processing]], [[textile]] and [[tourism]] sectors. Larger companies are reporting declines in output averaging 30%.&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;

===Future development===
Senegal is committed to shifting from a diesel-based power generation to cheaper energy sources. Senegal has thus put an option on the [[coal]] technology. The recent bid to build-own and operate a 125&amp;nbsp;MW coal-fired [[Sendou power station]] was awarded to a consortium of companies headed by the Swedish operator Nykomb Synergetics.&lt;ref name=forbes250108&gt;

 |publisher= Forbes
 |date=25 January 2008
 |accessdate=18 February 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Senegal has embarked on an aggressive effort to produce significant quantities of [[biofuel]]s, initially to run electricity generation units, and has a pilot project using sugarcane-based [[ethanol]].&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;

'''European Energy Exchange AG''', Germany's energy [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]], is the leading [[energy exchange]] in Central Europe. It develops, operates and connects secure, liquid and transparent markets for energy and related products. On the EEX spot and derivatives markets, power, natural gas, {{CO2}} emission allowances, coal and guarantees of origin are traded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eex.com/blob/68250/bc1150c78328d90dc18a14f9dd6cbacf/e-eex-unternehmen-februar-2014-pdf-data.pdf EEX Product Brochure 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309053628/http://www.eex.com/blob/68250/bc1150c78328d90dc18a14f9dd6cbacf/e-eex-unternehmen-februar-2014-pdf-data.pdf |date=9 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The European Energy Exchange is located in [[Leipzig]]. The current EEX emerged as a result of a [[merger]] between [[LPX Leipzig Power Exchange]] and the Frankfurt-based EEX in 2002. [[Deutsche Börse|Deutsche Börse Group]]’s derivatives business unit [[Eurex Exchange|Eurex]] acquired the majority share in the EEX in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutscheboerse-eex-idUSTRE71M3W020110223|title=Deutsche Boerse unit buys majority in EEX|date=2017-02-23|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurex Zürich AG controls 62.91% voting share and 75.05% stock share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eex.com/en/about/eex/shareholders|title=Shareholders|website=www.eex.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EEX operates market platforms for trading in [[electric energy]], natural gas, [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emission allowances and [[coal]].  EEX holds 50% of the European Power Exchange [[EPEX SPOT]] located in Paris which operates short-term trading in power for Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland. EEX's subsidiary [[EEX Power Derivatives GmbH]] offers a platform for German and French power derivatives trading.

EEX currently holds shares in the following companies:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eex.com/en/about/eex Shares held by EEX as of 2018-09-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

EEX announced that it reached agreement to acquire US-based Nodal Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.automatedtrader.net/news/at/157151/deutsche-boerses-eex-acquires-us-based-nodal-exchange|title=Deutsche Boerse's EEX acquires US based Nodal Exchange {{!}} Financial Industry &amp; Algorithmic Trading News {{!}} Automated Trader|website=www.automatedtrader.net|language=en|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading volume==
In 2013, the trading of electricity on the EEX Power Derivatives Market amounted to 1,263.9 TWh ([[Terawatt-hour|terawatt hours]]) compared with 931.4 TWh in 2012. In the year 2013, a total of 346 TWh was traded on the Power Spot Markets of EPEX SPOT (2012: 339 TWh). In the field of natural gas the volume traded on the EEX amounted to 110 TWh, an increase of 46 percent compared with the previous year (2012: 75.5 TWh). The volume in trading in emission allowances amounted to 850.3 million tonnes in 2013 in total (previous year: 254.6 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eex.com/blob/66776/8ea17d8bc1445c4113d8774772d6dee8/pr-20140114-eex-jahresrueckblick-pdf-data.pdf EEX end-of-year-review 2013, Date: 01/14/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spot market==
The [[spot market]] for electricity is operated by EPEX SPOT, a joint venture owned by German EEX AG and the French Powernext SAS (its 100% daughter). On each day of the year, EPEX SPOT operates day-ahead auctions for three market areas: Germany/Austria, France and Switzerland. The physical delivery of power takes place on the next day. EPEX SPOT provides also an intraday market for Germany and France. This market can be used to satisfy short-term needs of electricity or to sell short-term over capacities. Participants in the market can buy up to 45 minutes before every hour electricity for the specific hour. This market operates 24/7 without exceptions. The electricity for the next day can be traded from 15:00 onwards.

In 2011, EEX introduced 24/7 trading on the Natural Gas Spot Market. On the Spot Market, companies can trade natural gas on a continuous basis for the current day (within day), one day and two days in advance as well as for the following weekend. Since the launch of 24/7 trading EEX has also offered continuous trading with a minimum lot size of 1 MW (in addition to the 10 MW contracts). Short term gas quantities can be traded on the exchange for delivery in the market areas GASPOOL, NetConnect Germany (NCG) and the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) area.

EEX offers also a spot market for [[EU ETS|EU allowances]]. Since 2005, EEX operates both [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]s markets in emission allowances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances Emission Allowances Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304062035/http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances |date=4 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EEX has offered trading of emission allowances on the basis of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. EEX currently runs a secondary market for continuous trading on a Spot and Derivatives basis for EU ETS allowances (EUA, EUAA) and Kyoto credits (CER, ERU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances/emissions-allowance-secondary-market Emission Allowances Secondary Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304060802/http://www.eex.com/en/products/emission-allowances/emissions-allowance-secondary-market |date=4 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 26, 2008, it is possible to trade CER Futures on the EEX (Certified Emission Reductions), global emission credits in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. On 14 April 2008 EEX and Eurex launched trading of options on EUA Futures. Since January 2010 EEX AG runs the auctioning of the Emission Allowances issued by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. All trading participants admitted to trading in emission allowances on EEX are able to take part in the auction without any further preconditions regarding licensing. From the very beginning, this also included all trading participants taking part in the existing Eurex cooperation on the Derivatives Market. In addition, EEX also carries out the EUA auctions for further countries (Poland, Hungary). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has won the tendering procedure for the transitory auctioning platform for the EUA auctioned off by Germany for the third emissions trading period in February 2012 and it was chosen as cooperation exchange for the NER30 program of the European Investment Bank (EIB). As of 30 April 2012, emission allowances for the aviation industry (EU Aviation Allowances – EUAA) will also be offered for trading. Furthermore, Futures on Emission Reduction Units (ERU) will be launched at the end of April. In March, EEX extended the futures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER) for all maturities of the third trading period.

==Derivatives market==
Participants on the EEX  can trade power contracts (weeks, months, quarters, years) up to 6 years in the future. The Power Futures are financially settled contracts, but they can be physically delivered in Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy (Coming). Besides electricity also natural gas futures (market areas GASPOOL and NCG), financial coal futures and a broad range of {{CO2}} derivatives ([[Futures contract|Futures]] on EUA, CER, EUAA and ERU) can be traded at the EEX-Derivatives market.

Furthermore, Guarantees of Origin  (GoOs) are tradable on the EEX derivatives market. GoOs are certificates which confirm that a given Megawatt Hour of power has been generated from [[Renewable energy|renewable resources]]. These are exclusively issued for disclosure and transparency purposes and they are cancelled upon use. Trading in Guarantees of Origin on EEX is not connected with the delivery of power. Guarantees of Origin can be traded up to three years into the future. There are two maturities per year. EEX offers three products on the Derivatives Market:
*Nordic Hydro - Guarantees of Origin for [[Hydropower]] from Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
*Alpine Hydro - Guarantees of Origin for Hydropower from the Alpine region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland)
*Central Northern European Wind - Guarantees of Origin for [[Wind power|Wind Power]] from north-western Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands)

==Clearing and settlement==
Clearing and settlement of all exchange transactions is done by the European Commodity Clearing AG (ECC). ECC was founded in 2006 with the transfer of the EEX clearing activities to this subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eex.com/en/about/newsroom/news-detail/eex-and-endex-establish-clearing-co-operation/57366 Press Release, 07/05/2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175715/http://www.eex.com/en/about/newsroom/news-detail/eex-and-endex-establish-clearing-co-operation/57366 |date=16 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialised on the physical delivery of energy products, ECC is dedicated clearing provider for six exchanges: European Energy Exchange (EEX), Central European Gas Hub AG (CEGH), EPEX SPOT, Hungarian Power Exchange (HUPX), POWER EXCHANGE CENTRAL EUROPE, and Powernext. Furthermore, EEX and ECC provide the service of Trade Registration. This service enables the trading participants and the trade registration participants to conclude transactions through registration by mutual agreement or to have over-the-counter transactions registered.

==Transparency==
EEX operates "Transparency in Energy Markets”, the neutral platform for energy market data which fulfils the statutory publication requirements and implements the market participants’ voluntary commitments. The platform was established by EEX and the four German transmission system operators and launched in October 2009. In 2011, the Austrian transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid AG joined the cooperation. EEX is in charge of the operation of the platform, which comprises plausibility checking, anonymisation, aggregation and publication of the data reported.

On 2 September 2014, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) launched its new transparency site. At [http://www.eex-transparency.com www.eex-transparency.com], visitors can gain access to comprehensive fundamental data and relevant information for wholesale energy trading. The website is a further development of the existing platform “Transparency in Energy Market” and contains information about capacity, utilization and availability of facilities for the production of electricity as well as new information on the storage of electricity and natural gas consumption.

'''Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion ''' refers to the [[combustion]]-product gas resulting from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most fossil fuels are combusted with ambient air (as differentiated from combustion with pure [[oxygen]]). Since ambient air contains about 79 volume percent gaseous [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1997|isbn=0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is essentially non-combustible, the largest part of the [[flue gas]] from most fossil-fuel combustion is uncombusted nitrogen. [[Carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}), the next largest part of flue gas, can be as much as 10−25 volume percent or more of the flue gas.  This is closely followed in volume by water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) created by the combustion of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen.  Much of the 'smoke' seen pouring from [[flue gas stack]]s is this water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air.

A typical flue gas from the combustion of fossil fuels contains very small amounts of [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]].&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; The nitrogen oxides are derived from the nitrogen in the ambient air as well as from any nitrogen-containing compounds in the fossil fuel. The sulfur dioxide is derived from any [[sulfur]]-containing compounds in the fuels. The particulate matter is composed of very small particles of solid materials and very small liquid droplets which give flue gases their smoky appearance.

The steam generators in large [[power plant]]s and the process [[furnace]]s in large [[oil refinery|refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, and [[incinerator]]s burn considerable amounts of fossil fuels and therefore emit large amounts of flue gas to the ambient atmosphere. The table below presents the total amounts of flue gas typically generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[fuel oil]] and [[coal]]. The data were obtained by [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zumdahl, Steven S.|title=Chemical Principles|edition=5th|publisher=Houghton Mifflin College Division|year=2005|isbn=0-618-37206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-dispersion.com/formulas.html#combustion Air Dispersion Modeling Conversions and Formulas]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of interest to note that the total amount of wet flue gas generated by coal combustion is only 10 percent higher than the flue gas generated by natural-gas combustion (the ratio for dry flue gas is higher).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Fractional anisotropy (FA)''' is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value between zero and one that describes the degree of [[anisotropy]] of a [[diffusion]] process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in [[diffusion imaging]] where it is thought to reflect [[fiber density]], [[axon]]al diameter, and [[myelination]] in [[white matter]]. The FA is an extension of the concept of [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity of conic sections]] in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.

== Definition ==

A Diffusion Ellipsoid is completely represented by the Diffusion Tensor, D. FA is calculated from the [[eigenvalue]]s (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;) of the diffusion [[tensor]].&lt;ref name="Basser1996" /&gt; The eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; give the directions in which the ellipsoid has major axes, and the corresponding eigenvalues  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; give the magnitude of the peak in that direction.

[[File:DTschematic.jpg|thumb|right| Diffusion Tensor Schematic]]

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1 - \hat{\lambda})^2 + (\lambda_2 - \hat{\lambda})^2 + (\lambda_3 - \hat{\lambda})^2}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda} = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3)/3&lt;/math&gt; being the mean value of the eigenvalues.

An equivalent formula for FA is

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)^2 + (\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)^2 + (\lambda_3 - \lambda_1)^2}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is further equivalent to:&lt;ref name="ozarslan2005" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(3-\frac{1}{\text{trace}(\text{R}^2)}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the "normalized" diffusion tensor:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{R} = \frac{\text{D}}{\text{trace}(\text{D})}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if all the eigenvalues are equal, which happens for isotropic (spherical) diffusion, as in free water, the FA is {{math|0}}.   The FA can reach a maximum value of {{math|1}} (this rarely happens in real data), in which case D has only one nonzero eigenvalue and the ellipsoid reduces to a line in the direction of that eigenvector. This means that the diffusion is confined to that direction alone.

== Details ==

This can be visualized with an ellipsoid, which is defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of D. The FA of a sphere is ''0'' since the diffusion is isotropic, and there is equal probability of diffusion in all directions. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Diffusion Tensor give a complete representation of the diffusion process. FA quantifies the pointedness of the ellipsoid, but does not give information about which direction it is pointing to.

Note that the FA of most liquids, including water, is {{math|0}} unless the diffusion process is being constrained by structures such as network of fibers.  The measured FA may depend on the effective length scale of the diffusion measurement.  If the diffusion process is not constrained on the scale being measured (the constraints are too far apart) or the constraints switch direction on a smaller scale than the measured one, then the measured FA will be attenuated.  For example, the brain can be thought of as a fluid permeated by many fibers (nerve axons).  However, in most parts the fibers go in all directions, and thus although they constrain the diffusion the FA is {{math|0}}. In some regions, such as the [[corpus callosum]] the fibers are aligned over a large enough scale (on the order of a mm) for their directions to mostly agree within the resolution element of a [[magnetic resonance image]], and it is these regions that stand out in an FA image.  [[Liquid crystals]] can also exhibit anisotropic diffusion because the needle or plate-like shapes of their molecules affect how they slide over one another.  When the FA is 0 the tensor nature of D is often ignored, and it is called the diffusion constant.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ellipsoid2722.jpg| FA value of 0.9209, the DT matrix is diagonal([27 2 2])
File:Ellipsoid888.jpg| FA value of 0, the DT matrix is diagonal([8 8 8])
File:Ellipsoid eigenvalues14142.jpg|FA value of 0.6030, the DT matrix is diagonal([14 14 2])
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A drawback of the Diffusion Tensor model is that it can account only for [[Gaussian]] diffusion processes, which has been found to be inadequate in accurately representing the true diffusion process in the human brain. Due to this, higher order models using spherical harmonics and Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF) have been used to define newer and richer estimates of the anisotropy, called Generalized Fractional Anisotropy. GFA computations use samples of the ODF to evaluate the anisotropy in diffusion. They can also be easily calculated by using the Spherical Harmonic coefficients of the ODF model.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008" /&gt;

'''Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea''' is a regional convention signed by the official representatives of the five littoral [[Caspian sea|Caspian]] states: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russian Federation]] and [[Turkmenistan]] in Tehran (Iran) on 4 November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oils.gpa.unep.org/framework/region-6-next.htm Global Marine OIl Pollution Information Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt; The Framework Convention, also called Tehran Convention, entered into force on 12 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caspianenvironment.org/newsite/Convention-EntryIntoForce.htm Caspian Environment Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of this convention is “the protection of the Caspian environment from all sources of pollution including the protection, preservation, restoration and [[sustainability|sustainable]] and rational use of the biological resources of the Caspian Sea”.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea [http://www.caspianenvironment.org/newsite/Convention-FrameworkConventionText.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with Articles 7 - 11 of the Convention the Parties undertake an obligation to take measures to prevent, reduce and control pollution from the land-based sources, seabed activities, vessels, as well as pollution from other human activities including land reclamation and associated coastal dredging and construction of dams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/unep178.doc.htm UNEP Press-release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Convention also provides for appropriate measures to prevent the introduction into the Caspian Sea and to control and combat [[invasive species|invasive]] alien species, which threaten [[ecosystem]]s, [[habitat]]s or [[species]].

The Parties also take preventive, preparedness and response measures to protect the environment and human beings from consequences of natural and man-made environmental [[emergencies]], cooperate in setting up early warning systems and ensure the availability of adequate equipment and qualified personnel for combatting environmental emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;Article 13 of the Framework Convention&lt;/ref&gt; The Parties also agree to carry out [[environmental impact assessment]]s of hazardous activities capable of causing environmental emergencies or adverse effects on environment within their [[jurisdiction]],.&lt;ref&gt;Article 17 of the Framework Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parties also undertake to ensure the protection, preservation, restoration and rational use of marine biological resources in the Caspian Sea; strive to maintain or restore populations of marine species at levels that can produce the maximum [[sustainable yield]]; prevent [[over-exploitation]] of marine resources and protect [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]], rare and [[endangered species|endangered marine species]] and vulnerable ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Article 14 of the Framework Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 Convention also provides for cooperation of the Parties in [[environmental monitoring]], developing harmonised discharge and emission standards, conducting environmental research and development and exchanging environmental information.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 18, 20 and 21 of the Framework Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

A regularly convened Conference of the Parties and Secretariat were established by the Tehran Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 22-23 of the Framework Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the following four Protocols to the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea were drafted by Secretariat and discussed at the meetings of the Conference of the Parties:

*Protocol on Land-Based Sources of Pollution
*Protocol Concerning Regional Cooperation in Case of Emergency
*Protocol on EIA in a Transboundary Context
*Protocol on Protection of the Caspian Biodiversity.

The Protocol Concerning Regional Preparedness, Response and Co-operation in Combating Oil Pollution Incidents was adopted in Aktau, Kazakhstan on August 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of the Protocol on the website of the Framework Convention [http://www.tehranconvention.org/index/squelettes/spip.php?article41]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol for the Protection of the Caspian Sea against Pollution from Land-based Sources and Activities was signed in Moscow, Russian Federation, on December 12, 2012 at the 4th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Tehran Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehranconvention.org/IMG/pdf/Protocol_on_Pollution_from_Land_Based_Sources_and_Activities.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grand Bois''' (meaning ''great wood'', also '''Grans Bwa''', '''Bran Bwa''', '''Ganga-Bois''') is an elemental, nature-oriented [[loa]] closely associated with trees, plants and herbs in [[Haiti]]an [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]. Offerings to him include leaves and herbs, honey, and spiced rum. As a Petro Loa and Loa of the wilderness he can be fierce and unpredictable in some aspects. 

'''Grand Bois''', '''[[Kalfu|Maitre Carrefour]]''' (Master Crossroads), and [[Baron Cimetière]] (Baron Cemetery) form the Triad of Magicians. They represent the journey of life: ''Grand Bois'' represents the rich earth that you spring from and the dark woods you stumble through, ''Maitre Carrefour'' represents the various roads and paths you choose to travel on, and ''Baron Cimitère'' represents the end of the trip.     

Grand Bois is represented by [[Saint Sebastian]] as his Catholic counterpart. His colors are commonly shades of green (sometimes including red in some Houses).

'''Irazú''' is the first [[Costa Rican]] satellite to be launched into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qcostarica.com/dream-of-first-costa-rican-satellite-in-orbit-closer-to-reality/|title=Dream Of First Costa Rican Satellite In Orbit Closer To Reality|date=2017-03-23|work=Q Costa Rica|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.costaricantimes.com/the-first-costa-rican-satellite/56217|title=The First Costa Rican Satellite|last=|first=|date=26 August 2018|website=www.costaricantimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nano satellite was launched into space on 2 April 2018, onboard a [[Falcon 9]] rocket headed for the International Space Station. It is expected to orbit the earth for six months with the function of monitoring carbon, humidity, and temperature levels in Costa Rican forests. Funds for the launch of satellite was provided, in a significant part, through a [[Kickstarter]] [[crowdfunding]] campaign. 

== Background ==
The design, development, and financing of the Irazú satellite involved the Central American Association for Aeronautics (ACAE), based in Costa Rica, and engineers from the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2017/03/22/satellite-costa-rica-irazu|title=Costa Rica’s first satellite scheduled for deployment in one year|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen professors and students from Costa Rica Institute of Technology and from the National Training Institute worked on the project.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/1st-costa-rican-satellite-will-space-soon/|title=The 1st Costa Rican Satellite Will Be in Space Soon {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Villegas|first=Charito|date=2017-10-24|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 10-centimeter square "nano" satellite will monitor temperature, [[humidity]], and carbon dioxide fixation with the purpose of [[climate change]] analysis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Building the satellite from its individual component took six months and required an additional six months for testing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the initial testing period, Irazú was sent to Japan where it was further tested at the [[Kyushu Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usexpatcostarica.com/first-costa-rican-satellite-will-be-launched-into-space/|title=First Costa Rican satellite will be launched into space|date=2018-03-14|work=American Expatriate Costa Rica|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later sent to the [[JAXA|Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] for onward delivery to NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tec.ac.cr/en/articulos/first-costa-rican-satellite-travels-japan-final-tests|title=First Costa Rican satellite travels to Japan for final tests|date=2017-10-23|work=TEC|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The total cost of the project was US$500,000 with much of the money coming from ACAE. The Costa Rica Institute of Technology was tasked to provide the final $75,000 needed to complete the last stages of construction, testing and deployment into space.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/irazu/irazu-project-the-first-satellite-made-in-costa-ri|title=Irazú Project: The First Satellite Made in Costa Rica|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute turned to [[crowdfunding]] to raise the expected amount. Through [[Kickstarter]], about 800 donors from all over the world helped to raise the funds needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/irazu/irazu-project-the-first-satellite-made-in-costa-ri/posts/1535108|title=Update 2: Show your support for the campaign on Facebook and Twitter! · Irazú Project: The First Satellite Made in Costa Rica|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch== 
On 2 April 2018, the satellite was carried to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) onboard a [[Falcon 9]] rocket with help from [[NASA]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was deployed from the space station into its orbit from the KIBO satellite deployment module on 11 May 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/12/national/science-health/kenyas-first-satellite-released-japans-kibo-module-iss/|title=Kenya’s first satellite released from Japan’s Kibo module at ISS|date=2018-05-12|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its launch coincided with two other satellites namely [[Ubakusat]] and [[1KUNS-PF]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All three satellites were deployed into space from the ISS by Japanese astronaut [[Norishige Kanai]] through the [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The satellite orbits the Earth at a height of about {{convert|400|km}} above the earth and will be in service for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2017/03/22/satellite-costa-rica-irazu|title=Costa Rica’s first satellite scheduled for deployment in one year|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication ==
Irazú communicates with two earth stations: the experimental station at [[San Carlos (canton)|San Carlos]], and the monitoring station on the central Campus of Costa Rica Institute of Technology in [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the monitoring station, information will be relayed from space concerning the level of tree growth in the country.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The data will be used to determine the approximate carbon fixation rate of Costa Rican forests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Jordan River''' (also '''River Jordan'''; {{lang-he-n|נְהַר הַיַּרְדֵּן}} ''Nahar ha-Yarden, {{lang-syc|ܢܗܪܐ ܕܝܘܪܕܢܢ}},'' {{lang-ar|نَهْر الْأُرْدُنّ}} ''Nahr al-Urdunn'', [[Ancient Greek]]: Ιορδάνης, ''Iordànes'') is a {{convert|251|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} river in the [[Middle East]] that flows roughly north to south through the [[Sea of Galilee]] (Hebrew: כנרת Kinneret, Arabic: Bohayrat Tabaraya, meaning Lake of Tiberias) and on to the [[Dead Sea]]. [[Jordan]] and the [[Golan Heights]] border the river to the east, while the [[West Bank]] and [[Israel]] lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.

The river has a major significance in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] since many believe that the Israelites crossed it into the [[Promised Land]] and that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptised]] by [[John the Baptist]] in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|title=An Interfaith Look at the Jordan River|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Jordan River - Dead Sea.png|thumb|River Jordan draining into the [[Dead Sea]]]]
The Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee, and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the "[[Hula Valley]]", as opposed to "Upper Jordan Valley"; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity; and the term [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is reserved for the lower course.

Over its upper course, the river drops rapidly in a {{convert|75|km|adj=on}} run to the once large and swampy [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]], which is slightly above [[sea level]]. Exiting the now much diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the {{convert|25|km}} down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip. At that point the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last {{convert|120|km|adj=on}}-long section follows what is commonly termed the "Jordan Valley", which has less [[stream gradient|gradient]] (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river [[meander]]s before entering the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Endorheic basin|terminal lake]] about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last section: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Zarqa River]].

Its section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel, and forms the western boundary of the Golan Heights. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).

The streams coming together to create the River Jordan in its upper basin are, west to east:
* [[Nahal Ayun|Iyyon]] (Hebrew: עיון ''Iyyon'', Arabic: دردره ''Dardara'' or براغيث ''Braghith'' – on old [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]] maps (1871–77) as ''Wadi el-Kharrar'' in the [[Marjeyoun District|Merj 'Ayun area]] and ''Nahr Bareighit'' in its lower part), a stream which flows from Lebanon.
* [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Arabic: الحاصباني ''Hasbani'', Hebrew: either שניר ''Snir'' or ''Hatzbani''), a stream which flows from [[Mount Lebanon]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}.
* [[Dan River (Middle East)|Dan]] (Arabic: اللدان ''Leddan'', Hebrew: דן ''Dan''), a stream whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.
* [[Nahal Hermon|Banias]] (Arabic: بانياس ''Banias'', Hebrew: either ''Banias'' or חרמון ''Hermon''), a stream arising from a spring at [[Banias]] at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]].
South of the [[Sea of Galilee]] the Jordan River receives the waters of further tributaries, the main ones being
* [[Yarmouk River]]
* [[Zarqa River]]
Smaller tributaries in this segment are
* [[Wadi al-Far'a (river)|Wadi al-Far'a]]
* [[Wadi Qelt]]

==Etymology==
While several hypotheses for the origin of the river's name have been proposed, the most accepted is that it comes from Semitic Yard|on 'flow down' &lt;√ירד reflecting the river's declivity.&lt;ref name="rahkonen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rahkonen |first1=Pauli Ensio Juhani |title="Canaanites" or "Amorites"?

==History==
In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by [[Christopher Costigan]] in 1835, [[Thomas Howard Molyneux]] in 1847, [[William Francis Lynch]] in 1848, and [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadsea.com/history/|title=History of the Dead Sea - Discover the Dead Sea with Us!|date=1 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1849 book ''[[s:Narrative Of The United States Expedition To The River Jordan And The Dead Sea|Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea]]'' is available online.

[[File:Abbud24C.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coloured postcard of the Jordan River, by [[Karimeh Abbud]], circa 1925]]
In 1964, Israel began operating a pumping station that diverts water from the Sea of Galilee to the [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]]. Also in 1964, Jordan constructed a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] that diverted water from the [[Yarmouk River]], another main tributary of the Jordan River to the [[King Abdullah Canal|East Ghor Canal]]. Syria has also built reservoirs that catch the Yarmouk's waters. Environmentalists blame [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] for extensive damage to the Jordan River ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Plushnick-Masti"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091001354.html|title=Raw Sewage Taints Sacred Jordan River|last=Plushnick-Masti|first=Ramil|date=10 September 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the waters are 70% to 90% used for human purposes and the flow is greatly reduced. Because of this and the high evaporation rate of the [[Dead Sea]], as well as industrial extraction of salts through evaporation ponds, the sea is shrinking. All the shallow waters of the southern end of the sea have been drained in modern times and are now salt flats.

A small section of the northernmost portion of the Lower Jordan, the first ca. {{convert|3|km|adj=on}} below the Sea of Galilee, has been kept pristine for baptism and local tourism. Most polluted is the 100-kilometre downstream stretch—a meandering stream from above the confluence with the Yarmouk to the [[Dead Sea]]. Environmentalists say the practice of letting sewage and brackish water flow into the river has almost destroyed its [[ecosystem]]. Rescuing the Jordan could take decades, according to environmentalists.&lt;ref name="Plushnick-Masti"/&gt; In 2007, [[Friends of the Earth]] Middle East (FoEME) named the Jordan River as one of the world's 100 most endangered ecological sites, due in part to lack of cooperation between Israel and neighboring Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;"Endangered Jordan", ''Dateline World Jewry'', [[World Jewish Congress]], September, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same environmentalist organization had said in a report that the Jordan River could dry up by 2011 unless the decay was stopped.&lt;ref name=dry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news192044027.html|title=Jordan River could die by 2011: report|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flow rate of the Jordan River once was 1.3 billion cubic metres per year; as of 2010, just 20 to 30 million cubic metres per year flow into the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=dry /&gt;

Recent literature shows the role of power asymmetries and of discourses and narratives in shaping hydropolitics along the Jordan River Basin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10784-017-9364-y Hussein, Hussam, and Mattia Grandi. "Dynamic political contexts and power asymmetries: the cases of the Blue Nile and the Yarmouk Rivers." International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics (2017): 1-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roads, border crossings, bridges==
[[File:RAFTING ON THE JORDAN RIVER.jpg|thumb|Rafting on Jordan River, Northern Galilee]]
[[Highway 90 (Israel)|Route 90]], part of which is named after [[Rehavam Zeevi]], connects the northern and southern tips of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parallels the Jordan River on the western side.

There are two border crossings between Israel and Jordan which cross the river over bridges. The northern one, [[Jordan River Crossing|Jordan River Crossing or Sheikh Hussein Bridge]] is near [[Beit She'an]]; the southern one, [[Allenby Bridge]] (also King Hussein Bridge), is near [[Jericho]].

From the bridges crossing the river within Israel, the most famous one is the [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge|Bnot Ya'akov Bridge]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: Gesher Bnot Ya'akov, "Daughters of Jacob Bridge").

* [[Arik Bridge]] at the northern end of the Sea of Galilee; allows access to the central Golan Heights, was crucial in the 1967 and 1973 wars
* [[Al-Sinnabra]] at the spot where the river used to exit the Sea of Galilee in the past; few remains excavated by archaeologists
* [[Gesher, Israel|Jisr el-Majami']] north of [[Beit She'an|Beit She'an/Beisan]]; closed
* [[Damia Bridge|Damiya or Adam Bridge]] halfway between Jericho and Beit She'an; closed
Another closed bridge is the [[King Abdullah Bridge]] south of the Allenby Bridge.

==Importance as a water source==
The waters of the Jordan River are the second largest water resource for Israel, [[desalination]] of sea water from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] being the first. Israel's [[National Water Carrier]], completed in 1964, delivers water from the Sea of Galilee to the Israeli coastal plain.

[[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Jordan]] receives {{convert|50,000,000|m3}} of water from the river, a quantity which is regulated by the 1994 [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty]] with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susskind|first=Lawrence|author2=Shafiqul Islam|title=Water Diplomacy: Creating Value and Building Trust in Transboundary Water Negotiations|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|year=2012|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2012/water-diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, one of the main water resources in Jordan was the Jordan River, with a flow of 1.3 billion m3 per year (BCM/yr). However, after Israel built the National Water Carrier in 1953 and diverted water from Lake Tiberias to Israel’s coastal plains and southern desert, the flow of the Lower Jordan River dropped significantly. The 50 MCM/yr that Israel provides from Lake Tiberias as part of the 1994 peace treaty was meant to compensate for this loss. A 2010 study found that the Lower Jordan River has been reduced to 2% of its historic flow.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Water quality has also deteriorated sharply, with high levels of salinity and pollution from agricultural fertilizer and untreated wastewater upstream in Israel and the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface and Groundwater of Jordan|url=https://water.fanack.com/jordan/water-resources/surface-and-groundwater/|website=Fanack Water|publisher=Fanack Water of the Middle East and North Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict about the waters of the Jordan River was a contributing factor to the [[Origins of the Six-Day War#Water dispute|Six-Day War]] when, starting in 1965, [[Syria]] attempted to divert some of its headwaters in collaboration with Lebanon and Jordan.&lt;ref name=mehr&gt;Mehr, Farhang, "The politics of water," in Antonino Zichichi, Richard C. Ragaini, eds., ''International Seminar on Nuclear War and Planetary Emergencies'', 30th session, Erice, Italy, 18–26 August 2003, Ettore Majorana International Centre for Scientific Culture, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pie. Ltd., 2004, p. 258, 259&lt;/ref&gt; The diversion works would have reduced the water availability for Israel's carrier by about 35%, and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Murakami |year=1995 |url= http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0m.htm |title=Appendix C: Historical review of the political riparian issues in the development of the Jordan River and basin management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==
In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the Jordan is referred to as the source of fertility of a large plain ("Kikkar ha-Yarden"), said to be watered like "the garden of the LORD" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|13:10|HE}}). There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), on his way back from [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23–24|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the "two tribes and the half tribe" settled to the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the "nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim). 

Opposite [[Jericho]], it was called "the Jordan of Jericho" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5–6|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midian]]ites ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Sukkot|Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}). In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:1-4|HE}} the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that "trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm Barnes' Notes] on 2 Kings 6, accessed 26 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15–17|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as "a witness" between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). The prophet and wonder-worker Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]]'s [[leprosy]] by having him bathe in its waters ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}), and he made an axe head lost by one of the "children of the prophets" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).

==New Testament==
[[File:Jordanian Christian women visiting Al-Maghtas, Jordan River, 1913 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jordanian Christian]] women visiting [[Al-Maghtas]] site, 28 November 1913.]]
[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|250px|right|thumb| [[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]]]]
The [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptised unto repentance &lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Jordan ([[Matthew 3:5]]–[[Matthew 3:6|6]]; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). These acts of [[Baptism]] are also reported as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).

[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptised]] by him there ([[Matthew 3:13]]; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29–36|KJV}}).

The [[prophecy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1–2|KJV}}) is also reported in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.

The New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[Sermon|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7–8|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at Jordan in the place John had first baptised ({{bibleverse||John|10:39–40|KJV}}).

Evidence from scriptures and archaeological findings has concluded that the site called [[Al-Maghtas]] on the [[Jordan]]ian side is the most accurate location for the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John. This has led to choosing Al-Maghtas as a UNESCO World Heritage site, which took place in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446/|title=Baptism Site "Bethany Beyond the Jordan" (Al-Maghtas)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
The Jordan is a frequent symbol in [[Folk music|folk]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual music]], and in [[poetry|poetic]] and [[literature|literary]] works.

Because, according to Jewish tradition, the [[Israelites]] made a difficult and hazardous journey from [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] to freedom in [[Promised Land|the Promised Land]], the Jordan can refer to freedom. The actual crossing is the final step of the journey, which is then complete.

Because of the baptism of Jesus, water from the Jordan is employed for the christening of heirs and princes in several Christian royal houses, such as the cases of [[Prince George of Cambridge]], [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon of Bulgaria]]&lt;ref&gt;Kate Connolly, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/20/worlddispatch.kateconnolly "Once upon a time in Bulgaria"], ''The Guardian'', 20 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Ogilvy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baptized |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871108-1,00.html |quote=water from the River Jordan was sent for the occasion; |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 22, 1964 |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baptism of Jesus is referred to in a hymn by the reformer Martin Luther, "{{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam]]}}" (1541), base for a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, {{lang|de|[[Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam, BWV 7|''Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam'', BWV 7]] |italic=unset}} (1724).

The Jordan River, due primarily to its rich spiritual importance, has provided inspiration for countless songs, hymns, and stories, including the traditional African-American spiritual/folk songs "[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]", "[[Deep River (song)|Deep River]]", and "[[Roll, Jordan, Roll]]". It is mentioned in the songs "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]", "[[Will You Be There]]", and "[[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|The Wayfaring Stranger]]" and in "[[Ol' Man River]]" from the musical ''[[Show Boat]]''. "The Far Side Banks of Jordan" by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]] on June's [[Grammy Award]]-winning studio album, ''[[Press On]]'', mentions the Jordan River as well as the Promised Land. Jordan River is also the subject of [[roots reggae]] artist [[Burning Spear]]'s song of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jah-lyrics.com/index.php?songid=1135|title=Jah Lyrics: Burning Spear - Jordan River Lyrics|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lambay''', sometimes referred to as '''Lambay Island''' ({{etymology|non|Lambey|[[domestic sheep|lamb]] island}}; called in {{lang-ga|Reachrainn}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/16810.aspx Lambay Island] [[Placenames Database of Ireland]]. Retrieved: 23 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; lies in the [[Irish Sea]] off the coast of north [[County Dublin]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is {{convert|4|km|mi|0|spell=in}} offshore from the headland at [[Portrane]] and is the [[Extreme points of Ireland|easternmost point]] of the province of Leinster.

Similarly named places are [[Lamba (Faroe Islands)|Lamba]] in the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Lamba (island)|Lamba]] in [[Shetland]].

==History==
[[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' (2nd century AD) described an island called Εδρου (''Edrou''). PIE *''sed''- ‘to sit, settle’ had descendants in many languages,
including Greek ἑδρα (''hedra'') ‘sitting place’ whose many specific uses included ‘base for ships’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
Lambay Island is the largest island off the east coast of Ireland and is about 2.5 square kilometres (240 hectares or 593.1 acres) in size. Its highest point rises to 127 metres (416.7 feet). There are steep cliffs on the northern, eastern, and southern sides of the island, with a more low-lying western shore. The geology is dominated by [[igneous rock]]s, with [[shale]]s and [[limestone]]s.  There are a small number of wells and streams.

There is a private harbour on the western shore, and there are a small number of buildings nearby including a [[bothy]], coastguard cottages and a [[real tennis]] court.

==Lambay Castle==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Lambay Castle, Approach.jpg|thumb|Castle Approach]]
A small late 16th-century fort with battlemented gables, possibly incorporating a 15th-century blockhouse, on the island was transformed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] into a romantic castle for the Hon. Cecil Baring, afterwards 3rd Lord Revelstoke. Baring had been working in the USA when he fell in love with the wife of one of his co-directors. She divorced her husband and married Baring. He bought the island for £5,250 in 1904 as a place to escape to with his beautiful young wife, Maude Louise Lorillard, the daughter of [[Pierre Lorillard IV|Pierre Lorillard]], the first American to win [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]]. The story of their early life on the island inspired [[Julian Slade]]’s musical ''[[Free as Air]]''.

Lutyens made the old fort habitable and built a quadrangle of kitchens, bathrooms and extra bedrooms adjoining it, with roofs of grey Dutch [[Pantile (roof material)|pantiles]] sweeping down almost to the ground. He also built a circular curtain wall or [[enceinte]] surrounding the castle and its garden, with an impressive bastioned gateway; this wall serves the practical purpose of a wind break, enabling trees and plants to grow inside it – which would not grow outside. Everything is of a silvery grey stone. The rooms in the castle have vaulted ceilings and stone fireplaces; there is a stone staircase with many curves and an underground gallery in the new quadrangle which might have been conceived by Piranesi. According to the Revelstoke records on the island, Lambay Castle is also the location where [[Michael Powell]] wrote his screenplay for [[Black Narcissus|Black Narcissus (1947)]].

Lutyens also designed the approach from the harbour, with curved step-like terraces reminiscent of the now-vanished [[Porto di Ripetta|Ripetta in Rome]] and a series of ellipses, circles being a long-standing symbol of welcome and also of wholeness. Characteristically, having ascended those Baroque steps, one has to cross an open field to come to the curtain wall, the entrance gateway not being at first visible; so there is a sense of expectancy.

Close to the harbour is the White House, a largely horse-shoe shaped house with high roofs and whitewashed walls, which Lutyens designed in the 1930s for Lord Revelstoke's daughters Daphne and Calypso and their families, while the castle and island were left to his only son Rupert Baring. On a small cliff-top near the White House is an old Catholic chapel, with a portico of tapering stone columns (also added by Lutyens) and a barrel vaulted ceiling. Inside are various religious symbols and artefacts made by members of the family, including the little stain-glass window.

==Wildlife==
The island supports one of the largest and most important [[seabird]] colonies in Ireland, with over 50,000 [[common guillemot]]s, 5,000 [[black-legged kittiwake|kittiwakes]], 3,500 [[razorbill]]s, 2,500 pairs of [[European herring gull|herring gulls]], as well as smaller numbers of [[Atlantic puffin|puffins]], [[Manx shearwater]]s, [[fulmar]]s, [[greylag goose|greylag geese]] and many other species.

Among the [[mammal]]s of the island are Atlantic Great [[grey seal]]s (Ireland's only east coast colony {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}), which pup on the island itself; wild [[red-necked wallaby|red-necked wallabies]] (introduced by Rupert Baring in the 1950s, augmented by a surplus from [[Dublin Zoo]] in the 1980s, numbering perhaps around 100 in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-heck-are-wallabies-doing-ireland-180953304/ |title= What the Heck Are Wallabies Doing in Ireland? |work= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonion]] |date= 12 November 2014 |accessdate= 21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seandalaiocht.com/1/post/2010/07/archaeological-wallabies-on-lambay-island.html |title= Archaeological Wallabies on Lambay Island |work= Seandálaíocht - Irish for Archaeology |date= 8 July 2010 |accessdate= 21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/wallabies-lambay-island-2-3516673-Jul2017&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced [[fallow deer]] (a herd of about 200).

==Current status==
[[File:Lambay Castle Wall.jpg|thumb|The Castle Wall]]
The island is still privately owned by the [[Baron Revelstoke|Baring]] family trust. The medieval castle is the only [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]]-designed home, together with the [[Liria Palace]] in Madrid, which is still in the occupation and ownership of the original family that commissioned it. Alex Baring (7th [[Baron Revelstoke]]) is currently in occupation.  The farm has accepted [[WWOOF]]ers as volunteers in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOOFing in Leinster|url=http://www.wwoof.ie/hostlist/preview/Leinster/all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The estate includes domestic extensions to the old Castle, a row of Coastguard cottages, the Bothy, the White House (family guesthouse), a harbour and boathouse and a distinctive open-air [[real tennis]] court, the only one remaining in Ireland (there was one in the old [[University College Dublin]] complex on Earlsfort Terrace). There is also the farm with cottages, and the Chapel is located on an isolated [[promontory]]. All architecture was either designed or renovated by Sir Edwin Lutyens.

Due to its deep surrounding waters, the island attracts scuba divers and fishermen, as well as lobster-potters. The island is accessible by invitation only, mainly from Malahide Marina and occasionally Rogerstown Pier, [[Rush, Dublin|Rush]] and Skerries Harbour all north of Dublin.

==Prehistory and history==
The island was important in the [[Neolithic]] period in Ireland as a [[ground stone]] axe quarrying and production site. Two outcrops of [[andesite]], or ''Lambay [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]'' as it is more commonly known, were utilised. The quarry site is unusual in Ireland for being the only Neolithic stone axe quarry with evidence for all stages of production, from quarrying to final polishing.
[[File:Aerial approach to Lambay Island.jpg|alt=Lambay aerial shot west coast|thumb|300x300px|Aerial Approach to Lambay]]
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Roman]] writer [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and the ancient Greek [[Ptolemy]] knew about the island and referred to it as ''Limnus'' or ''Limni''. Its Irish name, ''Reachra'', was eventually joined by a [[Old Norse|Norse]] name based on the root word ''ey'' for island. The name ''Lambey'' probably originated with the practice of sending over [[sheep|ewe]]s to the island in spring to lamb in a predator-free environment. The belief that the fore part of the name in Norse is from the word ''lamb'' makes perfect sense, but may be a later rationalisation for a name based on whatever the name of the island was at the time of Pliny and Ptolemy and the word ''ey''. The Irish name for the nearby coastal area of [[Portrane]], ''Port Reachrainn'', originated from its position facing the island.

A number of [[Iron Age]] burials were discovered on the island in 1927 during works on the island's harbour. The finds included a number of Romano-British items, and the site has been interpreted as evidence for the arrival of a small group of refugees from [[Brigantia (ancient region)|Brigantia]], fleeing the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] from 71 to 74.

[[Columba|St. Columba]] is said to have established a monastic settlement on Lambay {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;[[530 in Ireland|530 AD]], and Ireland's [[Viking age]] began with a raid on this settlement. The raid, marked by the pillaging of the island's church and the burning of its buildings, took place in [[8th century in Ireland|795]].  (''The burning of Reachrainn by plunderers; and its shrines were broken and plundered.'') 
Surveying in the 20th century found remains of an enclosure to the south of the present chapel, and suggestions of a connected moated site (the present chapel was renovated by [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]] in the early 20th century).

[[Sigtrygg Silkbeard|Sitric]], a Danish King of Dublin, granted Lambay to [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]], and in [[1181 in Ireland|1181]] [[John, King of England|Prince John]] granted it to the Archbishops of Dublin. This was reconfirmed by King Edward in 1337 and by King Richard in 1394. A later archbishop gave the rents of the island to the nuns of Grace Dieu for the upkeep of their monastery and school. He also gave the tithes of the Lambay rabbits to the nuns and at that time the rabbit taxes were worth 100 shillings a year.

In [[1467 in Ireland|1467]], it was provided by statute that the [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|Earl of Worcester]], then [[Lord Deputy of Ireland|Lord Deputy]], be granted Lambay to build a fortress for England's protection against the Spaniards, French and Scots. Worcester paid the Archbishop of Dublin 40 shillings per annum and though he had a licence to build a castle on Lambay it is not certain that it was actually built.

During the reformation, Archbishop Brown granted the Island to [[John Challoner]] for a rent of £6.13.4. The conditions were that Challoner would within six years build a village, castle and harbour for the benefit of fishermen and as a protection against smugglers. He was to inhabit Lambay "with a colony of honest men". He was a very active man who worked four mines for silver and copper and bred falcons on the island's many cliffs.

Challoner still owned Lambay in Elizabethan times but in 1611 the island was granted to Sir William Ussher and his heirs. [[James Ussher]], later the Anglican [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]], lived on Lambay in 1626 but by 1650 he was resident in London. He was highly respected by Cromwell and today lies buried in Westminster Abbey. The Ussher family held the island for 200 years. In the 17th century there was some exploratory lead or copper mining.

During the [[Williamite war in Ireland]], the island was used as an internment camp for Irish soldiers. More than one thousand of them were imprisoned there after the [[Battle of Aughrim]] in 1691 and some died of wounds and starvation.

In 1805, the leasehold of Lambay was inherited by Sir William Wolseley, and in 1814 it was acquired by the Talbot family of [[Malahide]]. In 1860 the existing farmers were removed and replaced with English and Scottish tenants.

Having sold nearby Portrane House, Count James Consedine bought Lambay in 1888, developing the island for hunting. In turn, the Baring family of banking fame bought Lambay Island in 1904 for £5,250 pounds (depending on different sources). Cecil Baring hired [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] to work on renovation of the island's main residence, the 15th Century fort, and surrounds. Lutyens became a firm friend of the island and continued to return there throughout his life, adding to his architectural designs and renovations over the course of 30 years or so.  Cecil Baring became Lord Revelstoke in 1929 and died in 1934.  He and his beloved wife [[Pierre Lorillard IV|Maude Lorillard]] are buried in the family Mausoleum on Lambay, along with their son Rupert Baring and grandsons John and James Baring.  The Mausoleum, also designed by Lutyens, forms part of the circular rampart wall around the Castle and is engraved with a poem Cecil wrote in memory of Maude when she died.

The island has claimed a number of shipwrecks, one of the most notable of which was [[Tayleur|RMS ''Tayleur'']]. One of the largest merchant ships of her day, she struck the island on 21 January 1854 just hours into her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Perth, Australia and sank with the loss of 380 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guy|first=Stephen|title=Wreck of the Tayleur|url=http://blog.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/WreckOfTheTayleur.aspx|website=National Museums Liverpool Blog|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambay was the landing site of the winners of the 1921 [[Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)|Gordon Bennett Gas Balloon Race]]. The pilots were Captains Armbruster and Ansermier, both Swiss. They took off from [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], and flew 756 kilometres with a maximum altitude of 3,600 metres during their flight of 27 hours and 23 minutes.

Lambay Island was Protestant majority until the early 20th century.

In [[meteorology]], '''lee waves''' are [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] stationary waves. The most common form is '''mountain waves''', which are atmospheric internal [[gravity wave]]s.  These were discovered in 1933 by two German [[glider pilot]]s, Hans Deutschmann and [[Wolf Hirth]], above the [[Krkonoše]].&lt;ref&gt;On March 10, 1933, German glider pilot Hans Deutschmann (1911–1942) was flying over the Riesen mountains in Silesia when an updraft lifted his plane by a kilometer.  The event was observed, and correctly interpreted, by German engineer and glider pilot Wolf Hirth (1900–1959), who wrote about it in:  Wolf Hirth, ''Die hohe Schule des Segelfluges'' [The advanced school of glider flight] (Berlin, Germany:  Klasing &amp; Co., 1933).  The phenomenon was subsequently studied by German glider pilot and atmospheric physicist Joachim P. Küttner (1909 -2011) in: Küttner, J. (1938) "Moazagotl und Föhnwelle" (Lenticular clouds and foehn waves), ''Beiträge zur Physik der Atmosphäre'', '''25''', 79–114, and Kuettner, J. (1959) "The rotor flow in the lee of mountains."

They are [[Frequency|periodic]] changes of [[atmospheric pressure]], [[temperature]] and [[orthometric height]] in a [[Air current|current]] of [[air]] caused by vertical displacement, for example [[orographic lift]] when the [[wind]] blows over a [[mountain]] or [[mountain range]]. They can also be caused by the surface wind blowing over an [[escarpment]] or [[plateau]],&lt;ref name=Pagen/&gt; or even by upper winds deflected over a [[thermal]] [[updraft]] or [[cloud street]].

The vertical motion forces periodic changes in [[speed]] and [[Boxing the compass|direction]] of the air within this air current. They always occur in groups on the [[Windward and leeward|lee]] side of the [[terrain]] that triggers them. Sometimes, mountain waves can help to enhance precipitation amounts downwind of mountain ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaffin et al.|title=An Unexpectedly Heavy and Complex Snowfall Event across the Southern Appalachian Region|journal=Weather and Forecasting|date=2003|volume=18|issue=2|pages=224–235|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0434%282003%29018%3C0224%3AAUHACS%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |bibcode=2003WtFor..18..224G|doi=10.1175/1520-0434(2003)018&lt;0224:AUHACS&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a [[turbulent]] [[vortex]], with its [[rotation|axis of rotation]] parallel to the mountain range, is generated around the first [[Crest (physics)|trough]]; this is called a '''rotor'''. The strongest lee waves are produced when the [[lapse rate]] shows a stable layer above the obstruction, with an unstable layer above and below.&lt;ref name=Pagen&gt;{{cite book | last = Pagen | first = Dennis | title = Understanding the Sky | publisher = Sport Aviation Pubns | location = City | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-936310-10-3 | pages= 169–175 | quote= This is the ideal case, for an unstable layer below and above the stable layer create what can be described as a springboard for the stable layer to bounce on once the mountain begins the oscillation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic theory ==
[[File:Lee wave GFD lab.JPG|thumb|A fluid dynamics lab experiment illustrates flow past a mountain-shaped obstacle. Downstream wave crests radiate upwards with their group velocity pointing about 45° from horizontal. A downslope jet can be seen in the lee of the mountain, an area of lower pressure, enhanced turbulence, and periodic vertical displacement of fluid parcels. Vertical dye lines indicate effects are also felt upstream of the mountain, an area of higher pressure.]]
Lee waves are a form of [[Internal wave|internal gravity waves]] produced when stably [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] flow is forced over an obstacle. This disturbance elevates air parcels above their level of [[neutral buoyancy]]. Buoyancy restoring forces therefore act to excite vertical [[oscillation]] of the perturbed air parcels at the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency|Brunt-Väisäla frequency]], which for the atmosphere is:

&lt;math&gt;N = \sqrt{{g \over \theta_0}{d\theta_0 \over dz}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta_0(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical profile of [[potential temperature]].

Oscillations tilted off the vertical axis at an angle of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; will occur at a lower [[frequency]] of &lt;math&gt;N\cos{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;. These air parcel oscillations occur in concert, parallel to the wave fronts (lines of constant [[Phase (waves)|phase]]). These wave fronts represent extrema in the perturbed [[pressure]] field (i.e., lines of lowest and highest pressure), while the areas between wave fronts represent extrema in the perturbed [[buoyancy]] field (i.e., areas most rapidly gaining or losing buoyancy).

Energy is transmitted along the wave fronts (parallel to air parcel oscillations), which is the direction of the wave [[group velocity]]. In contrast, the phase propagation (or [[Phase velocity|phase speed]]) of the waves points perpendicular to energy transmission (or [[group velocity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atmosphere-ocean dynamics|last=Gill|first=Adrian E.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1982|isbn=9780122835223|edition=1|volume=|location=San Diego, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-935704-25-6_4|title=Atmospheric Processes over Complex Terrain|last=Durran|first=Dale R.|date=1990-01-01|publisher=American Meteorological Society|isbn=9781935704256|editor-last=Blumen|editor-first=William|series=Meteorological Monographs|pages=59–81|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-935704-25-6_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both lee waves and the rotor may be indicated by specific [[wave cloud]] formations if there is sufficient moisture in the atmosphere, and sufficient vertical displacement to cool the air to the [[dew point]]. Waves may also form in dry air without cloud markers.&lt;ref name=Pagen/&gt; Wave clouds do not move downwind as clouds usually do, but remain fixed in position relative to the obstruction that forms them.

* Around the [[Crest (physics)|crest]] of the wave, [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic expansion cooling]] can form a cloud in [[shape]] of a [[Lens (geometry)|lens]] ([[lenticular cloud|lenticularis]]). Multiple lenticular clouds can be stacked on top of each other if there are alternating layers of relatively dry and moist air aloft.
* The rotor may generate  [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] or [[cumulus fractus]] in its upwelling portion, also known as a "roll cloud". The rotor cloud looks like a line of cumulus. It forms on the lee side and parallel to the ridge line.  Its base is near the height of the mountain peak, though the top can extend well above the peak and can merge with the lenticular clouds above. Rotor clouds have ragged leeward edges and are dangerously turbulent.&lt;ref name=Pagen/&gt;
* A [[foehn]] wall cloud may exist at the lee side of the mountains, however this is not a reliable indication of the presence of lee waves.
* A [[pileus (meteorology)|pileus]] or cap cloud, similar to a lenticular cloud, may form above the mountain or cumulus cloud generating the wave.
* [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|Adiabatic compression heating]] in the trough of each wave oscillation may also [[evaporate]] [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] or [[stratus cloud]]s in the [[airmass]], creating a "wave window" or "Foehn gap".

==Aviation==

Lee waves provide a possibility for [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] to gain [[altitude]] or fly long distances when [[Gliding|soaring]]. World record wave flight performances for speed, distance or altitude have been made in the lee of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], [[Alps]], [[Patagonia|Patagonic]] [[Andes]], and [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] mountain ranges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://records.fai.org/gliding/ FAI gliding records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205015245/http://records.fai.org/gliding/ |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Perlan Project]] is working to demonstrate the viability of climbing above the [[tropopause]] in an unpowered glider using lee waves, making the transition into [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] standing waves. They did this for the first time on August 30, 2006 in [[Argentina]], climbing to an altitude of {{convert|15460|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=14043 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413093412/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=14043 |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perlanproject.com/ Perlan Project]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mountain Wave Project]] of the [[Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile]] focusses on analysis and classification of lee waves and associated rotors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/ostiv/projects.htm OSTIV-Mountain Wave Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MWP"&gt;[http://mwp.flightplanner.info/Defaultengl.htm] – accessed 2009-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

The conditions favoring strong lee waves suitable for soaring are:

* A gradual increase in windspeed with altitude
* Wind direction within 30° of perpendicular to the mountain ridgeline
* Strong low-altitude winds in a stable atmosphere
* Ridgetop winds of at least 20 knots

The rotor turbulence may be harmful for other small [[aircraft]] such as [[balloon#Balloons as flying machines|balloon]]s, [[hang glider]]s and [[Paragliding|paraglider]]s. It can even be a hazard for large aircraft; the phenomenon is believed responsible for many [[aviation accidents and incidents]], including the in-flight breakup of [[BOAC Flight 911]], a [[Boeing 707]], near [[Mt. Fuji]], [[Japan]] in 1966, and the in-flight separation of an engine on an [[Evergreen International Airlines]] [[Boeing 747]] cargo jet near [[Anchorage, Alaska]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AAR9306.aspx NTSB Accident Report AAR-93-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rising air of the wave, which allows gliders to climb to great heights, can also result in high altitude upset in jet aircraft trying to maintain level cruising flight in lee waves. Rising, descending or turbulent air in or above the lee waves can cause [[Overspeed (aircraft)|overspeed]] or [[Stall (flight)|stall]], resulting in [[mach tuck]] and loss of control, especially when the aircraft is operated near the "[[Coffin corner (aviation)|coffin corner]]".

==Other varieties of atmospheric waves==
[[File:Hydrostatic.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Hydrostatic wave (schematic drawing)]]

There are a variety of distinctive types of waves which form under different atmospheric conditions.

* ''[[Wind shear]]'' can also create waves. This occurs when an [[atmospheric inversion]] separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction. If the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by [[thermal]]s coming up from below, it will create significant shear waves in the lee of the distortions that can be used for soaring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Hydraulic jump induced waves'' are a type of wave that forms when there exists a lower layer of air which is dense, yet thin relative to the size of the mountain.  After flowing over the mountain, a type of shock wave forms at the trough of the flow, and a sharp vertical discontinuity called the [[hydraulic jump]] forms which can be several times higher than the mountain.  The hydraulic jump is similar to a rotor in that it is very turbulent, yet it is not as spatially localized as a rotor.  The hydraulic jump itself acts as an obstruction for the stable layer of air moving above it, thereby triggering wave.  Hydraulic jumps can distinguished by their towering roll clouds, and have been observed on the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range&lt;ref name="Kuettner+Hertenstein"&gt;[http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/40363.pdf Observations of Mountain-Induced Rotors and Related Hypotheses: a Review] by Joachim Kuettner and Rolf F. Hertenstein&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mountain ranges in southern California.
* ''Hydrostatic waves'' are vertically propagating waves which form over spatially large obstructions.  In hydrostatic equilibrium, the pressure of a fluid can depend only on altitude, not on horizontal displacement.  Hydrostatic waves get their name from the fact that they approximately obey the laws of hydrostatics, i.e. pressure amplitudes vary primarily in the vertical direction instead of the horizontal.  Whereas conventional, non-hydrostatic waves are characterized by horizontal undulations of lift and sink, largely independent of altitude, hydrostatic waves are characterized by undulations of lift and sink at different altitudes over the same ground position.
* ''[[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]]'' can occur when velocity shear is present within a continuous fluid or when there is sufficient velocity difference across the interface between two fluids.
* ''[[Rossby wave]]s'' (or planetary waves) are large-scale motions in the atmosphere whose restoring force is the variation in Coriolis effect with latitude.

Below is the '''list of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2015'''.

== Timeline of known close approaches less than one lunar distance from Earth in 2015 ==
A list of known [[near-Earth asteroid]] close approaches less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] (384,400 [[Kilometre|km]] or 0.00256 [[astronomical unit|AU]]) from Earth in 2015.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a list of current Earth close approaches see [http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca NEO Earth Close Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note this data does not include any of the [[List_of_bolides|43 objects that collided with earth in 2015]], none of which were discovered in advance, but were recorded by sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices (of the 43 objects detected, 2 had an impact energy greater than that of a 1 kiloton device) &lt;ref&gt;https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{color box|#ff9999}} Rows highlighted red indicate objects which were not discovered until after closest approach

{{color box|#ffff99}} Rows highlighted yellow indicate objects discovered less than 24 hours before closest approach

{{color box|#99ff99}} Rows highlighted green indicate objects discovered more than one week before closest approach (in 2015 only one object was detected on approach this far in advance, {{mpl|2015 XY|261}})

{{color box|#79d8ff}} Rows highlighted blue indicate objects discovered more than one year before closest approach i.e. objects successfully cataloged on a previous orbit, rather than being detected during approach (in 2015 no objects were detected this far in advance)

*{{mpl|2015 HM|10}} (~80 meters in diameter) passed 1.15 lunar distances (440,000&amp;nbsp;km) (1.08 lunar distances from the Moon) (410,000&amp;nbsp;km) on 7 July 2015.
*{{mp|2015 TQ|21}} (~15 meters in diameter) passed 1.005 lunar distances (390,000&amp;nbsp;km) on 7 October 2015
*2014 UR (~20 meters in diameter) passed 3.81 lunar distances (1.46 million km) from Earth on 18 October 2015.
*{{mpl|2015 TB|145}} (~600 meters in diameter) passed 1.3 lunar distances (480,000&amp;nbsp;km) (0.74 lunar distances from the Moon) (286,000&amp;nbsp;km) on 31 October 2015.
*{{mp|2015 VO|142}} (~6 meters in diameter) passed 1.02 lunar distances (393,000&amp;nbsp;km) (0.85 lunar distances from the Moon) (327,000&amp;nbsp;km) on 24 November 2015
*[[Sentry (monitoring system)|Risk-listed]] asteroid {{mpl|2007 VE|191}} (~60 meters in diameter) was not observed when it probably passed roughly {{convert|0.5|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth on 27 November 2015.
*[[2015 YB]] initially calculated to make a close approach to Earth on 19 December 2015 turned out to be a much further away inner main-belt asteroid. On 31 December 2015 the asteroid received the designation {{mpl|2015 YU|9}}.

== Timeline of close approaches less than one Lunar distance from the Moon in 2015 ==
The number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids approaching Earth for several reasons:
* Asteroids approaching Earth not only move faster, but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern surveys due to these factors
* Asteroids approaching closer to Earth are higher priority to confirm, and only confirmed asteroids are listed with a lunocentric approach distance
* Those which make close approaches to the Moon are frequently lost in its glare, making them harder to confirm, and are more easily discovered during the new Moon, when the Moon is too close to the Sun for any asteroids to be detected while they are near to the Moon anyway.

These factors combined severely limit the amount of Moon-approaching asteroids, to a level many times lower than the detected asteroids to pass just as close to Earth instead.

As a global food source, the most important edible seeds by weight are [[cereal]]s, followed by [[legume]]s and then [[List of culinary nuts|nut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=Babasaheb|title=Handbook of Nutrition and Diet|page=196|publisher=CRC Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cereals and legumes correspond with the [[Family (biology)|botanical families]] [[Poaceae]] and [[Fabaceae]], respectively, while nuts, [[pseudocereal]]s, and other seeds form [[polyphyly|polyphylic]] groups based on their culinary roles.

== Cereals ==
A [[cereal]], also called a cereal grain or simply a [[grain]], is the edible seed of a [[grass]], a [[plant]] in the [[Poaceae]] family. Cereals can be consumed in a variety of ways, all of which require [[Husk|husking]] and cooking, including [[Groat (grain)|whole]], rolled, [[Puffed grain|puffed]], or [[Mill (grinding)|ground]] into [[flour]]. Many cereals are present or past [[staple food]]s, providing a large fraction of the calories in the places in which they are eaten. Today, cereals provide almost half of all calories consumed in the world.&lt;ref name="prodstat"&gt;{{cite web

=== Pseudocereals ===
A [[pseudocereal]], or pseudocereal grain, is the edible seed of a pseudocereal, one of a polyphylic group of plants that produce seeds that resemble those of cereals. Pseudocereals are used in many of the same ways as cereals.

This page contains a sortable table listing all major [[mountain]]s and [[hill]]s of [[Switzerland]]. The table includes all [[summit]]s that have a [[topographic prominence]] of at least {{convert|300|m|ft|0}}, regardless of [[elevation|absolute height]] or other merit, ranking them by height and prominence. For a list of mountains with lower prominence, see [[List of mountains of Switzerland above 3000 m]] and [[List of highest mountains of Switzerland|List of mountains of Switzerland above 3600 m]]. For a list of mountains including [[topographic isolation]], see [[List of most isolated mountains of Switzerland]].

Along with [[List of lakes of Switzerland|the lakes]], mountains constitute a major natural feature of Switzerland with [[List of Swiss cantons by elevation|most of the cantons]] having summits exceeding {{convert|2000|m|ft|-3}} and three of them having summits exceeding {{convert|4000|m|ft|-3}}. The two main [[mountain range]]s are the [[Alps]] (south and east) and the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] (north and west), separated by the [[Swiss Plateau]] which also includes a large number of hills. Topographically, the three most important summits of Switzerland are those of [[Monte Rosa]] (most [[Elevation|elevated]]), the [[Finsteraarhorn]] (most [[Topographic prominence|prominent]]) and [[Piz Bernina]] (most [[Topographic isolation|isolated]]).&lt;!--Elevation, prominence and isolation are the first three parametres in the mountain infobox--&gt;

==Criteria==
The [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] defines a summit in the Alps as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a prominence/drop of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the "key col"). There are over 4400 such summits exceeding 2000 m in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Thöni, [http://www.gipfelverzeichnis.ch Directory of the mountains of Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, traditionally a prominence of at least 300 m, or 10 times the aforementioned criterion value, has been used.&lt;!-- an old reference for that would be nice--&gt; Inclusion based on prominence is expedient for its objectivity and verifiability, but has its drawbacks. For example, an impressive mountain peak dominating a valley may be connected via long high ridges to a barely higher hidden summit. Among the better-known peaks absent from this list are [[Fletschhorn]] ([[Lagginhorn]]), [[Mont Blanc de Cheilon]] ([[Ruinette]]), [[Nadelhorn]] and [[Täschhorn]] ([[Dom (mountain)|Dom]]), [[Piz d'Err]] ([[Piz Calderas]]), [[Piz Badile]] ([[Piz Cengalo]]) and [[Piz Palü]] ([[Piz Zupò]]).

{{wide image|2007-10 Monte Rosa.jpg|800px|[[Monte Rosa]], the highest mountain of Switzerland, has several subsidiary summits. Only the Dufourspitze, its main peak, is included in the list.}}

==Accuracy==
All mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-[[scale (map)|scale]] maps available.&lt;ref name=maps&gt;All mountain heights and prominences are from the 1:25,000 [[Swisstopo]] topographic maps. Key cols of mountains above 2500 m were verified using the [[SRTM]] data based contour lines in the terrain view of [[Google maps]].&lt;/ref&gt;
However, heights sometime conflict on different scales. For example, the [[Fletschhorn]] is indicated to be 3993, 3982, and 3984.5 m high on the 1:100'000, 1:50'000 and 1:25'000 [[National Maps of Switzerland|Swisstopo map]], respectively. The (rounded) elevation given by the largest scale map is always used in this table.
Also, the deepest points in connecting ridges are not always survey points with spot elevations, so that heights have to be estimated from contour lines. For example, maps often provide heights for the place where a route passes over a ridge rather than for the lowest point of that pass.

Finally, many height indications on these maps may be not up-to-date, while glacier and firn melt has decreased the height of both peaks and key cols, quite dramatically. For example, until 2009, the Col des Maisons Blanches which lies on the [[Corbassière Glacier]] was measured to be 3,418 m, while the more recent maps (2012) show it to be 3,404 m high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |author=[[Swisstopo]] |title=Col des Maisons Blanches (1:25,000) |map= |date= |year=2009 |url=https://s.geo.admin.ch/63c404e0e2 |access-date=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key col for the [[Combin de Corbassière]] (3,716 m), which, thanks to the retreat of the glacier, now appears on the list with a prominence of 312 m.

==Distribution==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
The list contains 451 mountains with a prominence higher than 300 m, among which 24 are above 4000 m, 64 above 3500 m, 208 above 3000 m, 321 above 2500 m, 384 above 2000 m, 417 above 1500 m and 443 above 1000 m. The [[Arithmetic mean|average]] and [[median]] heights are respectively 2812 and 2956 m. Eight summits (sometimes called [[ultra-prominent peak]]s) have a prominence exceeding 1500 m, they are found in seven cantons. The great majority of the summits are located in the [[Alps]], the other being located in the [[Jura Mountains]]. On average, each summit is the culminating point of an area corresponding to 91.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is equivalent in term of density to approximately 1.09 summits per 100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan de Ferranti &amp; Eberhard Jurgalski, [http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/prominence.html Europe to R150m list]&lt;/ref&gt;

These 451 major summits are found in 22 different [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Out of 26 cantons. The cantons of [[Basel-Stadt]], [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] and [[Thurgau]] do not appear on the list.&lt;/ref&gt; 3 cantons ([[Valais]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] and [[Graubünden]]) have summits above 4000 m, 9 cantons have summits above 3000 m, 15 cantons have summits above 2000 m and 21 cantons have summits above 1000 m. Two cantons have more than 100 summits: Graubünden (152) and Valais (104), while eleven cantons have less than 10 summits. 82 of the summits are on cantonal borders, 2 of which being tripoints ([[Brienzer Rothorn]] and [[Säntis]]). A number of mountains (e.g. [[Titlis]], [[Chasseral]], [[Lägern]]) straddle borders as well, but have their summit on one side of the border. In the list, only the exact location of the culminating point of the mountain is considered.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The list excludes [[Aiguille du Chardonnet]] (France), [[Corno di Dosdè]] (Italy), [[Drei Türme]] (Austria), [[Mont d'Or (Jura Mountains)|Mont d'Or]] (France), [[Sasso Gordona]] (Italy) and [[Sighignola]] (Italy) although they are all partially located in Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

!First&lt;ref&gt;The three main sources for first ascent data are:&lt;br/&gt;For the Western Alps; [[W.A.B. Coolidge]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=df4OAAAAQAAJ The Alps in nature and history], Methuen &amp; Co, London, 1908.&lt;br/&gt;For the Central Alps; [[Gottlieb Studer]], ''Über Eis und Schnee: Die höchsten Gipfel der Schweiz und die Geschichte ihrer Besteigung,'' Volumes 1-3, Schmid &amp; Francke, Bern, 1896-1899.&lt;br/&gt;For the Eastern Alps: ''Die Erschließung der Ostalpen'', Volumes 1-3, German and Austrian Alpine Club, Berlin, 1894.&lt;br/&gt;Given are the years for the first recorded ascents. In many cases local people or surveyors made earlier ascents. In particular, chamois and ibex hunters are expected to have reached many summits. Years in italics indicate that it is known that an earlier ascent was made, for example by the presence of artifacts on top or the summit's prior use as a triangulation point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;ascent

This '''list of oil and gas fields of the North Sea''' contains links to [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] [[oil reservoir|reservoirs]] beneath the [[North Sea]]. In terms of the oil industry, "[[North Sea oil]]" often refers to a larger geographical set, including areas such as the Norwegian Sea and the UK "Atlantic Margin" (west of Shetland) which are not, strictly speaking, part of the North Sea. The UK list includes facilities in the Irish Sea.

==List of fields==
[[File:North sea eez.PNG|thumb|Map of exclusive economic zones]]

* Many fields in Quadrantrs P, Q, K, L, and some in blocks E, F

===United Kingdom===
====Onshore====
Onshore oil and gas resources in the UK are located in a number of provinces corresponding to prospective sedimentary basins. Provinces and Basins (from south to north) include the Wessex-Channel Basin, Weald Basin, Worcester Basin, Cheshire Basin, East Midlands Province, West Lancashire Basin, NE England Province, Northumberland-Solway Basin, Midland Valley of Scotland, and the Orcadian Basin. A list of current and historic UK onshore oil and gas fields is given in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;Onshore Oil and Gas, British Geographical Survey - Mineral Planning Factsheet, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Offshore ====
The UK continental shelf (UKCS) comprises six geographical and geological oil, gas and condensate regions: Southern North Sea (principally gas fields); Central North Sea (oil, condensate and gas fields); Moray Firth (oil and associated gas fields); Northern North Sea (oil and associated gas fields); West of Shetland (oil and associated gas); and the Irish Sea/Liverpool Bay (oil and gas). The fields and installations in the following list are allocated to regions corresponding to the [[Oil and Gas Authority]]'s listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/data-centre/data-downloads-and-publications/field-data/|title=Oil and Gas Authority field data|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Installation Identification'''

Oil and gas field names follow themes chosen by the companies who originally developed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snsbi.org.uk/Nomina_articles/Nomina_32_Young.pdf|title=Oil and gas field names in thee North Sea|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An offshore '''installation''' on the [[United Kingdom Continental Shelf|UK Continental Shelf]] may comprise a single integrated '''platform''' or two or more bridge-linked '''platforms'''. Installations are identified by a large black-on-yellow sign on the installation. This may give the name of the original or current owner or operator, the field name, and a set of numbers and letters, e.g. Shell/Esso Leman 49/26A. The numbers identify the Quadrant and Block where the installation is located, e.g. 49/26 is in Quadrant 49 Block 26.[[Bacton Gas Terminal#cite note-6|&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The first letter is a sequential letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) identifying each installation within a field. For installations in the Southern North Sea the second and subsequent letters may designate a platform's function, e.g. the Leman 49/26A complex comprises four bridge-linked platforms 49/26AP (Production), 49/26AD1 (Drilling 1), 49/26AD2 (Drilling 2), and 49/26AK (Compression). Common designations are:

Note: Drilling refers to the original function of the platform to support well drilling operations. No Southern North Sea installation has permanent drilling facilities.

On some installations the letters simply provide a unique two letter identity, e.g.Tethys TN, Viscount VO.

===== Southern North Sea gas fields =====
The Southern North Sea (SNS) comprises gas (plus associated condensate) fields. Themed field names comprise groups of fields that are geographically, operationally or commercially linked. Names are based on:
* Geographical location (Leman, Sole Pit, etc)
* Personal names (e.g. Audrey, Sean)
* ‘Lost’ east coast villages (Ravenspurn, Newsham, etc)
* Arthurian legend (e.g. Camelot, Excalibur, Guinevere)
* Planets and moons (Jupiter, Ganymede, etc.)
* Gemstones (Amethyst, Topaz)
* Scientists and inventors (e.g. Murdoch, Davy)
* Rivers (Tyne, Waveney, etc)
* Sailing vessels (e.g. Ketch, Schooner)
* Aircraft (Vulcan, Valliant, Victor, etc)
A full listing of UK Southern North Sea gas fields is given in the table below.

The SNS fields are serviced from [[Easington, East Riding of Yorkshire|Easington]], [[Lowestoft]], [[Hartlepool]], [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], [[Skegness]], [[Norwich Airport|Norwich airport]] and [[Humberside Airport|Humberside airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Amoco Southern North Sea Field Map dated 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conoco Southern North Sea Gas Operations Map dated 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perenco SNS Operations Map dated 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ConocoPhillips Southern North Sea Gas Operations Map dated 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shell ONEgas Facilities and Pipelines Schematic dated 1 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/data-centre/data-downloads-and-publications/field-data/|title=UK Oil and Gas Authority Field Data|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dalkey Island - Irish Sea prospect

=== [[Faroe Islands|Faroes]] ===

==== Offshore ====
* Various blocks licensed for exploration, several discoveries not yet developed{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

=== Iceland ===

==== Offshore ====
* Nothing published, but the idea is not inconceivable on the ridges extending towards Iceland from the Faroes and the East Greenland Coast

=== East Greenland ===

==== Onshore ====
* No prospects reported, though sediments analogous to the Mesozoic and Caenozoic deposits of the North Sea are known, so there is appreciable interest. Development would be formidably difficult, technically, logistically and politically.

==== Offshore ====
* A recent conference on hydrocarbon prospects in arctic Russia (Geological Society, London; February 2006) had several speakers mention major gas prospectivity on the East [[Greenland]] coast, but they cited no sources. A conference volume was due towards the end of 2006, which may elaborate.

=== Barents Sea ===

==== Onshore ====
* No significant prospects or potential

==== Offshore ====
* Significant exploration, appraisal and development. Major discoveries are the [[Snøhvit]] gasfield, operated by [[Statoil]] in the Norwegian sector and the [[Shtokman field|Stokhmanovskoye gasfield]] planned to be operated by [[Gazprom]] in the Russian sector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">Found in a single location on the earth’s surface, '''McNulty rhyolite''' is a comparatively rare gem [[rock (geology)]] quality U.S. variety of [[rhyolite]] rock. McNulty rhyolite appears in the official U.S. Department of Interior, United States Geological Survey ''Lexicon of Geological Names of the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexicon of Geological Names of the United States (Including Alaska)'' Part 2 M-Z (Geological Survey Bulletin 896) Mary Grace Wilmarth, compiler, p. 1260, United States Dept. of Interior, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1938) (Univ. of Mich., Digitized February 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiated from common rhyolite==
Rhyolite is an [[igneous]], [[volcanic rock]] of [[felsic]]. It often resembles [[granite]] and has the same basic [[mineral]] makeup; however, rhyolite’s origin is extrusive and not [[plutonic]]. Because it is so rich in silica, its melts or lavas, unlike those of [[basalt]], are highly viscous. In [[volcanic]] extrusion, rhyolite tends not to flow, but, rather to plug expanding gases until thrown off in eruption in release of the pent up force of the expansion. In the U.S. today, rhyolites are most commonly found in the west and southwest. Unlike granite, some few varieties of rhyolite, like McNulty rhyolite, are coveted by lapidaries as gem rocks, because of their identifying mineral [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s, interesting colors and flow banding. Other examples of varieties of rhyolite, suitable for use as gem rock (though both far, far more common than McNulty rhyolite), are “Wonderstone” and “Hichoryite”, which are together found in [[Mexico]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]] and [[New Mexico]].

==Brief description and source==
McNulty rhyolite (as per S.F. Simmons 1898) or McNulty Gulch rhyolite (as per W. Cross 1886), described by Cross as “Light-colored; numerous slightly pinkish quartz crystals, white glassy feldspars, and brown blotlte leaves, with subordinate ashen gray ground mass btw. them.”,&lt;ref&gt;again, ''Lexicon of Geological Names of the United States (Including Alaska)'' Part 2 M-Z (Geological Survey Bulletin 896) Mary Grace Wilmarth, compiler, p. 1260, United States Dept. of Interior, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1938) (Univ. of Mich., Digitized February 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; is found only in McNulty Gulch in [[Colorado]], United States. McNulty Gulch is a feature of granite porphyry&lt;ref&gt;Henry Stevens Washington ''Chemical Analysis of Igneous Rocks'' (USGS Professional Paper No. 14) Washington, D.C.: Govt. Printing Office (1903) p 163&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Leadville, Colorado]] in the U.S. Ten Mile Mining District.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Koschmann and M.H. Bergendahl ''Principal Gold Producing Districts of the United States'' (Geological Survey Professional Paper 610) Washington: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402 (1968) (Library of Congress catalog-card no. GS 68-341) p 117&lt;/ref&gt; The igneous rhyolites of McNulty Gulch formed in the mountain of Colorado’s Ten Mile Mining District later than the diorite and Lincoln porphyry there but earlier than the once rich silver ore deposits of the district’s Grand Union or Silver Bowl mine.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Lovering ''Geology and Ore Deposits of the Montezuma Quadrangle Colorado'' (Geological Survey Professional Paper 178) Washington: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. (1935) p 29&lt;/ref&gt; McNulty Gulch is an integral part of the western United States’ and Colorado’s gold rush history, being the 1861 site of one of the earliest gold finds in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;O.J. Hollister ''The mines of Colorado'' Springfield, Massachusetts: S. Bowles &amp; Co. (1867) p 326&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial gold placers in Colorado were only discovered by George A. Jackson in nearby areas of Colorado 2 years earlier in 1858. These discoveries precipitated a rush of prospectors into the surrounding mountains and the [[Colorado Gold Rush]] commenced. During 1858-67, Colorado produced about $14,924,000 in placer gold and about $10 million in lode gold at mid 19th century values.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Koschmann and M.H. Bergendahl ''Principal Gold Producing Districts of the United States'' (Geological Survey Professional Paper 610) Washington: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402 (1968) (Library of Congress catalog-card no. GS 68-341) p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed description==
In the United States Geological Survey description of the Ten Mile District Quadrangle, McNulty rhyolite rock is described thus “McNulty rhyolite. This is a fine-grained porphyritic rhyolite, light gray in color, with many small white feldspars and locally some small smoky quartz crystals. It is probably allied to the nevadite in time of eruption, or it may be later. It cuts both the Lincoln and the Quail diorite-porphyry. It occurs in small irregular masses in McNulty Gulch, and extends southward beyond the present quadrangle. In one mass above the Railroad Boy tunnel (45)* are small drusy cavities containing little tablets of tridymite.” [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gf/048/text.pdf]

''Not to be confused with [[archaea]], in spite of biological discussion commonly alluding to the only life forms of that era, e.g. microbes''

The '''Neoarchean''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|iː|oʊ|ɑr|ˈ|k|iː|ə|n}}; also spelled '''Neoarchaean''') is a [[geology|geologic]] [[era (geology)|era]] within the [[Archean|Archaean Eon]]. 

The Neoarchean spans the period from {{Ma|Neoarchean|Paleoproterozoic}}&amp;mdash;the period being defined [[Absolute dating|chronometrically]] and not referenced to a specific level in a rock section on [[Earth]]. 

== Complex life ==
During this era, oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved, releasing an abundance of oxygen, that first reacted with minerals and afterward was free to react with greenhouse gases of the atmosphere, leaving the Earth's surface free to radiate its energy to space. This is known as the [[oxygen catastrophe]] which was to happen later in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] from a poisonous buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere, released by these oxygen producing photoautotrophs, which evolved earlier in the Neoarchean.

== Continental formation ==
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
During this era, the supercontinent [[Kenorland]] formed at about {{Ma|2720}}.&lt;ref name="Bozhko2011"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On Two Types of Supercontinental Cyclicity | author=Bozhko, N.

The '''Patagonian grasslands''' (NT0804) is an [[ecoregion]] in the south of Chile, Argentina and the [[Falkland Islands]]. The grasslands are home to diverse fauna, including several rare or endemic species of birds. There are few protected areas. The grasslands are threatened by [[overgrazing]] by sheep, which supply high-quality merino wool. Efforts are being made to develop sustainable grazing practices to avoid [[desertification]].

==Location==
{{location map|Argentina|relief=yes|lat_deg=-52.833 |lon_deg=-69.179  |caption=Location in Argentina|width=220px}}
The Patagonian grasslands extend across eastern [[Tierra del Fuego]] in Chile and Argentina from near the southern cone, and cover part of [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]] just north of the [[Strait of Magellan]] up to the [[Gallegos River]].
They also include the Falkland Islands.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}{{efn|The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) "WildFinder" application shows the grasslands as part of the [[Patagonian steppe]].{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}} This is inconsistent with the WWF's detailed description of the grasslands as a separate ecoregion.{{sfn|Dellafiore}} However, the term "Patagonian grasslands" may be used to cover all grasslands in [[Patagonia]], including the steppe and the more southern parts.{{sfn|Cibils|2005|p=123}} This article takes the narrow definition of the WWF NT0804 ecoregion.}}
To the north the grasslands adjoin the [[Patagonian steppe]] ecoregion.{{sfn|Dellafiore|(b)}}
To the west they adjoin the [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregion.{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

==Physical==

The ecoregion in South America is divided into a northern mainland section and southern Tierra del Fuego Island section by the Strait of Magellan.
The grasslands cover terrain of low mountains, plateaus and plains.
The soils are rich, with high levels of organic material.
Average annual rainfall is {{convert|300|to|400|mm}}.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}
Mean temperatures in the far south of Tierra del Fuego are {{convert|5.4|C}}, but temperatures may fall below {{convert|-20|C}}.{{sfn|Cibils|2005|p=125}}

The ecoregion holds important wetlands including the Tero marsh and lagoons, Rio Pelque marsh, Lago Argentino, Puerto Bandera lagoons, Lake Viedma, Meseta del Tobiana lagoons and Escarchados lagoons. 
In the coastal region important wetlands include Río Santa Cruz, Monte León, Río Coig, Ría Gallegos, Cabo Vígenes, Bahía San Sebastián, Río Grande, Mitre Peninsula, Beagle Canal and Isla of the Estados.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

==Ecology==

The Patagonian Grasslands are in the [[neotropical realm]], in the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

===Flora===

The northern part of the ecoregion is covered by tundra grasslands.
In the center there are high latitude Andean meadows and in the far south there are deciduous thickets.
On the Falkland Islands there are swamp forests.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

The vegetation is mostly grass-steppe with scattered shrubs.
Species include ''[[Festuca pallescens]]'', ''[[Senecio patagonicus]]'' and ''[[Plantago maritima]]''. 
Species found in saline soils near the sea include ''[[Atriplex reichei]]'' and ''[[Lepidophyllum cupressiforme]]''. 
Common genera include [[Adesmia (plant)|Adesmia]], [[Anarthrophyllum]], [[Berberis]], [[Chuquiraga]], [[Lycium]], [[Mulinum]], [[Schinus]] and [[Verbena]].
The dominant species in the steppe of Tierra del Fuego is the perennial grass ''[[Festuca gracillima]]''.
Other grasses include ''[[Poa atropidiformis]]'', [[Trisetum]] species and ''[[Hordeum comosum]]''. 
The most common plant in the valley floors and plains is ''Hordeum comosum'', interspersed with ''[[Alopecurus antarticus]]'', ''[[Phleum conmutatus]]'', ''[[Poa pratensis]]'' and [[Agrosti]] species.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

===Fauna===
[[File:Macá tobiano sobre vinagrilla en lago de la patagonia Argentina.jpg|thumb|The critically endangered [[hooded grebe]] ]]
The region holds very diverse fauna.
Mammals include [[Patagonian mara]] (''Dolichotis patagonum''), [[southern viscacha]] (''Lagidium viscacia''), [[Wolffsohn's viscacha]] (''Lagidium wolffsohni''), [[Patagonian weasel]] (''Lyncodon patagonicus''), [[Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk]] (''Conepatus humboldtii''), [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), [[Falkland Islands wolf]] (''Dusicyon australis'') and [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe'').
Threatened species include [[Patagonian mara]] (''Dolichotis patagonum''), guanaco, [[South American gray fox]] (''Lycalopex griseus'') and [[South American fur seal]] (''Arctocephalus australis'').{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

Bird include [[Darwin's rhea]] (''Rhea pennata''), [[Patagonian tinamou]] (''Tinamotis ingoufi''), [[black-chested buzzard-eagle]] (''Geranoaetus melanoleucus''), [[peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus''), [[band-winged nightjar]] (''Systellura longirostris''), [[Patagonian mockingbird]] (''Mimus patagonicus'') and [[Patagonian yellow finch]] (''Sicalis lebruni'').
Endemic birds found north of the strait include [[hooded grebe]] (''Podiceps gallardoi''), [[Magellanic plover]] (''Pluvianellus socialis''), [[chocolate-vented tyrant]] (''Neoxolmis rufiventris''), [[white-bridled finch]] (''Melanodera melanodera''), [[short-billed miner]] (''Geositta antarctica''), [[ruddy-headed goose]] (''Chloephaga rubidiceps'') and [[striated caracara]] (''Phalcoboenus australis'').{{sfn|Dellafiore}}
The [[striated caracara]] (''Phalcoboenus australis'') and [[blackish cinclodes]] (''Cinclodes antarcticus'') are found in Tierra del Fuego. 
Endemic birds in the Falklands are the [[Falkland steamer duck]] (''Tachyeres brachypterus'') and [[Cobb's wren]] (''Troglodytes cobbi''). 
The Falklands are also important for seabirds such as [[gentoo penguin]] (''Pygoscelis papua'').{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

==Status==
[[File:Upland.jpg|thumb|Grassland in the [[Falkland Islands]] ]]
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] gives the ecoregion a status of "Vulnerable".
Few people live in the ecoregion.
However, grazing livestock and introduced animals have destroyed the natural grassland, particularly tussock grass.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}
Where the sparse vegetation has been damaged the soil is exposed to erosion.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}
Overgrazing by [[merino]] sheep is turning the grassland into a desert.{{sfn|Nogues|2010}}
In the past Guanacos were the only large grazing animal, and imposed little stress on the semi-arid grasslands.
Commercial sheep farming, which began at the end of the 19th century, has had a drastic impact.
Palatable grasses have been progressively eliminated, replaced by unpalatable woody plants.{{sfn|Cibils|2005|p=121}}

The natural tussock grass is an important resource for endemic birds.
Three birds species at risk are the critically endangered [[hooded grebe]] (''Podiceps gallardoi''), the rare [[ruddy-headed goose]] (''Chloephaga rubidiceps'') and the near threatened [[striated caracara]] (''Phalcoboenus australis''), which has suffered from over-hunting.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}

==Conservation==

The ecoregion has few protected areas.
They include [[Dicky Private Wildlife Reserve]] (''Refugio Privado de Vida Silvestre Dicky'') and [[Magallanes National Reserve]] on the mainland, and [[Reserva Costa Atlántica]] in Tierra del Fuego.{{sfn|Dellafiore}}
The Patagonian Grasslands of Argentina Conservation Project, organized by [[The Nature Conservancy]], is trying to develop sustainable grazing practices in partnership with scientists and landowners, but it is a challenge to find economic incentives.{{sfn|Nogues|2010}}
An Argentine company has worked with The Nature Conservancy to develop protocols and measurements for sustainable grazing, which can be used in branding clothes made of Patagonian wool. The theory, which is controversial, is that if sheep are moved frequently to emulate herds of wild animals avoiding predators they may actually help regenerate the grasslands.
The decisions on where and how fast to move them depend on many ecological factors, and some academics are skeptical about whether real benefits can be achieved.{{sfn|Winninghoff|2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10939">[[File:Point bar and cut bank.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cut bank (geology)|Cut bank]] erosion and point bar deposition as seen on the [[Powder River (Montana)|Powder River]] in [[Montana]].]]
A '''point bar''' is a depositional feature made of [[alluvium]] that accumulates on the inside bend of [[streams]] and [[river]]s below the [[slip-off slope]]. Point bars are found in abundance in mature or [[meander]]ing streams.  They are crescent-shaped and located on the inside of a stream bend, being very similar to, though often smaller than, [[towheads]], or river islands.  

Point bars are composed of sediment that is [[well sorted]] and typically reflects the overall capacity of the stream. They also have a very gentle ''slope'' and an [[elevation]] very close to water level. Since they are low-lying, they are often overtaken by [[floods]] and can accumulate driftwood and other debris during times of high water levels. Due to their near flat [[topography]] and the fact that the water speed is slow in the shallows of the  point bar they are popular rest stops for boaters and rafters.   However, camping on a point bar can be dangerous as a [[flash flood]] that raises the stream level by as little as a few inches (centimetres) can overwhelm a campsite in moments.

A point bar is an area of [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] whereas a [[cut bank]] is an area of [[bank erosion|erosion]].

Point bars are formed as the [[Secondary flow#River bends|secondary flow]] of the stream sweeps and rolls sand, gravel and small stones laterally across the floor of the stream and up the shallow sloping floor of the point bar.

Any fluid, including water in a stream, can only flow around a bend in [[vortex]] flow.&lt;ref&gt;"In the absence of secondary flow, bend flow seeks to conserve angular momentum so that it tends to conform to that of a free vortex with high velocity at the smaller radius of the inner bank and lower velocity at the outer bank where radial acceleration is lower."

&lt;/ref&gt;  In vortex flow the speed of the fluid is fastest where the radius of the flow is smallest, and slowest where the radius is greatest.  ([[Tropical cyclones]], [[tornado]]es, and the spinning motion of water as it escapes down a drain are all visible examples of vortex flow.)  In the case of water flowing around a bend in a stream the [[Secondary flow#River bends|secondary flow]] in the [[boundary layer]] along the floor of the stream does not flow parallel to the banks of the stream but flows partly across the floor of the stream toward the inside of the stream (where the radius of curvature is smallest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chant|first1=R.

&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be demonstrated at home.  Partly fill a circular bowl or cup with water and sprinkle a little sand, rice or sugar into the water.  Set the water in circular motion with a  hand or spoon.  The [[Secondary flow#Circular flow in a bowl or cup|secondary flow]] will quickly sweep the solid particles into a neat pile in the center of the bowl or cup.  The primary flow (the vortex) might be expected to sweep the solid particles to the perimeter of the bowl or cup, but instead the [[secondary flow]] along the floor of the bowl or cup sweeps the particles toward the center.

Where a stream is following a straight course the slower boundary layer along the floor of the stream is also following the same straight course.  It sweeps and rolls sand, gravel and polished stones downstream, along the floor of the stream.  However, as the stream enters a bend and vortex flow commences as the primary flow, a secondary flow also commences and flows partly across the floor of the stream toward the convex bank (the bank with the smaller radius).  Sand, gravel and polished stones that have travelled with the stream for a great distance where the stream was following a straight course may finally come to rest in the point bar of the first stream bend.

Due to the circular path of a stream around a bend the surface of the water is slightly higher near the concave bank (the bank  with the larger radius) than near the convex bank.  This slight slope on the water surface of the stream causes a slightly greater water pressure on the floor of the stream near the concave bank than near the convex bank.  This pressure gradient drives the slower boundary layer across the floor of the stream toward the convex bank.  The pressure gradient is capable of driving the boundary layer up the shallow sloping floor of the point bar, causing sand, gravel and polished stones to be swept and rolled up-hill.

The concave bank is often a [[cut bank]] and an area of [[bank erosion|erosion]].  The eroded material is swept and rolled across the floor of the stream by the [[secondary flow]] and may be deposited on the point bar only a small distance downstream from its original location in the concave bank.

The point bar typically has a gently sloping floor with shallow water.  The shallow water is mostly the accumulated boundary layer and does not have a fast speed.  However, in the deepest parts of the stream where the stream is flowing freely, vortex flow prevails and the stream is flowing fastest where the radius of the bend is smallest, and slowest where the radius is greatest.  The shallows around the point bar can become treacherous when the stream is rising.  As the water depth increases over the shallows of the point bar, the vortex flow can extend closer toward the convex bank and the water speed at any point can increase dramatically in response to only a small increase in water depth.

==Fallacy regarding formation of point bars==
An old fallacy exists regarding the formation of point bars and [[oxbow lake]]s which suggests they are formed by the [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] (dropping) of a watercourse's [[suspended load]] claiming the velocity and energy of the stream ''decreases'' toward the inside of a bend.   This fallacy relies on the erroneous notion that the momentum of the water is "always" slowest on the inside of the bend (where the radius is smallest) and fastest on the outside of the bend (where the radius is greatest), which ignores its increased [[angular momentum]].

Mass deposition of suspended solids rarely occurs on one bank save in [[tide|tidal estuaries]]; instead, [[vortex]] flow being faster on the inner bank compensates for the greater height and therefore mass of water flowing downstream along the concave bank, and the rough, shallow bed usually provides per liter of water above more [[Suspension_(chemistry)|agitation to maintain any suspended particles]].  Any relatively steady gradient open flow not met with complex interactions with contrary flows, such as tides, or major obstacles, flows around a bend in a simple model of vortex flow, with relatively few variables and [[coefficient]]s. 

All point bars typically have a gently sloping floor with shallow water.  Clearly a higher proportion of the water in very shallow water does much more work to overcome friction above and below (especially in a countervailing breeze) which lowers its speed, see [[Bernoulli%27s_principle|Bernouilli's principle]].  It is probably this close-quarters observation which led early geographers to believe in deposition by sedimentation of suspended matter rather than close-to-bed secondary currents.

In a steady-gradient section of a watercourse, sedimentation may occur where the water is saturated and the shallow bank has high flow resistance but does not agitate the suspension.  Similarly, the fallacy has scant explanation as to why deposition occurs at a stream bend, and little or none occurs where the stream is following a straight course, with exception of a steep slope (river gradient) where the river has formed a natural [[cutting (transportation)|cut]] or waterfall and may then deposit some of its load at the point of meeting a less steep section e.g. great meander.

In the settled low-gradient parts of a meandering watercourse the water speed is slow, turbulence is low, and the water is not capable of holding coarse sand and gravel in suspension.  In contrast, point bars comprise coarse sand, gravel, polished stones and other submerged objects.  These materials have not been carried in suspension and then dropped on the point bar – they have been swept and rolled into place by the secondary flow that exists across the floor/bed in the vicinity of a stream bend, which will be intensified if there is [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] particularly from an irregular, scoured opposing bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowker|first=Kent A.|date=1988|title=Albert Einstein and Meandering Rivers|journal=Earth Science History|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.searchanddiscovery.net/documents/Einstein/albert.htm|accessdate=2016-07-01}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3088">The '''Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment Working Group''' ('''PAME''') is a subdivision of the [[Arctic Council]]. It is one of the six working groups that comprises the Council.

PAME was founded as part of the 1991 [[Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy]] and its work continued by the 1996 Ottawa Charter that also established the Arctic Council. PAME's headquarters are located in [[Akureyri]], [[Iceland]].

PAME deals with all Arctic Council activities that are related to the sustainable development of the Arctic region and the protection of the environment. It monitors the evolution of global and regional policies concerning the Arctic and the growth of traffic in the region. Where necessary, it makes recommendations for improvements. PAME works on projects that are approved every two years by the Arctic Council.  These  include polar action programmes and guidelines to make companies and nations worldwide aware of the possible consequences of their land or sea-based activities on the vulnerable Arctic marine environment.

In 2009 the working group released a major report on Arctic marine shipping, the [[Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment]], which analyses current and future trends in Arctic transport. PAME was asked to conduct this research after the 2004 [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]] had concluded that "Reduced sea ice is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.no/Topics/Polar-regions/Arctic-region/Polar-climate/Arctic-Climate-Change-and-Its-Impacts-/Marine-transportation- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025110/http://www.environment.no/Topics/Polar-regions/Arctic-region/Polar-climate/Arctic-Climate-Change-and-Its-Impacts-/Marine-transportation-/ |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Santa Marta páramo''' (NT1007) is an [[ecoregion]] containing [[páramo]] (high moorland) vegetation above the treeline in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The isolated position of the range has allowed unique species to evolve. Some are related to those found in Central America and the Caribbean coastal areas, and some to species from the Andes. The habitat is relatively stable, but has been drastically changed from the original by long-term human activity.

==Geography==
===Location===
The Santa Marta páramo has an area of {{convert|129,499|ha}}.
It covers the upper levels of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] in the north of Colombia.{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
This is a roughly triangular massif with its north side parallel to the [[Caribbean]] sea, the southwest side facing the swamps of the [[Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta]] and the southeast side facing the [[Serranía del Perijá]] mountains across the [[Cesar River|Cesar]] and [[Ranchería River|Ranchería]] river valleys.{{sfn|Carbono}}
The ecoregion is surrounded by the [[Santa Marta montane forests]] ecoregion, which in turn is surrounded by the [[Sinú Valley dry forests]] and [[Guajira-Baranquilla xeric scrub]] ecoregions.{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

===Physical===
[[File:Map of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.png|thumb|[[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] (left) and [[Serranía del Perijá]] (right)]]

The Santa Marta páramo is the most northern section of [[páramo]] (high moor) in South America.
The isolated Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta has an elevation of {{convert|5775|m}}.
The páramo is found between the treeline around {{convert|3300|m}} and the snowline around {{convert|5000|m}}, with some variations due to differences in slope, rainfall and exposure to the wind and sun. The area is almost all [[granodiorite]] from the [[Jurassic]] period.{{sfn|Carbono}}

===Climate===

The Köppen climate classification is "Cwb": warm temperate, winter dry, warm summer.{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}
Where the [[Northern Andean páramo]] is generally humid throughout the year with moisture delivered in the form of rain, clouds and fog as air masses are lifted up over the mountains, the Santa Marta páramo is similar to the [[Costa Rican páramo]] and [[Cordillera de Merida páramo]], where the northeast trade winds create a distinct dry season.{{sfn|Luteyn}}
Moist air currents rise every day and produce mist and rain.
Most rain falls in May and September.{{sfn|Carbono}}

At a sample location at coordinates {{coord|10.75|-73.75}} mean monthly temperatures ranged from {{convert|11.4|C}} in January to {{convert|13.8|C}} in June.
Yearly average temperature was about {{convert|13|C}}, with average minimum of {{convert|8|C}} and maximum of {{convert|18.5|C}}.
Average total rainfall was about {{convert|1800|mm}}.
Mean monthly rainfall varied from {{convert|33.3|mm}} in January to {{convert|245.2|mm}} in May, falling back to {{convert|115.2|mm}} in July and rising again to {{convert|304.5|mm}} in October.{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}

==Ecology==
The Santa Marta páramo ecoregion is in the [[Neotropical realm|neotropical]] realm, in the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] biome.{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
The ecoregion is part of the Northern Andean Paramo global ecoregion, which also includes the [[Cordillera Central páramo]], [[Cordillera de Merida páramo]] and [[Northern Andean páramo]] terrestrial ecoregions.
The plants and animals are adapted to the cold, dry conditions of the high peaks.
There is a high level of local endemism, particularly on the more isolated peaks.{{sfn|Northern Andean Paramo – WWF Global}}
The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta has been designated a [[Biosphere Reserve]] due to the endemic plants and animals, particularly at the higher levels.{{sfn|Carbono}}

===Origins===
{{location map|Colombia|relief=yes|lat_deg=10.827 |lon_deg=-73.667 |caption=Location in Colombia, isolated from the Andes cordillera|width=220px}}
The Andes began to rise in the [[Miocene]] epoch, but in the north did not reach their present height until the [[Pliocene]] during a period of strong volcanic activity between four and five million years ago.
This was the period when land rose above the tree line and the protopáramo vegetation was formed with new species of the ''[[Poaceae]]'', ''[[Cyperaceae]]'', ''[[Asteraceae]]'', ''[[Ericaceae]]'' and other families. 
During the later parts of the [[Quaternary]] epoch there were alternating glacial and interglacial periods, with short, cold and dry periods alternating with warmer and more humid periods.
The páramo belts moved lower and joined together in the cold periods, and moved higher into unconnected enclaves when the temperatures rose.
The result is a mix of species of [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Boreal climate|boreal]] origin with [[genus|genera]] that are found in most páramos, but many [[endemism|endemic]] species in the individual páramos.{{sfn|Worboys|Francis|Lockwood|2010|p=193}}

The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta páramo is isolated and has a unique composition of flora and fauna.{{sfn|Worboys|Francis|Lockwood|2010|p=193}}
The isolation has given time for endemic species to evolve including the [[Castenedia]] and [[Raouliopsis]] genera.
The species evolved from warm tropical species adapted to moist conditions and from Andean species that migrated along the eastern cordillera of Colombia.
The flora is closer to the flora of the [[Cordillera de Merida páramo]] and the [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]] than to the Northern Andean páramo.
It is descended from flora growing on land that was lifted to intermediate elevations in the early and middle [[Cenozoic]], and that differentiated when the land was lifted to high elevations during the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]].{{sfn|Carbono}}

A 2013 analysis of the páramo units in Colombia evaluated similarities between their endemic flora.{{sfn|Londoño |Cleef |Madriñán|2014|p=82}}
It found that the units naturally formed into five biogeographical provinces:{{sfn|Londoño |Cleef |Madriñán|2014|p=83–84}}
The definition of the Páramos del Norte province differs from the traditional grouping, where the Santa Marta páramo is treated as a separate ecoregion and the [[Serranía del Perijá|Perijá]] páramo is included in the Cordillera Oriental province. The flora of these two is closer to the Páramos de Chirripó of Central America than to the rest of the Northern Andean páramo, despite their being separated by the [[Cesar River]] valley.{{sfn|Londoño |Cleef |Madriñán|2014|p=84}}

===Flora===

[[File:Hypochaeris sissiliflora - Flickr - Dick Culbert.jpg|thumb|Chikku Chikku (''[[Hypochaeris sessiliflora]]'') ]]
The páramo contains high altitude [[Tussock (grass)|tussock grassland]], thicket, bogs and marshes.{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
Vegetation on the northern side receives more rain and is rougher than the vegetation on the southern side, which is protected from the trade winds.{{sfn|Carbono}}
125 species of angiosperms have been recorded that are endemic to the Sierra Nevada, of which 61 are found only in the páramo.
135 genera of vascular plants have been recorded.
''[[Raouliopsis]]'' and ''[[Obtegomeria]]'' are endemic.
''[[Pentacalia]]''  has 8 of its 11 endemic species that grow only in the páramo.
''[[Diplostephium]]'' has 9 of its 10 endemic species that grow only in the páramo.
Other genera with species endemic to the páramo include ''[[Micropleura]]'', ''[[Niphogetum]]'', ''[[Perissocaelum]]'' and ''[[Cotopaxia]]''.{{sfn|Carbono}}

The vegetation has strips of typical páramo vegetation formations.
The lowest "subpáramo" strip along the Andean [[Woodland edge|forest margin]] is more shrubby.
Flora include ''[[Calamagrostis effusa]]'', ''[[Arcytophyllum nitidum]]'', ''[[Stevia lucida]]'', ''[[Escallonia myrtilloides]]'', ''[[Hesperomeles lanuginosa]]''.{{sfn|Carbono}}
The central strip of true páramo has more open [[shrubland]]s with low shrubs.
Open areas contain ''[[Acaena cylindrostachya]]'', ''[[Castilleja fissifolia]]'' and ''[[Lupinus carrikeri]]''. 
Shrubs found in protected valleys and rocky slopes include ''[[Lachemilla polylepis]]'', ''[[Simplocos nivalis]]'' and ''[[Obtegomeria caerulescens]]''.
Swamps and the margins of glacial lakes have clumps of ''[[Azorella crenata]]'' and rosettes of ''[[Hypochaeris sessiliflora]]''.{{sfn|Carbono}}
Water plants include ''[[Callitriche nubigena]]'' and ''[[Ranunculus limoseloides]]''. 
The upper "superpáramo" has scattered tussocks of grass.
There are patches of ''[[Raouliopsis seifrizii]]'' and ''[[Draba sanctae-marthae]]''.
Areas shielded from the wind hold ''[[Valeriana karstenii]]'' and ''[[Perissocaelum purdiei]]''.{{sfn|Carbono}}

===Fauna===
[[File:Atelopus carrikeri01.jpg|thumb|[[Guajira stubfoot toad]] (''Atelopus carrikeri''), a critically endangered endemic species{{sfn|Acosta-Galvis et al. 2010}}]]

Endemic mammals include subspecies of the [[red brocket]] (''Mazama americana carrikeri''), and the [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor bangsi'').{{sfn|Carbono}}
Endangered amphibians include ''[[Atelopus arsyecue]]'', [[Guajira stubfoot toad]] (''Atelopus carrikeri'') and Boulenger's backpack frog (''[[Cryptobatrachus boulengeri]]'').{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}
Birds include the [[Andean condor]] (''Vultur gryphus''), [[rufous-collared sparrow]] (''Zonotrichia capensis'') and [[Jameson's snipe]] (''Gallinago jamesoni'').{{sfn|Carbono}}
Endangered birds include the [[Santa Marta bush tyrant]] (''Myiotheretes pernix'') and [[black-backed thornbill]] (''Ramphomicron dorsale'').{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}

==Status==

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] gives a status of "Relatively Stable/Intact".
The páramo is expanding as the Andean forest at lower levels is cleared and the glaciers recede in the upper areas.{{sfn|Carbono}}
The ecoregion is protected by the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Park]].{{sfn|Santa Marta páramo – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
The growing populations of [[Kogi people|Kogi]], [[Arsario]] and [[Arhuaco people|Arhuaco]] indigenous people have reserves that cover parts of the páramo and have special rights within the park.
They graze large herds of cattle and sheep up to elevations of {{convert|3800|m}}, and hunt cougars and condors to protect their livestock.
They extract wood for fuel and building.
In the subpáramo they have expanded the scrublands by burning and grow potatoes and onions.
These changes reduce biodiversity, change the balance of vegetation and increase erosion.{{sfn|Carbono}}

{{Other uses}}
A '''seiche''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ʃ}} {{respell|SAYSH|'}}) is a [[standing wave]] in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water.  Seiches and seiche-related phenomena have been observed on lakes, [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s, swimming pools, bays, harbours and seas. The key requirement for formation of a seiche is that the body of water be at least partially bounded, allowing the formation of the standing wave.

The term was promoted by the Swiss [[hydrology|hydrologist]] [[François-Alphonse Forel]] in 1890, who was the first to make scientific observations of the effect in [[Lake Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. H. |last=Darwin |authorlink=George Howard Darwin |title=The Tides and Kindred Phenomena in the Solar System |year=1898 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |pages=21–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word originates in a [[Swiss French]] dialect word that means "to sway back and forth", which had apparently long been used in the region to describe oscillations in alpine lakes.

Seiches in harbours can be caused by ''long period'' or ''[[infragravity waves]]'', which are due to [[subharmonic]] [[nonlinear]] wave interaction with the [[wind wave]]s, having periods longer than the accompanying wind-generated waves.&lt;ref name=Munk&gt;{{cite conference

[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|293px|thumb|right|A standing wave (black) depicted as a sum of two propagating waves traveling in opposite directions (blue and red).]]

==Causes and nature of seiches==
Seiches are often imperceptible to the naked eye, and observers in boats on the surface may not notice that a seiche is occurring due to the extremely long wavelengths.

The effect is caused by resonances in a body of water that has been disturbed by one or more factors, most often meteorological effects (wind and atmospheric pressure variations), seismic activity, or [[tsunami]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunamis are normally associated with earthquakes, but landslides, volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gravity]] always seeks to restore the horizontal surface of a body of liquid water, as this represents the configuration in which the water is in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]].

Vertical harmonic motion results, producing an impulse that travels the length of the basin at a velocity that depends on the depth of the water. The impulse is reflected back from the end of the basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce standing waves with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no vertical motion. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature.

The longest natural [[period (physics)|period]] of a seiche is the period associated with the fundamental resonance for the body of water—corresponding to the longest standing wave.  For a surface seiche in an enclosed rectangular body of water this can be estimated using Merian's formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Methuen |location=London |title=Dynamical oceanography |last=Proudman |first=J. |author-link=Joseph Proudman |year=1953 |oclc=223124129 |pages=§117 (p. 225) |nopp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. R. |last=Merian |title=Ueber die Bewegung tropfbarer Flüssigkeiten in Gefässen |language=German |trans-title=On the motion of drippable liquids in containers |type=thesis |publisher=Schweighauser |location=Basel |year=1828 |oclc=46229431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2L}{\sqrt{g h}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the longest natural period, ''L'' is the length, ''h'' the average depth of the body of water, and ''g'' the [[Earth's gravity|acceleration of gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;As an example, the period for a seiche wave in a body of water 10 meters deep and 5 kilometers long would be 1000 seconds or about 17 minutes, while a body about 300 km long (such as the [[Gulf of Finland]]) and somewhat deeper has a period closer to 12 hours.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher order harmonics are also observed. The period of the second harmonic will be half the natural period, the period of the third harmonic will be a third of the natural period, and so forth.

==Seiches around the world==
Seiches have been observed on both lakes and seas. The key requirement is that the body of water be partially constrained to allow formation of standing waves. Regularity of geometry is not required; even harbours with exceedingly irregular shapes are routinely observed to oscillate with very stable frequencies.

===Lake seiches===
Low rhythmic seiches are almost always present on larger lakes. They are usually unnoticeable among the common wave patterns, except during periods of unusual calm. [[Harbour]]s, [[Headlands and bays|bays]], and [[estuaries]] are often prone to small seiches with amplitudes of a few centimetres and periods of a few minutes.

Among other lakes well known for their regular seiches is New Zealand's [[Lake Wakatipu]], which varies its surface height at [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] by 20 centimetres in a 27-minute cycle. Seiches can also form in semi-enclosed seas; the [[North Sea]] often experiences a lengthwise seiche with a period of about 36 hours.
[[Image:Lake Erie water level.gif|thumb|right|450px|Differences in water level caused by a seiche on [[Lake Erie]], recorded between [[Buffalo, New York]] (''red'') and [[Toledo, Ohio]] (''blue'') on November 14, 2003]]

The [[National Weather Service]] issues low water advisories for portions of the Great Lakes when seiches of 2 feet or greater are likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pierce|first1=T.|title=MARINE AND COASTAL SERVICES ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS|url=http://www.weather.gov/directives/sym/pd01003001curr.pdf|publisher=[[National Weather Service]], Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services|accessdate=April 19, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517023653/http://www.weather.gov/directives/sym/pd01003001curr.pdf|archivedate=May 17, 2008|format=pdf|date=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Erie]] is particularly prone to wind-caused seiches because of its shallowness and its elongation on a northeast-southwest axis, which frequently matches the direction of prevailing winds and therefore maximises the [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] of those winds. These can lead to extreme seiches of up to {{convert|5|m|ft}} between the ends of the lake.

The effect is similar to a [[storm surge]] like that caused by hurricanes along ocean coasts, but the seiche effect can cause oscillation back and forth across the lake for some time. In 1954, [[Hurricane Hazel]] piled up water along the northwestern [[Lake Ontario]] shoreline near [[Toronto]], causing extensive flooding, and established a seiche that subsequently caused flooding along the south shore.

Lake seiches can occur very quickly: on July 13, 1995, a large seiche on [[Lake Superior]] caused the water level to fall and then rise again by three feet (one metre) within fifteen minutes, leaving some boats hanging from the docks on their mooring lines when the water retreated.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Korgen.

Lakes in seismically active areas, such as [[Lake Tahoe]] in [[California]]/[[Nevada]], are significantly at risk from seiches. Geological evidence indicates that the shores of Lake Tahoe may have been hit by seiches and tsunamis as much as {{convert|10|m|ft|1}} high in prehistoric times, and local researchers have called for the risk to be factored into emergency plans for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Kathryn|title=Tsunami!

[[Earthquake]]-generated seiches can be observed thousands of miles away from the epicentre of a quake. [[Swimming pools]] are especially prone to seiches caused by earthquakes, as the ground tremors often match the resonant frequencies of small bodies of water. The 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]] in [[California]] caused swimming pools to overflow across southern California.  The massive [[Good Friday earthquake]] that hit [[Alaska]] in 1964 caused seiches in swimming pools as far away as [[Puerto Rico]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}. The [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake that hit Lisbon, Portugal]] in 1755 caused seiches 2,000 miles (3,000&amp;nbsp;km) away in Loch Lomond, Loch Long, Loch Katrine and Loch Ness in [[Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seismic Seiches|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/seiche.php|website=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program|publisher=Abridged from Earthquake Information Bulletin, January–February 1976, Volume 8, Number 1.|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[canal]]s in [[Sweden]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] caused seiches in standing water bodies in many Indian states  as well as in [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and northern [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;In fact, "one person drowned in a pond as a result of a seiche in Nadia, West Bengal". {{cite web|title=26 December 2004, M9.1 "Boxing Day" Earthquake &amp; Tsunami/Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake/Indian Ocean Tsunami|url=http://asc-india.org/lib/20041226-sumatra.htm|website=Amateur Seismic Centre|accessdate=19 April 2017|location=Pune|date=22 Feb 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seiches were again observed in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[West Bengal]] in [[India]] as well as in many locations in [[Bangladesh]] during the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asc-india.org/lib/20051008-kashkoh.htm|title=M7.6 Kashmir-Kohistan Earthquake, 2005|website=Amateur Seismic Centre|location=Pune|date=31 Oct 2008|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950 Chayu-Upper Assam earthquake is known to have generated seiches as far away as [[Norway]] and southern [[England]]. Other earthquakes in the Indian sub-continent known to have generated seiches include the 1803 Kumaon-Barahat, [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake|1819 Allah Bund]], 1842 Central Bengal, 1905 Kangra, 1930 Dhubri, 1934 Nepal-Bihar, 2001 Bhuj, 2005 Nias, 2005 Teresa Island earthquakes. The [[2010 Chile earthquake|February 27, 2010 Chile earthquake]] produced a seiche on [[Lake Pontchartrain]], [[Louisiana]] with a height of around 0.5 feet. The [[2010 Sierra El Mayor earthquake]] produced large seiches that quickly became an internet phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizonageology.blogspot.com/2010/04/video-of-mini-tsunami-in-devils-hole.html|title= Arizona Geology: Video of seiche in Devils Hole pupfish pond.

===Sea and bay seiches===
Seiches have been observed in seas such as the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. This results in the flooding of [[Venice]] and [[St. Petersburg]], respectively, as both cities are constructed on former marshland. In St. Petersburg, seiche-induced flooding is common along the [[Neva River]] in the autumn. The seiche is driven by a low pressure region in the [[North Atlantic]] moving onshore, giving rise to [[cyclone|cyclonic]] lows on the [[Baltic Sea]]. The low pressure of the cyclone draws greater-than-normal quantities of water into the virtually land-locked Baltic. As the cyclone continues inland, long, low-frequency seiche waves with wavelengths up to several hundred kilometres are established in the Baltic. When the waves reach the narrow and shallow Neva Bay, they become much higher — ultimately flooding the Neva embankments.&lt;ref&gt;This behaves in a fashion similar to a [[tidal bore]] where incoming tides are funneled into a shallow, narrowing river via a broad bay. The funnel-like shape increases the height of the tide above normal, and the flood appears as a relatively rapid increase in the water level.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar phenomena are observed at Venice, resulting in the [[MOSE Project]], a system of 79 mobile barriers designed to protect the three entrances to the [[Venetian Lagoon]].

[[Nagasaki Bay]] is a typical area in Japan where seiches have been observed from time to time, most often in the spring — especially in March.  On 31 March 1979, the [[Nagasaki]] tide station recorded a maximum water-level displacement of {{convert|2.78|m|ft}}, at that location due to the seiche. The maximum water-level displacement in the whole bay during this seiche event is assumed to have reached {{convert|4.70|m|ft}}, at the bottom of the bay.  Seiches in Western [[Kyushu]] — including Nagasaki Bay — are often induced by a low in the atmospheric pressure passing South of Kyushu island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  Seiches in Nagasaki Bay have a [[period (physics)|period]] of about 30 to 40 minutes.  Locally, {{Nihongo|seiche|副振動|fukushindō}} is called {{Nihongo|abiki|あびき}}.  The word of ''abiki'' is considered to have been derived from {{Nihongo|網引き|amibiki}}, which literally means: the dragging-away ({{Nihongo|引き|''biki''}}) of a fishing net ({{Nihongo|網|ami}}).  Seiches not only cause damage to the local fishery but also may result in flooding of the coast around the bay, as well as in the destruction of [[port]] facilities.

Seiches can also be induced by [[tsunami]], a wave train (series of waves) generated in a body of water by a pulsating or abrupt disturbance that vertically displaces the water column. On occasion, tsunamis can produce seiches as a result of local geographic peculiarities. For instance, the tsunami that hit [[Hawaii]] in 1946 had a fifteen-minute interval between wave fronts. The natural resonant period of [[Hilo|Hilo Bay]] is about thirty minutes. That meant that every second wave was in phase with the motion of Hilo Bay, creating a seiche in the bay. As a result, Hilo suffered worse damage than any other place in Hawaii, with the tsunami/seiche reaching a height of 26 feet along the Hilo Bayfront, killing 96 people in the city alone. Seiche waves may continue for several days after a tsunami.

Tide-generated internal solitary waves (solitons) can excite coastal seiches at the following locations: [[Magueyes Island]] in Puerto Rico,

===Underwater (internal) waves===
Although the bulk of the technical literature addresses surface seiches, which are readily observed, seiches are also observed beneath the lake surface acting along the [[thermocline]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[thermocline]] is the boundary between colder lower layer ([[hypolimnion]]) and warmer upper layer ([[epilimnion]]).&lt;/ref&gt; in constrained bodies of water.

In analogy with the Merian formula, the expected period of the internal wave can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, C. H. (1974). Lake hydrodynamics. Mitt. Internat. Verein. Limnol. 20, 124–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2L}{c}&lt;/math&gt;       with       &lt;math&gt;c^2 = g \frac{\rho_2-\rho_1}{\rho_2} \frac{h_1 h_2}{h_1+h_2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the natural [[Frequencies|period]], ''L'' is the length of the water body, &lt;math&gt;h_1, h_2&lt;/math&gt; the average thicknesses of the two layers separated by [[stratification (water)|stratification]] (e.g. [[epilimnion]] and [[hypolimnion]]), &lt;math&gt;\rho_1, \rho_2&lt;/math&gt; the [[densities]] of these two same layers and ''g'' the [[Earth's gravity|acceleration of gravity]].

==Engineering for seiche protection==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Engineers consider seiche phenomena in the design of flood protection works (e.g., [[Saint Petersburg Dam]]), [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]]s  and dams (e.g., [[Grand Coulee Dam]]), potable water storage basins, harbours and even spent nuclear fuel storage basins.

'''Steven M. Newman''' (born May 31, 1954) is an American world trekker, public speaker, freelance writer, author, and adjunct professor. From April 1983 to April 1987, he walked solo around the world and became popularly known as “The Worldwalker.” The author or co-author of three books, he has given over 2,300 speeches to universities, schools, churches, companies, and other groups. The longest hiking trail in Ohio’s state park system, the [http://www.trimbleoutdoors.com/ViewTrip/308403 Steven Newman Worldwalker Perimeter Trail], has been permanently renamed after him, and he has been honored with that state’s highest award, as well as with a doctorate in humanities. In 2012 he signed his third multiyear shoe and sportswear endorsement contract that will pay him royalties until he reaches the age of 70 with the company [http://en.aquatwo.com/ Aqua Two].

== Biography ==
Newman was born in the village of [[Bethel, Ohio]], to Bethel native Edwin Newman, who is of English and Scottish descent, and Mary Kennedy from [[Buffalo, New York]], who is of Irish descent. His father, a salesman, met Mary, a nurse, when they chanced upon each other in an elevator at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. Mary was at that time a nurse for the singer [[Lena Horne]]. They married and lived in Bethel until Steven’s birth, at which time they moved to [[Florida]] for several years before returning to Bethel.

Steven lived in [[Titusville, Florida]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] until the finish of the fourth grade. His parents moved back to [[Ohio]] then, and he attended public schools in Bethel through grade 12. In high school he became well known for his ultra-long running feats and was given the nickname of “Bebe” (after a famous Kenyan marathoner of that time). He also took the opportunity during those years to hitchhike (without his parents’ permission) to several distant points across the USA. He graduated with a BS in Journalism from [[Ohio University]] in 1972. While at OU, he ran cross country, was successful in orienteering, participated in the ROTC program for three years, and took many English classes. He paid his way through college by working each summer as a uranium prospector in the wilds of Wyoming’s Red Desert. His boss was former Republican congressman [[John Wold]], and the project Newman worked on (often alone with only his red [[collie]] Charley as a companion) was highly experimental in nature and shrouded in some secrecy.

== Professional career ==
Within a few months of graduating from Ohio University, Newman started working (at $150 a week) as a reporter for the ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'', Wyoming’s largest newspaper. After a couple years he quit the newspaper (now at a salary of around $180 a week) to pursue freelance writing and to prepare for a goal he had had since he was nine: a walk around the world, documenting his encounters with the various cultures. After five years of prep that included strenuous hikes and camping in the West, saving $25,000 from roustabouting on small drilling rigs, poring over hundreds of topographical maps in the [[Casper, Wyoming]] and [[New York City, New York]] public libraries, and visiting embassies in Washington, DC, he returned to Bethel to begin what would eventually be officially recognized as the first documented solo walk around the world.

Steven’s first book advance (for ''Letters From Steven'') was for $500. His next three book advances (including the paperback version of one of his two other books) would each be for six figures. The most popular of his books, ''Worldwalk'', was published internationally and selected as a Main Selection for America’s oldest and most prestigious book club. His walk around the world was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and led to thousands of speech invitations and many honors. A one-hour documentary about the Worldwalk was done by film director Brian Doubleday and shown on several PBS stations across the USA.

In the years since his solo backpacking trek around the world, Newman has walked the lengths of [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]]. His exploits have also resulted in sponsor-paid trips to other nations such as [[China]], where in 2012 he visited 14 cities, lectured at China’s most prestigious university ([[Peking University]]), and signed a 12-year endorsement contract. Another company in Japan also markets apparel with Newman’s name and well-known stickman logo on them.

Presently Newman does extensive traveling to other parts of the world (including, in Bolivia in 2012, a hike the length of the Choro Trail and a wild mountain bike ride with a book fan, [http://juliancook.com Julian Cook], down the “[[Road of Death]]”). He and his wife, Darci, reside on nearly 25 acres along the [[Ohio River]] on a heavily forested hillside known as Worldwalker Hill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Thames Measurement''', also known as '''Thames Tonnage''', is a system for measuring ships and boats.  It was created in 1855 as a variation of [[Builder's Old Measurement]] by the [[Royal Thames Yacht Club]], and was designed for small vessels, such as [[yacht]]s.  It was originally used for calculating the port dues for yachts; the formula was also used in some early [[handicapping]] systems for [[yacht racing]].&lt;ref name=OUP&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kemp|editor1-first=Peter|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|date=1979|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-211553-7|page=864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculation of Thames Tonnage uses the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{Thames Tonnage} = \frac {(\text{length}-\text{beam}) \times \text{beam} \times \frac {\text{beam}}{2}} {94}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''length'' is the length, in [[foot (length)|feet]], from the stempost to sternpost;
*''beam'' is the maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]], in feet.&lt;ref name=OUP /&gt;

This can be simplified as:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Thames Tonnage} = \frac {(\text{length}-\text{beam}) \times \text{beam}^2} {188}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1922">Thermal motion is able to produce [[capillary waves]] at the molecular scale. At this scale,
gravity and hydrodynamics can be neglected, and only the [[surface tension]] contribution is
relevant.

Capillary wave theory (CWT) is a classic account of how [[thermal fluctuations]] distort an interface.
It starts from some intrinsic surface &lt;math&gt;h(x,y,t)&lt;/math&gt;that is distorted. Its energy will be
proportional to its area:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{st}= \sigma \int dx\, dy\, \left[\sqrt{1+\left( \frac{dh}{dx}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dh}{dy}\right)^2}-1\right]\approx \frac{\sigma}{2} \int dx\, dy\,  \left[ \left( \frac{dh}{dx}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dh}{dy}\right)^2 \right], &lt;/math&gt;
where the first equality is the area in this (the [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]]) representation, and the second
applies for small values of the derivatives (surfaces not too rough). The constant of proportionality, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[surface tension]].

By performing a [[Fourier analysis]] treatment, normal modes are easily found. Each contributes an energy proportional to the square of its amplitude; therefore, according to classical statistical mechanics, equipartition holds, and the mean energy of each mode will be &lt;math&gt; kT / 2&lt;/math&gt;. Surprisingly, this result leads to a divergent surface (the width of the interface is bound to diverge with its area). This divergence is nevertheless very mild: even for displacements on the order of meters the deviation of the surface is comparable to the size of the molecules. Moreover, the introduction of an external field removes the divergence: the action of gravity is sufficient to keep the width fluctuation on the order of one molecular diameter for areas larger than about 1 mm2 (Ref. 2).&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Rowlinson and B. Widom "Molecular theory of capillarity 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23782">{{main article|Mountain peaks of the United States}}
In [[mountaineering]] in the United States, a '''thirteener''' is a [[mountain]] that exceeds {{Convert|13000|ft|m|1}} [[above mean sea level]], similar to the more familiar "[[fourteener]]s," which exceed {{Convert|14000|ft|m|1}}.  In most instances, "thirteeners" refers only to those peaks between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation.

The importance of thirteeners is greatest in [[Colorado]], which has the majority of such peaks in [[North America]] with over 600 of them.  Despite the large number of peaks, over 20 [[peak bagging|peak baggers]] have reported climbing all of Colorado's thirteeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Colorado 13ers List | url= http://listsofjohn.com/elev?s=CO&amp;e=13 | accessdate = 2016-10-06 | publisher=listsofjohn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteeners are also significant in states whose [[List of U.S. states by elevation|highpoints]] fall between 13,000 and 13,999 feet.  Regarding whether or not peaks in excess of 13,999 feet should be considered as "thirteeners", this article will count them as such for statistical purposes, but concentrate its focus on those peaks less than 14,000 feet since the higher peaks are already covered in the [[fourteener]]s list.

Not all summits over 13,000&amp;nbsp;feet qualify as thirteeners, but only those summits that [[mountaineering|mountaineers]] consider to be independent. Objective standards for independence include [[topographic prominence]] and isolation (distance from a higher summit), or a combination. However thirteener lists do not always consistently use such objective rules.  A rule commonly used by mountaineers in the [[contiguous United States]] is that a peak must have at least {{Convert|300|ft|m|0}} of prominence to qualify.  According to the [http://www.mcak.org Mountaineering Club of Alaska], it is standard in [[Alaska]] to use a {{Convert|500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} prominence rule rather than a 300-foot rule.  These are the standards applied for the lists below.

===Alaska===
[[Alaska]] has at least 41 thirteeners that meet its more stringent prominence criteria of 500&amp;nbsp;ft, of which 20 are also fourteeners.  Different sources list varying numbers  of 13,000+ ft peaks in the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Alaska’s Summits 13,000 feet and above | url= http://www.climb.mountains.com/Project_Island_files/AK_13ers.shtml | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Alaska 13,000-foot Peaks | url= http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=21301 | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Highest Alaskan Summits (Wrangell-St. Elias National Park &amp; Preserve) | url= http://www.nps.gov/wrst/planyourvisit/upload/Highest%20Alaskan%20Summits.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because many of the peaks (especially those that are sub-peaks of a higher mountain) are unnamed and have no spot elevations given on the USGS topographical maps.  Using a 300' interpolated prominence criterion, there are 61 13,000+ ft peaks in Alaska&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Alaska's Highest Peaks | url= https://listsofjohn.com/PeakStats/selecth.php?sort=&amp;n=61&amp;s=AK | accessdate = 2016-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea''' ('''UNCLOS'''), also called the '''Law of the Sea Convention''' or the '''Law of the Sea treaty''', is the international agreement that resulted from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which took place between 1973 and 1982. The Law of the Sea Convention defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the world's oceans, establishing guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine [[natural resource]]s. The Convention, concluded in 1982, replaced four 1958 [[treaties]]. UNCLOS came into force in 1994, a year after Guyana became the 60th nation to ratify the treaty.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; {{As of|2016|06}}, 167 countries and the [[European Union]] have joined in the Convention. It is uncertain as to what extent the Convention codifies [[customary international law]].

While the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] receives instruments of [[ratification]] and accession and the UN provides support for meetings of states party to the Convention, the UN has no direct operational role in the implementation of the Convention. There is, however, a role played by organizations such as the [[International Maritime Organization]], the [[International Whaling Commission]], and the [[International Seabed Authority|International Seabed Authority (ISA)]]. (The ISA was established by the UN Convention.)

==Background==
UNCLOS replaces the older '[[freedom of the seas]]' concept, dating from the 17th century: national rights were limited to a specified belt of water extending from a nation's [[coast]]lines, usually {{convert|3|nmi|km}} ([[Three-mile limit]]), according to the '[[cannon]] shot' rule developed by the Dutch jurist [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]].&lt;ref name="Akashi-Bynkershoek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akashi|first1=Kinji|title=Cornelius Van Bynkershoek: His Role in the History of International Law|date=2 October 1998|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-9041105998|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Pp--yPYL58C&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;ots=qgJPsX3-ZM&amp;dq=Cornelius%20van%20Bynkershoek%20cannon&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=Cornelius%20van%20Bynkershoek%20cannon&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 July 2016|ref=Akashi-Bynkershoek}}&lt;/ref&gt; All waters beyond national boundaries were considered [[international waters]]: free to all nations, but belonging to none of them (the ''[[International waters|mare liberum]]'' principle promulgated by [[Hugo Grotius]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/grotius-the-freedom-of-the-seas-latin-and-english-version-magoffin-trans|title=The Freedom of the Seas (Latin and English version, Magoffin trans.)  – Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, some nations expressed their desire to extend national claims: to include mineral resources, to protect [[fish stock]]s, and to provide the means to enforce [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution controls]]. (The [[League of Nations]] called a 1930 conference at [[The Hague]], but no agreements resulted.) Using the customary international law principle of a nation's right to protect its natural resources, President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1945 extended United States control to all the natural resources of its [[continental shelf]]. Other nations were quick to follow suit. Between 1946 and 1950, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador extended their rights to a distance of {{convert|200|nmi|km}} to cover their [[Humboldt Current]] fishing grounds. Other nations extended their territorial seas to {{convert|12|nmi|km}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

By 1967, only 25 nations still used the old {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} limit,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} while 66 nations had set a {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} territorial limit{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and eight had set a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} limit.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} {{As of|2008|05|28}}, only two countries still use the {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} limit: Jordan and Palau.&lt;ref name="untableofclaims"&gt;{{cite web | title=Table of claims to maritime jurisdiction | url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/table_summary_of_claims.pdf | accessdate=1 May 2009 | publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; That limit is also used in certain Australian islands, an area of Belize, some Japanese [[strait]]s, certain areas of Papua New Guinea, and a few [[British Overseas Territories]], such as [[Anguilla]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1956, the United Nations held its first Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I) at [[Geneva]], Switzerland. UNCLOS I&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/8_1.htm UNCLOS I]&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in four treaties concluded in 1958:

* [[Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone]], entry into force: 10 September 1964
* [[Convention on the Continental Shelf]], entry into force: 10 June 1964
* [[Convention on the High Seas]], entry into force: 30 September 1962
* [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas]], entry into force: 20 March 1966

Although UNCLOS I was considered a success, it left open the important issue of breadth of territorial waters.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt;

== UNCLOS II ==

In 1960, the United Nations held the second Conference on the Law of the Sea ("UNCLOS II"); however, the six-week Geneva conference did not result in any new agreements.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt; Generally speaking, developing nations and third world countries participated only as clients, allies, or dependents of the United States or the Soviet Union, with no significant voice of their own.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== UNCLOS III ==
[[File:Zonmar-en.svg|thumb|300px|Sea areas in international rights]]

The issue of varying claims of territorial waters was raised in the UN in 1967 by [[Arvid Pardo]] of Malta, and in 1973 the ''Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea'' was convened in New York. In an attempt to reduce the possibility of groups of nation-states dominating the negotiations, the conference used a consensus process rather than majority vote. With more than 160 nations participating, the conference lasted until 1982. The resulting convention came into force on 16 November 1994, one year after the 60th state, Guyana, ratified the treaty.

The convention introduced a number of provisions. The most significant issues covered were setting limits, navigation, archipelagic status and transit regimes, [[exclusive economic zones]] (EEZs), continental shelf jurisdiction, deep seabed mining, the exploitation regime, protection of the marine environment, scientific research, and settlement of disputes.

The convention set the limit of various areas, measured from a carefully defined [[baseline (sea)|baseline]]. (Normally, a sea baseline follows the low-water line, but when the coastline is deeply indented, has fringing islands or is highly unstable, straight baselines may be used.) The areas are as follows:

; [[Internal waters]]:Covers all water and waterways on the landward side of the baseline. The coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use, and use any resource. Foreign vessels have no right of passage within internal waters. A vessel in the high seas assumes jurisdiction under the internal laws of its flag State. Pursuit of a ship by the Coastal State may only take place in the internal waters and is required to end when reaching the contiguous zone.
; [[Territorial waters]]: Out to {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|abbr=off}} from the baseline, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use, and use any resource. Vessels were given the right of [[innocent passage]] through any territorial waters, with strategic straits allowing the passage of military craft as [[transit passage]], in that naval vessels are allowed to maintain postures that would be illegal in territorial waters. "Innocent passage" is defined by the convention as passing through waters in an expeditious and continuous manner, which is not "prejudicial to the peace, good order or the security" of the coastal state. Fishing, polluting, weapons practice, and spying are not "innocent", and submarines and other underwater vehicles are required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag. Nations can also temporarily suspend innocent passage in specific areas of their territorial seas, if doing so is essential for the protection of their security.
; Archipelagic waters: The convention set the definition of Archipelagic States in Part IV, which also defines how the state can draw its territorial borders. A baseline is drawn between the outermost points of the outermost islands, subject to these points being sufficiently close to one another. All waters inside this baseline are designated ''Archipelagic Waters''. The state has sovereignty over these waters (like internal waters), but subject to existing rights including traditional fishing rights of immediately adjacent states.&lt;ref name="UNCLOS3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm | title=UNCLOS 3 Article 51 | publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea | accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign vessels have right of innocent passage through archipelagic waters (like territorial waters).
; [[Contiguous zone]]: Beyond the {{convert|12|nmi|km|adj=on}} limit, there is a further {{convert|12|nmi|km}} from the territorial sea [[baseline (sea)|baseline]] limit, the contiguous zone, in which a state can continue to enforce laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution, if the infringement started within the state's territory or territorial waters, or if this infringement is about to occur within the state's territory or territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SECTION 4. CONTIGUOUS ZONE, Article 33|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm|work=UNCLOS PART II – TERRITORIAL SEA AND CONTIGUOUS ZONE|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the contiguous zone a [[hot pursuit]] area.
; [[Exclusive economic zone]]s (EEZs): These extend {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|abbr=off}} from the [[baseline (sea)|baseline]]. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. In casual use, the term may include the territorial sea and even the continental shelf. The EEZs were introduced to halt the increasingly heated clashes over fishing rights, although [[Petroleum|oil]] was also becoming important. The success of an offshore [[oil platform]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1947 was soon repeated elsewhere in the world, and by 1970 it was technically feasible to operate in waters 4,000 metres deep. Foreign nations have the freedom of navigation and overflight, subject to the regulation of the coastal states. Foreign states may also lay submarine pipes and cables.
; [[Continental shelf]]: The continental shelf is defined as the [[natural prolongation]] of the land territory to the [[continental margin]]'s outer edge, or {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. A state's continental shelf may exceed {{convert|200|nmi|km}} until the natural prolongation ends. However, it may never exceed {{convert|350|nmi|km mi|abbr=off}} from the baseline; or it may never exceed {{convert|100|nmi|km mi|abbr=off}} beyond the 2,500-meter [[isobath]] (the line connecting the depth of 2,500 meters). Coastal states have the right to harvest mineral and non-living material in the subsoil of its continental shelf, to the exclusion of others. Coastal states also have exclusive control over living resources "attached" to the continental shelf, but not to creatures living in the water column beyond the exclusive economic zone.

Aside from its provisions defining ocean boundaries, the convention establishes general obligations for safeguarding the marine environment and protecting freedom of scientific research on the high seas, and also creates an innovative legal regime for controlling mineral resource exploitation in deep seabed areas beyond national jurisdiction, through an [[International Seabed Authority]] and the [[Common heritage of mankind]] principle.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wisconsin International Law Journal. 2003; 21:409&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landlocked country|Landlocked]] states are given a right of access to and from the sea, without taxation of traffic through transit states.&lt;ref&gt;This is a principle that was first developed in the [[Convention on Transit Trade of Land-locked States]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part XI and the 1994 Agreement ==

Part XI of the Convention provides for a regime relating to minerals on the seabed outside any state's territorial waters or EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zones). It establishes an [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA) to authorize seabed exploration and mining and collect and distribute the seabed mining royalty.

The United States objected to the provisions of Part XI of the Convention on several grounds, arguing that the treaty was unfavorable to American economic and security interests. Due to Part XI, the United States refused to ratify the UNCLOS, although it expressed agreement with the remaining provisions of the Convention.

From 1982 to 1990, the United States accepted all but Part XI as customary international law, while attempting to establish an alternative regime for exploitation of the minerals of the deep seabed. An agreement was made with other seabed mining nations and licenses were granted to four international consortia. Concurrently, the Preparatory Commission was established to prepare for the eventual coming into force of the Convention-recognized claims by applicants, sponsored by signatories of the Convention. Overlaps between the two groups were resolved, but a decline in the demand for minerals from the seabed made the seabed regime significantly less relevant. In addition, the decline of Socialism and the fall of Communism in the late 1980s had removed much of the support for some of the more contentious Part XI provisions.

In 1990, consultations were begun between signatories and non-signatories (including the United States) over the possibility of modifying the Convention to allow the industrialized countries to join the Convention. The resulting 1994 Agreement on Implementation was adopted as a binding international Convention. It mandated that key articles, including those on limitation of seabed production and mandatory technology transfer, would not be applied, that the United States, if it became a member, would be guaranteed a seat on the Council of the International Seabed Authority, and finally, that voting would be done in groups, with each group able to block decisions on substantive matters. The 1994 Agreement also established a Finance Committee that would originate the financial decisions of the Authority, to which the largest donors would automatically be members and in which decisions would be made by consensus.

On 1 February 2011, the Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) issued an advisory opinion concerning the legal responsibilities and obligations of States Parties to the Convention with respect to the sponsorship of activities in the Area in accordance with Part XI of the Convention and the 1994 Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_17/adv_op_010211.pdf Case No. 17 – Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities With Respect to Activities in the Area – Advisory Opinion], Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (1 February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory opinion was issued in response to a formal request made by the International Seabed Authority following two prior applications the Authority's Legal and Technical Commission had received from the Republics of Nauru and Tonga regarding proposed activities (a plan of work to explore for polymetallic nodules) to be undertaken in the Area by two State-sponsored contractors – Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (sponsored by the Republic of Nauru) and Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (sponsored by the Kingdom of Tonga). The advisory opinion set forth the international legal responsibilities and obligations of Sponsoring States AND the Authority to ensure that sponsored activities do not harm the marine environment, consistent with the applicable provisions of UNCLOS Part XI, Authority regulations, ITLOS case law, other international environmental treaties, and Principle 15 of the UN Rio Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itssdjournalunclos-lost.blogspot.com/2011/03/international-tribunal-on-law-of-sea.html International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea Finally Renders Advisory Opinion Establishing that the Precautionary Principle is Incorporated Within UNCLOS Law], ''ITSSD Journal on the UN Law of the Sea Convention'' (22 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Grassland''' is a classification of [[protected area|protected]] and managed [[federal lands]] in the United States authorized by Title III of the [[Bankhead–Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937]]. For administrative purposes, they are essentially identical to [[United States National Forest]]s, except that grasslands are areas primarily consisting of [[prairie]]. Like National Forests, National Grasslands may be open for hunting, grazing, mineral extraction, recreation and other uses. Various National Grasslands are typically administered in conjunction with nearby National Forests. 

All but three National Grasslands are on or at the edge of the [[Great Plains]]. Those three are in southeastern [[Idaho]], northeastern [[California]], and central [[Oregon]]. The three National Grasslands in [[North Dakota]], together with one in northwestern South Dakota, are administered jointly as the [[Dakota Prairie Grasslands]]. National Grasslands are generally much smaller than National Forests. Whereas a typical National Forest would be about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}}, the average Grassland size is {{convert|191914|acre|ha}}. The largest National Grassland, the [[Little Missouri National Grassland]] in North Dakota, covers {{convert|1028784|acre|ha}}, which is approximately the [[median]] size of a National Forest. As of September 30, 2007, the total area of all 20 National Grasslands was {{convert|3838280|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name=Areas/&gt;

==Dust Bowl==

The catastrophic [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s led to the creation of the [[Soil Conservation Service]] in 1933.  This and subsequent federal laws paved the way for establishing national grasslands.

[[File:Auguste Puttemans Isis 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Isis as a veiled "goddess of life" with the Sais inscription written in French on the pedestal beneath her, at the [[Herbert Hoover National Historic Site]]]]
The '''veil of Isis''' is a metaphor and [[allegorical]] [[motif (visual arts)|artistic motif]] in which [[nature]] is personified as the [[goddess]] [[Isis]] covered by a [[veil]] or [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]], representing the inaccessibility of nature's secrets. It is often combined with a related motif, in which nature is portrayed as a goddess with multiple breasts who represents Isis, [[Artemis]], or a combination of both.

The motif was based on a statue of Isis, or of the goddess [[Neith]] who was sometimes equated with her, in the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] city of [[Sais]] mentioned by the Greco-Roman authors [[Plutarch]] and [[Proclus]]. They claimed the statue bore an inscription saying "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever lifted my mantle." Illustrations of Isis with her veil being lifted were popular from the late 17th to the early 19th century, often as allegorical representations of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] science and philosophy uncovering nature's secrets. Authors at the end of the 18th century, foreshadowing the [[Romantic movement]], began using the lifting of Isis's veil as a metaphor for revealing awe-inspiring truth. [[Helena Blavatsky]], in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' in 1877, used the metaphor for the spiritual truths that her [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] belief system hoped to discover, and modern [[ceremonial magic]] includes a ritual called the '''Rending of the Veil''' to bring the magician to a higher state of spiritual awareness.

==The statue and inscription at Sais==
The first mention of the veil of Isis appears in ''On Isis and Osiris'', a philosophical interpretation of [[ancient Egyptian religion]] by [[Plutarch]], a Greek writer in the late first and early second centuries CE. He wrote of a seated statue of a goddess in the Egyptian city of [[Sais]] that bore the inscription "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever lifted my garment."&lt;ref name="Griffiths 131"&gt;Griffiths 1970, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch called the garment a ''[[peplos]]''; the word is translated in English as "mantle" or "veil".&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch identified the goddess as "Athena, whom [the Egyptians] consider to be Isis."&lt;ref name="Griffiths 131"/&gt; Sais was the cult center of the goddess [[Neith]], whom the Greeks [[interpretatio graeca|compared]] to their goddess [[Athena]] and was thus the goddess that Plutarch spoke of. In Plutarch's time [[Isis]] was the preeminent goddess in Egyptian religion and was frequently [[ancient Egyptian deities#Manifestations and combinations|syncretized]] with Neith, which is why Plutarch equated the two.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 1970, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; More than 300 years after Plutarch, the [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Proclus]] wrote of the same statue in Book I of his ''Commentaries on Plato's "Timaeus"''. In this version, the garment is a ''[[chiton (costume)|chiton]]'', "no mortal" is replaced by "no one", and a third statement is added: "The fruit of my womb was the sun".&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt;

Proclus said the statue was in the ''[[adyton]]'' of a [[Egyptian temple|temple]] at Sais, but the inner areas of Egyptian temples were not accessible to anyone but priests, and it is unlikely that a statue of a deity would have been permanently veiled; priests saw the [[cult image]] of the god every day when performing temple rites. However, a statue in a temple's courtyards or halls could have borne an inscription similar to the one Plutarch and Proclus related.&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt; The first part of the inscription—"I am all that has been and is and shall be"—means the goddess encompasses everything. This claim was commonly made of [[creator god]]s such as [[Ra]] or [[Amun]] in Egyptian religion; if the same was said about Isis, it reflected her increased status in Greco-Roman times, in which she was often said to be the creator of the world. The second part—"no one has ever lifted my mantle"—implies that the goddess was [[virgin]]al, a claim that was occasionally made of Isis in Greco-Roman times but conflicted with the long-standing belief that she and her husband [[Osiris]] conceived their son [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 1970, pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Proclus's version suggests that the goddess conceived and gave birth to the sun without the participation of a male deity, which would reflect Egyptian myths about Neith as the mother of the sun god Ra. Another possible explanation, suggested by the Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]], is that the latter part of the Egyptian inscription said "There is nobody except me", proclaiming that the all-encompassing goddess was unique, and was mistranslated into Greek as "there is nobody who opened [or: uncovered] my face."&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt;

==Isis and Artemis as nature==
[[File:Anatome Animalium frontispiece.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Science unveiling Nature in the frontispiece to ''Anatome Animalum'', 1681]]
Several other sources influenced the motif of the veiled Isis. One was a tradition that linked Isis with [[nature]] and the goddess [[Artemis]]. [[European art]] has a long tradition of personifying nature as a [[Mother Nature|motherly figure]]. Starting in the 16th century, this motif was influenced by the iconography of the goddess [[Temple of Artemis#Ephesian Artemis|Artemis of Ephesus]] (also known under the name of her [[Roman gods|Roman]] equivalent, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]). The Ephesian Artemis was depicted with round protuberances on her chest that may originally have been jewelry but came to be interpreted as breasts. Isis was sometimes compared with Artemis, and the Roman writer [[Macrobius]], in the fourth century CE, wrote, "Isis is the earth or nature that is under the sun. That is why the goddess's entire body bristles with a multitude of breasts placed close to one another [as in the case of Artemis of Ephesus], because all things are nourished by earth or by nature." Thus, the 16th-century artists represented nature as Isis-Artemis with multiple breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 233–238&lt;/ref&gt;

A second influence was a tradition that nature is mysterious. It goes back to an aphorism by the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] in the late sixth or early fifth century BCE, which is traditionally translated as "Nature loves to hide." [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in the 1590s personified nature as a woman with a veil, though without a direct connection to Isis,&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; although Isis appears elsewhere in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin 2012, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Several illustrators in the 17th century used the anonymous woman with a veil in the same way. In the 1650s, [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' explicitly explained Isis's veil as an emblem of the secrets of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 237, 240–242&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece to [[Gerhard Blasius]]'s 1681 book ''Anatome Animalum'', engraved by [[Jan Luyken]], was the first depiction of a many-breasted Isis-Artemis figure with her veil being removed. It shows a personification of science removing the veil, as an allegory for the way science uncovers nature's secrets. This metaphor was reused in the frontispieces of many of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]'s works, and then in illustrations to other scientific works throughout the 18th century. In some cases the veiled figure is a statue, reminiscent of the original statue of Artemis at Ephesus, while in others it is a living woman. The motif was sometimes elaborated with other metaphors, so that, for example, in the frontispiece to ''The Philosophy of Nature'' by [[Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales]], Nature unveils herself to a philosopher as he overthrows Despotism and Superstition. The unveiling of the Isis-figure thus expressed the hope, prevalent during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], that philosophy and science would triumph over unreason to uncover nature's deepest truths. This motif continued beyond the Enlightenment into the 19th century. An example is [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]]'s 1899 sculpture ''[[Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science]]'', in which the multiple breasts are omitted and the Isis-figure wears a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]] on her gown that hints at her Egyptian background.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 1, 237–243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isis as a mystery==
[[File:Frontispiece to The Temple of Nature.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The unveiling of a statue of Isis as a personification of nature, depicted as the climactic moment of an Isiac initiation, in an 1803 engraving by [[Henry Fuseli]]&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another interpretation of Isis's veil emerged in the late 18th century, in keeping with the [[Romantic movement]] that was developing at the time, in which nature constitutes an awe-inspiring mystery rather than prosaic knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation was influenced by the ancient [[mysteries of Isis|mystery initiations dedicated to Isis]] that were performed in the Greco-Roman world.&lt;ref name="Assmann 126"&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 126–134&lt;/ref&gt; Although these rites were developed in [[Hellenistic]] or Roman times, under the influence of earlier [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery rites]],&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer 2014, pp. 110–114&lt;/ref&gt; both classical authors and 18th-century scholars assumed them to have been age-old features of ancient Egyptian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson 2004, pp. 241–245&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Freemasons]], members of a European [[fraternal organization]] that attained its modern form in the early 18th century, adopted Egyptian motifs and came to believe their rituals could be traced back to the mysteries of Isis.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson 2004, pp. 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; One Freemason in the 1780s, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], tried to reconcile [[Masonic ritual and symbolism#Symbols in ritual|Freemasonry's traditional origin story]], which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian themes. To do so, he interpreted the first statement on the statue at Sais, "I am all that has been and is and shall be," as a declaration of [[pantheism]], in which nature and divinity are identical. Reinhold claimed the public face of Egyptian religion was [[polytheistic]], but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal the deeper, pantheistic truth to elite initiates. He also said the statement "[[I am that I am]]", spoken by the [[God in Judaism|Jewish God]] in the [[Book of Exodus]], meant the same as the Saite inscription and indicated that [[Judaism]] was a descendant of the ancient Egyptian belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 115–125&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of Reinhold's interpretation, other Freemasons came to see the veiled Isis as a symbol of an impenetrable enigma, representing [[truth]] and [[being]] as well as nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2004, pp. 267–269&lt;/ref&gt; a deity that, as Assmann puts it, was regarded as "too all-encompassing to have a name."&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] connected the motif of Isis's veil with his concept of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], saying, "Perhaps no one has said anything more sublime, or expressed a thought more sublimely, than in that inscription on the temple of Isis (Mother Nature)." According to Kant, the sublime evoked both wonder and terror, and these emotions appeared frequently in the works of late 18th and early 19th-century authors using the motif of the veil. The ecstatic nature of ancient mystery rites themselves contributed to the focus on emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2004, pp. 269–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Schiller]], for instance, wrote an essay on Egyptian and Jewish religion that mostly copied Reinhold's work but put a new emphasis on the emotional buildup that surrounded the mysteries. He said it prepared the initiate to confront the awe-inspiring power of nature at the climax of the rite. Similarly, a frontispiece by [[Henry Fuseli]], made for [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s poem ''The Temple of Nature'' in 1803, explicitly shows the unveiling of a statue of Isis as the climax of the initiation.&lt;ref name="Assmann 126"/&gt;

[[Helena Blavatsky]]'s 1877 book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', one of the foundational texts for the [[Western esoteric tradition|esoteric]] belief system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], used the metaphor of the veil as its title. Isis is not prominent in the book, but in it Blavatsky said that philosophers try to lift the veil of Isis, or nature, but see only her physical forms. She added, "The soul within escapes their view; and the Divine Mother has no answer for them," implying that theosophy will reveal truths about nature that science and philosophy cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Ziolkowski 2008, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parting of the Veil==
The "Parting of the Veil", "Piercing of the Veil", "Rending of the Veil" or "Lifting of the Veil" refers, in the [[Western mystery tradition]] and [[contemporary witchcraft]], to opening the "veil" of matter, thus gaining entry to a state of spiritual awareness in which the mysteries of nature are revealed. In [[ceremonial magic]], the Sign of the Rending of the Veil is a symbolic gesture performed by the magician with the intention of creating such an opening. It is performed starting with the arms extended forwards and hands flat against each other (either palm to palm or back to back), then spreading the hands apart with a rending motion until the arms point out to both sides and the body is in a T shape. After the working is complete, the magician will typically perform the corresponding Sign of the Closing of the Veil, which has the same movements in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Greer 1997, pp. 51–53, 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wind power in Uruguay''' generates a rapidly growing proportion of the country's [[electricity]] mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy |title=Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy|publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the majority of Uruguayan electricity generation is derived from hydroelectric sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uy.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the country’s total installed wind power capacity surpassed 1,000 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.energynews.es/english/uruguay-reached-1000-mw-in-wind-power/|title=Uruguay has reached 1,000 MW in wind power - www.energynews.es|date=2016-10-21|work=www.energynews.es|access-date=2017-10-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, this figure comprised 17 percent of the country’s overall electricity generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/how-uruguay-became-wind-power-powerhouse|title=How Uruguay Became a Wind Power Powerhouse {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; marking a sudden increase in the overall share from the 2 percent all alternative renewable energy sources made up in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uy.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 UTE, the country's power plants and transmission administrator, announced that record electricity demand was being met entirely by renewable sources, of which wind power comprised 34 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/electricpower/utes-investment-plan-made-it-possible-to-cover-the-historical-consumption-peak-in-uruguay|title=UTE investments allow historic consumption peak to be covered - BNamericas|date=2018-07-25|work=BNamericas|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-07/25/c_137347180.htm|title=Uruguay's record power demand completely covered by renewable energies - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national government has supported this nascent but fast-moving wind power transformation by providing a policy environment of incentives like [[Feed-in tariff|feed-in tariffs]] and utility-scale bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/how-uruguay-became-wind-power-powerhouse|title=How Uruguay Became a Wind Power Powerhouse {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former helped incentivize small-scale installations, while the latter enabled large-scale projects. 

== Background ==
In 2008, the Uruguayan government set a target of 15% joint participation in the national electricity grid by a number of alternative renewable sources, namely biomass, wind power, and mini-hydro.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/IRENA_RE_Latin_America_Policies_2015_Country_Uruguay.pdf|title=Renewable Energy Policy Brief: Uruguay|last=|first=|date=|website=IRENA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind power alone far surpassed that proportion in the several years following the setting of that goal. Electricity generation auctions, first put forward in 2006, have been a primary vehicle for larger-scale deployment of mini-hydro and wind power deployment over the past decade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some analysts have credited Uruguay's ability to leverage [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] funding to create reliable policy frameworks that would eventually encourage greater standalone private investment in the sector.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/how-uruguay-became-wind-power-powerhouse|title=How Uruguay Became a Wind Power Powerhouse {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Wind power in regional electricity trade ==
Its proximity to [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] make for relatively easy electricity trade between the countries, and in 2016 Uruguay began exporting excess wind power generation to neighboring Argentina. The two countries' state-operated utilities had previously sold electricity bilaterally, but the 2016 wind power sales marked the first Uruguayan-Argentine electricity trade between private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1395152/uruguay-export-wind-energy-argentina|title=Uruguay to Export Wind Energy to Argentina|last=|first=|date=|website=Wind Power Monthly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10/2/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, along the [[Brazil–Uruguay border|Uruguayan border with Brazil]], wind power projects are being approached through a binational partnership with Brazilian utility [[Eletrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/how-uruguay-became-wind-power-powerhouse|title=How Uruguay Became a Wind Power Powerhouse {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current '''world's longest meat hot dog''' record holder measured {{convert|203.8|m|ft}} and was manufactured by [[Novex]] of Paraguay in 2011. [[Sara Lee Corp.]] made a [[hot dog]], {{convert|1996|ft|m}} long, in commemoration of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' does not reflect this record in any of its publications as of 2006. Speculation surrounding the 1996-foot record is that although the hot dog was most likely continuous, the bun (an integral part of the hot dog unit) was not. Since October 2017 the town [[Flensburg]], in Germany claimed to have manufactured the World's longest hot dog with {{convert|218|m|ft}}.

==Current world records ==
On July 15, 2011, a hot dog measuring {{convert|203.8|m|ft}} and weighing approximately {{convert|120|kg|lb}} was made by Ochsi to obtain the world record. The [[hot dog bun]] weighed approximately {{convert|150|kg|lb}} and was made by Myriam Products.

* On August 4, 2006, a hot dog measuring {{convert|60|m|ft|sigfig=3}} in a bun measuring {{convert|60.3|m|ft|sigfig=3}} was made by the Shizuoka Meat Producers of Shizuoka, Japan and the [[:ja:全日本パン協同組合連合会|All-Japan Bread Association]] to obtain the world record. International media were on hand, and supporting documents have been verified by Guinness. The hot dog was made as the central part of a media event surrounding the 50th anniversary of the [[:ja:全日本パン協同組合連合会|All-Japan Bread Association]]. The wiener was made offsite at the Shizuoka plant prior to the day, and it was then cooked along with the bread in a ballroom at the [[Akasaka Prince Hotel]] in [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. After the official measurement, the hot dog was cut up and eaten by those present.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhJlmerwRNE][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1H1XvKRzH4][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaqNrkfDoI][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDPJD-df7E4]

==Technical challenges==
Creating a long hot dog is not much of a feat. This is because the hot dog is structurally quite sound, and remarkably flexible. In the August 2006 record breaking attempt, the hot dog was manufactured by Shizuoka Meat Producers, and wound into a large plastic barrel which was easily transported inside a delivery van.

The limiting factor for breaking this type of record is the bun. The bun, in order to remain in one continuous unit, needs to be baked in its final form. For the All-Japan Bread Association, this meant the connection of the longest conveyor belt possible with the equipment available to them. The dough was assembled in half-meter sections, then pressed together to create a longer tube of dough, which was then fed through the ovens via conveyor, and carried away from the ovens by another conveyor. The key was to make sure that the already-cooked bun did not move at a faster rate than the bun behind it because this would cause the bun to pull apart. The wiener was fed through the oven at the same time to cook it.  There also needed to be space outside the oven to store the bun and wiener until the entire bun had been baked. To allow for enough room for this to happen, the ovens and prep area were set up outside the ballroom of the [[Akasaka Prince Hotel]] on the loading dock, and the bun and wiener were fed into the ballroom along the conveyor as they exited the oven.

Upon completion, the bun was sliced down the middle by bakers, and spectators were asked to don rubber gloves and first lift the wiener in one piece for photos, and then insert it into the bun. After being topped with mustard and ketchup, the completed hot dog was lifted by the assembled spectators {{convert|30|cm|in}} off the conveyor for photos. Finally, the official measurement was completed, and the wiener was {{convert|60|m|ft|sigfig=3}} in length, with the bun coming in at {{convert|60.3|m|ft|sigfig=3}} in length. After photos and video of the official measurement were completed, the hot dog was cut into sections and the assembled spectators each had a piece. However, this only used about {{convert|8|m|ft}} of the hot dog.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">The '''World Curling Rankings''' system is designed to track and list the amount of success achieved by each member association of the [[World Curling Federation]] (WCF) in a given curling season. The system, which was implemented in December 2006, is similar to the [[FIFA World Rankings|ranking system]] used by [[FIFA]]. The events taken into account when calculating each nation's score include the [[Curling at the Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]], the [[World Curling Championships]], the [[European Curling Championships]], and the [[Pacific Curling Championships]]. The system was developed by [[Patrick Hürlimann]], who is a former [[List of Olympic medalists in curling|Olympic champion]] and was the vice president of the WCF from 2010 to 2012.

==Method of calculation==
The points are calculated for each nation based on performance during the last six curling seasons. Results in seasons prior to the current season are scaled by the following factors:
{| class="wikitable" style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center"
|-
|align=left bgcolor=#efefef| Years prior to current season ||width=20| 0 ||width=20| 1 ||width=20| 2 ||width=20| 3 ||width=20| 4 ||width=20| 5
|-

|}

===Points distribution===
Points are allocated based on the final rankings of each nation at an eligible event.

====International events====
The points distributions are given for each event as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center"
|+Winter Olympic Games

|}

====Regional events====
All nations that qualify for the World Curling Championships receive 50 points, regardless of final ranking in regional events, if applicable.

Nations in the European or Pacific Curling Championships that do not qualify for the World Championships receive less than 50 points. Based on their final ranking in the tournament, nations receive 49 or fewer points, in decrements of 1 point.
