      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5655">'''‘Aql''' ({{lang-ar|عقل}}, meaning "intellect"), is an [[Arabic language]] term used in [[Islamic philosophy]] or [[Schools of Islamic theology|theology]] for the [[intellect]] or the [[reason|rational]] [[Faculties of the soul|faculty of the soul]] or mind. It is the normal translation of the Greek term ''[[nous]]''. In [[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence]], it is associated with using reason as a source for ''[[sharia]]'' "religious law" and has been translated as "dialectical reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Esposito | first =John | author-link =John Esposito  | year =2004 | title =The Oxford Dictionary of Islam | series =Oxford paperback reference | publication-place =Oxford, UK | publisher =Oxford University Press | page =22 | isbn =0-19-512559-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DivineGuide"&gt;{{Citation | last =Moezzi | first =Mohammad Ali Amir | year =1994 | title =The Divine Guide in Early Shiʻism: The Sources of Esotericism in Islam | publication-place =Albany | publisher =State University of New York Press | page =6 | isbn =0-7914-2121-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alkafi"&gt;{{Citation |title = Kitab al-Kafi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alamut"&gt;{{Citation |first=Anthony |last=Campbell |title = The Assassins of Alamut| year = 2004 |pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In Islam, the term ‘aql was heavily elucidated by early Shī‘ah thinkers; it came to replace and expand the pre-Islamic concept of ''ḥilm'' ({{lang-ar|حلم}}) "serene justice and self-control, dignity" in opposition to the negative notions of ignorance (''jahl'') and stupidity (''safah'').&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

The "possessor of ‘aql", or ''al-‘āqīl'' (plural ''al-‘uqqāl'') realises a deep connection with God. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Jaʿfar aṣ-Ṣādiq]] (d. 765, notably an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imām]]) described this connection as a realisation that God loves some, that God is truth and that only ''[[ilm (Arabic)|‘ilm]]'' "sacred knowledge" and its development can help humanity fulfil its potential.

His son, Imām [[Musa al-Kadhim|Mūsà al-Kāżim]] (d. 799), expanded this exegesis by defining ‘aql as the "faculty for apprehending the divine, a faculty of metaphysical perception, a light in the heart, through which one can discern and recognize signs from God."&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt; He further noted that where the A'immah (Imāms) are the ''ḥujjatu ż-żāhira'' "External proof [of God]", ‘aql is the ''ḥujjatu l-Bāṭina'' "Secret proof".&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

While in early Islam, ‘aql was opposed to ''jahl'' "ignorance", the expansion of the concept meant it was now opposed to ''safah'' "[deliberate] stupidity" and ''junūn'' "lack of sense, indulgence". Under the influence of [[Mu'tazili|Mu‘tazilī]] thought, ‘aql came to mean "dialectical reasoning".&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

== Shī‘ī Legal Implementation ==
In Shī‘ī jurisprudence, ‘aql is the process of using intellect or logic to deduce law. Legal scholars in both Sunni and Shī‘ī Islamic traditions share Quranic interpretation, the ''[[Sunnah]]'', and ''Ijma‘'' "consensus" as sources of Islamic law and judicial decisions (''ḥukm''). However, [[Twelver]]s of the Ja‘farī [[madh'hab|school of law]] utilize ‘aql whereas Sunnis use ''[[qiyas]]'' "analogical reasoning" as the fourth source of law.

Among Twelvers, [[Akhbari|Akhbārīs]] (associated with exotericism and traditionalism and theological schools in [[Qom]]) and [[Usuli]]s (associated with esotericism and rationalism and theological schools in [[Baghdad]]) were contending subschools: the former reject ''[[ijtihad|ijtihād]]'' outright; the latter advocate ''ijtihad'' and have been predominant for the last 300 years.&lt;ref name="DivineGuide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Masud | first =Muhammad Khalid | last2 =Messick | first2 =Binkley Morris | first3 =Powers | last3 =David Stephan | year =1996 | title =Islamic Legal Interpretation: Muftis and Their Fatwas  | series =Harvard studies in Islamic law | publication-place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =Harvard University Press | page =14 | isbn =0-674-46870-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shī‘ī Islam, "the gates of ''ijtihād''" were never closed and with the use of ‘aql, Shī‘ī ''mujtahid''s "practitioner of ''ijtihād''" and ''faqīh''s "legal specialists" are able to respond as issues arise that were not explicitly dealt with in the Qur'an or Sunnah.{{Islamic theology}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5681">'''Animal reflectors''' or mirrors are important to the survival of many kinds of animal, and, in some cases, have been mimicked by engineers developing [[photonic crystals]]. Examples are the scales of silvery fish, and the [[tapetum lucidum]] that causes the [[eyeshine]] of dogs and cats. All these reflectors work by interference of light in multilayer structures with dimensions less than a wavelength, so can be classed as photonic crystals. Other animal photonic crystals have evolved to reflect narrow spectra, producing [[animal coloration]].

==Functions of animal reflectors==
===Camouflage===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:170306 Denton mirror(65a).png|frame|Fig.1. Why reflecting flanks camouflage fish.  The fish is represented by a vertical mirror S. A predator (A or B) sees reflected light very similar to the light it would see if the fish were not there (x1 vs x2 and y1 vs y2).  From...&lt;ref&gt;Denton, E.J. and Nichol, J.A.C.(1965) Studies on reflexion of light from silvery surfaces of fish, with special reference to the bleak, ''Alburnus alburnus''. J. Mar. Biol. Ass. U.K. 45, 683-703.&lt;/ref&gt;]]  --&gt;The scales of silvery fish, by reflecting light from the flank make detection by a predator difficult because the reflected light is similar to the incident light in the absence of the prey (Fig. 1).

===Focusing light===
The eyes of some bivalve mollusks, such as the scallop (Pecten) use a concave mirror, the argentea, at the back of the eye, to create an image on the retina. The deep-sea ostracod Gigantocypris has eyes with parabolic reflectors. The compound eyes of long-bodied decapod crustaceans, such as shrimps and lobsters, use mirrors in square boxes &lt;ref&gt;Land, M.F.(2000) Eyes with mirror optics. Journal of Optics A - Pure and Applied Optics 2 (6) R44-R50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing retinal sensitivity===
Most nocturnal vertebrates have a reflecting [[tapetum lucidum]] behind the retina, which produces the '[[eyeshine]]' seen in cats and dogs.  Incoming photons that are not absorbed by the photoreceptors are reflected back, increasing their chances of being absorbed and generating nerve signals.

==Mechanisms of reflection==
[[File: Animal Reflectors Fig 2.png|frame|A. The cells of the tapetum of the cat contain arrays of rodlets with a spacing at about λ/2.&lt;ref&gt;Pedler, C. (1963). The fine structure of the tapetum cellulosum. Expl Eye Res. 2,189-19&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Different lattice planes have different spacings and reflect different wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, J.A. (1971) Some reflective properties of the tapetum lucidum of the cat's eye. J. Physiol.(Lond.), 212, 393-409&lt;/ref&gt; C. The different domains of rodlets reflect different wavelengths to give an overall reflection with a wide spectral range.]]
Schultze, in 1872, stated without reservation that reflection from the multilayered structure of the tapeta of Carnivora is by interference.&lt;ref&gt;Schultze, M. (1872). Uber das Tapetum in der Choriodes des Auges der Raubthiere. Sitzungsberichte der niederrheinischen Gesellschaft für Natur- und Heilkunde, 29, 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Rayleigh (1887) mentions that a reflector composed of a stack of thin transparent layers will reflect more strongly than a single layer,&lt;ref&gt;Rayleigh, 3rd Baron (1887) XVII. On the maintenance of vibrations by forces of double frequency, and on the propagation of waves through a medium endowed with a periodic structure. Phil. Mag. Series 5, vol.24 No.147, 145-159, DOI: 10.1080/14786448708628074.&lt;/ref&gt; but only in 1917 did he publish a mathematical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Rayleigh, 3rd Baron (1917). On the reflection of light from a regularly stratified medium. Proc. R. Soc. A, 93. 565-577.&lt;/ref&gt; Multilayer reflectors were constructed by engineers in the 1950s (see [[dielectric mirror]]) and in 1966 M.F. Land published a full analysis of an animal reflector that included electron microscopy, optical measurements, and a clear explanation of the theory &lt;ref&gt;Land, M.F. (1966) A multilayer interference reflector in the eye of the scallop. J. Exp. Biol. 45, 433-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflectors with a one-dimensional multilayer structure===
Animal multilayer reflectors work in the same way as a man-made [[dielectric mirror]] (or Bragg mirror) being composed of alternating layers of high and low refractive index, the thickness of each layer being 1/4 the wavelength most strongly reflected.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, A.F. (1968) A theoretical treatment of reflexion of light by multilayer structures. J. Exp. Biol. 48 (2) 227-245.&lt;/ref&gt; To reflect a wide range of wavelengths, the spacing must vary through the thickness of the stack.&lt;ref&gt;Land, M.F. (1972) The physics and biology of animal reflectors. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 24, 75-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectors made of alternating layers of flat guanine crystals (refractive index, n = 1.83) and cytoplasm (n ≈ 1.33) have evolved independently in fish scales and in the tapeta of the eyes of elasmobranchs (Gur 2017).  The tapetum of the bush-baby, Galago crassicaudatus, has a similar structure, but with crystals of riboflavin (n = 1.73).

===Reflectors with a two-dimensional structure===
The [[tapetum lucidum|tapetum]] of [[Carnivora]] (cats, dogs, lions etc.) contains remarkably regular arrays of rodlets, and reflects light from planes of the lattice by [[Bragg's Law]] (Fig. 2A). Each domain of rodlets has a different spacing and reflects a different colour from the main plane (shown horizontal in Fig. 2B) so with near-parallel illumination, spots of different colors are seen (Fig.1C). Because there are lattice planes at many inclinations, the tapetum as a whole reflects diffusely and is scarcely iridescent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4949">'''Canopy research''' is the field of [[scientific research]] based upon data collected in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] of trees.

==Objects==
* Description of plant and animal [[species]] residing in the tree-summits. Mainly [[ancient forest]]s and [[tropical forest]]s are studied.
* Study of forest [[ecosystem]] dynamics, change drivers and other factors that shape [[forest]] systems.
* Collection of [[meteorology|meteorological]] data.  Meteorological studies can help researchers measure the efficacy of forest canopies in offsetting [[global climate change]].  Researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have [[calibration|calibrated]] a model for forest canopies that measures and estimates the amount of carbon a forest canopy absorbs/releases due to [[photosynthesis]]/[[Cellular respiration|respiration]].  The research found that the forest canopy shifted from a carbon “sink” (of net carbon absorption due to photosynthesis) to a carbon “source” (of net carbon respiration) following the [[defoliation]] of the canopy due to the [[gypsy moth]].  [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100331.htm]   This research helps scientists determine the role of trees in offsetting carbon released into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming, and the biological influences that impact it.

==Chief discoveries==
* 90% of animal and 50% of plant species in tropical rainforests live in the upper levels of the large trees. As many as 1000 different insects have been collected from one tree.
* Tropical forests require a minimum area to develop their crucial [[micro climate]] and to provide [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] for larger [[mammal]]s.
* While grown forests continue to store [[carbon dioxide]], young forests store up ten times more.

Canopy research is a relatively new scientific field which was hampered for a long time by lack of means of access to the tree canopies and lack of appropriate means of housing researchers.

[[Climbing]] gear, [[tree house]]s, [[canopy walkway]]s, [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, [[airship]]s and inflatable platforms resting on the treetops have lately overcome these barriers.

* Cranes have proven to offer the best three-dimensional access. The effort to set them up is worthwhile, as most research projects are long term.
* Airships (or dirigibles, or blimps) offer the best means of accessing large areas of canopy.
* [[Tree house]]s are best for housing because they offer dry, light and secure accommodation without cutting down an area of forest.

'''Carmine Benincasa''' (born 17 December 1947 in [[Eboli]]) is an Italian art critic and [[Art History|art historian]] professor.

== Biography ==
'''Carmine Benincasa''' was born in [[Eboli]] in the south of Italy. After studying in a religious school he moved to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

He was a professor of art history at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Macerata]], the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Florence]] and Professor of History of Art at the [[Faculty of Architecture]] of the [[University La Sapienza]] in Rome. During this period he met intellectuals like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]],&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0357919&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Bruno Zevi]] and many more.

From 1978 to 1982 he was a member of the [[Venice Biennale]] Visual Arts Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/10/16/biennale-il-psi-fa-incetta-di-poltrone.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Environment. In 1994 he was briefly accused and incarcerated for defrauding collectors by validating and selling false artworks.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/07/08/critico-arte-professore-in-cella-per.html&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently thrown out of court for lack of evidence. Benincasa was eventually cleared of every wrongdoing by the [[Supreme Court of Italy]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id%3D239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804000431/http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id=239 |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benincasa has published numerous essays, articles and monographs on artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Mario Ceroli]], [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Joan Mirò]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Giorgio Morandi]]. He has also organized many international exhibitions, including a section of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982.

Benincasa is currently chief editor of the Italian edition of ''[[Cahiers d'Art]]''.

'''Chamber of Computer Engineers of Turkey''' ({{lang-tr|Bilgisayar Mühendisleri Odası}}, abbreviated BMO) was founded on 2 June 2012. 

Formerly, the computer engineers in [[Turkey]] were the members of  [[Chamber of Electrical Engineers of Turkey]]. But, on 9 March 2011 computer engineers decided to form their own chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ankara/19780205.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Bilgisayar mühendisleri oda kuruyor |date=2012-01-27 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulatory board announced that each year about 6,500 new CS engineers (including related undergraduate studies) graduate from the universities.&lt;ref name="BMO"&gt;[http://bmo.org.tr/2012/06/02/bilgisayar-muhendisleri-odasinin-kurulusu-onaylandi/ Chamber page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; During the general assembly of [[Union of chambers of Turkish engineers and architects]] on the 2 June 2012, the request was approved.&lt;ref name="BMO"/&gt; The chamber has become the 24th member of the union - UCTEA.

A '''complementarity problem''' is a type of [[mathematical optimization]] problem. It is the problem of optimizing (minimizing or maximizing) a function of two [[vector space|vector]] variables subject to certain requirements (constraints) which include: that the [[inner product]] of the two vectors must equal zero, i.e. they are orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Billups | first1=Stephen | last2=Murty | first2=Katta | title=Complementarity Problems | doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(00)00432-5|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~murty/LCPart.ps | year=2000 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | volume=124 | pages=303| bibcode=2000JCoAM.124..303B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for finite-dimensional real vector spaces this means that, if one has vectors ''X'' and ''Y'' with all ''nonnegative'' components (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;: in the [[first quadrant]] if 2-dimensional, in the first [[octant (solid geometry)|octant]] if 3-dimensional), then for each pair of components ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; one of the pair must be zero, hence the name ''complementarity''. e.g. ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;0) and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;2) are complementary, but ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;1) and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2,&amp;nbsp;0) are not. A complementarity problem is a special case of a [[variational inequality]].

==History==
Complementarity problems were originally studied because the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]] in [[linear programming]] and [[quadratic programming]] constitute a [[linear complementarity problem]] (LCP) or a [[mixed complementarity problem]] (MCP). In 1963 [[Carlton E. Lemke|Lemke]] and [[J.T. Howson|Howson]] showed that, for two person games, computing a [[Nash equilibrium]] point is equivalent to an LCP. In 1968 [[Richard W. Cottle|Cottle]] and [[George B. Dantzig|Dantzig]] unified linear and quadratic programming and [[bimatrix game]]s. Since then the study of complementarity problems and variational inequalities has expanded enormously.

Areas of [[mathematics]] and [[science]] that contributed to the development of complementarity theory
include: [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems, [[Variational inequality|variational inequality theory]], [[fixed point theory]], [[topological degree theory]] and [[nonlinear analysis]].

'''[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]]''' has been considered as a dominant paradigm, or research programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |chapter=Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes |editor1-first=Imre |editor1-last=Lakatos |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Musgrave |title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |volume=4 |series=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA91 |date=2 September 1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |pages=91–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of '''[[science education]]'''. The term constructivism is widely used in many fields, and not always with quite the same intention. This entry offers an account of how constructivism is most commonly understood in science education.

==Description==
Science Education is now an established field within Education, and worldwide has its own journals, conferences, university departments and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Fensham |title=The Evolution of Science Education as a Field of Research: Defining an Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE9WVALhQTAC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-1468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a diverse field, a major influence on its development was research considered to be undertaken from a constructivist perspective on learning, and supporting approaches to teaching that themselves became labelled constructivist. Thus, this constructivism was largely of a psychological flavour, often drawing on the work of [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Child's Conception Of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWZIOL0NDLwC |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5951-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Principles of Genetic Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-avb4T8ksC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-16890-8 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ausubel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, D.P. |title=Educational Psychology: A cognitive view |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |location=New York |year=1968 |isbn=978-0030696404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. Gagné]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gagné, R.M. |title=The Conditions of Learning |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |year=1970 |isbn=978-0039100698 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome S. |last=Bruner |title=The Process of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iaq5R8vPujAC |year=1977 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-71001-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influential group of science education researchers were also heavily influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)]]'s [[Personal Construct Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Kelly |title=A Theory of Personality: The Psychology of Personality Constructs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp5iH1deNNEC |year=1963 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-00152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Thought and Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkz7stcdbKgC |year=1986 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-72010-6 |origyear=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxjjUefze_oC |year=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-57629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since being championed in the West by [[Jerome Bruner]]) has also been increasingly influential.

These workers from psychology informed the first generation of science education researchers. Active research groups developed in centres like the [[University of Waikato]] (Aotearoa/New Zealand), [[University of Leeds]] (UK) and [[University of Surrey]] (UK), with a strong interest in students' ideas in science (formed before, or during instruction) as these were recognised as being highly influential on future learning, and so whether canonical scientific would be learnt. This work, sometimes labelled the 'alternative conceptions movement' was motivated by a series of influential publications on children's ideas in science and their implications for learning (and so for how teaching should be planned to take them into account). Whilst a range of influential papers could be cited it has been suggested that a number of seminar contributions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Easley, J. |title=Pupils and paradigms: a review of literature related to concept development in adolescent science students |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=5 |pages=61–84 |year=1978 |doi=10.1080/03057267808559857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Erickson, G. |title=Theories-in-action: some theoretical and empirical issues in the study of students' conceptual frameworks in science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–60 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Watts, D.M. |title=Concepts, misconceptions and alternative conceptions: changing perspectives in science education |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–98 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Osborne, R.J. |author3=Fensham, P.J. |title=Children's science and its consequences for teaching |journal=Science Education |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=623–633 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730660412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osborne, R.J. |author2=Wittrock, M.C. |title=Learning Science: a generative process |journal=Science Education |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=489–508 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730670406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect set out the commitments, or 'hard core' of a constructivist research programme into the learning and teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taber, K.S. |title=Beyond Constructivism: the Progressive Research Programme into Learning Science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=125–184 |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/03057260608560222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taber09&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was also the focus of a number of books aimed at the science education community - researchers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driver, R. |title=The Pupil as Scientist? |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1983 |isbn=978-0335101788 |oclc=10585522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Guesne, E. |author3=Tiberghien, A. |title=Children's Ideas in Science |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1985 |isbn=978-0335150403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul J. |last1=Black |first2=Arthur M. |last2=Lucas |title=Children's Informal Ideas in Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlxS0fBb5woC |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-00539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These papers presented learning as process of personal sense making, and an iterative matter such that what is learnt was channelled by existing knowledge and understanding (whether canonical or alternative), and teaching as needing to take learners' existing ideas into account in teaching. The research programme soon amounted to thousands of studies on aspects of students' (of different ages and educational levels, from different countries) thinking and learning in science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duit, R. |title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education) |year=2009 |publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education |url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There have been a wide range of criticisms of constructivist work in science, including strong criticism from philosophical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthews, M.R. |title=Discontent With Constructivism |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=24 |pages=165–172 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/03057269408560045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scerri, E.R. |title=Philosophical confusion in chemical education research |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1021/ed080p468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms have done little to stem the influence of the perspective, perhaps because they tend not to refer to the core tenets of constructivism as an approach based on learning theory and research from cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt;

==Alternative conceptions and conceptual frameworks in science education==
Learners' ideas in science have been variously labelled as [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Alternative%20conception.html alternative conceptions], alternative conceptual frameworks, preconceptions, [[scientific misconceptions]], naive theories etc. Although some scholars have attempted to distinguish between these terms, there is no consensual usage and often these terms are in effect synonymous.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt; It has been found that some alternative conceptions are very common, although others appear quite idiosyncratic. Some seem to be readily overcome in teaching, but others have proved to be tenacious and to offer a challenge to effective instruction. Sometimes it is considered important to distinguish fully developed conceptions (i.e., explicit ways of understanding aspects of the natural work that are readily verbalised) from more 'primitive' features of cognition acting at a tacit level, such as the so-called phenomenology primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=diSessa, A.A. |title=Towards an epistemology of physics |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=105–225 |year=1993 |doi=10.1080/07370008.1985.9649008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'knowledge-in-pieces' perspective suggests the latter act as resources for new learning which have potential to support the development of either alternative or canonical knowledge according to how teachers proceed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.P. |author2=diSessa, A.A. |author3=Roschelle, J. |title=Misconceptions reconceived: a constructivist analysis of knowledge in transition |journal=The Journal of the Learning Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=115–163 |year=1993 |doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) tend to be seen as learning impediments to be overcome. What research has shown is the prevalence among learners at all levels of alternative ways to thinking about just about all [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Science%20Topics.html science topics], and a key feature of guidance to teachers is to elicit students' ideas as part of the teaching process. The success of constructivism is that this is now largely taken-for-granted in science teaching and has become part of standard teaching guidance in many contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Key Stage 3 National Strategy. (2002). Framework for teaching science: years 7, 8 and 9. London: Department for Education and Skills.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously there was a strong focus on the abstract nature of concepts to be learnt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shayer, M. |author2=Adey, P. |title=Towards a Science of Science Teaching: Cognitive development and curriculum demand |publisher=Heinemann Educational Books |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0435578251 |oclc=7759952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but little awareness that often the teacher was not seeking to replace ignorance with knowledge, but rather to modify and develop learners existing thinking which was often at odds with the target knowledge set out in the curriculum.

===Constructivist science teaching===
Constructivism is seen as an educational theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; and a key perspective to inform pedagogy. There are many books informing teachers and others about constructivist research findings and ideas, and giving guidance on how to teach science form a constructivist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter J. |last1=Fensham |first2=Richard T. |last2=White |first3= |title=The Content of Science: A Constructivist Approach to Its Teaching and Learning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg6dlitxLm0C |year=1994 |publisher=Falmer Press |isbn=978-0-7507-0221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Joel J. |editor1-last=Mintzes |editor2-first=James H. |editor2-last=Wandersee |editor3-first=Joseph D. |editor3-last=Novak |title=Teaching Science for Understanding: A Human Constructivist View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zXcrHWhnDwC |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-087924-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth G. |last=Tobin |title=The Practice of Constructivism in Science Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47LuS0m9heEC |date=12 November 2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-48974-7 |origyear=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.S. |last=Taber |title=Chemical Misconceptions: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Cure : Classroom Resources |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_P0V8vIBhUC |year=2002 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn=978-0-85404-381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-cultural communication''' is a field of study that looks at how people from differing [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to [[communication|communicate]] across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/home/default.aspx Japan Intercultural Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and culture==
During the [[Cold War]], the economy of the United States was largely self-contained because the world was polarized into two separate and competing powers: the [[Eastern Bloc|East]] and the [[Western Bloc|West]]. However, changes and advancements in economic relationships, political systems, and technological options began to break down old cultural barriers. Business transformed from individual-country capitalism to [[Globalization#Modern|global capitalism]]. Thus, the study of cross-cultural communication was originally found within businesses and government, both seeking to expand globally. Businesses began to offer [[Language education|language training]] to their employees and programs were developed to train employees to understand how to act when abroad.  With this also came the development of the [[Foreign Service Institute]], or FSI, through the [[Foreign Service Act]] of 1946, where government employees received training and prepared for overseas posts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, William B. Hart, &amp; Yoshitaka Miike (2002). Edward T. Hall and The History of Intercultural Communication: The United States and Japan. Keio Communication Review No. 24, 1-5. Accessible at http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2002/review24/2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; There began also implementation of a “[[world view]]” perspective in the curriculum of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 44, 48, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1974, the [[International Progress Organization]], with the support of [[UNESCO]] and under the auspices of [[Senegal]]ese President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], held an international conference on "The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations" ([[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], 27–29 July 1974) which called upon [[United Nations]] member states "to organize systematic and global comparative research on the different cultures of the world" and "to make all possible efforts for a more intensive training of diplomats in the field of international cultural co-operation ... and to develop the cultural aspects of their foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Köchler]] (ed.), Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations. Tübingen: Erdmann, 1978, {{ISBN|978-3-7711-0311-8}}, Final Resolution, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has become an increasing pressure for universities across the world to incorporate intercultural and international understanding and knowledge into the education of their students. &lt;ref&gt;Deardorff, D. K. (2015). A 21st Century Imperative: integrating intercultural competence in Tuning. Tuning Journal for Higher Education, 3(1), 137–147. https://doi.org/10.18543/tjhe-3(1)-2015pp137-147
&lt;/ref&gt; International literacy and cross-cultural understanding have become critical to a country’s cultural, technological, economic, and political health. It has become essential for universities to educate, or more importantly, “transform”, to function effectively and comfortably in a world characterized by close, multi-faceted relationships and permeable borders. Students must possess a certain level of global competence to understand the world they live in and how they fit into this world. This level of global competence starts at ground level- the university and its faculty- with how they generate and transmit cross-cultural knowledge and information to students.&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavors to bring together the relatively unrelated fields of [[cultural anthropology]] with established areas of communication. At its core, cross-cultural communication involves understanding the ways in which culturally distinct individuals communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication requires an interdisciplinary approach. It involves literacy in fields such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

== Global rise ==
With increasing [[globalization]] and international trade, it is unavoidable that different cultures will meet, conflict, and blend together. People from different culture find it is difficult to communicate not only due to language barriers, but also are affected by culture styles.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/#facts-and-figures| title=Fact and Figure about cross cultural training.| accessdate=3 December 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[individualistic culture]]s, such as in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, an independent figure or self is dominant. This independent figure is characterized by a sense of self relatively distinct from others and the environment. In [[Self-enhancement#Culture|interdependent cultures]], usually identified as Asian, Latin American, African, and Southern European cultures, an interdependent figure of self is dominant. There is a much greater emphasis on the interrelatedness of the individual to others and the environment; the self is meaningful only (or primarily) in the context of social relationships, duties, and roles. In some degree, the effect brought by cultural difference override the language gap. This culture style difference contributes to one of the biggest challenges for cross-culture communication. Effective communication with people of different cultures is especially challenging. Cultures provide people with ways of thinking—ways of seeing, hearing, and interpreting the world. Thus the same words can mean different things to people from different cultures, even when they speak the "same" language. When the languages are different, and translation has to be used to communicate, the potential for misunderstandings increases. The study of cross-cultural communication is a global research area.  As a result, cultural differences in the ''study'' of cross-cultural communication can already be found.  For example, cross-cultural communication is generally considered part of [[communication studies]] in the US, but is emerging as a sub-field of [[applied linguistics]] in the UK.

== Incorporation into college programs ==
The application of cross-cultural communication theory to foreign language education is increasingly appreciated around the world. Cross-cultural communication classes can now be found within foreign language departments of some universities, while other schools are placing cross-cultural communication programs in their departments of education.

With the increasing pressures and opportunities of globalization, the incorporation of international networking alliances has become an “essential mechanism for the internationalization of higher education”.&lt;ref&gt;Teather, D. (2004). The networking alliance: A mechanism for the internationalisation of higher education? Managing Education Matters, 7(2), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities from around the world have taken great strides to increase intercultural understanding through processes of organizational change and innovations. In general, university processes revolve around four major dimensions which include: organizational change, curriculum innovation, staff development, and student mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Rudzki, R. E. J. (1995). The application of a strategic management model to the internationalization of higher education institutions. Higher Education, 29(4), 421-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellingboe emphasizes these four major dimensions with his own specifications for the internationalization process. His specifications include: (1) college leadership; (2) faculty members' international involvement in activities with colleagues, research sites, and institutions worldwide; (3) the availability, affordability, accessibility, and transferability of study abroad programs for students; (4) the presence and integration of international students, scholars, and visiting faculty into campus life; and (5) international co-curricular units (residence halls, conference planning centers, student unions, career centers, cultural immersion and language houses, student activities, and student organizations).&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"/&gt;

Above all, universities need to make sure that they are open and responsive to changes in the outside environment. In order for internationalization to be fully effective, the university (including all staff, students, curriculum, and activities) needs to be current with cultural changes, and willing to adapt to these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, K.S. (1984). Organizational adaptation and higher education. Journal of Higher Education 55(2), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Ellingboe, internationalization “is an ongoing, future-oriented, multidimensional, interdisciplinary, leadership-driven vision that involves many stakeholders working to change the internal dynamics of an institution to respond and adapt appropriately to an increasingly diverse, globally focused, ever-changing external environment".&lt;ref&gt;Ellingboe, B.J. (1998). Divisional strategies to internationalize a campus portrait: Results, resistance, and recommendations from a case study at a U.S. university, in Mestenhauser, J.A. and Ellingboe, B.J (eds.), Reforming the Higher Education Curriculum: Internationalizing the Campus. Phoenix, AZ: American Council on Education and Oryx Press, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; New distance learning technologies, such as interactive teleconferencing, enable students located thousands of miles apart to communicate and interact in a virtual classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has indicated that certain themes and images such as children, animals, life cycles, relationships, and sports can transcend cultural differences, and may be used in international settings such as traditional and online university classrooms to create common ground among diverse cultures (Van Hook, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, S.R. (2011, 11 April). Modes and models for transcending cultural differences in international classrooms. Journal of Research in International Education, 10(1), 5-27. http://jri.sagepub.com/content/10/1/5&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theories for cross-cultural communication are based on the work done looking at value differences between different cultures, especially the works of [[Edward T. Hall]], [[Richard D. Lewis]], [[Geert Hofstede]], and [[Fons Trompenaars]]. [[Clifford Geertz]] was also a contributor to this field. Also Jussi V. Koivisto's model on cultural crossing in internationally operating organizations elaborates from this base of research.

These theories have been applied to a variety of different communication theories and settings, including general business and management ([[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]]) and marketing ([[Marieke de Mooij]], [[Stephan Dahl]]). There have also been several successful educational projects which concentrate on the practical applications of these theories in cross-cultural situations.

These theories have also been criticized mainly by management scholars (e.g. [[Nigel Holden]]) for being based on the culture concept derived from 19th century cultural anthropology and emphasizing on culture-as-difference and culture-as-essence. Another criticism has been the uncritical way [[Hofstede]]’s dimensions are served up in textbooks as facts ([[Peter W. Cardon]]). There is a move to focus on 'cross-cultural interdependence' instead of the traditional views of comparative differences and similarities between cultures. Cross-cultural management is increasingly seen as a form of [[knowledge management]]. While there is debate in academia, over what cross-cultural teams can do in practice, a meta-analysis by [[Günter Stahl]], [[Martha Maznevski]], [[Andreas Voigt]] and [[Karsten Jonsen]] on research done on multicultural groups, concluded "Research suggests that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Günter|last2=Maznevski|first2=Martha|last3=Voigt|first3=Andreas|last4=Jonsen|first4=Karsten|title=Unraveling the Effects of Cultural Diversity in Teams: A Meta-Analysis of Research on Multicultural Work Groups|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=May 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=690–709|jstor=40604760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Master of Science in Management]] programs have an internationalization specialization which may place a focus on cross-cultural communication. For example, the [[Ivey Business School]] has a course titled Cross Cultural Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross Cultural Management|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/msc/courses/cross-cultural-management/|website=Ivey Business School|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross cultural communication gives opportunities to share ideas, experiences, and different perspectives and perception by interacting with local people.

==International educational organizations==

===WYSE International===

[[WYSE International]] is a worldwide educational charity specializing in education and development for emerging leaders established in 1989. It is a non-governmental organization associated with the [[Department of Public Information]] of the United Nations.

Over 3000 participants from 110 countries have attended their courses, they have run in 5 continents. Its flagship International Leadership Programme is a 12-day residential course for 30 people from on average 20 different countries (aged 18 – 35).

WYSE International's website states its aims are to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"provide education independently of political, religious or social backgrounds and promote visionary leadership capable of responding to evolving world needs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyse-ngo.org/ WYSE International website&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MEET - Middle East Education through Technology===

[[MEET - Middle East Education through Technology]] is an innovative educational initiative aimed at creating a common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders. Israeli and Palestinian students are selected through an application process and work in small bi-national teams to develop technology and business projects for local impact. Through this process of cross-cultural communication, students build mutual respect, cultural competence and understanding of each others.

==Aspects==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

There are several parameters that may be perceived differently by people of different cultures:

* High- and low-context cultures: context is the most important cultural dimension and also difficult to define. The idea of context in culture was advanced by the anthropologist Edward T Hall. He divides culture into two main groups: High and Low context cultures. He refers to context as the stimuli, environment or ambiance surrounding the environment.  Depending on how a culture relies on the three points to communicate their meaning, will place them in either high or low- context cultures. For example, Hall goes on to explain that low-context cultures assume that the individuals know very little about what they are being told, and therefore must be given a lot of background information. High-context cultures assume the individual is knowledgeable about the subject and has to be given very little background information.
* Nonverbal, oral and written: the main goal behind improving intercultural audiences is to pay special attention to specific areas of communication to enhance the effectiveness of the intercultural messages. The specific areas are broken down into three sub categories: nonverbal, oral and written messages.

Nonverbal contact involves everything from something as obvious as eye contact and facial expressions to more discreet forms of expression such as the use of space. Experts have labeled the term [[kinesics]] to mean communicating through body movement. Huseman, author of ''Business Communication'', explains that the two most prominent ways of communication through kinesics are eye contact and facial expressions.

Eye contact, Huseman goes on to explain, is the key factor in setting the tone between two individuals and greatly differs in meaning between cultures. In the Americas and Western Europe, eye contact is interpreted the same way, conveying interest and honesty. People who avoid eye contact when speaking are viewed in a negative light, withholding information and lacking in general confidence. However, in the Middle East, Africa, and especially Asia, eye contact is seen as disrespectful and even challenging of one's authority. People who make eye contact, but only briefly, are seen as respectful and courteous. 

Facial expressions are their own language by comparison and universal throughout all cultures. Dale Leathers, for example, states that facial expression can communicate ten basic classes of meaning.

The final part to nonverbal communication lies in our gestures, and can be broken down into five subcategories:
* '''Emblems'''
Emblems refer to sign language (such as, thumbs up, one of the most recognized symbols in the world) 
* '''Illustrators''' 
Illustrators mimic what is spoken (such as gesturing how much time is left by holding up a certain number of fingers). 
* '''Regulators''' 
Regulators act as a way of conveying meaning through gestures (raising up a hand for instance indicates that one has a certain question about what was just said) and become more complicated since the same regulator can have different meanings across different cultures (making a circle with a hand, for instance, in the Americas means agreement, in Japan is symbolic for money, and in France conveys the notion of worthlessness). 
* '''Affect displays''' 
Affect displays reveal emotions such as happiness (through a smile) or sadness (mouth trembling, tears). 
* '''Adaptors'''
Adaptors are more subtle such as a yawn or clenching fists in anger.

The last nonverbal type of communication deals with communication through the space around people, or proxemics. Huseman goes on to explain that Hall identifies three types of space:
# Feature-fixed space: deals with how cultures arrange their space on a large scale, such as buildings and parks.  
# Semifixed feature space: deals with how space is arranged inside buildings, such as the placement of desks, chairs and plants.
# Informal space: the space and its importance, such as talking distance, how close people sit to one another and office space are all examples. A production line worker often has to make an appointment to see a supervisor, but the supervisor is free to visit the production line workers at will.

Oral and written communication is generally easier to learn, adapt and deal with in the business world for the simple fact that each language is unique. The one difficulty that comes into play is [[paralanguage]], how something is said.

==Differences between Western communication and traditional Indigenous communication==

According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]],{{qualify evidence}} Western conversational interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Australian Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research interests ==
Prof. Hebert's research is published in several scholarly books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.amazon.com/David-G.-Hebert/e/B006L2XYMM | title=David G. Hebert on Amazon | publisher= Amazon.com| accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 30 different professional journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gASNnFkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao

===Music competition in Japan===
In 2012, Hebert published ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools'',&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2012). ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese School''. Dordrecht: Springer Press {{ISBN|9400721773}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book that identified the world's largest music competition and documented the experiences of its participants. With more than 14,000 competing [[wind bands]] and widely admired performances, Japan is an especially important nation for instrumental [[music education]], and Hebert's ethnographic and historical monograph has been described in the journal ''Music Education Research'' as "the most comprehensive information about concert (wind) band participation in any country."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gouzouasis and Alan Henderson (2012). Secondary Student Perspectives on Musical and Educational Outcomes from Participation in Band Festivals. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14613808.2012.714361 "Music Education Research"], 14(4), pp.479-498.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review in the ''British Journal of Music Education'', "David Hebert delved deep under the surface of the seemingly everyday where he discovered anomalies and cultural specifics that are unlike anything found in the West ... His book performs the remarkable: a call to explore new ways of doing high school band programmes differently."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Stanfield (2014). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9196573&amp;fileId=S0265051714000047 "British Journal of Music Education"], 31(1), pp.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt; A sociologist with Tokyo Metropolitan University has said that this book "can serve as an important reference and inform the decisions of those attempting to advance changes to the educational system."&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima, Hiroshi (2013). Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools. [http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/2/337.extract "Social Science Japan Journal"], 16(2), pp.337-340.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also describes Japanese composers, and has been used for concert program notes by prominent conductors, such as [[Eugene Corporon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lonestarwindorchestra.com/connect/concert-programs/notes-from-japan/ | title=Lonestar Wind Orchestra: Notes from Japan | publisher= Lonestar Wind Orchestra, Dallas, Texas, USA | accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Reynish (who describes it as "compulsory reading for anyone interested in Japanese music")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timreynish.com/repertoire/repertoire-by-country/japan.php#windb|title=Repertoire By Country - Repertoire - Tim Reynish|work=timreynish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book helps to explain why [[music competitions]] are a global phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David G. (2018, in press). Competition in Music. ''SAGE International Encyclopedia of Music and Culture'' (Janet Sturman, Ed.), Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music globalization, transculturation and hybridity===
According to Roberta Pike, Hebert asserts that "research is needed to explore the role of culture in music education."&lt;ref&gt;Roberta E. Pike, Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects (Fremont, CA: Jain, 2007), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; From a global perspective, Hebert has examined how musical practices, technologies, and genres are adopted into new contexts, including educational and religious traditions within institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D.

He twice served as keynote speaker for conferences on Music and [[Globalization]] in Poland (2014 and 2015), from which proceedings were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | last2 = Rykowski | first2 = Mikolaj |title = Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/music-glocalization | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9781527503939}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Pluralism and music institutions===
Hebert's work has also addressed the challenges of representing [[cultural diversity]] and embracing pluralism in music education, claiming for music a unique role in [[intercultural communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2010). "Ethnicity and Music Education: Sociological Dimensions". In Ruth Wright (Ed.), ''Sociology and Music Education.'' Aldershot: Ashgate Press, pp.93-114. {{ISBN|0754668010}}; David G. Hebert, Tuovi Martinsen, and Keld Hosbond (2010). [http://www2.siba.fi/musiikkikasvatuslehti/userfiles/FJME_vol13_1_nettiversio.pdf "Launching the Nordic Master of Global Music Program"]. Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.88-91.&lt;/ref&gt; He has advocated for [[popular music pedagogy]] and [[world music]] pedagogy as innovative approaches for reaching a wider population of students.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. [https://www.amazon.com/Multicultural-Perspectives-Education-William-Anderson/dp/1607095408 Jazz and Rock Music]. In W. M. Anderson &amp; P. S. Campbell (Eds.), ''Multicultural Perspectives in Music Education'', Vol.1 (third edition) (pp.112-127). Lanham, MD: Rowman-Littlefield Publishers (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher educators have noted that Hebert "guides the reader toward a sociological understanding" of diversity,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Schmidt (2012). Book Review – Sociology and Music Education [http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/v22n1/visions/Schmidt_Book_Review_Sociology_and_Music_Education.pdf "Visions of Research in Music Education"], 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and offers "suggestions for 'empowering music teachers to respond appropriately to the complexity of ethnic differences'."&lt;ref&gt;Tami J. Draves (2011). Sociology and Music Education. "Journal of Historical Research in Music Education", 33(1), pp.109.&lt;/ref&gt; Extending in directions pioneered by his PhD mentor [[Patricia Shehan Campbell]], Hebert has also written of "the challenges of multicultural teaching in music" and "the central role that ethnic identity plays in musical meaning and engagement."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon G.

===Nationalism in music education===
Hebert co-edited with Alexandra Kertz-Welzel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandrakertzwelzel.com|title=Alexandra Kertz-Welzel|work=alexandrakertzwelzel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Professor and Chair, [[University of Munich]]), the 2012 book ''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book includes contributions by music education researchers from several continents, and discusses "how music contributes to the creation of an emotional climate in schools, and its function in fostering the formation of particular loyalties, identities and dispositions."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G. Parker (2016). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0046760X.2015.1088077 "History of Education"], 45(3), pp.395-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Music psychologist [[John Sloboda]] described this book as "a 'must read' resource for anyone interested in this topic."&lt;ref&gt;John Sloboda (2012). Patriotism and nationalism in music education: A review essay [http://www.ijea.org/v13r2/index.html#.VMOGxWTF_0h "International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts"], 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review in ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', Hebert and Kertz-Welzel pose "challenging questions about the role of music teachers in propagating and inculcating patriotic sentiments", and the book is relevant beyond the [[sociology of music]], to any "scholars engaged in researching comparative and political educational issues."&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Jamset. (2013). Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education. "Fontes Artis Musicae", 60(2), pp.123-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Hebert has argued that "intercultural music transmission" enables national boundaries to be positively transcended via music participation.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2001). [http://jrm.sagepub.com/content/49/3/212.abstract "The Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra: A Case Study of Intercultural Music Transmission"].

===Historical ethnomusicology===
Hebert's interests in global music [[historiography]] developed as he explored such topics as how European music was adopted in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2012) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-2178-4_2 "Where are These Bands From? – An Historical Overview"] in ''Wind Bands and Cultural Identity in Japanese Schools''. Dordrecht: Springer Press, pp.11-82. {{ISBN|9400721773}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how the American genres of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] ironically struggled to gain acceptance in American schools.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2011).

International Journal of Music Education, 36(1), pp. 14-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he produced a book with Jonathan McCollum (Washington College) entitled ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''.&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David (2014) [https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Historical-Ethnomusicology-Jonathan-McCollum/dp/0739168266 ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''] Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through use of "a broad spectrum of geocultural examples, the volume includes several engaging strategies for using and writing about history in order to understand the world's musics".&lt;ref&gt;Justin R. Hunter (2016). Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/608918 "NOTES"], 72(3), pp.534-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicologists Keith Howard, Daniel M. Neuman and Judah Cohen contributed chapters. Hebert now edits a book series in this field with Jonathan McCollum for [[Rowman and Littlefield]] press, ''The Lexington Series in Historical Ethnomusicology: Deep Soundings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://sociomusicology.blogspot.nl/2017/03/historical-ethnomusicology-book-series.html | title=Historical Ethnomusicology Book Series: Deep Soundings | publisher= Sociomusicology blog| accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Music technology and online music education===
Hebert has also been active in researching the application of new technologies in [[online music education]] and research.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. (2016). Technology and Arts Education Policy. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2016.1187932 "Arts Education Policy Review"], 117(3), pp.1-5 (Editorial Introduction, ''Technology'' Special Issue).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming interested in "[[big data]]", he authored an article examining the challenges of educating music teachers in a fully online doctoral program (at [[Boston University]]).&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2008). [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25487541 "Reflections on Teaching the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music Online"]. International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music, 39(1), pp.93-103; David G. Hebert (2007). [http://www.stthomas.edu/rimeonline/vol5/index.htm "Five Challenges and Solutions in Online Music Teacher Education"]. Research and Issues in Music Education, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This sparked some debate – with Kenneth H. Phillips, among others – that led to further publications on projects in Europe and Africa that made use of the Internet to support intercultural music exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthmann, Alex and Hebert, David (2012) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199928019.013.0037 "Music Learning and New Media in Virtual and Online Environments"].

===East Asian studies===
Hebert has researched music in Japan, where he lived for about 5 years, and he often lectures for leading universities and conservatories in China. He has published several articles and book chapters on western music in Japan (and Korea), and is editor of ''International Perspectives on Translation, Education, and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies'' (Springer), the 25th anniversary proceedings of the Nordic Association for Japanese and Korean Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | title = International Perspectives on Translation, Education, and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies | publisher = Springer | location = New York | url = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319684321 | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9783319684321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert has also drawn attention to East Asian arts through the [[International Sociological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://isaconf.confex.com/isaconf/wc2014/webprogram/Session4110.html

== Philosophical orientation ==
Hebert claims that [[postmodernist]] discourse no longer offers an adequate explanation for contemporary musical practices, and that most music philosophy suffers from an [[Ethnocentrism |ethnocentric]] orientation. Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited a period of "digital prehistory" to enter a phase of "data saturation" through ubiquitous [[mass surveillance]],&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). "Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.85-148 {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing conditions he describes as "glocalimbodied,"&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2009). [http://www.parlando.hu/2009-4-web-Herbert-Eng.htm "On Virtuality and Music Education in Online Environments"]. Parlando, 48(4) [in Hungarian translation, by Mariann Abraham].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that local and global forces converge to "stamp" the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media. Hebert also argues that music, now most commonly consumed in digital form, may be understood as "content" in a "selfie-stick society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | last2 = Rykowski | first2 = Mikolaj |title = Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age | publisher = Cambridge Scholars | location = Newcastle, UK | url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/music-glocalization | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9781527503939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, this new context results in music creation and consumption increasingly transcending earlier connections to space and time, engendering both a blurring and reactionary institutionalization of local genres and historical styles. Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re-envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of "flexibility",&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2009) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-90-481-2700-9_4 "Musicianship, Musical Identity and Meaning as Embodied Practice"] In T. Regelski &amp; J. T. Gates (Eds.), ''Music Education for Changing Times: Guiding Visions for Practice''. Dordrecht: Springer Press, pp.39-55. {{ISBN|9048126991}}&lt;/ref&gt; with inclusion of marginalized traditions, cultivation of both acoustic and digital competencies, and rejection of any ties to "[[aesthetic]] [[fundamentalism]]", [[techno-utopianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. (2016). Technology and Arts Education Policy. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2016.1187932 "Arts Education Policy Review"], 117(3), pp.1-5 (Editorial Introduction, ''Technology'' Special Issue).&lt;/ref&gt; [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David (2015) [http://mej.sagepub.com/content/101/3/77.abstract "Militarism and Music Education"]. ''Music Educators Journal'', vol.101, no. 3, pp.77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Music scholars have noted that Hebert "believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity'," and that "Music learned in school should have some connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an ‘embodied practice situated in sociocultural contexts’."&lt;ref&gt;Jeananne Nichols (2011). Music education for changing times: A review essay [http://ijea.org/v12r2/index.html "International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts"], 12.&lt;/ref&gt; An advocate for increased [[contemporary music]], [[music technology]], and [[popular music]] in schools, Hebert nevertheless warns that these should not be seen as panacea for poor teaching or inadequate funding and facilities, and that historical traditions – including the heritage of "classical" [[art music]] – still legitimately require ample space in school education.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert and Marja Heimonen (2013). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10632913.2013.803421 "Public Policy and Music Education in Norway and Finland"]. Arts Education Policy Review, 114(3), special issue on "Cosmopolitanism and Policy", pp.135-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert's work especially promotes the value of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] in [[teacher education]],&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert, Tuovi Martinsen, and Keld Hosbond (2010). [http://www2.siba.fi/musiikkikasvatuslehti/userfiles/FJME_vol13_1_nettiversio.pdf "Launching the Nordic Master of Global Music Program"]. Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.88-91; David G. Hebert and Eva Saether (2014).

Music Education Research, 16(4), pp.418-435.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasizes the importance of an international-comparative perspective for envisioning improvements to educational policies and practices.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hebert (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1584974/Keynote_International_Comparisons_in_the_Improvement_of_Education "International Comparisons in the Improvement of Education"]. Signum Temporis: Journal of Pedagogy and Psychology, 5(2), pp.17-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criticism.'' 
While largely accepted, some of Hebert's conclusions have faced opposition from other scholars. His research in Japan controversially suggests that some important aspects of music history are inaccurately "remembered", and he has argued that similar issues may be found in common music history textbooks in the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and McCollum, Jonathan (2014). "Philosophy of History and Theory in Historical Ethnomusicology". In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert, Eds., ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology''. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books / Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.85-148 {{ISBN|0739168266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebert asserts that music contests can have not only positive, but also negative consequences for participants and the musical traditions they display, and require careful design for desirable outcomes. Some music educators defend traditional pedagogies that Hebert and others claim need to be redeveloped or supplemented with new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fonder [https://genius.com/Mark-fonder-professor-of-music-education-at-ithaca-college-no-default-or-reset-necessary-large-ensembles-enrich-many-annotated "No Default or Reset Necessary – Large Ensembles Enrich Many."]; See debate between Hebert and Kenneth Phillips in 2008, [http://www.stthomas.edu/rimeonline/vol6/index.htm "Research and Issues in Music Education"], 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Walker and [[Roger Scruton]] would disagree with Hebert's position regarding the value of [[popular music pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walker (2007). ''Music Education: Cultural Values, Social Change and Innovation''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Bates has argued that a "cosmopolitan" perspective may already receive excessive emphasis in the field of music education,&lt;ref&gt;Vincent C. Bates (2014). [http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Bates13_1.pdf "Rethinking cosmopolitanism in music education."]. Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education 13(1): 310–27.&lt;/ref&gt; while Thomas Regelski has suggested that "culture" – a concept emphasized in much of Hebert's writings – is a nebulous construct with questionable utility for the field.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Regelski (2010). [http://www2.siba.fi/musiikkikasvatuslehti/userfiles/FJME_vol13_1_nettiversio.pdf "Culturalism, Multi-Culturalism, and Multi-Musical Prosperity."]. Finnish Journal of Music Education, 13(1), pp.95-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical activities ==
Primarily employed as a professor, Hebert continues to perform as a professional musician in various genres, and teaches a course in songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hib.no/personside/?username=DGH  | title=HiB Faculty Profile David Gabriel Hebert (Norwegian language) | publisher=hib.no | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A jazz trumpeter and classical bass baritone singer, in 2013-2015 he had occasional work as a professional chorus member (Edvard Grieg Kor)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://en.edvardgriegkor.no/singers/ | title=Edvard Grieg Kor: The Singers | publisher= Edvard Grieg Kor, Bergen, Norway | accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Bergen National Opera]], and [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;(McCollum and Hebert, 2014, p.409)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Hebert performed as singer-songwriter with [[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[alternative rock]] band ''Post Impression'', which shared stages with [[The Posies]], [[Heatmiser]] and [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]]. He later played as a member of Zimbabwean band Maichi [[Dumisani Maraire|Maraire]] and Kubatana, [[Seattle]]-based Cuban salsa band [[Son (music)|''Son]] ''de Cinco a Siete'', and his own jazz groups. Moving to Tokyo, he performed as trumpeter and vocalist in the duo ''Jazz de Iitomo'' with Johnny Todd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://johnnytoddpiano.com/ | title=Johnny Todd| publisher=Johnny Todd Piano| accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; jazz pianist/arranger and former bandleader for [[Don Ho]].

'''Dendrology''' ({{lang-grc|δένδρον}}, ''dendron'', "tree"; and {{lang-grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', ''science of'' or ''study of'') or '''[[xylology]]''' ({{lang-grc|ξύλον}}, ''ksulon'', "wood") is the science and study of [[Woody plant|wooded plants]] ([[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, and [[liana]]s), specifically, their taxonomic classifications. There is no sharp boundary between [[plant taxonomy]] and dendrology; however, woody plants not only belong to many different plant [[Family (biology)|families]], but these families may be made up of both woody and non-woody members. Some families include only a few woody [[species]]. Dendrology, as a discipline of industrial forestry, tends to focus on identification of economically useful woody plants and their taxonomic interrelationships.  As an academic course of study, dendrology will include all woody plants, native and non-native, that occur in a region.  A related discipline is the study of sylvics, which focuses on the autecology of [[genus|genera]] and species.

== Relationship with botany ==

Dendrology is often confused with [[botany]]. However, botany is the study of all types of general plants, while dendrology studies only woody plants. Dendrology may be considered a subcategory of botany that specializes in the characterization and identification of woody plants.

==Translation halt==
There are a lot of [[mRNA]]s that have been [[DNA transcription|transcribed]] but not [[mrna translation|translated]] during dictyate.&lt;ref name=maskin&gt;[http://www.molecule.org/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS1097276500802300 Molecule.org - Maskin Is a CPEB-Associated Factor that Transiently Interacts with eIF-4E] Barbara Stebbins-Boaz,1 Quiping Cao,1 Cornelia H de Moor,1 Raul Mendez,1 and Joel D Richter1&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before ovulation, the oocyte of interest activates these mRNA strains.

===Biochemistry mechanism=== &lt;!--maskin redirects here--&gt;
Translation of mRNA in dictyate is partly explained by molecules binding to sites on the mRNA strain, which results in that [[initiation factor]]s of translation can not bind to that site. Two such molecules, that impedes initiation factors, are [[CPEB]] and ''maskin'', which bind to [[cytoplasmic polyadenylation element|CPE]] (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element). When these two molecules remain together, then maskin binds the initiation factor [[eIF-4E]],&lt;ref name=maskin/&gt; and thus eIF4E can no longer interact with the other initiation factors&lt;ref&gt;Lodish 2008, p.351&lt;/ref&gt; and  no translation occurs. On the other hand, dissolution of the CPEB/maskin complex leads to eIF-4E binding to the initiation factor [[eIF-4G]],&lt;ref name=maskin/&gt; and thus translation starts, which contributes to the end of dictyate and further maturation of the oocyte.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7884">{{Other uses|ERA (disambiguation)}}
{{dictdef}}
An '''era''' is a span of time defined for the purposes of [[chronology]] or [[historiography]], as in the [[regnal era]]s in the history of a given monarchy, a [[calendar era]] used for a given [[calendar]], or the [[geological era]]s defined for the [[history of Earth]].

Comparable terms are [[Epoch (disambiguation)|epoch]], [[age (geology)|age]], [[Periodization|period]], [[saeculum]], [[aeon]] (Greek ''aion'') and   Sanskrit [[yuga]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|era}}
The word has been in use in English since 1615, and is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''aera'' "an era or epoch from which time is reckoned," probably identical to Latin ''æra'' "counters used for calculation," plural of ''æs'' "brass, money".
 
The Latin word use in chronology seems to have begun in 5th century [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain, where it appears in the ''History'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and in later texts. The [[Spanish era]] is calculated from 38 BC, perhaps because of a tax (cfr. [[indiction]]) levied in that year, or due to a miscalculation of the [[Battle of Actium]], which occurred in 31 BC. 

Like epoch, "era" in English originally meant "the starting point of an age"; the meaning "system of chronological notation" is c.1646; that of "historical period" is 1741.

==Use in chronology==
In [[chronology]], an '''era''' is the highest level for the organization of the measurement of [[time]]. A '''[[calendar era]]''' indicates a span of many years which are numbered beginning at a specific [[epoch (reference date)|reference date (epoch)]], which often marks the origin of a political state or [[cosmology]], dynasty, ruler, the birth of a leader, or another significant historical or mythological event; it is generally called after its focus accordingly as in ''[[Victorian era]]''.

===Geological era===
{{main|Era (geology)}}
In large-scale natural science, there is need for another time perspective, independent from human activity, and indeed spanning a far longer period (mainly prehistoric), where ''[[Era (geology)|geologic era]]'' refers to well-defined time spans. 
The next-larger division of geologic time is the [[aeon|eon]]. The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon is subdivided into eras.&lt;ref&gt;Short, N.M. (2009). [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html "Geologic Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418090602/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect2/Sect2_1b.html |date=2005-04-18 }} in [http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ''Remote Sensing Tutorial''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027181013/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2009-10-27 }}. [[NASA]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently three eras defined in the Phanerozoic; the following table lists them from youngest to oldest (BP is an abbreviation for "before present").

The older [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] eons are also divided into eras.

===Cosmological era===
For periods in the  [[history of the universe]], the term "[[Epoch (cosmology)|epoch]]" is typically preferred, but "era" is used e.g. of the "[[Stelliferous Era]]".

===Calendar eras===
{{main|Calendar era}}
Calendar eras count the years since a particular date (epoch), often one with religious significance. [[Anno mundi]] ("year of the world") refers to a group of calendar eras based on a [[Dating creation|calculation of the age of the world]], assuming it was created as described in the [[Book of Genesis]].  In Jewish religious contexts one of the versions is still used, and many [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious calendars used another version until 1728. Hebrew year 5772 AM began at sunset on 28 September 2011 and ended on 16 September 2012.  In the Western church [[Anno Domini]] (=AD = CE), counting the years since the birth of Jesus on traditional calculations, was always dominant. 

The [[Islamic calendar]], which also has variants, counts years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or emigration of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], which occurred in 622 CE. The Islamic year is some days shorter than 365; January 2012 fell in 1433 AH ("After Hijra").

For a time ranging from 1872 to the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Japanese used the imperial year system (''kōki''), counting from the year when the legendary [[Emperor Jimmu]] founded Japan which occurred in 660 BC.

Many [[Buddhist calendar]]s count from the death of the [[Buddha]], which according to the most commonly used calculations was in 545-543 BCE or 483 BCE. Dates are given as "BE" for "Buddhist Era"; 2000 CE was 2543 BE in the [[Thai solar calendar]].

Other calendar eras of the past counted from political events, such as the [[Seleucid era]] and the Ancient Roman ''[[ab urbe condita]]'' ("AUC"), counting from the foundation of the city.

===Regnal eras===
{{main|Regnal year}}
The word era also denotes the units used under a different, more arbitrary system where time is not represented as an endless continuum with a single reference year, but each unit starts counting from one again as if time starts again.  The use of [[regnal year]]s is a rather impractical system, and a challenge for historians if a single piece of the historical chronology is missing, and often reflects the preponderance in public life of an absolute ruler in many ancient cultures.  Such traditions sometimes outlive the political power of the throne, and may even be based on mythological events or rulers who may not have existed (for example Rome numbering from the rule of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]]).  In a manner of speaking the use of the supposed date of the birth of Christ as a base year is a form of an era.
 
In [[East Asia]], each emperor's reign may be subdivided into several reign periods, each being treated as a new era. The name of each was a motto or slogan chosen by the emperor. Different East Asian countries utilized slightly different systems, notably:

*[[Chinese era name|Chinese eras]]
*[[Japanese era name|Japanese era]]
*[[Korean era name|Korean eras]]
*[[Vietnamese era name|Vietnamese eras]]

A similar practice survived in the [[United Kingdom]] until quite recently, but only for formal official writings: in daily life the ordinary year A.D. has been used for a long time, but [[Acts of Parliament]] were dated according to the years of the reign of the current [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|Monarch]], so that "61 &amp; 62 Vict c. 37" refers to the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] passed in the session of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 61st/62nd year of the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

===Historiography===
"Era" can be used to refer to well-defined periods in historiography, such as the [[Roman era]], [[Elizabethan era]], [[Victorian era]], etc.
Use of the term for more recent periods or topical history might include [[Soviet era]], and "[[:Category:History of European art music|musical eras]]" in the history of modern [[popular music]], such as the "[[Big Band|Big Band era]]", "[[Disco era]]", etc.

'''Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure''' refers to the structure of sequences for eukaryotic chromosomes.  Some fine sequences are included in more than one class, so the classification listed is not intended to be completely separate.

==Chromosomal characteristics==
Some sequences are required for a properly functioning chromosome:
* [[Centromere]]: Used during cell division as the attachment point for the spindle fibers.
* [[Telomere]]:  Used to maintain chromosomal integrity by capping off the ends of the linear chromosomes.  This region is a [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]], but its function is more specific than a simple tandem repeat.

Throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, the overall structure of chromosome ends is conserved and is characterized by the telomeric tract - a series of short G-rich repeats. This is succeeded by an extensive subtelomeric region consisting of various types and lengths of repeats - the telomere associated sequences (TAS).&lt;ref name=Pryde1997&gt;Pryde FE, Gorham HC, Louis EJ (1997) Chromosome ends: all the same under their caps. Curr Opin Genet Dev 7(6):822-828&lt;/ref&gt; These regions are generally low in gene density, low in transcription, low in recombination, late replicating, are involved in protecting the end from degradation and end-to-end fusions and in completing replication. The subtelomeric repeats can rescue chromosome ends when telomerase fails, buffer subtelomerically located genes against transcriptional silencing and protect the genome from deleterious rearrangements due to ectopic recombination. They may also be involved in fillers for increasing chromosome size to some minimum threshold level necessary for chromosome stability; act as barriers against transcriptional silencing; provide a location for the adaptive amplification of genes; and be involved in secondary mechanism of telomere maintenance via recombination when telomerase activity is absent.

==Structural sequences==
Other sequences are used in replication or during interphase with the physical structure of the chromosome.
* [[Ori (genetics)|Ori, or Origin]]: Origins of replication.
* [[Matrix attachment region|MAR]]: Matrix attachment regions, where the DNA attaches to the nuclear matrix.

==Protein-coding genes==
Regions of the genome with protein-coding genes include several elements:
* [[Enhancer (genetics)|Enhancer]] regions (normally up to a few thousand basepairs upstream of transcription).
* [[promoter (biology)|Promoter]] regions (normally less than a couple of hundred basepairs upstream of transcription) include elements such as the [[TATA box|TATA]] and [[CAAT box|CAAT]] boxes, GC elements, and an [[initiator element|initiator]].
* [[Exon]]s are the part of the transcript that will eventually be transported to the cytoplasm for translation.  When discussing gene with [[alternate splicing]], an exon is a portion of the transcript that could be translated, given the correct splicing conditions.  The exons can be divided into three parts
**The coding region is the portion of the mRNA that will eventually be translated.
**Upstream untranslated region ([[Five prime untranslated region|5' UTR]]) can serve several functions, including mRNA transport, and initiation of translation (including, portions of the [[Kozak sequence]]).  They are never translated into the protein (excepting various mutations).
**The 3' region downstream from the stop codon is separated into two parts:
***[[Three prime untranslated region|3' UTR]] is never translated, but serves to add mRNA stability.  It is also the attachment site for the [[poly-A tail]].  The poly-A tail is used in the initiation of translation and also seems to have an effect on the long-term stability (aging) of the mRNA.
***An unnamed region after the [[poly-A tail]], but before the actual site for transcription termination, is spliced off during transcription, and so does not become part of the 3' UTR.  Its function, if any, is unknown.
* [[Intron]]s are intervening sequences between the exons that are never translated.  Some sequences inside introns function as [[miRNA]], and there are even some cases of small genes residing completely within the intron of a large gene.  For some genes (such as the [[antibody]] genes), internal control regions are found inside introns.  These situations, however, are treated as exceptions.

==Genes that are used as RNA==
Many regions of the DNA are transcribed with RNA as the functional form:
* [[rRNA]]: Ribosomal RNA are used in the [[ribosome]].
* [[tRNA]]: Transfer RNA are used in the [[Translation (biology)|translation]] process by bringing [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome.
* [[snRNA]]: Small nuclear RNA are used in [[spliceosome]]s to help the processing of pre-mRNA.
* [[Guide RNA|gRNA]]: Guide RNA are used in [[RNA editing]].
* [[miRNA]]: Micro RNA are small (approximately 24 nucleotides) that are used in [[gene silencing]].
* [[Small nucleolar RNA|snoRNA]]: Small nucleolar RNA are used to help process and construct the ribosome.

Other RNAs are transcribed and not translated, but have undiscovered functions.

==Repeated sequences==
Repeated sequences are of two basic types: unique sequences that are repeated in one area; and repeated sequences that are interspersed throughout the genome.

===Satellites===
Satellites are unique sequences that are repeated in tandem in one area.  Depending on the length of the repeat, they are classified as either:
* [[Minisatellite]]: Short repeats of nucleotides.
* [[Microsatellite (genetics)|Microsatellite]]: Very short repeats of nucleotides.  Some trinucleotide repeats are found in coding regions (see, [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]).  Most are found in noncoding regions.  Their function is unknown, if they have any specific function.  They are used as [[molecular marker]]s and in [[DNA fingerprinting]].

===Interspersed sequences===
[[Interspersed repeat|Interspersed sequences]] are tandem repeats, with sequences that are found interspersed across the genome. They can be classified based on the length of the repeat as:
* [[Short interspersed element|SINE]]: Short interspersed sequences.  The repeats are normally a few hundred base pairs in length.  These sequences constitute about 13% of the human genome&lt;ref name=Pierce&gt;Pierce, B. A. (2005).  Genetics: A conceptual approach.  Freeman. Page 311&lt;/ref&gt; with the specific ''[[Alu sequence|Alu]]'' sequence accounting for about 10%.
* [[Long interspersed nuclear element#LINEs|LINE]]: Long interspersed sequences.  The repeats are normally several thousand base pairs in length.  These sequences constitute about 21% of the human genome.&lt;ref name=Pierce /&gt;

Both of these types are classified as [[retrotransposons]].

==Retrotransposons==
[[Retrotransposon]]s are sequences in the DNA that are the result of retrotransposition of RNA. LINEs and SINEs are examples where the sequences are repeats, but there are non-repeated sequences that can also be retrotransposons.

==Other sequences==
Typical eukaryotic chromosomes contain much more DNA than is classified in the categories above.  The DNA may be used as spacing, or have other as-yet-unknown function.  Or, they may simply be random sequences of no consequence.

'''Family literacy''' is a method of [[education]]. Relatively new, family literacy is being put into practice in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[South Africa]].

==Philosophy==
The roots of family literacy as an educational method come from the belief that “the parent is the child’s first teacher.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salisbury University - May Literacy Centre|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/seidel/mayliteracycenter/FamilyLit.html|publisher=Salisbury.edu|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that adults who have a higher level of education tend to not only become productive citizens with enhanced social and economic capacity in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Howard|title=Investment in Learning. The Individual and Social Value of American Higher Education|year=1997|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=0-8018-5530-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their children are more likely to be successful in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woessmann|first=Ludger|title=How Equal are Educational Opportunities? Family Background and Student Achievement in Europe and the US|date=March 2004|volume=1162|series=CESifo Working Paper Series|ssrn=528209}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literate parents are better able to support the learning of their children.&lt;ref name="Centre for Family Literacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Family Literacy - Logic Model|url=http://www.famlit.ca/resources/logicmodel.shtml|publisher=Famlit.ca|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Establishing family literacy programs is the most effective strategy to increase parental involvement and literacy development. The purpose of parental literacy curriculum is to increase students’ academic achievement. When family literacy programs are established parents become advocates for their child’s literacy. Simultaneously students’ literacy excels as parents become empowered. When parents are empowered they become active lifelong participants in their child’s education &lt;ref name="familyliteracyprogram1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familyliteracyprogram.org/ |title=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Family Literacy Program&amp;nbsp; |publisher=Familyliteracyprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717193539/http://www.familyliteracyprogram.org/ |archive-date=2015-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Comprehensive family [[literacy]] services provide a [[holism|holistic]], fully integrated, family-focused approach, providing parents and children most in need of improving their literacy skills with intensive, frequent, and long-term educational and non-educational services. Family literacy services make sustainable changes in a family by integrating all of the following activities:
* [[Adult Education]]: designed to extend basic academic level, think critically and creatively, solve problems, set and achieve goals, and acquire successful workplace and interpersonal skills.
* Childhood Education: designed to promote the growth and development of young children and to engage parents in their child’s educational program in order to foster meaningful involvement that will be maintained throughout the child’s educational career.
* Parent Education: provides instruction on how children grow, develop, and learn. It addresses issues critical to family well-being, connects parents with community resources, and provides opportunities for parents to network and develop mutual support systems.
* Interactive Parent/Child Activities: provides parents and children the opportunity to share their newly developed literacy experiences. Parents and children interact together, enriching their relationship through reciprocal learning that takes place, enabling them to become true partners in education.

==Examples==
*Adult Education:  The goal of educating parents is to empower and provide resources to parents who are a child's first teacher. Adult Education helps to rebuild relationships between parents and the school's faculty and staff. Some classes and activities provided for parents at the Prairie State College Family Literacy Project are [[English as Second Language]] classes, Adult Basic Education classes, General Education Development certifications, and vocational training.
*Building Family: The Leadership Program’s nationally recognized Building Family program invites parents into school communities with workshops that are hands-on, informative, and fun. These successful workshops meet a wide variety of parent needs and interests: from personal health and professional growth to nurturing the creative spirit and parenting strategies for promoting children’s academic achievement. Backed by The Leadership Program’s decades of experience facilitating more than 2,000 Building Family workshops for over 20,000 public school parents, this inspiring guidebook includes thirty-three complete workshops with convenient step-by-step instructions. Use it to lead dynamic experiences that will inspire enduring parent engagement in your own school community.
*Childhood Education: Helping to involve parents can be done in a child's learning through play groups, sharing stories and books together, and child-directed play time that all help the child to bond with their parents.
*Parent Education: The family literacy program developed in [[Illinois]] at the Prairie State Family Literacy Program provides parental support about health issues, good nutrition, discipline, and takes parents and children on field trips to purchase books for children to read at home.
*Interactive Parent/Child Activities: The Prairie State Family Literacy Program has developed a special time for interactive activities that they call "P.A.C.T." time. During this P.A.C.T. time there are play groups that involve both parents and their children working together. They are separated by age groups to help guide the interaction and activities.
*Greenman Elementary in [[Illinois]] established the first family literacy project called P.A.L. Parents Advocating Literacy in district 129. Since 2010 over 100 parents have become members of  P.A.L. (Parents Advocating Literacy.) P.A.L. is a family literacy project that teaches parents strategies that teachers use in the classroom every day. Establishing P.A.L. is the most effective approach to increase parental involvement in reading development. The purpose of family literacy curriculum is to increase students’ achievement by connecting school and home. When family literacy is established parents become advocates for their child’s literacy. Through P.A.L. parents become empowered and become lifelong supporters of their child’s education. P.A.L. was implemented district wide in 2013. P.A.L. is also in other districts throughout Illinois.&lt;ref name="familyliteracyprogram1"/&gt;
*F.R.E.D.:Fathers Reading Every Day is a family literacy program developed at Texas A&amp;M University.  In this program, fathers or father figures such as grandparents, uncles, or family friends are encouraged to read to their children every day for four weeks.

}}The term '''''choice theory''''' is the work of [[William Glasser]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], author of the book so named, and is the culmination of some 50 years of theory and practice in [[psychology]] and [[counselling]].

==Characteristics==
Choice theory posits behaviours we choose are central to our existence. Our behaviour ([[choice]]s) are driven by five genetically driven needs, survival, love and belonging, freedom, fun, and power.
Survival needs include
* food
* clothing
* shelter
* breathing
* personal safety
* security and sex, having children
and four fundamental psychological needs:
* Belonging/connecting/[[love]]
* [[Power (sociology)|Power]]/significance/competence
* [[Liberty|Freedom]]/autonomy
* Fun/learning

Choice theory suggests the existence of a "Quality World". Glasser's idea of a "Quality World" restates the [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian idea of archetypes]] but Glasser never acknowledged this. Nonetheless, Glasser's "Quality World" and what [[Carl Jung|Jung]] would call healthy archetypes are indistinguishable.

Our "Quality World" images are our role models of an individual's "perfect" world of parents, relations, possessions, beliefs, etc. How each person's "Quality World" is somewhat unusual, even in the same family of origin, is taken for granted.

Starting from birth and continuing throughout our lives, each person places significant role models, significant possessions and significant systems of belief (religion, cultural values, and [[icon]]s, etc.) into a mostly unconscious framework Glasser called our "Quality World". Glasser mostly ignores the issues of negative role models and stereotypes in choice theory.

Glasser also posits a "Comparing Place" where we compare-contrast our perception of people, places, and things immediately in front of us against our ideal images (archetypes) of these in our Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes).

Behavior ("Total Behavior" in Glasser's terms) is made up of these four components:  [[acting]], [[thinking]], [[feeling]], and [[physiology]]. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect our feeling and physiology.

A big conclusion for Glasser, one he repeats often, is the source of much personal unhappiness is failing or failed [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with people important to us: spouses, parents, [[children]], friends and [[colleague]]s.

The symptoms of unhappiness are widely variable and are often seen as [[mental illness]]. Glasser believed that "pleasure" and "happiness" are related but are far from synonymous. [[Sex]], for example, is a "pleasure" but may well be divorced from a "satisfactory relationship" which is a precondition for lasting "[[happiness]]" in [[life]]. Hence the intense focus on the improvement of relationships in counseling with choice theory—the "new reality therapy". Those familiar with both are likely to prefer choice theory, the more modern formulation.

Choice theory posits most mental illness is, in fact, an expression of unhappiness. Glasser champions how we are able to learn and choose alternate behaviors resulting in greater personal satisfaction. [[Reality therapy]] is the choice theory-based counseling process focused on helping clients to learn to make those self-optimizing choices.

==The ten axioms==

# The only person whose behavior we can control is our own.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we can give another person is information.&lt;br /&gt;
# All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems.&lt;br /&gt;
# The problem relationship is always part of our present life.&lt;br /&gt;
# What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy our basic needs right now and plan to continue satisfying them in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
# We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying the pictures in our Quality World.&lt;br /&gt;
# All we do is behave.&lt;br /&gt;
# All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four components: acting, thinking, feeling and physiology&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can only control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think.&lt;br /&gt;
# All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and named by the part that is the most recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.choicetheory.com | title=Choice Theory Psychology, Reality Therapy, Lead Management, &amp; Quality Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In classroom management ==
William Glasser's choice theory begins:  behavior is not separate from choice; we all choose how to behave at any time. Second, we cannot control anyone's behavior but our own. Glasser also believed in the vitality of classroom meetings for the purpose of improving communication and solving real classroom problems. In the classroom, it is important for teachers to "help students envision a quality existence in school and plan the choices that lead to it".&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"&gt;Charles, C.M. (2008). ''Building Classroom Discipline.'' (9th ed.). Boston: Pearson Education.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Johnny Waits is an 18-year-old high school senior and plans on attending college to become a computer programmer. Glasser suggests Johnny could be learning as much as he can about computers instead of reading Plato. This concept is called quality curriculum, which connects students with practical real world topics, chosen by the student according to their leanings. Topics with actual career potential are most encouraged. Under Glasser's strategy, teachers hold discussions with students when introducing new topics asking them to identify what they would like to explore in depth. As part of the process, students need to explain why the material is valuable in life.&lt;ref name="Charles, C.M. 2008"/&gt;

==Education==

Glasser was no supporter of [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]]. Most Quality Schools he supervised had very conventional curriculum topics. The main innovation was a deeper, humanistic approach to group process between teacher, student and learning.

A typical example of choice theory and education are [[Sudbury school|Sudbury Model schools]], where students decide for themselves how to spend their days. In these schools, students of all ages determine what they will do, as well as when, how, and where they will do it. This freedom is at the heart of the school and it belongs to the students as their right, not to be violated. The fundamental premises of the school are: that all people are curious by nature; that the most efficient, long-lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group; and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility. In practice this means that students initiate all their own activities and create their own environments. The physical plant, the staff, and the equipment are there for the students to use as the need arises. The school provides a setting in which students are independent, are trusted, and are treated as responsible people; and a community in which students are exposed to the complexities of life in the framework of a participatory democracy.

Sudbury schools are based on the premise that students are personally responsible for their acts, in opposition to virtually all schools today that deny it. The denial is threefold: schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action—these are the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Thus, members of these schools learn democracy by experience, and enjoy the rights of individuals.

Sudbury schools do not perform and do not offer evaluations, assessments, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational evaluation for the 21st Century, they adduce.

== Critiques ==

Glasser's theories and teachings have not gone without criticism. In a book review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v07n02/v07n0208.pdf Review of ''Warning: Psychiatry Can Be Hazardous to Your Mental Health''], Jackson, W. Clay.  2005. The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, Vol. 7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; W. Clay Jackson writes, "Dr. Glasser postulates that everything contained in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#DSM-IV-TR .282000.29|DSM-IV-TR]] is a result of an individual's brain creatively expressing its unhappiness. ... Dr. Glasser demonizes the entire profession as charlatans who have been brainwashed by their predecessors or who simply misrepresent many of the psychiatric illnesses to patients as having a biological basis. ... Despite claiming to have an appendix full of references demonstrating there is no evidence medications have a role in curing mental illness, the book simply relies on a core group of anti-establishment authors. ... However, what is noticeably absent from the book is a set of randomized clinical trials demonstrating the success of his teachings."

The '''Grand Ducal Crown of Tuscany''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''corona del Granducato di Toscana'') was a [[Crown (heraldry)|ducal crown]] created by the [[Medici|Medicean]] [[List of rulers of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]].

== The old crown ==
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 36.png|thumb|left|The old grand ducal crown in an engraving.]]
[[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], [[duke]] of [[Florence]], sought to achieve a title which removed him from his status as a [[feudatory]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and gave him more political independence. Getting nothing from the Emperor, he turned to the [[Papacy]]. Already he had attempted to get [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] to give him the title of [[king]] or [[archduke]] with no success. Finally in 1569, after many favours and dealings of differing levels of legitimacy, [[Pope Pius V]] released a [[Papal bull]] which conferred the style of ''[[Serene Highness|Altezza Serenissima]]'' and the title of [[Grand Duke]], a very rare title ranked him above a [[Duke]], but below a [[Prince]].

In January 1570 Cosimo I was crowned by Pius himself at [[Rome]], though by rights such a move was the prerogative of the Emperor. For this reason, [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] refused to recognise the new title, though [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] immediately recognised its validity. With time all Europe came around.

The crown of the Grand Duke of Tuscany was clearly distinct from both princely and ducal crowns. It was a gold circlet decorated with [[emerald]]s, [[ruby|rubies]] and [[pearl]]s with rays projecting from the top.

Uniquely the crown had a large [[fleur de lis]] at the front in the centre.

== The new crown ==
[[File:Giangastonecoronation.jpg|thumb|Gian Gastone with the new grand ducal crown, modified from the previous.]]
When [[Cosimo III de' Medici|Cosimo III]], Grand Duke of Tuscany (1670-1723) received the "right to royal rank" from [[Vienna]] added arches and a globe to the top of the grand ducal crown, as these were the typical elements of a royal crown. The new status of the Grand Duchy included among other things a change of style from ''Altezza Serenissima'' to ''[[Royal Highness|Altezza Reale]]''.

The Grand Ducal Crown is only known from drawings and paintings, since it was lost during the Napoleonic Occupation. A copy of the crown was placed in the coffin of each of the Grand Dukes at their funerals. One of these, which belonged to [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] (r. 1723-1737) was recovered during a survey of the corpse and is now conserved in Florence.

''[http://www.informaworld.com/index/908038833.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the [[environmental impact of aviation]] and especially its [[greenhouse gas emissions]] have brought particular focus on flying.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson K, Bows A (2008).

''[http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/kevin-anderson-2.ppt]''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher than the same emissions if made at ground-level.&lt;ref&gt;Peeters, P. &amp; Williams, V. 2009. Calculating emissions and radiative forcing. P.76 in: Gössling, S. &amp; Upham, P (Eds.), 2009. ''Climate change and aviation: Issues, challenges and solutions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/1999doc.nsf/63c71d2d4054d0fdc125685d0053aee4/c125685b002f5004c125686b005cb510/$FILE/00071363.PDF#page=95|pages=118|author=John Adams|title=Proceedings from the Ottawa Workshop - OECD|date=19 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer [[Donald Appleyard]]).

The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes.

[[File:Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach5.0.gif|thumb|Simulation of hypersonic speed (Mach 5)]]
In [[aerodynamics]], a '''hypersonic speed''' is one that greatly exceeds the [[speed of sound]], particularly [[speed of sound|Mach]] 5 and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Atmospheric Flight in the Twentieth Century | editor=Galison, P.; Roland, A. | publisher=Springer | year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfrOBgAAQBAJ | isbn=978-94-011-4379-0 | page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise [[Mach number]] at which a craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic speed varies, since individual physical changes in the airflow (like molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]]) occur at different speeds; these effects collectively become important around Mach 5. The hypersonic regime is often alternatively defined as speeds where [[ramjet]]s do not produce net [[thrust]].

==Characteristics of flow==
While the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. The peculiarity in hypersonic flows are as follows:
# Shock layer
# [[Aerodynamic heating]]
# Entropy layer
# Real gas effects
# Low density effects
# Independence of aerodynamic coefficients with Mach number.

===Small shock stand-off distance===
As a body's Mach number increases, the density behind a [[Shock wave#Bow shocks|bow shock]] generated by the body also increases, which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to [[conservation of mass]]. Consequently, the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher Mach numbers.

===Entropy layer===
As Mach numbers increase, the [[entropy]] change across the shock also increases, which results in a strong [[entropy gradient]] and highly [[vortical]] flow that mixes with the [[boundary layer]].

===Viscous interaction===
A portion of the large [[kinetic energy]] associated with flow at high Mach numbers transforms into [[internal energy]] in the fluid due to viscous effects. The increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature. Since the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is approximately zero for low to moderate hypersonic Mach numbers, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer coincides with a decrease in density. This causes the bottom of the boundary layer to expand, so that the boundary layer over the body grows thicker and can often merge with the shock wave near the body leading edge.

===High-temperature flow===
High temperatures due to a manifestation of viscous dissipation cause non-equilibrium chemical flow properties such as vibrational excitation and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] of molecules resulting in [[convection|convective]] and [[Atmospheric reentry#Real (non-equilibrium) gas model|radiative heat-flux]].

== Classification of Mach regimes ==
Although "subsonic" and "supersonic" usually refer to speeds below and above the local [[speed of sound]] respectively, aerodynamicists often use these terms to refer to particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because a "[[transonic]] regime" exists around M=1 where approximations of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] used for subsonic design no longer apply, partly because the flow locally exceeds M=1 even when the freestream{{clarify|date=March 2018}} Mach number is below this value.

The "supersonic regime" usually refers to the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used; for example, where the ([[air]]) flow is not chemically reacting and where [[heat transfer]] between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations.

Generally, [[NASA]] defines "high" hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Among the aircraft operating in this regime are the [[Space Shuttle]] and (theoretically) various developing [[spaceplane]]s.

In the following table, the "regimes" or "ranges of Mach values" are referenced instead of the usual meanings of "subsonic" and "supersonic".

| Aircraft designed to fly at supersonic speeds show large differences in their aerodynamic design because of the radical differences in the behaviour of [[fluid flow]]s above Mach 1. Sharp edges, thin [[airfoil]]-sections, and all-moving [[tailplane]]/[[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] are common. Modern [[combat aircraft]] must compromise in order to maintain low-speed handling; "true" supersonic designs include the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and BAC/Aérospatiale [[Concorde]].

==Similarity parameters==
The categorization of airflow relies on a number of [[Dimensionless numbers|similarity parameters]], which allow the simplification of a nearly infinite number of test cases into groups of similarity. For transonic and [[compressible flow]], the [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s alone allow good categorization of many flow cases.

Hypersonic flows, however, require other similarity parameters. First, the [[analytic equation]]s for the [[shock wave|oblique shock angle]] become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~&gt;10) Mach numbers. Second, the formation of strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream [[Reynolds number]] is less useful as an estimate of the behavior of the [[boundary layer]] over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flows mean that [[real gas]] effects become important. For this reason, research in hypersonics is often referred to as [[aerothermodynamics]], rather than [[aerodynamics]].

The introduction of real gas effects means that more variables are required to describe the full state of a gas. Whereas a stationary gas can be described by three variables ([[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[adiabatic index]]), and a moving gas by four ([[flow velocity]]), a hot gas in chemical equilibrium also requires state equations for the chemical components of the gas, and a gas in nonequilibrium solves those state equations using time as an extra variable. This means that for a nonequilibrium flow, something between 10 and 100 variables may be required to describe the state of the gas at any given time. Additionally, rarefied hypersonic flows (usually defined as those with a [[Knudsen number]] above 0.1) do not follow the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].

Hypersonic flows are typically categorized by their total energy, expressed as total [[enthalpy]] (MJ/kg), total pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation pressure (kPa-MPa), [[stagnation temperature]] (K), or flow velocity (km/s).

[[Wallace D. Hayes]] developed a similarity parameter, similar to the [[area rule|Whitcomb area rule]], which allowed similar configurations to be compared.

==Regimes==
Hypersonic flow can be approximately separated into a number of regimes. The selection of these regimes is rough, due to the blurring of the boundaries where a particular effect can be found.

===Perfect gas===
In this regime, the gas can be regarded as an [[ideal gas]]. Flow in this regime is still Mach number dependent. Simulations start to depend on the use of a constant-temperature wall, rather than the adiabatic wall typically used at lower speeds. The lower border of this region is around Mach 5, where [[ramjet]]s become inefficient, and the upper border around Mach 10-12.

===Two-temperature ideal gas===
This is a subset of the perfect gas regime, where the gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the gas must be considered separately, leading to two temperature models. See particularly the modeling of supersonic nozzles, where vibrational freezing becomes important.

===Dissociated gas===
In this regime, diatomic or polyatomic gases (the gases found in most atmospheres) begin to [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] as they come into contact with the [[Shock wave|bow shock]] generated by the body. [[catalysis|Surface catalysis]] plays a role in the calculation of surface heating, meaning that the type of surface material also has an effect on the flow. The lower border of this regime is where any component of a gas mixture first begins to dissociate in the stagnation point of a flow (which for nitrogen is around 2000 K). At the upper border of this regime, the effects of [[ionization]] start to have an effect on the flow.

===Ionized gas===
In this regime the [[ionization|ionized]] electron population of the stagnated flow becomes significant, and the electrons must be modeled separately. Often the electron temperature is handled separately from the temperature of the remaining gas components. This region occurs for freestream flow velocities around 10–12&amp;nbsp;km/s. Gases in this region are modeled as non-radiating [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

===Radiation-dominated regime===
Above around 12&amp;nbsp;km/s, the heat transfer to a vehicle changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated. The modeling of gases in this regime is split into two classes:
#[[Optical depth|Optically thin]]: where the gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other parts of the gas
#Optically thick: where the radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.
The modeling of optically thick gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the calculation of the radiation at each point, the computation load theoretically expands exponentially as the number of points considered increases.

==History==

The institute was established by Karachi University's Department of Mathematics in 1994.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"&gt;{{Cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as an autonomous research institute with the idea for a space science astrophysics programme and an astronomical observatory was conceived right at the inception of the Karachi University.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; However, the trace of establishing such institute came in place in 1960, when Professor A.B.A Haleem, Professor of Political Science and Vice-Chancellor of the Karachi University, first obtained and procured the powerful astronomical telescope with relevant equipment from a West-German company.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; Known as [[KU Observatory|Karachi University Astrophysics Observatory]], an astronomical observatory was initiated under the administrative supervision of the Department of Mathematics of the Karachi University.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; Later in time, the Federal [[Government of Pakistan]] built a building to install the observatory which initially belonged to the Department of Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; In 1994, the building and the observatory became a part of the ISPA with Prof. Dr. Jawaid Quamar as its first founding director.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt;

Prof. Dr. Jawaid Quamar is credited for leading the institute at an academic and international level as he had attracted many students to do their research under his supervision and he also introduced new programmes in the relevant field in the country. The new metallic dome of the observatory was an evidence of Dr. Quamar’s hard work and dedication.

Later, after the retirement of Dr. Quamar, Mr. M. Shahid Qureshi took charge of the institute in 2002. He regularized the academic programs at ISPA and lead the institute till 2010. Mr Qureshi earned his PhD from the same institute under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nasiruddin Khan (of department of Mathematics, UOK). In Fact Dr. Qureshi was the third PhD of the institute, first being Prof. Dr. M. Ayub Khan Yousufzai, second Prof. Dr. M. Jawed Iqbal (the current Director of ISPA).

On June 4, 2015, a brief inaugural session took place at ISPA where, Prof. Dr. Jawaid Quamar inaugurate the ISPA Seminar Library in the memory of "Prof. Dr. Irshad Ahmed Khan Afridi", who was involved in the foundation of ISPA. The new name of ISPA seminar library (Dr. Irshad Ahmed Khan Afridi Seminar Library) was approved by the Syndicate of Karachi University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jogss.org/conference/Abstracts%20Booklet%20of%203rd%20National%20Conference%2001-10-2015.pdf|title=Inaugrial of Dr. Irshad Ahmed Khan Afridi Seminar Library, University of Karachi|last=|first=|date=31 May 2017|website=|publisher=Institute of Space &amp; Planetary Astrophysics (ISPA), University of Karachi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry aout.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration from [[Très riches heures du Duc de Berry]], 1412-16, by Pol and Hermann de Limbourg, representing the month of August and depicting, in the foreground, the Nobility riding out to hunt with falcons while in the midground, the harvest takes place and the workers cool off in the river. One of the Duc's many castles, Étampes, completes the scene. Illumination on vellum, 22,5 x 13,6 cm]]
The term '''Labours of the Months''' refers to cycles in [[Medieval art|Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance art]] depicting in twelve scenes the rural activities that commonly took place in the months of the year.  They are often linked to the signs of the [[Zodiac]], and are seen as humankind's response to God's ordering of the Universe. 

The Labours of the Months are frequently found as part of large sculptural schemes on churches, and in [[illuminated manuscripts]], especially in the Calendars of late medieval [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]].  The manuscripts are important for the development of [[landscape painting]], containing most of the first painting where this was given prominence. The most famous cycle is that painted in the early 15th century by [[Limbourg Brothers|Hermann, Pol and Johan de Limbourg]] in [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. In the 16th century, late in the history of the theme, [[Simon Bening]] produced especially fine cycles which link the Limbourgs with the landscape paintings of [[Peter Breughel the Elder]].

==Typical cycle==
The contents of cycles varied with date, location, and the purpose of the work. The [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] &lt;small&gt;(illustrated right)&lt;/small&gt; was designed for the personal use of a great magnate, and was unusually large, allowing all the typical elements to be used in many months. It combines astrological and calendar information at the top, with a combination of the agricultural life of the peasant, the life of the elite courtiers, and illustrations of the Duke's many castles in the background of several scenes.   

A typical simple scheme was:&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'', mp 246, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

*January - Feasting
*February - Sitting by the fire
*March - Pruning trees, or digging
*April - Planting, enjoying the country or picking flowers
*May - Hawking, courtly love
*June - Hay harvest
*July - Wheat harvest
*August - Wheat threshing
*September - Grape harvest
*October - Ploughing or sowing
*November - Gathering acorns for pigs
*December - Killing pigs, baking

- but there were many variations, especially in major wine-growing areas, where more wine related scenes were included.  Italian cycles often advance the agricultural scenes a month earlier than ones from the [[Low countries]] or England.  The impact of the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]] has been detected in differences between early and late examples.

==Sculpture cycles==
[[Image:Perugia - Fontana Maggiore - 1 - Mesi - 09 - Settembre - Foto G. Dall'Orto 5 ago 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The Month of September from the Fontana Maggiore in [[Perugia]] (c. 1275), by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, shows the treading of grapes.]] 
Most sculptured cycles in Europe, especially when compressed into the [[archivolt]] of a portal, consist of an astrological symbol beside, above or incorporated in a sculpture or relief illustrating a monthly labour.

A few sculpted examples of the many surviving are: 
* [[Chartres cathedral]]: west and north portal archivolts. Window, see below
* [[Notre Dame, Paris]]: northern doorjambs of the west facade (Portal of the Virgin), and a stained glass Zodiacs, labours, vices and virtues cycle filling the west rose window
* [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay|Vezelay Abbey]]: Archivolt of main west basilica doorway
* [[Autun Cathedral]]: Archivolt of main west cathedral doorway
* [[Ferrara Cathedral]]
* [[Saint Mark's, Venice]]: main portal
* [[San Zeno di Verona]]: facade
* [[Lucca Cathedral]]:  large bas-relief panels with little Zodial signs, to the right and left of the main facade door
* [[Fontana Maggiore]], [[Perugia]]: relief panels showing monthly labours are amongst those surrounding the lower basin of the great  fountain in front of the Duomo.
* [[Otranto Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and labours form part of the mosaic scenes which cover the entire floor.
* [[Canterbury Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and monthly labours are amongst the subjects illustrated in large inlaid marble floor medallions on the edge of the Trinity Chapel close to where the shrine of Saint Thomas (Becket) was located.
* [[St Augustine's Church, Brookland]], Kent: large cylindrical lead font with reliefs of both Zodiac signs and monthly labours - a rare example in the UK both of such a font and of the combination of zodiac signs and monthly labours.
* [[Carlisle Cathedral]]: the foliate capitals of the twelve piers of the choir each contain a figure representing one of the labours of the months.

==Stained glass==
[[Image:Chartres_cathedral_041_Seasons_Dec_Jan_Feb.JPG|thumb|250px|Chartres Cathedral, the months of December, January and February]]
The Labours of the months often occur in those [[rose window]]s that are dedicated to the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]], the circular nature of the window suiting the cyclic theme. In these windows, the months are part of a complex iconographical scheme. Other windows have the Labours of the Months specifically as their subject matter.

'''Lead paint''' or '''lead-based paint''' is [[paint]] containing [[lead]]. As pigment, [[lead(II) chromate]] ([[Lead|Pb]] [[Chromium|Cr]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[chrome yellow]]"), [[Lead(II,IV) oxide]], ([[Lead|Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], "red lead"), and [[lead(II) carbonate]] ([[Lead|Pb]] [[Carbon|C]] [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], "[[white lead]]") are the most common forms.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Völz, Hans G. ''et al.''|title=Pigments, Inorganic|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a20_243.pub2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lead is added to paint to accelerate [[drying oil|drying]], increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. It is one of the main health and [[environmental issues with paint|environmental hazards associated with paint]]. In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE57O64G20090825 | work=Reuters | title=Lead-laden paint still widely sold around the world | date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas countries such as the [[Lead-based paint in the United States|U.S.]] and the [[Lead-based paint in the United Kingdom|UK]] have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
[[White lead|Lead white]] was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described by [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Vitruvius]] and the ancient Greek author [[Theophrastus]].

The traditional method making the pigment was called the stack process. Hundreds or thousands of earthenware pots containing vinegar and lead were embedded in a layer of either [[tan bark]] or cow [[feces]]. The pots were designed so that the vinegar and lead were in separate compartments, but the lead was in contact with the vapor of the vinegar. The lead was usually coiled into a spiral, and placed on a ledge inside the pot. The pot was loosely covered with a grid of lead, which allowed the carbon dioxide formed by the [[fermentation]] of the tan bark or the dung to circulate in the pot.   Each layer of pots was covered by a new layer of tan, then another layer of pots. the heat created by the fermentation, [[acetic acid]] vapor and carbon dioxide within the stack did their work, and within a month the lead coils were covered with a crust of white lead.  This crust was separated from the lead, washed and ground for pigment.  This was an extremely dangerous process for the workmen.  Medieval texts warned of the danger of "[[apoplexy]], [[epilepsy]], and paralysis" from working with lead white.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson, ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', p. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the risks, the pigment was very popular with artists because of its density and opacity; a small amount could cover a large surface.

The dangers of lead paint were considered well-established by the beginning of the 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, [[Sherwin-Williams]] reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint "poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors".&lt;ref name="SWP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066401898;view=1up;seq=110 |title=Dangers of White Lead |last1=Guenther |first1=Richard |date=1904-02-24 |website=[[Hathitrust]] |publisher=Sherwin Williams Co. |accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1886, German health laws prohibited women and children from working in factories processing lead paint and [[lead sugar]].&lt;ref name=ayass&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ayaß |editor1-first=Wolfgang |editor1-link=:de:Wolfgang Ayaß |date=1999-01-01 |title=Quellensammlung zur Geschichte der deutschen Sozialpolitik 1867 bis 1914, II.

==Toxicity==
{{further|Lead poisoning}}
[[File:Lead Paint - cracking and flaking.jpg|thumb|right|Lead paint can crack and form flakes, which can contaminate the surrounding environment.]]
Lead paint is hazardous. It can cause [[nervous system]] damage, stunted growth, [[kidney]] damage, and delayed development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=93&amp;tid=22|title=ToxFAQs™ for Lead|date=August 2007|last=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|publisher=Center for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dangerous to children because it tastes sweet,{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} therefore encouraging children to put lead chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths. Lead paint is dangerous to adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women. Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted. Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen. High levels may result in death.

==Regulation==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=May 2012}}
The [[European Union]] has passed a directive controlling lead paint use.

In Canada, regulations were first enacted under the Hazardous Products Act in 1976 that limited lead content of paints and other liquid coatings on furniture, household products, children's products, and exterior and interior surfaces of any building frequented by children to 0.5% by weight.&lt;ref name="healthcanada-leadfaq"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/contaminants/lead-plomb/asked_questions-questions_posees-eng.php Some Commonly Asked Questions About Lead and Human Health], Health Canada&lt;/ref&gt; New regulations on surface coating materials, which came into force in 2005, further limit lead to its background level for both interior and exterior paints sold to consumers. Canadian paint manufacturers have been conforming to this background level in their interior and exterior consumer paints since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead and Health|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/lead-plomb-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603023707/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/lead-plomb-eng.php|archivedate=3 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a Canadian company, Dominion Colour Corporation, is "the largest manufacturer of lead-based paint pigments in the world" and has faced public criticism for obtaining permission from the [[European Chemicals Agency]] to continue to export lead chromate paints from its Dutch subsidiary to countries where its uses are not tightly regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-company-s-lead-based-products-a-danger-to-world-health-critics-say-1.3340853 |title=Toronto company's lead-based products a danger to world health, critics say |last=Fowler |first=Jennifer |date=1 December 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) banned lead paint in 1977 in residential properties and public buildings (16 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 1303), along with toys and furniture containing lead paint. The cited reason was "to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml77/77096.html|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|title=CPSC Announces Final Ban On Lead-Containing Paint|date=2 September 1977|last=Office of Information and Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819015700/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtml77/77096.html|archivedate=19 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For manufacturers, the CPSC instituted the [[Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008]], which changed the cap on lead content in paint from 0.06% to 0.009% starting August 14, 2009.  In 2018 the State of Delaware banned the use of lead paint on outdoor structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?legislationId=26820|title=HB 456 AN ACT TO AMEND TITLES 14, 16, 17, 26, AND 29 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO THE USE OF LEAD PAINTS ON OUTDOOR STRUCTURES.|last=State of Delaware|first=General Assembly|date=29 August 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] required that all renovators working in homes built before 1978 and disturbing more than six square feet of lead paint inside the home or 20 square feet outside the home be certified. EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule) lowers the risk of lead contamination from home renovation activities. It requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities and pre-schools (any child occupied facility) built before 1978 be certified by EPA and use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/getleadsafe/|title=U.S. EPA Renovation, Repair and Painting Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, there are an estimated 37 million homes and apartments with lead paint in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Charles |url=https://undark.org/article/lead-testing-child-blood-levels/ |title=America’s Misguided War on Childhood Lead Exposures |work=Undark |date=2018-03-21 |accessdate=2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines banned lead paint in 2013, but in 2017, 15% of the paint still was not certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mogensen|first1=Jackie Flynn|title=You’ll Probably Never Save as Many Lives as This Guy Who Got the Philippines to Stop Using Lead Paint|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/04/youll-probably-never-save-as-many-lives-as-this-guy-who-got-the-philippines-to-stop-using-lead-paint/|accessdate=23 April 2018|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead paint is not prohibited in India. A 2015 study found that over 31% of household paints in India had lead concentration above 10,000 parts per million (ppm), which far exceeds the [[Bureau of Indian Standards|BIS]] standard of 90 ppm for lead in paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Over 31 percent paints have alarming levels of lead: study |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/over-31-percent-paints-have-alarming-levels-of-lead-study/ |journal=[[Press Trust of India]] |via=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=18 April 2016|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], the Hazardous Substances Act of 2009 classifies lead as a hazardous substance and limits its use in paint to 600 parts per million (ppm). A proposed amendment will modify this to 90 ppm, thereby almost completely eradicating lead from paint. The amendment would also include all industrial paints, which were previously excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/proposed-amendment-to-legislation-set-to-eliminate-lead-in-paint-2018-06-15|title=Proposed amendment to legislation set to eliminate lead in paint|last=Bulbulia|first=Tasneem|work=Engineering News|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead paint in art==

===Oil paints===
In art, [[white lead|white lead paint]] is known as "flake white" or "Cremnitz white". It is valued for the ease of handling and resilience the lead confers to [[oil paint]]s. Lead white paint dries relatively quickly to form a strong, flexible paint film. Lead-based white is one of the oldest manufactured pigments. It was the only white pigment available to artists in appreciable quantities until the twentieth century, when zinc-white and titanium-white became available.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Ralph|title=The artist's handbook of materials and techniques|year=1991|publisher=Viking|location=New York City|isbn=0670837016|edition=5. ed., rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrially produced lead white, the typical pigment from the 19th century until its ban, was thought to be inferior to traditionally fabricated forms, which had larger "flake" particles that conferred ease of handling.

Titanium and zinc whites are far less toxic than lead white and have largely supplanted it in most fine arts applications.  Safety regulations have also made lead white more expensive and difficult to obtain in some regions, such as the EU.  However, lead white oil paints are still produced and in use by artists who prefer their unique handling, mixing, and structural qualities.&lt;ref name="Mayer 1991"/&gt;

Flake white has various drawbacks, including a tendency to become transparent over time. It also blackens in the presence of certain atmospheric pollutants, although this can be reversed.

===Water-based paints===
Lead is not a traditional pigment in water mediums, as zinc is superior for works on paper, as is [[calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) for [[frescos]]. Lead-based paints, when used on paper, often cause the work to become discolored after long periods of time; the paint's lead carbonate reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the air and with acids, which often come from fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume= 4
| year = 1985
| url = http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v04/bp04-04.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substitutes==

===Titanium===
Paint manufacturers have replaced white lead with a less toxic substitute, [[titanium white]] (based on the pigment [[titanium dioxide]]), which was first used in paints in the 19th century. Titanium dioxide is considered safe enough to use as a [[food coloring]] and in [[toothpaste]]. It is also a common ingredient in [[sunscreen]]. When used in paints today, it is often coated with [[silicon]] or [[aluminum oxide]]s for durability. Titanium white has far greater opacity and tinting strength than lead white, and it can easily overpower most other pigments if not mixed carefully.  Titanium white has been criticized for leading to "chalkiness" in mixtures, and for allegedly decreasing the permanence of organic pigments mixed with it due to its high [[refractive index]].

===Zinc===
[[Zinc white]] is less opaque and weaker in tinting strength than either titanium white or lead white. It is commonly used to lighten mixtures subtly while maintaining transparency.  Although zinc white is the standard white in watercolors, its structural soundness in oils has been debated. Zinc white dries slowly and creates a relatively inflexible paint film.  Critics of the pigment argue that its use leads to excessive cracking and delamination, even when used sparingly.&lt;ref name="naturalpigments"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zinc White –  Problems in Oil Paint?|url=http://naturalpigments.com/education/article.asp?ArticleID=127|publisher=Natural Pigments LLC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206110619/http://naturalpigments.com/education/article.asp?ArticleID=127|archivedate=2011-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1790">A '''myc tag''' is a polypeptide [[protein tag]] derived from the [[c-myc]] gene product that can be added to a protein using [[recombinant DNA]] technology. It can be used for [[affinity chromatography]], then used to separate recombinant, overexpressed protein from wild type protein expressed by the host organism. It can also be used in the isolation of protein complexes with multiple subunits.

A myc tag can be used in many different assays that require recognition by an [[antibody]]. If there is no antibody against the studied protein, adding a myc-tag allows one to follow the protein with an antibody against the Myc epitope. Examples are cellular localization studies by immunofluorescence or detection by [[Western blotting]].

The peptide sequence of the myc-tag is (in 1- and 3-letter codes, respectively): N-EQKLISEEDL-C, N-Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu-C, where N stands for [[Amino-terminus]] and C stands for [[Carboxy terminus]]. The tag is approximately 1202 [[Dalton (unit)|Daltons]] in atomic mass and has 10 amino acids.

It can be fused to the [[C-terminus]] and the [[N-terminus]] of a protein. It is advisable not to fuse the tag directly behind the signal peptide of a secretory protein, since it can interfere with translocation into the [[secretory pathway]].

A monoclonal antibody against the myc [[epitope]], named 9E10, is available from the non-commercial [[Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/c-myc Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank 9E10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922211658/http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/c-myc |date=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ostensive definition''' conveys the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a term by pointing out examples. This type of [[definition]] is often used where the term is difficult to define verbally, either because the words will not be understood (as with children and new speakers of a language) or because of the nature of the term (such as colors or sensations). It is usually accompanied with a gesture [[pointing]] to the object serving as an example, and for this reason is also often referred to as "[[wikt:definition by pointing|definition by pointing]]". 

==Overview==

Ostensive definition assumes the  questioner has sufficient understanding to recognize the type of information being given. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So one might say: the ostensive definition explains the use—the meaning—of the word when the overall role of the word in language is clear. Thus if I know that someone means to explain a colour-word to me the ostensive definition "That is called 'sepia' " will help me to understand the word.... One has already to know (or be able to do) something in order to be capable of asking a thing's name. But what does one have to know?&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Philosophical Investigations'', §30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The limitations of ostensive definition are exploited in a famous argument from the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (which deal primarily with the [[philosophy of language]]), the [[private language argument]], in which [[Wittgenstein]] asks if it is possible to have a private language that no one else can understand.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Philosophical Investigations'', §258.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Passmore states that the term was first defined by the British logician [[William Ernest Johnson]] (1858–1931):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as "ostensive definition", such contrasts as those between ... "determinates" and "determinables", "continuants" and "occurrents", are now familiar in philosophical literature" (Passmore 1966, p. 344).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ostension in folklore==
The term ostension is also used by those who study [[folklore]] and [[urban legend]]s to indicate real-life happenings that parallel the events told in pre-existing and well-established [[legend]]s and lore. Semiotician [[Umberto Eco]] was the first to use the term to describe the way in which people communicate messages through miming actions, as by holding up a pack of cigarettes to say, "Would you like one?"&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''A Theory of Semiotics.'' 224-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was applied to contemporary legends by folklorists [[Linda Dégh]] and Andrew Vázsonyi, who argued that the most direct form of ostension involved committing an actual crime mentioned in a well-known urban legend, such as microwaving someone's pet animal or placing poison in a child's Halloween candy. While such events are rare, the authors stressed that folklorists must recognize "that fact can become narrative and narrative can become fact."&lt;ref name="DéghVázsonyi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dégh|first1=Linda|last2=Vázsonyi|first2=Andrew|title=Does the Word 'Dog' Bite? Ostensive Action: A Means of Legend Telling|journal=Journal of Folklore Research|date=1983|volume=20|pages=5–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}}

Dégh and Vázsonyi, followed by other analysts, argued that there were two other forms of ostension that did not necessarily involve literal acting out of legends.

''Quasi-ostension'' involves interpretation of ambiguous events in terms of a legend, as when a murder is first believed to have been a "cult" sacrifice or "gang" murder when in fact the perpetrator had other motives. Many local media panics are based in this form of ostension.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Bill. Legend-Trips and Satanism: Adolescents' Ostensive Traditions as "Cult" Activity. In Richardson et al., ''The Satanism Scare,'' pp. 279-295.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pseudo-ostension'' involves legend-like events intentionally acted out by persons aware of the original narrative. For example, in 1991, [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']] published a letter written by "C.J." a Dallas-area woman who said she was HIV-positive, but intentionally having sex with as many men as possible. Soon after, a local radio talk-show broadcast a phone call from a woman who said she was the real "C.J." "I blame it on men, period," she said to the talk-show host. "I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me." After a huge spike in males seeking HIV screening in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, both the author of the letter and the talk-show caller were identified as hoaxers intending to raise consciousness of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;''FOAFTale News'' 25 (March 1992): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostension has become an important concept for folklorists studying the ways in which folklore affects everyday people's real lives, ranging from supernatural rituals such as [[legend tripping]] to the complex ways in which awareness of [[AIDS]] has affected people's sexual habits.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Diane. ''Once upon a Virus'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist John McDowell, in an article preceding Dégh and Vázsonyi by a year, explored the relationship between [[iconicity]]—representation—and ostension—presentation—in mythic narrative, finding in episodes of ostention a virtual encounter with the experiential substrate, an experience that he termed "narrative epiphany".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Iconicity: Ostension in Kamsa Mythic Narrative, Journal of the Folklore Institute 19 (1982): 119-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:codex ephremi.jpg|thumb|350px|The ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a Greek manuscript of the Bible from the 5th century, is a palimpsest.]]

In [[textual studies]], a '''palimpsest''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ɪ|m|p|s|ɛ|s|t}}) is a [[manuscript]] page, either from a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or a [[book]], from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parchment#History|Pergamene]] (now known as [[parchment]]) was made of lamb, calf, or goat kid skin (best made in ancient [[Pergamon]]) and was expensive and not readily available, so in the interest of economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing. In colloquial usage, the term ''palimpsest'' is also used in [[architecture]], [[archaeology]], and [[geomorphology]] to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a [[monumental brass]] the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved.

== Etymology ==

The word "palimpsest" derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:palimpsestus#Latin|palimpsestus]]'', which derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:en:παλίμψηστος#Ancient Greek|παλίμψηστος]] (''palímpsēstos'', "again scraped"), a compound word that literally means "scraped clean and ready to be used again". The Ancient Greeks used wax-coated tablets, like scratch-pads, to write on with a stylus, and to erase the writing by smoothing the wax surface and writing again. This practice was adopted by [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], who wrote (literally scratched on letters) on [[Wax tablet|wax-coated tablets]], which were reuseable; [[Cicero]]'s use of the term "palimpsest" confirms such a practice.

== Development ==
[[File:Georgian paliphsest V-VI cc.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Georgian language|Georgian]] palimpsest from the 5th or 6th century]]

Because [[parchment]] prepared from animal hides is far more durable than [[paper]] or [[papyrus]], most palimpsests known to modern scholars are parchment, which rose in popularity in [[Western Europe]] after the 6th century. Where papyrus was in common use, reuse of writing media was less common because papyrus was cheaper and more expendable than costly parchment. Some papyrus palimpsests do survive, and Romans referred to this custom of washing papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Suetonius]], [[Augustus]], "though he began a tragedy with great zest, becoming dissatisfied with the style, he obliterated the whole; and his friends saying to him, What is your Ajax doing? He answered, My Ajax met with a sponge." (''Augustus'', 85). Cf. a letter of the future emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] to his friend and teacher [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] (''ad M. Caesarem'', 4.5), in which the former, dissatisfied with a piece of his own writing, facetiously exclaims that he will "consecrate it to water (''lymphis'') or fire (''Volcano'')," i.e. that he will rub out or burn what he has written.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing was washed from parchment or [[vellum]] using milk and [[oat bran]]. With the passing of time, the faint remains of the former writing would reappear enough so that scholars can discern the text (called the ''scriptio inferior'', the "underwriting") and decipher it. In the later [[Middle Ages]] the surface of the vellum was usually scraped away with powdered [[pumice]], irretrievably losing the writing, hence the most valuable palimpsests are those that were overwritten in the early Middle Ages.

Medieval [[codex|codices]] are constructed in "gathers" which are folded (compare "[[wikt:folio|folio]]", "leaf, page" [[ablative case]] of [[Latin]] folium), then stacked together like a newspaper and sewn together at the fold. Prepared parchment sheets retained their original central fold, so each was ordinarily cut in half, making a [[quarto]] volume of the original folio, with the overwritten text running perpendicular to the effaced text.

== Modern decipherment ==
Faint legible remains were read by eye before 20th-century techniques helped make lost texts readable. To read palimpsests, scholars of the 19th century used chemical means that were sometimes very destructive, using [[tincture]] of [[gall]] or, later, [[ammonium bisulfate]]. Modern methods of reading palimpsests using [[ultraviolet]] light and photography are less damaging.

Innovative [[Digitization|digitized images]] aid scholars in deciphering unreadable palimpsests. Superexposed photographs exposed in various light spectra, a technique called "multispectral filming", can increase the contrast of faded ink on parchment that is too indistinct to be read by eye in normal light. For example, [[multispectral imaging]] undertaken by researchers at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] recovered much of the undertext (estimated to be more than 80%) from the ''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''. At the [[Walters Art Museum]] where the palimpsest is now conserved, the project has focused on experimental techniques to retrieve the remaining text, some of which was obscured by overpainted icons. One of the most successful techniques for reading through the paint proved to be [[X-ray]] [[fluorescence]] imaging, through which the iron in the ink is revealed. A team of imaging scientists and scholars from the United States and Europe is currently using spectral imaging techniques developed for imaging the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' to study more than one hundred palimpsests in the library of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="imaging"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-the-sinai-a-global-team-is-revolutionizing-the-preservation-of-ancient-manuscripts/2012/08/30/1c203ef4-ca1f-11e1-aea8-34e2e47d1571_story.html|title=In the Sinai, a global team is revolutionizing the preservation of ancient manuscripts|publisher=Washington POST Magazine|date= September 8, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==

A number of ancient works have survived only as palimpsests.&lt;ref&gt;The most accessible overviews of the transmission of texts through the cultural bottleneck are Leighton D. Reynolds (editor), in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'', where the texts that survived, fortuitously, ''only'' in palimpsest may be enumerated, and in his general introduction to textual transmission, ''Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature'' (with N.G. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt; Vellum manuscripts were over-written on purpose mostly due to the dearth or cost of the material. In the case of Greek manuscripts, the consumption of old [[codex|codices]] for the sake of the material was so great that a synodal decree of the year 691 forbade the destruction of manuscripts of the [[Scriptures]] or the [[church father]]s, except for imperfect or injured volumes. Such a decree put added pressure on retrieving the vellum on which secular manuscripts were written. The decline of the vellum trade with the introduction of paper exacerbated the scarcity, increasing pressure to reuse material.

Cultural considerations also motivated the creation of palimpsests. The demand for new texts might outstrip the availability of parchment in some centers, yet the existence of cleaned parchment that was never overwritten suggests that there was also a spiritual motivation, to sanctify pagan text by overlaying it with the word of God, somewhat as pagan sites were overlaid with Christian churches to hallow pagan ground. Or the pagan texts may have merely appeared irrelevant.

Texts most susceptible to being overwritten included obsolete legal and liturgical ones, sometimes of intense interest to the historian. Early Latin translations of Scripture were rendered obsolete by Jerome's [[Vulgate]]. Texts might be in foreign languages or written in unfamiliar scripts that had become illegible over time. The codices themselves might be already damaged or incomplete. [[Christian heresy|Heretical]] texts were dangerous to harbor—there were compelling political and religious reasons to destroy texts viewed as heresy, and to reuse the media was less wasteful than simply to burn the books.

Vast destruction of the broad [[quarto]]s of the early centuries took place in the period which followed the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], but palimpsests were also created as new texts were required during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The most valuable [[Latin]] palimpsests are found in the codices which were remade from the early large folios in the 7th to the 9th centuries. It has been noticed that no entire work is generally found in any instance in the original text of a palimpsest, but that portions of many works have been taken to make up a single volume. An exception is the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' (see below). On the whole, early medieval scribes were thus not indiscriminate in supplying themselves with material from any old volumes that happened to be at hand.

* The best-known palimpsest in the legal world was discovered in 1816 by Niebuhr and Savigny in the [[Chapter Library of Verona|library of Verona cathedral]]. Underneath letters by St. Jerome and Gennadius was the almost complete text of the [[Gaius (jurist)|Institutes of Gaius]], probably the first student's textbook on Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;The Institutes of Gaius, ed W.M. Gordon and O.F. Robinson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]], Paris: portions of the Old and New Testaments in Greek, attributed to the 5th century, are covered with works of [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraem the Syrian]] in a hand of the 12th century.
* The [[Sana'a palimpsest]] is one of the oldest Qur'anic manuscripts in existence. Carbon dating indicates that the undertext (the scriptio inferior) was written probably within 15 years before the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. The undertext differs from the standard Qur'anic text and is therefore the most important documentary evidence for the existence of variant Qur'anic readings.&lt;ref name=Sadeghi2&gt;{{cite journal |last = Sadeghi |first = Behnam |author2=Goudarzi, Mohsen | title = Ṣan'ā' 1 and the Origins of the Qur'ān |journal = Der Islam |date = March 2012 |url = http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fislm.2010.87.issue-1-2$002fislam-2011-0025$002fislam-2011-0025.xml;jsessionid=82FA69F0EB77BCCC0BC1E1A6AC19B933 |accessdate = 2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms. 17212]] with Syriac translation of St. Chrysostom's ''Homilies'', of the 9th/10th century, covers a Latin grammatical treatise from the 6th century.
* [[Codex Nitriensis]], a volume containing a work of [[Severus of Antioch]] of the beginning of the 9th century, is written on palimpsest leaves taken from 6th-century manuscripts of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the [[Gospel of Luke]], both of the 6th century, and the ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' of the 7th or 8th century, British Museum.
* A ''double palimpsest'', in which a text of St. [[John Chrysostom]], in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], of the 9th or 10th century, covers a Latin grammatical treatise in a cursive hand of the 6th century, which in its turn covers the Latin annals of the historian [[Granius Licinianus]], of the 5th century, British Museum.
* The only known ''hyper-palimpsest'': the [[Novgorod Codex]], where potentially hundreds of texts have left their traces on the wooden back wall of a wax tablet.
* The Ambrosian [[Plautus]], in rustic capitals, of the 4th or 5th century, re-written with portions of the [[Bible]] in the 9th century, Ambrosian Library.
* [[Cicero]], ''[[De re publica]]'' in [[uncial]]s, of the 4th century, the sole surviving copy, covered by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] on the [[Psalms]], of the 7th century, [[Vatican Library]].
* [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''On the Maintenance of Friendship'', the sole surviving fragment, overwritten by a late-6th-century Old Testament.

* The [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]], the oldest Syriac copy of the gospels, from the 4th century.
* The unique copy of a Greek grammatical text composed by [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]] for the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the 2nd century, preserved in the ''Österreichische Nationalbibliothek'', Vienna.
* [[Codex Zacynthius]] – Greek palimpsest fragments of the gospel of Saint Luke, obtained in the island of [[Zante]], by General [[Colin Macaulay]], deciphered, transcribed and edited by [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|Tregelles]].
* The [[Codex Dublinensis]] (Codex Z) of St. Matthew's Gospel, at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], also deciphered by Tregelles.
* The Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis, with text of ''Origins'' of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]], partly palimpsest, with texts of earlier codices [[Codex Guelferbytanus A|Guelferbytanus A]], [[Codex Guelferbytanus B|Guelferbytanus B]], [[Codex Carolinus]], and several other texts Greek and Latin.

About sixty palimpsest manuscripts of the Greek New Testament have survived to the present day. Uncial codices include:

Expanding during the last twenty years and already being revised this series seems designed for students and pastors.&lt;ref name=W&amp;SReview&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Heath|title=Review of PNTC series|work=wordandspirit.co.uk|url=http://www.wordandspirit.co.uk/blog/2005/09/23/commentary-series-review-pillar-new-testament-commentary/|date=September 23, 2005|access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exegetical opinions are addressed and current academic theories are reviewed making the series serious but not overly technical. The series is conservative evangelical, however its commentators hale from various churchmanship.&lt;ref name=W&amp;SReview/&gt; Currently the series editor is [[D. A. Carson]].&lt;ref name=PNTCPro/&gt;

In August 2016, Eerdmans withdrew the two commentaries which [[Peter O'Brien (theologian)|Peter O'Brien]] has contributed to the series (on Ephesians and Hebrews) on account of plagiarism. According to Eerdmans, the commentary on Hebrews in particular ran afoul "of commonly accepted standards with regard to the utilization and documentation of secondary sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx|title=Eerdmans Statement on Three New Testament Commentaries : Eerdmans|website=www.eerdmans.com|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status''' is a designation awarded to teachers in the [[Further Education]] and Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training sectors by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) in the [[United Kingdom]].

Since 1 April 2012, teachers with Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status have also been recognised as qualified to teach in schools.

Holders of QTLS who are members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) may be appointed to permanent positions as qualified teachers, without any further induction requirements.

QTLS is therefore recognised as equivalent to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#qualified-teacher-learning-and-skills-qtls&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Gaining and Maintaining QTLS==

From November 2014, QTLS has been offered by the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) to members of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET) for a fee of £485.  In order to obtain QTLS, the candidate is required to register with SET, undertake annual [[Continuing Professional Development]] (CPD) and complete SET's 'Professional Formation' process.  

Prior to November 2014, QTLS was offered by the [[Institute for Learning]] (IfL) which was absorbed into the Education &amp; Training Foundation (ETF) on 31 October 2014.

QTLS is equivalent to [[Qualified Teacher Status|QTS]].  Should an individual want to teach in maintained schools, the same way as any other teacher, then they must hold QTLS, currently be, and remain a member of the Society for Education &amp; Training (SET).

The [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] in Post-Compulsory Education &amp; Training and the [[Diploma in Education and Training]] (including its predecessors, e.g. [[DTLLS]]) are the qualifications which qualify a teacher to attain QTLS.

The '''RETScreen Clean Energy Management Software''' (usually shortened to '''RETScreen''') is a software package developed by the Government of Canada. RETScreen Expert was highlighted at the 2016 [[Clean Energy Ministerial]] held in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?crtr.sj1D=&amp;crtr.mnthndVl=9&amp;mthd=advSrch&amp;crtr.dpt1D=6683&amp;nid=1079429&amp;crtr.lc1D=&amp;crtr.tp1D=&amp;crtr.yrStrtVl=2014&amp;crtr.kw=&amp;crtr.dyStrtVl=1&amp;crtr.aud1D=&amp;crtr.mnthStrtVl=1&amp;crtr.page=3&amp;crtr.yrndVl=2020&amp;crtr.dyndVl=4 |title=Canada, Mexico and the United States Show Progress on North American Energy Collaboration |website=News.gc.ca |date=2016-06-03 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RETScreen Expert''' is the current version of the software and was released to the public on September 19, 2016. The software allows for the comprehensive identification, assessment and optimization of the technical and financial viability of potential renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; as well as the measurement and verification of the actual performance of facilities and the identification of energy savings/production opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX8JN0xkq5A |format=Video |author=Clean Energy Solutions Center |title=Financial Analysis with RETScreen |website=Youtube.com |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Viewer mode" in RETScreen Expert is free and permits access to all of the functionality of the software. Unlike past versions of RETScreen, however, a new "Professional mode" (which allows users to save, print, etc.) is now available on an annual subscription basis. 

RETScreen Suite, comprising RETScreen 4 and RETScreen Plus, is the previous version of the RETScreen software. RETScreen Suite includes cogeneration and off-grid analysis capabilities.

Unlike RETScreen Suite, RETScreen Expert is one integrated software platform; utilizes detailed and comprehensive archetypes for assessing projects; and includes portfolio analysis capability. RETScreen Expert integrates a number of databases to assist the user, including a global database of climatic conditions obtained from 6,700 ground-based stations and NASA satellite data; benchmark database; cost database; project database; hydrology database and product database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12693">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] that is simultaneously a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and a [[monoid]] ''x''•''y'' which admits operations ''x''\''z'' and ''z''/''y'', loosely analogous to division or implication, when ''x''•''y'' is viewed as multiplication or conjunction, respectively.  Called respectively right and left residuals, these operations coincide when the monoid is commutative.  The general concept was introduced by Ward and Dilworth in 1939.  Examples, some of which existed prior to the general concept, include [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s, [[Heyting algebra]]s, [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s, [[relation algebra]]s, and [[MV-algebra]]s.  [[Residuated lattice#Residuated semilattice|Residuated semilattices]] omit the meet operation &amp;and;, for example [[Kleene algebra]]s and [[action algebra]]s.

==Definition==

In [[mathematics]], a '''residuated lattice''' is an [[algebraic structure]] '''L''' = (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') such that
:  (i) (''L'', ≤) is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]].
: (ii) (''L'', •, '''I''') is a [[monoid]].
:(iii)  For all ''z'' there exists for every ''x'' a greatest ''y'', and for every ''y'' a greatest ''x'', such that ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' (the residuation properties).

In (iii), the "greatest ''y''", being a function of ''z'' and ''x'', is denoted ''x''\''z'' and called the '''right residual''' of ''z'' by ''x''. Think of it as what remains of ''z'' on the right after "dividing" ''z'' on the left by ''x''.  Dually, the "greatest ''x''" is denoted ''z''/''y'' and called the '''left residual''' of ''z'' by ''y''.  An equivalent, more formal statement of (iii) that uses these operations to name these greatest values is

(iii)'  for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L'', &amp;nbsp; ''y'' ≤ ''x''\''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x'' ≤ ''z''/''y''.

As suggested by the notation, the residuals are a form of quotient.  More precisely, for a given ''x'' in ''L'', the unary operations ''x''• and ''x''\ are respectively the lower and upper adjoints of a [[Galois connection]] on '''L''', and dually for the two functions •''y'' and /''y''.  By the same reasoning that applies to any Galois connection, we have yet another definition of the residuals, namely,
:''x''•(''x''\''y'') ≤ ''y'' ≤ ''x''\(''x''•''y''), and
:(''y''/''x'')•''x'' ≤ ''y'' ≤ (''y''•''x'')/''x'',

together with the requirement that ''x''•''y'' be monotone in ''x'' and ''y''.  (When axiomatized using (iii) or (iii)' monotonicity becomes a theorem and hence not required in the axiomatization.)  These give a sense in which the functions ''x''• and ''x''\ are pseudoinverses or adjoints of each other, and likewise for •''x'' and /''x''.

This last definition is purely in terms of inequalities, noting that monotonicity can be axiomatized as ''x''•''y'' ≤ (''x''&amp;or;''z'')•''y'' and similarly for the other operations and their arguments.  Moreover, any inequality ''x'' ≤ ''y'' can be expressed equivalently as an equation, either ''x''&amp;and;''y'' = ''x'' or ''x''&amp;or;''y'' = ''y''.  This along with the equations axiomatizing lattices and monoids then yields a purely equational definition of residuated lattices, provided the requisite operations are adjoined to the signature (''L'', ≤, •, '''I''') thereby expanding it to (''L'', &amp;and;, &amp;or;, •, '''I''', /, \).  When thus organized, residuated lattices form an equational class or [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], whose homomorphisms respect the residuals as well as the lattice and monoid operations.  Note that distributivity ''x''•(''y''&amp;or;''z'') = (''x''•''y'') &amp;or; (''x''•''z'') and ''x''•0 = 0 are consequences of these axioms and so do not need to be made part of the definition.  This necessary distributivity of • over &amp;or; does not in general entail distributivity of &amp;and; over &amp;or;, that is, a residuated lattice need not be a distributive lattice.  However it does do so when • and &amp;and; are the same operation, a special case of residuated lattices called a [[Heyting algebra]].
  
Alternative notations for ''x''•''y'' include ''x''&amp;#9702;''y'', ''x'';''y'' ([[relation algebra]]), and ''x''⊗''y'' ([[linear logic]]).  Alternatives for '''I''' include ''e'' and 1'.  Alternative notations for the residuals are ''x'' → ''y'' for ''x''\''y'' and ''y'' ← ''x'' for ''y''/''x'', suggested by the similarity between residuation and implication in logic, with the multiplication of the monoid understood as a form of conjunction that need not be commutative.  When the monoid is commutative the two residuals coincide.  When not commutative, the intuitive meaning of the monoid as conjunction and the residuals as implications can be understood as having a temporal quality: ''x''•''y'' means ''x'' ''and then'' ''y'', &amp;nbsp; ''x'' → ''y'' means ''had'' ''x'' (in the past) ''then'' ''y'' (now), &amp;nbsp; and ''y'' ← ''x'' means ''if-ever'' ''x'' (in the future) ''then'' ''y'' (at that time), as illustrated by the natural language example at the end of the examples.

== Examples ==
One of the original motivations for the study of residuated lattices was the lattice of (two-sided) [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Given a ring ''R'', the ideals of ''R'', denoted Id(''R''), forms a complete lattice with set intersection acting as the meet operation and "ideal addition" acting as the join operation. The monoid operation • is given by "ideal multiplication", and the element ''R'' of Id(''R'') acts as the identity for this operation. Given two ideals ''A'' and ''B'' in Id(''R''), the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;A/B:= \{r \in R \mid rB \subseteq A \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B\setminus A:=\{ r \in R \mid Br \subseteq A \}&lt;/math&gt;
It is worth noting that {0}/''B'' and ''B''\{0} are respectively the left and right [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilators]] of ''B''. This residuation is related to the ''[[conductor (ring theory)|conductor]]'' (or ''transporter'') in [[commutative algebra]] written as (''A'':''B'')=''A''/''B''. One difference in usage is that ''B'' need not be an ideal of ''R'': it may just be a subset.

[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[Heyting algebras]] are commutative residuated lattices in which ''x''•''y'' = ''x''&amp;and;''y'' (whence the unit '''I''' is the top element 1 of the algebra) and both residuals ''x''\''y'' and ''y''/''x'' are the same operation, namely implication ''x'' → ''y''.  The second example is quite general since Heyting algebras include all finite [[distributive lattice]]s, as well as all chains or [[total order]]s forming a [[complete lattice]], for example the unit interval [0,1] in the real line, or the integers and ±&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The structure ('''Z''', ''min'', ''max'', +, 0, &amp;minus;, &amp;minus;) (the integers with subtraction for both residuals) is a commutative residuated lattice such that the unit of the monoid is not the greatest element (indeed there is no least or greatest integer), and the multiplication of the monoid is not the meet operation of the lattice.  In this example the inequalities are equalities because &amp;minus; (subtraction) is not merely the adjoint or pseudoinverse of + but the true inverse.  Any totally ordered group under addition such as the rationals or the reals can be substituted for the integers in this example.  The nonnegative portion of any of these examples is an example provided ''min'' and ''max'' are interchanged and &amp;minus; is replaced by [[monus]], defined (in this case) so that ''x''-''y'' = 0 when ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and otherwise is ordinary subtraction.

A more general class of examples is given by the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of all [[binary relations]] on a set ''X'',  namely the power set of ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation '''I''' on ''X'' consisting of all pairs (''x'',''x'') for ''x'' in ''X''.  Given two relations ''R'' and ''S'' on ''X'', the right residual ''R''\''S'' of ''S'' by ''R'' is the binary relation such that ''x''(''R''\''S'')''y'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''zRx'' implies ''zSy'' (notice the connection with implication).  The left residual is the mirror image of this: ''y''(''S''/''R'')''x'' holds just when for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''xRz'' implies ''ySz''.

This can be illustrated with the binary relations &lt; and &gt; on {0,1} in which 0 &lt; 1 and 1 &gt; 0 are the only relationships that hold.  Then ''x''(&gt;\&lt;)''y'' holds just when ''x'' = 1, while ''x''(&lt;/&gt;)''y'' holds just when ''y'' = 0, showing that residuation of &lt; by &gt; is different depending on whether we residuate on the right or the left.  This difference is a consequence of the difference between &lt;•&gt; and &gt;•&lt;, where the only relationships that hold are 0(&lt;•&gt;)0 (since 0&lt;1&gt;0) and 1(&gt;•&lt;)1 (since 1&gt;0&lt;1).  Had we chosen ≤ and ≥ instead of &lt; and &gt;, ≥\≤ and ≤/≥ would have been the same because ≤•≥ = ≥•≤, both of which always hold between all ''x'' and ''y'' (since ''x''≤1≥''y'' and ''x''≥0≤''y'').

The Boolean algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[formal language]]s over an alphabet (set) Σ forms a residuated lattice whose monoid multiplication is language concatenation ''LM'' and whose monoid unit '''I''' is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty string ε.  The right residual ''M''\''L'' consists of all words ''w'' over Σ such that ''Mw'' ⊆ ''L''.  The left residual ''L''/''M'' is the same with ''wM'' in place of ''Mw''.

The residuated lattice of all binary relations on ''X'' is finite just when ''X'' is finite, and commutative just when ''X'' has at most one element.  When ''X'' is empty the algebra is the degenerate Boolean algebra in which 0 = 1 = '''I'''.  The residuated lattice of all languages on Σ is commutative just when Σ has at most one letter.  It is finite just when Σ is empty, consisting of the two languages 0 (the empty language {}) and the monoid unit '''I''' = {ε} = 1.

The examples forming a Boolean algebra have special properties treated in the article on [[residuated Boolean algebra]]s.

In [[natural language]] residuated lattices formalize the logic of "and" when used with its noncommutative meaning of "and then."  Setting ''x'' = ''bet'', ''y'' = ''win'', ''z'' = ''rich'', we can read ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'' as "bet and then win entails rich."  By the axioms this is equivalent to ''y'' ≤ ''x''→''z'' meaning "win entails had bet then rich", and also to ''x'' ≤ ''z''←''y'' meaning "bet entails if-ever win then rich."  Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as "bet entails had win then rich" and "win entails if-ever bet then rich" as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking "win and then bet entails rich."  Humans do not so readily detect that [[Peirce's law]] ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P'' is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with nonclassical reasoning than classical.

==Residuated semilattice==
A '''residuated semilattice''' is defined almost identically for residuated lattices, omitting just the meet operation &amp;and;.  Thus it is an [[algebraic structure]] L = (L, ∨, •, 1, /, \) satisfying all the residuated lattice equations as specified above except those containing an occurrence of the symbol &amp;and;.  The option of defining ''x'' ≤ ''y'' as ''x''&amp;and;''y'' = ''x'' is then not available, leaving only the other option ''x''&amp;or;''y'' = ''y'' (or any equivalent thereof).

Any residuated lattice can be made a residuated semilattice simply by omitting &amp;and;.  Residuated semilattices arise in connection with [[action algebra]]s, which are residuated semilattices that are also [[Kleene algebra]]s, for which &amp;and; is ordinarily not required.

The '''Sea Mammal Research Unit''' (SMRU) is a [[marine science]] research organisation in [[Fife]], Scotland. It provides the UK's main science capability in the field of [[marine mammal]] biology. It is located at the [[Gatty Marine Laboratory]], part of the [[University of St Andrews]]. It was established in 1978, when the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] merged its Seals Research Division and Whale Research Unit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/documents/SMRU_Scientific_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

SMRU's current strategic science priorities include evaluating the status of marine mammal populations; investigating the importance of marine mammals as components of [[marine ecosystem]]s; determining the dynamics of marine mammal populations; studying marine mammal social structure and communication; providing the technological basis for observing free-ranging marine mammals and their environment. SMRU also uses the popularity of marine mammals to improve public knowledge about the [[marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx?psr=408&lt;/ref&gt;

SMRU's activities address the requirements for information about marine mammals identified in the UK and Scottish Sustainable Development and Biodiversity Strategies and the Strategy for Scotland’s Coast and Inshore Waters. It is also relevant to the Joint UK Response to the Review of Marine Nature Conservation, the EU Marine Strategy and the UK Small Cetacean Bycatch Response Strategy.

SMRU is an independent NERC collaborative centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/collaborative/smru.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The funding it receives from NERC is mainly to support the [[Conservation of Seals Act 1970]]. SMRU focuses over half of its research effort on [[cetaceans]]. In agreement with NERC, SMRU raises the remainder of its funding from other sources. These include the [[European Union]], [[Defra]], [[Scottish Government]] and UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. It also develops and supplies instrumentation to the science community.

SMRU Consulting Ltd (Europe)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smruconsulting.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2006 as the commercial arm of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews and provides consultancy services and advice on marine environmental issues. They have offices in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.

Notable SMRU Consulting projects includes Marine Mammal Mitigation on the world's first commercial tidal device at Strangford Loch&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seageneration.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of PAMBuoy, now Decimus - run by St Andrews Instrumentation Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sa-instrumentation.com//&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1st June 2016, a dead Minke whale washed ashore on the West Sands beach of St. Andrews, near to the SMRU, and was discovered by a dog walker that evening. During low-tide on the 2nd June, staff and students from the SMRU, along with the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme, jointly conducted a necropsy of the whale in view of the public. Noting signature abrasions on the tailstock, and excessive fluid in the lungs, they concluded that the animal had been caught in a fishing trawler's lines, and was drowned by the dragging.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Strandings/posts/1015236731900447&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4667">{{Semiotics}}
[[Semiotics]] is the study of [[meaning-making]] on the basis of signs. Semiotics of [[photography]] is the observation of symbolism used within photography or "reading" the picture. This article refers to realistic, unedited photographs not those that have been manipulated in any way.
[[Roland Barthes]] was one of the first people to study the semiotics of images. He developed a way to understand the meaning of images. Most of Barthes' studies related to advertising, but his concepts can apply to photography as well.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borchers|first=Timothy|title=Rhetorical Theory|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, California|isbn=0-534-63918-6|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denotation==

[[Denotation]] refers to the meaning hidden in symbols or images. A denotation is "what we see" in the picture or what is "there" in the picture.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bate|first=David|title=Photography: The Key Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Burg|isbn=978-1-84520-667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], this is another way of saying that a photograph has both a signified and a referent, is both coded and encoded. This is to re-emphasize the co-existence of the iconic and idexical.&lt;ref name=References&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Clive|title=The Spoken Image: Photography and Language|year=1999|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-032-0|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In photography the photo itself is the signifier, the signified is what the image is or represents.&lt;ref name="Seiter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiter|first=Ellen|title=Semiotics, Structuralism, and Television|url=http://www.asu.edu/courses/lia394c/total-readings/Seiter--Semiotics.htm|work=Channels of Discourse, Reassembled: Television and Contemporary Criticism|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literal meaning of the image.

==Connotation==

[[Connotation (Semiotics)]] is arbitrary in that the meanings brought to the image are based on rules or conventions that the reader has learnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics in the Visual Arts|year=2010|publisher=AVA Publishing|isbn=978-2-940411-42-9|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotation attaches additional meaning to the first signifier, which is why the first signifier is often described in multiple words that include things like camera angle, color, lighting, etc.&lt;ref name="Seiter"/&gt; It is the immediate cultural meaning from what is seen in the picture, but not what is actually there.&lt;ref name="Bate 2009"/&gt; Connotation is what is implied by the image.

==Coded iconic==

According to Roland Barthes the coded iconic message is the story that the image portrays. This message is easily understood and the images represent a clear relationship.&lt;ref name="Borchers 2006 271"/&gt; The "reader" of the image applies their knowledge to the encoding of the photo. An image of a bowl of fruit for example might imply still life, freshness or market stalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=David|title=Visible Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics|year=2003|publisher=AKA Books|isbn=978-2-88479-035-2|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noncoded iconic==

Noncoded iconic is another part of Barthes' theory of understanding images. Noncoded has nothing to do with the emotions from the image as a whole. It is the "literal" denotation, the recognition of identifiable object in the photograph, irrespective of the larger societal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seiler|first=Robert M.|title=Roland Barthes|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/barthes.htm|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the bowl of fruit example, this photograph is just that, a bowl of fruit. A non-coded iconic has no deeper meaning, the image is exactly what it shows.

[[Image:Landpeople s cc8.PNG|thumb|right|250px|[[Septic tank]] and septic drain field]]
'''Septic drain fields''', also called '''leach fields''' or '''leach drains,''' are subsurface [[wastewater]] disposal facilities used to remove contaminants and impurities from the liquid that emerges after [[anaerobic digestion]] in a [[septic tank]].

A [[septic tank]], the septic drain field, and the associated piping compose a [[septic system]].  The septic drain field is effective for disposal of organic materials readily [[catabolism|catabolized]] by a microbial [[ecosystem]]. 
The drain field typically consists of an arrangement of trenches containing perforated pipes and porous material (often [[gravel]]) covered by a layer of [[soil]] to prevent [[animal]]s (and [[surface runoff]]) from reaching the [[wastewater]] distributed within those trenches.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, E.W. &amp; McGhee, Terence J. "Water Supply and Sewerage"McGraw-Hill Book Company (1979) {{ISBN|0-07-060929-2}} pp.576-577&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary design considerations are ''hydraulic'' for the volume of wastewater requiring disposal and ''catabolic'' for the long-term [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of that wastewater.

[[Sewage farm]]s are similarly used to dispose of [[wastewater]] through a series of ditches and lagoons (often with little or no pre-treatment). These are more often found in arid countries as the waterflow on the surface allows for irrigation (and fertilization) of agricultural land.

==Design==
[[File:Landpeople s cc9.gif|thumb|left|250px|Cross-section of [[weeping tile]] and leach field]]
Many health departments require a [[percolation test]] ("perc" test) to establish suitability of drain field soil to receive septic tank effluent.  An [[engineer]] or licensed designer may be required to work with the local governing agency to design a system that conforms to these criteria.

The goal of percolation testing is to ensure the soil is permeable enough for septic tank effluent to [[percolate]] away from the drain field, but fine grained enough to filter out pathogenic bacteria and viruses before they travel far enough to reach a [[water well]] or surface water supply. Coarse soils &amp;ndash; [[sand]] and gravel &amp;ndash; can transmit wastewater away from the drain field before pathogens are destroyed. [[Silt]] and [[clay]] effectively filter out pathogens but allow very limited wastewater flow rates.&lt;ref&gt;Alth, Max &amp; Charlotte "Constructing and Maintaining your Well &amp; Septic System" Tab Books (1984) {{ISBN|0-8306-0654-8}} pp.166-167&lt;/ref&gt; Percolation tests measure the rate at which clean water disperses through a disposal trench into the soil. Several factors may reduce observed percolation rates when the drain field receives [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] septic tank effluent:&lt;ref&gt;Alth, Max &amp; Charlotte "Constructing and Maintaining your Well &amp; Septic System" Tab Books (1984) {{ISBN|0-8306-0654-8}} p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

*Microbial colonies catabolizing soluble organic compounds from the septic tank effluent will adhere to soil particles and reduce the interstitial area available for water flow between soil particles.  These colonies tend to form a low-permeability [[biofilm]] of gelatinous slime at the soil interface of the disposal trench.&lt;ref&gt;Alth, Max &amp; Charlotte "Constructing and Maintaining your Well &amp; Septic System" Tab Books (1984) {{ISBN|0-8306-0654-8}} pp.164-165&amp;219&lt;/ref&gt;
*Insoluble particles small enough to be carried through the septic tank will accumulate at the soil interface of the disposal trench; non-biodegradable particles like [[synthetic fiber]] lint from laundry, mineral soil from washing, or bone and eggshell fragments from [[Garbage disposal unit|garbage disposal]]s will remain to fill interstitial areas formerly available for water flow out of the trench.&lt;ref&gt;Alth, Max &amp; Charlotte "Constructing and Maintaining your Well &amp; Septic System" Tab Books (1984) {{ISBN|0-8306-0654-8}} p.219&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cooking fats or [[petroleum]] products emulsified by [[detergent]]s or dissolved by [[solvent]]s can flow through prior to anaerobic liquifaction when septic tank volume is too small to offer adequate residence time, and may congeal as a [[hydrophobic]] layer on the soil interface of the disposal trench.&lt;ref name=hammer&gt;Hammer, Mark J. "Water and Waste-water Technology" John Wiley &amp; Sons (1975) {{ISBN|0-471-34726-4}} pp.407-408&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rising [[groundwater]] levels may reduce the available [[hydraulic head]] (or vertical distance) causing gravitational water flow away from the disposal trench.  Effluent initially flowing downward from the disposal trench ultimately encounters groundwater or impermeable rock or clay requiring a directional shift to horizontal movement away from the drain field.  A certain vertical distance is required between the effluent level in the disposal trench and the water level where the effluent is leaving the drain field for gravitational force to overcome [[viscosity|viscous frictional]] forces resisting flow through porous soil. Effluent levels in the vicinity of the drain field will appear to rise toward the ground surface to preserve that vertical distance difference if groundwater levels surrounding the drain field approach the level of effluent in the disposal trench.&lt;ref name=hammer/&gt;
*Frozen ground may seasonally reduce the cross-sectional area available for flow or evaporation.

=== Catabolic design ===
Just as the septic tank is sized to support a community of anaerobic organisms capable of liquifying anticipated amounts of putresible materials in wastewater, the drain field should be sized to support a community of aerobic soil [[microorganisms]] capable of [[decomposition|decomposing]] the anaerobic septic tank's effluent into aerobic water.  [[Hydrogen sulfide]] odors or [[iron bacteria]] may be observed in nearby wells or surface waters when effluent has not been completely oxidized prior to reaching those areas.&lt;ref name="hammer" /&gt;  The biofilm on the walls of the drain field trenches will use atmospheric [[oxygen]] in the trenches to catabolize organic compounds in septic tank effluent.  Groundwater flow is [[laminar flow|laminar]] in the aquifer soils surrounding the drain field.&lt;ref&gt;Linsley, Ray K. &amp; Franzini, Joseph B. "Water-Resources Engineering (2nd Ed.)" McGraw-Hill Book Company (1972) {{ISBN|978-0-07-037959-6}}, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Septic tank effluent with soluble organic compounds passing through the biofilm forms a mounded lens atop groundwater underlying the drain field.  [[Molecular diffusion]] controls mixing of soluble organic compounds into groundwater and transport of oxygen from underlying groundwater or the [[capillary fringe]] of the groundwater surface to micro-organisms capable of catabolizing dissolved organic compounds remaining in the effluent plume.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Robert H., Chilton, Cecil H. &amp; Kirkpatrick, Sidney D. "Chemical Engineers' Handbook (4th Ed.)" McGraw-Hill Book Company (1963) p.14-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofilter===
When a [[septic tank]] is used in combination with a [[biofilter]], the height and catabolic area of the drain field may be reduced.  This technology may allow higher density residential construction, minimal site disturbance, more usable land for trees, swimming pools, or gardens.  With adequate routine maintenance it may reduce the chances of the drain field plugging up.  The biofilter will not reduce the volume of liquid that must percolate into soil, but it may reduce the oxygen demand of organic materials in that liquid.

== Operation and maintenance ==

===Dosing schedules or resting periods===
A drain field may be designed to offer several separate disposal areas for effluent from a single septic tank.  One area may be "rested" while effluent is routed to a different area.  The [[nematode]] community in the resting drain field continues feeding on the accumulated biofilm and fats when the anaerobic septic tank effluent is no longer available.  This natural cleansing process may reduce [[bioclogging]] to improve hydraulic capacity of the field by increasing available interstitial area of the soil as accumulated organic material is oxidized.  The percolation rate after resting may approach, but is unlikely to match, the original clean water percolation rate of the site.

===Inappropriate wastes===
[[Image:Klamath Septic Leach Field.JPG|thumb|right|Septic drain field exposed by flood damage.]]
Septic tank and drain field microorganisms have very limited capability for catabolizing petroleum products and [[organochloride|chlorinated solvents]], and cannot remove dissolved [[metals]]; although some may [[sorption|sorb]] onto septic tank sludge or drain field soils, and concentrations may be diluted by other groundwater in the vicinity of the drain field.  Cleaning formulations may reduce drain field efficiency.  Laundry [[bleach]] may slow or stop microbial activity in the drain field, and [[disinfectant|sanitizing]] or deodorizing chemicals may have similar effects.  Detergents, solvents and [[drain cleaner]]s may transport [[emulsion|emulsified]], [[saponification|saponified]] or dissolved fats into the drain field before they can be catabolized to short-chain organic acids in the septic tank scum layer.&lt;ref name=hammer/&gt;

'''Sheldon Lee Gosline'' is an [[United States|American]] [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has extensively studied the ancient civilizations of the Far East. He is noted for proposing the existence of a developing literate civilization in southern China dating to the second millennium BCE.

==Biography==
Sheldon Lee Gosline began his professional education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a B.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Art History in 1985. He later continued his studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. degree 1988 and was awarded an M.A. degree in Oriental Studies in 1993.
He interrupted his stay at Cambridge to study at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an M.A. degree in Egyptology and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1992.
After Cambridge he studied at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from [[University College London]], where he researched at the [[Wellcome Trust]] Centre for the History of Medicine and the [[UCL Centre for the History of Medicine]]. His thesis concerned the intersection of business and medicine.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;[https://www.explorers.org/events/detail/nyc_public_lecture_series_feat_sheldon_gosline ''The Explorers Club''], NYC Public Lecture Series Featuring Sheldon Gosline (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gosline is owner of Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts based in Warren Center, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts|url=http://shangri-la.0catch.com/|publisher=Shangri-La|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.shangri-la.0catch.com|url=http://www.roadurls.com/www.shangri-la.0catch.com|website=Road Url|publisher=Road Url|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline has taught at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and at UW-Madison. He was at Northeast Normal University through 2004.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; 
In 2011, he moved to London to pursue a Ph.D. in the history of medicine, at [[University College London]]. Once he completed the degree, he returned to China to research the writing of the country’s minority groups.  He was first a visiting professor at [[Minzu University of China]] and [[Tsinghua University]], both in Beijing.  Since 2015, he has taught medical humanities at [[Peking University]]. He is a member of several professional associations.

He states that he has become proficient in or conversant with nine contemporary or ancient languages.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://shangri-la.0catch.com/press/vitae.html] ''Vitae of Prof. Sheldon Lee Gosline'' (shangri-la website; accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost civilization theory==
IN 2013 Gosline was shown some inscriptions found in [[Guangxi]] province and considered that several were based on the [[Indus script]] and Persian cuneiform. On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.”   Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device".&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt; He returned to what he called an "observatory complex" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. 

Reports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that "Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made," "No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks "were certainly produced by natural force".&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ye|first1=Xiaohong|title=Preliminary Observation and Cognition at Gansang|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0714/46829.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. &lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Fengxian|title=A Survey of Gansang site and Further Discussion|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46710.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that "Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi".  The conclusion was that "We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites" and that most of the "scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the "Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach." Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with "the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.&lt;ref name="Nu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nu|first1=He|title=Thinking about the Sites in Pingguo county, S China|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46706.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-a-coded-message-lead-an-american-to-a-lost-civilization-in-china?ct=t(Newsletter_4_21_20164_20_2016)&amp;mc_cid=5e86c4b93a&amp;mc_eid=34be11d5e3] Did A Coded Message Lead an American to a Lost Civilization in

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5920">'''Software diagnosis''' (also: ''software diagnostics'') refers to concepts, techniques, and tools that allow for obtaining findings, conclusions, and evaluations about [[software system]]s and their implementation, composition, behavior, and evolution. It serves as means to monitor, steer, observe and optimize software development, software maintenance, and software re-engineering in the sense of a [[business intelligence]] approach specific to software systems. It is generally based on the automatic extraction, analysis, and visualization of corresponding information sources of the software system. It can also be manually done and not automatic.

== Applications ==
Software diagnosis supports all branches of [[software engineering]], in particular project management, quality management, risk management as well as implementation and test. Its main strength is to support all stakeholders of software projects (in particular during [[software maintenance]] and for software re-engineering tasks&lt;ref&gt;Martin Beck, Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: "A Visual Analysis and Design Tool for Planning Software Reengineerings". Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 54-61, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) and to provide effective communication means for [[software development]] projects. For example, software diagnosis facilitates "bridging an essential information gap between management and development, improve awareness, and serve as early risk detection instrument".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet, Jürgen Döllner: "Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps". Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Software diagnosis includes assessment methods for "perfective maintenance" that, for example, apply "visual analysis techniques to combine multiple indicators for low maintainability, including code complexity and entanglement with other parts of the system, and recent changes applied to the code".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper et al.: "A Visual Analysis Approach to Support Perfective Software Maintenance". Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Visualisation, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 308-315, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In contrast to manifold approaches and techniques in [[software engineering]], software diagnosis does not depend on programming languages, modeling techniques, software development processes or the specific techniques used in the various stages of the software development process. Instead, software diagnosis aims at analyzing and evaluating the software system in its as-is state and based on system-generated information to bybass any subjective or potentially outdated information sources (e.g., initial software models). For it, software diagnosis combines and relates sources of information that are typically not directly linked. Examples: 
* Source-code metrics are related with software developer activity to gain insight into developer-specific effects on software code quality.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Limberger et al.: "Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis". Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* System structure and run-time execution traces are correlated to facilitate program comprehension through dynamic analysis in software maintenance tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper et al.: "ViewFusion: Correlating Structure and Activity Views for Execution Traces". Proceedings of the 10th Theory and Practice of Computer Graphics Conference, European Association for Computer Graphics, pp. 45-52, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
The core principle of software diagnosis is to automatically extract information from all available information sources of a given software projects such as source code base, project repository, code metrics, execution traces,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet: "Visualization of Execution Traces and its Application to Software Maintenance". PhD thesis, Hasso-Plattner-Institut, University of Potsdam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; test results, etc. To combine information, software-specific data mining, analysis, and visualization techniques are applied. Its strength results, among various reasons, from integrating decoupled information spaces in the scope of a typical software project, for example development and developer activities (recorded by the repository) and code and quality metrics (derived by analyzing source code) or key performance indicators (KPIs).

== Examples ==
Examples of software diagnosis tools include [[software map]]s and [[software metrics]].

== Critics ==
Software diagnosis—in contrast to many approaches in software engineering—does not assume that developer capabilities, development methods, programming or modeling languages are right or wrong (or better or worse compared to each other): Software diagnosis aims at giving insight into a given software system and its status ''regardless of the methods, languages, or models'' used to create and maintain the system.

[[File:Electrical Terminal Symbol.svg|thumb|Electrical terminal diagram symbol]]
A '''terminal''' is the point at which a [[electrical conductor|conductor]] from an [[electrical component]], device or network comes to an end and provides a point of connection to external [[electronic circuit|circuits]].  A terminal may simply be the end of a wire or it may be fitted with a connector or fastener.  In network analysis, terminal means a point at which connections can be made to a network in theory and does not necessarily refer to any real physical object.  In this context, especially in older documents, it is sometimes called a '''pole'''.

The connection may be temporary, as seen in portable equipment, may require a tool for assembly and removal, or may be a permanent electrical joint between two wires or devices.

All electric cells have two terminals. The first is the positive terminal and the second is the negative terminal. The positive terminal looks like a metal cap and the negative terminal looks like a metal disc. The current flows from the positive terminal, and out through the negative terminal, replicative of current flow (positive (+) to negative (-) flow).

== Types of terminals ==
* Splices
* Cups
* Hooks
* Solder Lugs
* Tongue Crimp terminals (ring terminals)
* Turrets
* Test probes (pogo terminals)
* [[Crocodile clip|Clips]]
* [[Screw terminal]]s
* Tab terminals (quick-connect, quick-disconnect)
* [[Wire nut]]s

'''''The Emperor's New Drugs – Exploding the Antidepressant Myth''''' is a 2009 book by [[Irving Kirsch]], arguing that the [[chemical imbalance theory]] of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] is wrong and that [[antidepressants]] have little or no direct effect on depression but, because of their common serious side-effects, they are a powerful [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="Kirsch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
While analyzing antidepressant trials as part of his research into the [[placebo]] effect, Kirsch realised that drug companies do not publish all of their disappointing antidepressant trial results, but most decisions about the efficacy of an antidepressant are based only on published results. Using the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], he and his colleagues acquired from the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] the unpublished trial results for six antidepressants. When the results from both published and unpublished studies were averaged, the researchers concluded that the drugs produced a small but [[Clinical significance|clinically meaningless]] improvement in mood compared with an inert placebo (sugar pill).&lt;ref name=Medscape/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirsch2002&gt;{{cite journal|title= The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|author1=Kirsch, Irving |author2=Moore, Thomas J. |author3=Scoboria, Alan |author4=Nicholls, Sarah S |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment|volume=5|issue=1|date= Jul 2002|doi= 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some researchers have questioned the statistical basis of this study suggesting that it underestimates the effect size of antidepressants&lt;ref name="HORDER2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horder J, Matthews P, Waldmann R | title = Placebo, Prozac and PLoS: significant lessons for psychopharmacology | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1277–88 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20571143 | doi = 10.1177/0269881110372544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOUNTOULAKIS2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fountoulakis KN, Möller HJ | title = Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20800012 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145710000957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other studies have reached a range of supporting and conflicting conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibbons RD, Hur K, Brown CH, Davis JM, Mann JJ | title = Benefits from antidepressants: synthesis of 6-week patient-level outcomes from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 572–9 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22393205 | pmc = 3371295 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2044 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, etal |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether their averaging of results was hiding a meaningful benefit to more-severely depressed patients by combining their results with those of moderately and mildly depressed patients, he and his colleagues undertook another study, this time of the four new-generation antidepressants for which all (published and unpublished) trial data were available, and concluded that the difference between drug and placebo effect was greater for more-severely depressed patients, and that this difference was clinically meaningful (but still relatively small) only at the upper end of the very severely depressed category. They attributed this difference to very seriously depressed patients being less responsive to the inert placebo.&lt;ref name=Kirsch2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |date=February 2008  |pmid=18303940 |pmc=2253608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirsch also addresses the conclusions of the [[STAR*D|a 2004 study]], that if one antidepressant doesn't work on a patient, another should be tried in its place, and then another, until hopefully one will be found to be effective. The 2004 study found that although only 37% of patients were helped by the first antidepressant tried, 67% had found some relief by the time they had tried the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rush AJ |title=Sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D): rationale and design |journal=Control Clin Trials |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=119–42 |date=February 2004  |pmid=15061154 |doi= 10.1016/s0197-2456(03)00112-0|url=|name-list-format=vanc |author2= Fava M |author3= Wisniewski SR |displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsch cites a 1957 study&lt;ref name="Kirsch59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which volunteers were given a drug that induces nausea and one to treat nausea. If the anti-nausea drug failed to prevent nausea, they were given another. If that failed, another was tried; and so on.

Since the [[Psychopharmacology revolution#Theory of mood disorders|chemical-imbalance theory of depression]] is based on the efficacy of antidepressants, Kirsch concludes, "It now seems beyond question that the traditional account of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain is simply wrong."&lt;ref name=Menand/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirsch80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
The European Psychiatric Association published a position paper in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Möller HJ, Bitter I, Bobes J, Fountoulakis K, Höschl C, Kasper S |title=Position statement of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) on the value of antidepressants in the treatment of unipolar depression |journal=Eur. Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=114–28 |year=2012 |pmid=22119161 |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.08.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933811001398}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described Kirsch's argument as "misleading".  The organization argues that 
* The mathematical treatment of the data was flawed and underestimates the efficacy of antidepressants; 
* The analysis incorrectly focuses on mean differences between groups and ignores important subgroup effects; 
* The size effect cutoff of 0.50 is arbitrary and not demonstrated to be clinically meaningful; 
* That efficacy measured by the 15-20% difference between placebo and active antidepressant treatment in rate of remission corresponds to moderate to strong efficacy in evidence-based medicine analyses, and 
* Kirsch's analysis disregards the results of double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance studies that show highly statistical effects on the rate of relapse for those treated with antidepressants relative to those receiving placebo

[[Marcia Angell]]'s review of The Emperor's New Drugs welcomes Kirsch's work as a long overdue application of the scientific method to a field lacking rigorous scientific analysis, stating "Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/06/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/ |title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why? |last=Angell |first=Marcia |website=[[New York Review of Books]] |publication-date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Daniel Carlat]] called the book "an important book, with the reservation that Kirsch’s selective use of data gives him the appearance of an anti-antidepressant partisan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Book Review: The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth. Irving Kirsch Basic Books; 2010. | pmc=3001545 | page=E873 | volume=182 | issue=18 | journal=CMAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He states that Irving's conclusions are "provocative but unconvincing", noting that many drugs such as benzodiazepines have been tested for antidepressant activity and found inactive.  Carlat argues that if antidepressants were acting purely via a placebo effect, any benzodiazepines and other drugs would show activity as well.

In a 2012 episode of [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'' featuring Kirsch and his book, host [[Lesley Stahl]] said, "The medical community is at war – battling over the scientific research and writings of a psychologist named Irving Kirsch ... Kirsch and his studies have triggered a furious counterattack, mainly from psychiatrists."&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/treating-depression-is-there-a-placebo-effect/|title=Treating Depression: Is there a Placebo Effect? |date=19 February 2012 |website= CBS, 60 Minutes |publisher= |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the program's airing, [[Jeffrey Lieberman]], the American Psychiatric Association's president elect at the time, said, "Dr. Kirsch is mistaken and confused, and he's ideologically biased in his thinking. He is conducting an analysis and interpreting the data to support his ideologically biased perspective.  What he is concluding is inaccurate, and what he is communicating is misleading to people and potentially harmful to those who really suffer from depression and would be expected to benefit from antidepressant medication. To say that antidepressants are no better than placebo is just plain wrong." &lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/760569 |author= Fran Lowry|title=APA Blasts 60 Minutes Program on Antidepressants |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22682">'''Uncertainty quantification (UQ)''' is the science of quantitative characterization and reduction of [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in both computational and real world applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.

Many problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. [[Computer experiment]]s on [[computer model|computer simulation]]s are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Sacks, William J. Welch, Toby J. Mitchell and Henry P. Wynn, ''Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments'', Statistical Science, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Nov., 1989), pp. 409-423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Iman, Jon C. Helton, ''An Investigation of Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis Techniques for Computer Models'', Risk Analysis, Volume 8, Issue 1, pages 71–90, March 1988, DOI: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01155.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Walker, P. Harremoës, J. Rotmans, J.P. van der Sluijs, M.B.A. van Asselt, P. Janssen and M.P. Krayer von Krauss, ''Defining Uncertainty: A Conceptual Basis for Uncertainty Management in Model-Based Decision Support'', Integrated Assessment, Volume 4, Issue 1, 2003, DOI: 10.1076/iaij.4.1.5.16466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of uncertainty==
Uncertainty can enter [[mathematical model]]s and experimental measurements in various contexts. One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:&lt;ref name="KennedyOHagan"&gt;Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, ''Bayesian calibration of computer models'', Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B Volume 63, Issue 3, pages 425–464, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

; Parameter uncertainty: This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by [[statistical methods]]. Some examples of this are the local [[free fall|free-fall]] acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and [[multiplier uncertainty]] in the context of [[macroeconomic policy]] optimization.
; Parametric variability: This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.
; Structural uncertainty: Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.
; Algorithmic uncertainty: Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the [[finite element method]] or [[finite difference|finite difference method]] may be used to approximate the solution of a [[partial differential equation]] (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation.
; Experimental uncertainty: Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables.
; Interpolation uncertainty: This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses.

===Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty===
Uncertainty is sometimes classified into two categories,&lt;ref&gt;Armen Der Kiureghiana, Ove Ditlevsen, ''Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter?'', Structural Safety, Volume 31, Issue 2, March 2009, Pages 105–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann G. Matthies, ''Quantifying uncertainty: modern computational representation of probability and applications'', Extreme Man-Made and Natural Hazards in Dynamics of Structures, NATO Security through Science Series, 2007, 105-135, DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4020-5656-7_4&lt;/ref&gt; although the validity of this categorization is open to debate.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} These categories are prominently seen in medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Abhaya Indrayan, "Medical Biostatistics, Second Edition", Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press, 2008, pages 8, 673&lt;/ref&gt;

; Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. For example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points.  The argument here is obviously in the definition of "cannot".  Just because we cannot measure sufficiently with our currently available measurement devices does not preclude necessarily the existence of such information, which would move this uncertainty into the below category.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
; Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but doesn't in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration.

In real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward to perform, depending on the application. Techniques such as the [[Monte Carlo method]] are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] (in the [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] case, the [[mean]] and [[covariance]] suffice, although it should be noted that, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as [[Karhunen–Loève theorem|Karhunen–Loève]] and [[polynomial chaos]] expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as [[probability bounds analysis]], [[fuzzy logic]] or evidence theory ([[Dempster–Shafer theory]] – a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.

==Two types of uncertainty quantification problems==
There are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the '''forward''' propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the '''inverse''' assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.

===Forward uncertainty propagation===
{{See also|Propagation of uncertainty}}
Uncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the ''parametric variability'' listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be:
* To evaluate low-order moments of the outputs, i.e. [[mean]] and [[variance]].
* To evaluate the reliability of the outputs. This is especially useful in [[reliability engineering]] where outputs of a system are usually closely related to the performance of the system.
* To assess the complete probability distribution of the outputs. This is useful in the scenario of [[utility]] optimization where the complete distribution is used to calculate the utility.

===Inverse uncertainty quantification===
{{see also|Inverse problem}}
Given some experimental measurements of a system and some computer simulation results from its mathematical model, inverse uncertainty quantification estimates the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model (which is called '''bias correction'''), and estimates the values of unknown parameters in the model if there are any (which is called '''parameter calibration''' or simply '''calibration'''). Generally this is a much more difficult problem than forward uncertainty propagation; however it is of great importance since it is typically implemented in a model updating process. There are several scenarios in inverse uncertainty quantification:
[[File:Bias Correction.png|thumb|right|300px|The outcome of bias correction, including an updated model (prediction mean) and prediction confidence interval.]]

====Bias correction only====
Bias correction quantifies the ''model inadequacy'', i.e. the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model. The general model updating formula for bias correction is:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x})+\delta(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the experimental measurements as a function of several input variables &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the computer model (mathematical model) response, &lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the additive discrepancy function (aka bias function), and &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; denotes the experimental uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the discrepancy function &lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;, and as a by-product, the resulting updated model is &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x})+\delta(\mathbf{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. A prediction confidence interval is provided with the updated model as the quantification of the uncertainty.

====Parameter calibration only====
Parameter calibration estimates the values of one or more unknown parameters in a mathematical model. The general model updating formulation for calibration is:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^*)+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the computer model response that depends on several unknown model parameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt; denotes the true values of the unknown parameters in the course of experiments. The objective is to either estimate &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt;, or to come up with a probability distribution of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta}^* &lt;/math&gt; that encompasses the best knowledge of the true parameter values.

====Bias correction and parameter calibration====
It considers an inaccurate model with one or more unknown parameters, and its model updating formulation combines the two together:
:&lt;math&gt; y^e(\mathbf{x})=y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}^*)+\delta(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;
It is the most comprehensive model updating formulation that includes all possible sources of uncertainty, and it requires the most effort to solve.

==Selective methodologies for uncertainty quantification==
Much research has been done to solve uncertainty quantification problems, though a majority of them deal with uncertainty propagation. During the past one to two decades, a number of approaches for inverse uncertainty quantification problems have also been developed and have proved to be useful for most small- to medium-scale problems.

===Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation===
Existing uncertainty propagation approaches include probabilistic approaches and non-probabilistic approaches. There are basically five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation:&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Lee and W. Chen, ''A comparative study of uncertainty propagation methods for black-box-type problems'', Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization
Volume 37, Number 3 (2009), 239-253, DOI: 10.1007/s00158-008-0234-7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simulation-based methods: [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulations]], [[importance sampling]], adaptive sampling, etc.
* Local expansion-based methods: Taylor series, [[Perturbation theory|perturbation method]], etc. These methods have advantages when dealing with relatively small input variability and outputs that don't express high nonlinearity. These linear or linearized methods are detailed in the article [[Uncertainty propagation]].
* Functional expansion-based methods: Neumann expansion, orthogonal or Karhunen-Loeve expansions (KLE), with [[Polynomial chaos|polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)]] and wavelet expansions as special cases.
* Most probable point (MPP)-based methods: first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM).
* Numerical integration-based methods: Full factorial numerical integration (FFNI) and dimension reduction (DR).
For non-probabilistic approaches, [[Interval arithmetic|interval analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Kieffer|first2=M.|last3=Didrit|first3=O.|last4=Walter|first4=E.|title=Applied Interval Analysis|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=1-85233-219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy theory]], possibility theory and evidence theory are among the most widely used.

The probabilistic approach is considered as the most rigorous approach to uncertainty analysis in engineering design due to its consistency with the theory of decision analysis. Its cornerstone is the calculation of probability density functions for sampling statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.npl.co.uk/npl_web/pdf/tqe2.pdf Arnaut, L. R. Measurement uncertainty in reverberation chambers - I. Sample statistics. Technical report TQE 2, 2nd. ed., sec. 3.1, National Physical Laboratory, 2008.]
&lt;/ref&gt; This can be performed rigorously for random variables that are obtainable as transformations of Gaussian variables, leading to exact confidence intervals.

===Methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification===

====Frequentist====
In [[regression analysis]] and [[least squares]] problems, the [[standard error]] of [[parameter estimate]]s is readily available, which can be expanded into a [[confidence interval]].

====Bayesian====
Several methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification exist under the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]]. The most complicated direction is to aim at solving problems with both bias correction and parameter calibration. The challenges of such problems include not only the influences from model inadequacy and parameter uncertainty, but also the lack of data from both computer simulations and experiments. A common situation is that the input settings are not the same over experiments and simulations.

=====Modular Bayesian approach=====
An approach to inverse uncertainty quantification is the modular Bayesian approach.&lt;ref name="KennedyOHagan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, ''Supplementary Details on Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models'', Sheffield, University of Sheffield: 1-13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The modular Bayesian approach derives its name from its four-module procedure. Apart from the current available data, a [[prior distribution]] of unknown parameters should be assigned.

;'''Module 1:''' Gaussian process modeling for the computer model

To address the issue from lack of simulation results, the computer model is replaced with a [[Gaussian process|Gaussian Process (GP)]] model
:&lt;math&gt; y^m(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta})\sim\mathcal{GP}\big(\mathbf{h}^m(\cdot)^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^m,\sigma_m^2R^m(\cdot,\cdot)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; R^m\big((\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}),(\mathbf{x}',\boldsymbol{\theta}')\big)=\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^d \omega_k^m(x_k-x_k')^2\right\}\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^r \omega_{d+k}^m(\theta_k-\theta_k')^2 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of input variables, and &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of unknown parameters.While &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{h}^m(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is pre-defined, &lt;math&gt; \left\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^m, \sigma_m, \omega_k^m, k=1,\ldots,d+r\right\} &lt;/math&gt;, known as ''[[hyperparameter]]s'' of the GP model, need to be estimated via [[Maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)]]. This module can be considered as a generalized [[Kriging]] method.

;'''Module 2:''' Gaussian process modeling for the discrepancy function
Similarly with the first module, the discrepancy function is replaced with a GP model
:&lt;math&gt; \delta(\mathbf{x})\sim\mathcal{GP}\big(\mathbf{h}^\delta(\cdot)^T\boldsymbol{\beta}^\delta,\sigma_\delta^2R^\delta(\cdot,\cdot)\big) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; R^\delta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=\exp\left\{-\sum_{k=1}^d \omega_k^\delta(x_k-x_k')^2 \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;
Together with the prior distribution of unknown parameters, and data from both computer models and experiments, one can derive the maximum likelihood estimates for &lt;math&gt; \left\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^\delta, \sigma_\delta, \omega_k^\delta, k=1,\ldots,d\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. At the same time, &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\beta}^m &lt;/math&gt; from Module 1 gets updated as well.

;'''Module 3:''' Posterior distribution of unknown parameters
[[Bayes' theorem]] is applied to calculate the [[posterior distribution]] of the unknown parameters:
:&lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\rm{data},\boldsymbol{\phi})\propto p(\rm{data}|\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi})p(\boldsymbol{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; includes all the fixed hyperparameters in previous modules.

;'''Module 4:''' Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function

=====Fully Bayesian approach=====
Fully Bayesian approach requires that not only the priors for unknown parameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\theta} &lt;/math&gt; but also the priors for the other hyperparameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; should be assigned. It follows the following steps:&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;F. Liu, [[M. J. Bayarri]] and J.O.Berger, ''Modularization in Bayesian Analysis, with Emphasis on Analysis of Computer Models'', Bayesian Analysis (2009) 4, Number 1, pp. 119-150, DOI:10.1214/09-BA404&lt;/ref&gt;

# Derive the posterior distribution &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt;;
# Integrate &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; out and obtain &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt;. This single step accomplishes the calibration;
# Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function.

However, the approach has significant drawbacks:
* For most cases, &lt;math&gt; p(\boldsymbol{\theta},\boldsymbol{\phi}|\rm{data}) &lt;/math&gt; is a highly intractable function of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence the integration becomes very troublesome. Moreover, if priors for the other hyperparameters &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; are not carefully chosen, the complexity in numerical integration increases even more.
* In the prediction stage, the prediction (which should at least include the expected value of system responses) also requires numerical integration. [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)]] is often used for integration; however it is computationally expensive.

The fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations.&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;

==Known issues==
The theories and methodologies for uncertainty propagation are much better established, compared with inverse uncertainty quantification. For the latter, several difficulties remain unsolved:
# Dimensionality issue: The computational cost increases dramatically with the dimensionality of the problem, i.e. the number of input variables and/or the number of unknown parameters.
# Identifiability issue:&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, P., W. Chen, and D. Apley, ''Improving Identifiability in Model Calibration Using Multiple Responses'', DETC2011-48623, ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences, August 28–31, Washington, D.C., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple combinations of unknown parameters and discrepancy function can yield the same experimental prediction. Hence different values of parameters cannot be distinguished/identified.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Physicists often uses various lattices to apply their favorite models in them. For instance, the most favorite lattice is perhaps the square lattice. There are 14 Bravais space lattice where every cell has exactly the same number of nearest, next nearest, nearest of next nearest etc neighbors and hence they are called regular lattice. Often physicists and mathematicians studies phenomena which requires disordered lattice where each cell do not have exactly the same number of neighbors rather the number of neighbors can vary wildly. For instance, if one want to study spread of disease, viruses, rumors etc then the last thing one would look for is the square lattice. In such cases a disordered lattice is necessary. One way of constructing a disordered lattice is by doing the following.

Starting with a square, say of unit area, and dividing randomly at each step only one block, after
picking it preferentially with respect to ares, into four smaller blocks creates '''weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)'''. Essentially it is a disordered planar lattice as its block size and their coordination number are random.

==Description==
In applied mathematics, a '''weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)''' is a structure that has properties in common with those of [[lattice (group)|lattices]] and those of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. In general, space-filling planar cellular structures can be useful in a wide variety of seemingly disparate physical and biological systems.
Examples include grain in [[polycrystalline]] structures, cell texture and tissues in biology, acicular texture in [[martensite]] growth, [[tessellated pavement]] on ocean shores, soap froths
and agricultural land division according to ownership etc.&lt;ref&gt;M. Rao, S. Sengupta and H. K. Sahu Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 75}, 2164 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Okabe, B. Boots, K. Sugihara and S. N. Chiu, {\it Spatial Tessellations - 
Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams} (Chicester: Wiley, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Ben-Naim and P. L. Krapivsky,
Phys. Rev. Lett. '''76,''' 3234 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The question of how these structures appear and the understanding of their topological and geometrical properties have always been an interesting proposition among scientists in general and physicists in particular.
Several models prescribe how to generate cellular structures. Often these
structures can mimic directly the structures found in nature and they are able to capture the essential properties that we find in natural structures. 
In general, cellular structures appear through random [[tessellation]], tiling, or 
subdivision of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping cells. For instance, [[Voronoi diagram]] and [[Apollonian]] packing are 
formed by partitioning or tiling of a plane into contiguous and non-overlapping convex polygons and disks respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Okabe, B. Boots, K. Sugihara and S. N. Chiu, {\it Spatial Tessellations - 
Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams} (Chicester: Wiley, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Delaney, S. Hutzler and T. Aste,  Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101} 120602 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular planar lattices like square lattices, triangular lattices, honeycomb lattices, etc., are the simplest example of the cellular structure in which every cell has exactly the same size and the same coordination number. The planar [[Voronoi diagram]], on the other hand, has neither a fixed cell size nor a fixed coordination number. Its coordination number distribution is rather [[Poisson distribution|Poissonian]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. de Oliveira, S. G. Alves, S. C. Ferreira, and R. Dickman, "Contact process on a Voronoi triangulation", Phys. Rev. E '''78''' 031133 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the distribution is peaked about the mean where it is almost impossible to find cells which have significantly higher or fewer coordination number than the mean. Recently, Hassan ''et al'' proposed a lattice, namely the weighted planar stochastic lattice. For instance, unlike a network or a graph, it has properties of lattices as its sites are spatially embedded. On the other hand, unlike lattices, its dual (obtained by considering the center of each block of the lattice as node and the common border between blocks as links) display the property of networks as its degree distribution follows a [[power law]]. Besides, unlike regular lattices, the sizes of its cells are not equal; rather, the distribution of the area size of its blocks obeys [[dynamic scaling]],&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Dayeen and M. K. Hassan “Multi-multifractality, dynamic scaling and neighbourhood statistics in weighted planar stochastic lattice” Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''91''' 228 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; whose coordination number distribution follows a power-law.&lt;ref&gt;M.

== Construction of WPSLs ==

The construction process of the WPSL can be described as follows. It starts with a square of unit area which we regard as an initiator. The generator then divides the initiator, in the first step, randomly with uniform probability into four smaller blocks. In the second step and thereafter, the generator is applied to only one of the blocks. The question is: How do we pick that block when there is more than one block? The most generic choice would be to pick preferentially according to their areas so that the higher the area the higher the probability to be picked. For instance, in step one, the generator divides the initiator randomly into four smaller blocks. Let us label their areas starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise as &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_4&lt;/math&gt;. But of course the way we label is totally arbitrary and will bear no consequence to the final results of any observable quantities. Note that &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th block which can be well regarded as the probability of picking the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th block. These probabilities are naturally normalized &lt;math&gt;\sum_i a_i=1&lt;/math&gt; since we choose the area of the initiator equal to one. In step two, we pick one of the four blocks preferentially with respect to their areas. Consider that we pick the block &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; and apply the generator onto it to divide it randomly into four smaller blocks. Thus the label &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is now redundant and hence we recycle it to label the top left corner while the rest of three new blocks are labelled  &lt;math&gt;a_5, a_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_7&lt;/math&gt; in a clockwise fashion. In general, in the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th step, we pick one out of &lt;math&gt;3j-2&lt;/math&gt; blocks preferentially with respect to area and divide randomly into four blocks. The detailed algorithm can be found in Dayeen and Hassan&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Dayeen and M. K. Hassan “Multi-multifractality, dynamic scaling and neighbourhood statistics in weighted planar stochastic lattice” Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''91''' 228 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hassan, Hassan, and Pavel.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan, M. Z. Hassan and N. I. Pavel, Scale-free coordination number disorder and multifractal size disorder in weighted planar stochastic lattice, J. Phys: Conf. Ser, '''297''' 012010 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

This process of lattice generation can also be described as follows. Consider that the substrate is a square of unit area and at each time step a seed is nucleated from which two orthogonal partitioning lines parallel to the sides of the substrate are grown until intercepted by existing lines. It results in partitioning the square into ever smaller mutually exclusive rectangular blocks. Note that the higher the area of a block, the higher is the probability that the seed will be nucleated in it to divide that into four smaller blocks since seeds are sown at random on the substrate. It can also describes kinetics of fragmentation of two-dimensional objects.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky, E. Ben-Naim, "Scaling and multiscaling in models of fragmentation", Phys. Rev. E '''50''' 3502 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Krapivsky, S. Redner and E. Ben_naim, ''A kinetic View of Statistical Physics'' (Cambridge University Press, New York, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Distribution WPSL.jpg|thumb|Degree distribution of the dual of the WPSL and coordination number distribution of the WPSL itself.]]

== Properties of WPSLs ==

* The dynamics of the growth of this lattice is governed by infinitely many conservation laws, one of which is the trivial conservation of total area.
* Each of the non-trivial conservation laws can be used as a multifractal measure and hence it is also a multi-multifractal ([[multifractal system]]).
* The area size distribution function of its blocks obeys [[dynamic scaling]].
* It can be mapped as a network if we consider the center of each block as a node and the common border between block as the link between the center of the corresponding nodes. The [[degree distribution]] of the resulting network exhibits power-law ([[scale-free network]]). In 1999 Barabasi and Albert argued that growth and preferential attachment (PA) rule are the two basic ingredients behind power-law degree distribution. In the case of WPSL, presence of one of the ingredients is obvious. What about the PA rule. A closer look at the growth process of the WPSL suggest that a block gain new neighbor only if one of its neighbor is picked and divided. Thus the higher the number of neighbors a block has, the higher is the chances that it will gain more neighbors. In fact, the ([[Mediation-driven attachment model]]) embodies exactly this idea. In this model too PA rule is present but in disguise!
* It exhibits multiscaling.

Before 2000 [[epidemic models]], for instance, were studying by applying them on regular lattices like square lattice assuming that everyone can infect everyone else in the same way.
The emergence of a network-based framework has brought a fundamental change, offering a much much better pragmatic skeleton than any time before. Today epidemic models is one of the most active applications of network science, being used to foresee the spread of influenza or to contain Ebola. The WPSL can be a good candidate for applying epidemic like models since it has the properties 
of graph or network and the properties of traditional lattice as well.

'''Zero-elevation surface''' is a widely accepted vertical reference point that is used to describe a surface, such as that of a [[planet]]. The value of this datum is usually adopted by statute. This elevation is used, for example, to build a texture map from an agreed surface, such as a [[spheroid]] with dimensions defined by a mean [[surface gravity]]. In the case of the [[Earth]], the zero-elevation surface is usually taken as [[sea level]].
