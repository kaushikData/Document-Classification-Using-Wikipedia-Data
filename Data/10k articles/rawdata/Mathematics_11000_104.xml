In [[geometry]], the '''31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron''' is an arrangement of 31 [[great circles]] in [[icosahedral symmetry]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/print/f5740.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was first identified by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and is used in construction of [[geodesic dome]]s. 

== Construction==
The 31 great circles can be seen in 3 sets: 15, 10, and 6, each representing edges of a [[polyhedron]] projected onto a sphere. Fifteen great circles represent the edges of a [[disdyakis triacontahedron]], the dual of a [[truncated icosidodecahedron]]. Six more great circles represent the edges of an [[icosidodecahedron]], and the last ten great circles come from the edges of the [[uniform star polyhedron|uniform star]] [[dodecadodecahedron]], making pentagrams with vertices at the edge centers of the icosahedron.

There are 62 points of intersection, positioned at the 12 vertices, and center of the 30 edges, and 20 faces of a regular [[icosahedron]].
== Images ==
The 31 great circles are shown here in 3 directions, with 5-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold symmetry. There are 4 types of right [[spherical triangle]]s by the intersected great circles, seen by color in the right image.

'''Adolph Winkler Goodman''' (July 20, 1915 – July 30, 2004) was an American [[mathematician]] who contributed to [[number theory]], [[graph theory]] and to the theory of [[univalent functions]]:&lt;ref name="quaternion"&gt;See the brief [[#{{harvid|The Editorial Staff|2004}}|obituary on him]] published on the newsletter of the department of Mathematics of the [[University of South Florida]].&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture on the coefficients of multivalent functions named after him is considered the most interesting challenge in the area after the [[Bieberbach conjecture]], proved by [[Louis de Branges]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="Haymanxi+162"&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Hayman|1994|loc=p. xi and p. 163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work ==

In 1948, he made a mathematical conjecture on coefficients of {{math|''ρ''}}-valent functions, first published in his [[Columbia University]] dissertation thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On some determinants related to {{math|''ρ''}}-valent formulas |last=Goodman |first=A W |publisher=Columbia University |year=1948 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36602209 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and then in a closely following paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On some determinants related to {{math|''ρ''}}-valent formulas |last=Goodman |first=A. W. |journal=American Mathematical Society |year=1948 |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=175–92 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1948-0023910-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture by Louis de Branges, this conjecture is considered the most interesting challenge in the field,&lt;ref name="Haymanxi+162" /&gt; and he himself and coauthors answered affirmatively to the conjecture for some classes of {{math|''ρ''}}-valent functions.&lt;ref&gt;His contributions are described in the brief survey on [[Goodman's conjecture]] found in {{harv|Hayman|1994|pp=162–163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His researches in the field continued in the paper ''Univalent functions and nonanalytic curves'', published in 1957:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Univalent functions and nonanalytic curves |last=Goodman |first=A. W. |journal=Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society |year=1957 |volume= 8 |issue= 3 |pages= 598–601 |doi = 10.1090/S0002-9939-1957-0086879-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968, he published the survey ''Open problems on univalent and multivalent functions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Open problems on Univalent and multivalent functions |last=Goodman |first=A. W. |journal=American Mathematical Society |year= 1968 |volume=74 |issue=6 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1968-12045-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually led him to write the two-volume book ''Univalent Functions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his research activity, He was actively involved in teaching: he wrote several college and high school textbooks including ''Analytic Geometry and the Calculus'', and the five-volume set ''Algebra from A to Z''.&lt;ref name="quaternion"/&gt;

He retired in 1993, became a Distinguished Professor Emeritus in 1995, and died in 2004.&lt;ref name="quaternion"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''[[Theodore Wilbur Anderson|Anderson's]] theorem''' is a result in [[real analysis]] and [[geometry]] which says that the [[integral]] of an integrable, symmetric, unimodal, non-negative function ''f'' over an ''n''-dimensional [[convex body]] ''K'' does not decrease if ''K'' is translated inwards towards the origin. This is a natural statement, since the [[graph of a function|graph]] of ''f'' can be thought of as a hill with a single peak over the origin; however, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, the proof is not entirely obvious, as there may be points ''x'' of the body ''K'' where the value ''f''(''x'') is larger than at the corresponding translate of ''x''.

Anderson's theorem also has an interesting application to [[probability theory]].

==Statement of the theorem==
Let ''K'' be a convex body in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; that is [[symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to reflection in the origin, i.e. ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''K''. Let ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a non-[[negative number|negative]], symmetric, globally integrable function; i.e.
* ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;;
* ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(&amp;minus;''x'') for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} x &lt; + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose also that the super-[[level set]]s ''L''(''f'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') of ''f'', defined by

:&lt;math&gt;L(f, t) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} | f(x) \geq t \},&lt;/math&gt;

are [[convex set|convex subsets]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for every ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0. (This property is sometimes referred to as being '''unimodal'''.) Then, for any 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{K} f(x + c y) \, \mathrm{d} x \geq \int_{K} f(x + y) \, \mathrm{d} x.&lt;/math&gt;

==Application to probability theory==
Given a [[probability space]] (Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;Pr), suppose that ''X''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-valued [[random variable]] with [[probability density function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞) and that ''Y''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an [[Statistical independence|independent]] random variable. The probability density functions of many well-known probability distributions are ''p''-[[concave function|concave]] for some ''p'', and hence unimodal. If they are also symmetric (e.g. the [[Laplace distribution|Laplace]] and [[normal distribution]]s), then Anderson's theorem applies, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr ( X \in K ) \geq \Pr ( X + Y \in K )&lt;/math&gt;

for any origin-symmetric convex body ''K''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5854">In [[mathematics]], an '''automatic group''' is a [[finitely generated group]] equipped with several [[finite state machine|finite-state automata]]. These automata represent the [[Cayley graph]] of the group.  That is, they can tell if a given word representation of a group element is in a "canonical form" and can tell if two elements given in canonical words differ by a generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

More precisely, let ''G'' be a group and ''A'' be a finite set of generators.  Then an ''automatic structure'' of ''G'' with respect to ''A'' is a set of finite-state automata:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Epstein|Cannon|Holt|Levy|1992}}, Section 2.3, "Automatic Groups: Definition", pp. 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ''word-acceptor'', which accepts for every element of ''G'' at least one word in &lt;math&gt;A^\ast&lt;/math&gt; representing it;
*''multipliers'', one for each &lt;math&gt;a \in A \cup \{1\}&lt;/math&gt;, which accept a pair (''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), for words ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; accepted by the word-acceptor, precisely when &lt;math&gt;w_1 a = w_2&lt;/math&gt; in ''G''.

The property of being automatic does not depend on the set of generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Epstein|Cannon|Holt|Levy|1992}}, Section 2.4, "Invariance under Change of Generators", pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Automatic groups have [[word problem for groups|word problem]] solvable in quadratic time. More strongly, a given word can actually be put into canonical form in quadratic time, based on which the word problem may be solved by testing whether the canonical forms of two words are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Epstein|Cannon|Holt|Levy|1992}}, Theorem 2.3.10, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic groups are characterized by the ''fellow traveler property''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Then, ''G'' is automatic with respect to a word acceptor ''L'' if and only if there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that for all words &lt;math&gt;u, v \in L&lt;/math&gt; which differ by at most one generator, the distance between the respective prefixes of ''u'' and ''v'' is bounded by ''C''. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\forall u, v \in L, d(u,v) \leq 1 \Rightarrow \forall k \in \mathbb{N}, d(u_{|k},v_{|k}) \leq C&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;w_{|k}&lt;/math&gt; for the k-th prefix of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; itself if &lt;math&gt;k &gt; |w|&lt;/math&gt;). This means that when reading the words synchronously, it is possible to keep track of the difference between both elements with a finite number of states (the neighborhood of the identity with diameter ''C'' in the Cayley graph).

==Examples of automatic groups==
The automatic groups include:
*[[Finite group]]s. To see this take the regular language to be the set of all words in the finite group.
*[[Euclidean group]]s
*All finitely generated [[Coxeter group]]s &lt;ref name="BrinkAndHowlett"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brink and Howlett | title = A finiteness property and an automatic structure for Coxeter groups | year = 1993 | journal = Mathematische Annalen | publisher = Springer Berlin / Heidelberg | issn= 0025-5831 | postscript = .| doi = 10.1007/bf01445101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">The '''Baire category theorem''' (BCT) is an important tool in [[general topology]] and [[functional analysis]]. The theorem has two forms, each of which gives [[sufficient condition]]s for a [[topological space]] to be a [[Baire space]].

The theorem was proved by [[René-Louis Baire]] in his 1899 doctoral thesis.

== Statement of the theorem ==
A [[Baire space]] is a topological space with the following property: for each [[countable]] collection of [[Open set|open]] [[dense set]]s &lt;math&gt;\{U_n\}_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, their intersection &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n&lt;/math&gt; is dense.

*('''BCT1''') Every [[complete metric space]] is a Baire space.  More generally, every topological space which is [[homeomorphic]] to an [[open set|open subset]] of a [[complete space|complete]] [[pseudometric space]] is a Baire space. Thus every [[completely metrizable]] topological space is a Baire space.
*('''BCT2''') Every [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] is a Baire space. The proof is similar to the preceding statement; the [[finite intersection property]] takes the role played by completeness.

Note that neither of these statements implies the other, since there are complete metric spaces which are not locally compact (the [[irrational number]]s with the metric defined below; also, any [[Banach space]] of infinite dimension), and there are locally compact Hausdorff spaces which are not [[metrizable space|metrizable]] (for instance, any uncountable product of non-trivial compact Hausdorff spaces is such; also,  several function spaces used in Functional Analysis; the uncountable [[Fort space]]). See [[Counterexamples in Topology|Steen and Seebach]] in the references below.

*('''BCT3''') A non-empty complete metric space, or any of its subsets with nonempty interior, is not the countable union of [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere-dense]] sets.

This formulation is equivalent to BCT1 and is sometimes more useful in applications.  Also: if a non-empty complete metric space is the countable union of closed sets, then one of these closed sets has ''non-empty'' interior.

== Relation to the axiom of choice ==
The proofs of '''BCT1''' and '''BCT2''' for arbitrary complete metric spaces require some form of the [[axiom of choice]]; and in fact BCT1 is equivalent over [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to a weak form of the axiom of choice called the [[axiom of dependent choices]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

A restricted form of the Baire category theorem, in which the complete metric space is also assumed to be separable, is provable in ZF with no additional choice principles.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 1979, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; This restricted form applies in particular to the [[real line]], the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[Cantor space]] 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, and a separable Hilbert space such as ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''R'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Uses of the theorem ==
'''BCT1''' is used in [[functional analysis]] to prove the [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], the [[closed graph theorem]] and the [[uniform boundedness principle]].

'''BCT1''' also shows that every complete metric space with no [[isolated point]]s is [[uncountable]]. (If ''X'' is a countable complete metric space with no isolated points, then each [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''x''} in ''X'' is [[nowhere dense]], and so ''X'' is of [[first category]] in itself.) In particular, this proves that the set of all [[real number]]s is uncountable.

'''BCT1''' shows that each of the following is a Baire space:
* The space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of [[real number]]s
* The [[irrational number]]s, with the metric defined by &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \tfrac{1}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the first index for which the [[continued fraction]] expansions of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; differ (this is a complete metric space)
* The [[Cantor set]]

By '''BCT2''', every finite-dimensional Hausdorff [[manifold]] is a Baire space, since it is locally compact and Hausdorff. This is so even for non-[[paracompact]] (hence nonmetrizable) manifolds such as the [[long line (topology)|long line]].

== Proof ==
The following is a standard proof that a complete pseudometric space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; is a Baire space.

Let &lt;math&gt; U_n&lt;/math&gt; be a countable collection of open dense subsets. We want to show that the intersection &lt;math&gt; \bigcap U_n&lt;/math&gt; is dense. A subset is dense if and only if every nonempty open subset intersects it. Thus, to show that the intersection is dense, it is sufficient to show that any nonempty open set &lt;math&gt; W&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; has a point &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; in common with all of the &lt;math&gt; U_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; U_1&lt;/math&gt; is dense, &lt;math&gt; W&lt;/math&gt; intersects &lt;math&gt; U_1&lt;/math&gt;; thus, there is a point &lt;math&gt; x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 0 \;&lt;\; r_1 \;&lt;\; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(x_1, r_1) \subset W \cap U_1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; B(x, r)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \overline{B}(x, r)&lt;/math&gt; denote an open and closed ball, respectively, centered at &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; with radius &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;. Since each &lt;math&gt; U_n&lt;/math&gt; is dense, we can continue recursively to find a pair of sequences &lt;math&gt; x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 0 \;&lt;\; r_n \;&lt;\; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{B}(x_n, r_n) \subset B(x_{n - 1}, r_{n - 1}) \cap U_n&lt;/math&gt;

(This step relies on the axiom of choice.) Since &lt;math&gt; x_n \;\in\; B(x_m, r_m)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; n \;&gt;\; m&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt; x_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]], and hence &lt;math&gt; x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to some limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by completeness. For any &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;, by closedness,
:&lt;math&gt;x \in \overline{B}(x_n, r_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt; x \;\in\; W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x \;\in\; U_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;.

Bases and [[Strong generating set|strong generating sets]] are concepts of importance in [[computational group theory]].  A base and a strong generating set (together often called a BSGS) for a group can be obtained using the [[Schreier–Sims algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Permutation Group Algorithms|volume=152|series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics|first=Ákos|last=Seress|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|pages=1–2|isbn=9780521661034|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxFqdbfc_CMC&amp;pg=PA1|quote=Sim's seminal idea was to introduce the notions of base and strong generating set}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often beneficial to deal with bases and strong generating sets as these may be easier to work with than the entire group. A group may have a small base compared to the set it acts on. In the "worst case", the [[symmetric group]]s and [[alternating group]]s have large bases (the symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has base size ''n'' &amp;minus; 1), and there are often specialized algorithms that deal with these cases.

In [[mathematical analysis]], a function of '''bounded variation''', also known as '''''{{math|BV}}'' function''', is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[total variation]] is bounded (finite): the [[graph of a function]] having this property is well behaved in a precise sense. For a [[continuous function]] of a single [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], being of bounded variation means that the [[distance]] along the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] of the [[y-axis|{{math|''y''}}-axis]], neglecting the contribution of motion along [[x-axis|{{math|''x''}}-axis]], traveled by a [[point (mathematics)|point]] moving along the graph has a finite value. For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is a [[Glossary of differential geometry and topology#H|hypersurface]] in this case), but can be every [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the graph itself with a [[hyperplane]] (in the case of functions of two variables, a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) parallel to a fixed {{math|''x''}}-axis and to the {{math|''y''}}-axis.

Functions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which one may find [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]]s of all continuous functions.

Another characterization states that the functions of bounded variation on a compact interval are exactly those {{math|''f''}} which can be written as a difference {{math|''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''h''}}, where both {{math|''g''}} and {{math|''h''}} are bounded [[monotonic function|monotone]].

In the case of several variables, a function {{math|''f''}} defined on an [[open subset]] {{math|Ω}} of ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is said to have bounded variation if its [[distribution (mathematics)|distributional derivative]] is a [[Vector-valued function|vector-valued]] finite [[Radon measure]].

One of the most important aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an [[Associative algebra|algebra]] of [[continuous function|discontinuous functions]] whose first derivative exists [[almost everywhere]]: due to this fact, they can and frequently are used to define [[generalized solution]]s of nonlinear problems involving [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s, [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]].

We have the following chains of inclusions for functions over a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the real line:

: '''[[Continuously differentiable]]''' ⊆ '''[[Lipschitz continuous]]''' ⊆ '''[[absolutely continuous]]''' ⊆ '''bounded variation'''  ⊆ '''[[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[almost everywhere]]'''

==History==
According to Boris Golubov, ''BV'' functions of a single variable were first introduced by [[Camille Jordan]], in the paper {{Harv|Jordan|1881}} dealing with the convergence of [[Fourier series]]. The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to functions of several variables was due to [[Leonida Tonelli]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonida Tonelli|Tonelli]] introduced what is now called after him '''Tonelli plane variation''': for an analysis of this concept and its relations to other generalizations, see the entry "[[Total variation]]".&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced a class of ''[[continuous function|continuous]]'' ''BV'' functions in 1926 {{Harv|Cesari|1986|pp=47–48}}, to extend his [[Direct method in the calculus of variations|direct method]] for finding solutions to problems in the [[calculus of variations]] in more than one variable. Ten years after, in {{Harv|Cesari|1936}}, [[Lamberto Cesari]] ''changed the [[continuous function|continuity]] requirement'' in Tonelli's definition ''to a less restrictive [[integral|integrability]] requirement'', obtaining for the first time the class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of [[Fourier series]], but for functions of ''two variables''. After him, several authors applied ''BV'' functions to study [[Fourier series]] in several variables, [[geometric measure theory]], [[calculus of variations]], and [[mathematical physics]]. [[Renato Caccioppoli]] and [[Ennio de Giorgi]] used them to define [[measure theory|measure]] of [[smooth function|nonsmooth]] [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] (see the entry "''[[Caccioppoli set]]''" for further information). [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik]] introduced her view of [[generalized solution]]s for [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equation]]s as functions from the space ''BV'' in the paper {{Harv|Oleinik|1957}}, and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper {{Harv|Oleinik|1959}}: few years later, [[Edward D. Conway]] and [[Joel A. Smoller]] applied ''BV''-functions to the study of a single [[hyperbolic equation|nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation]] of [[First-order partial differential equation|first order]] in the paper {{Harv|Conway|Smoller|1966}}, proving that the solution of the [[Cauchy problem]] for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the [[Cauchy boundary condition|initial value]] belongs to the same class. [[Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert]] developed extensively a calculus for ''BV'' functions: in the paper {{Harv|Vol'pert|1967}} he proved the [[Bounded variation#Chain rule for BV functions|chain rule for BV functions]] and in the book {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} he, jointly with his pupil [[Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev]], explored extensively the properties of ''BV'' functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Gianni Dal Maso]] in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|Dal Maso|1990}}.

==Formal definition==

=== ''BV'' functions of one variable ===
{{EquationRef|1|Definition 1.1.}} The '''total variation'''&lt;ref name="Tvar"&gt;See the entry "[[Total variation]]" for further details and more information.&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[real number|real]]-valued (or more generally [[complex number|complex]]-valued) [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'', defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'', ''b'']⊂ℝ is the quantity

:&lt;math&gt; V_a^b(f)=\sup_{P \in \mathcal{P}} \sum_{i=0}^{n_{P}-1} | f(x_{i+1})-f(x_i) |. \,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[supremum]] is taken over the set &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \mathcal{P} =\left\{P=\{ x_0, \dots , x_{n_P}\}|P\text{ is a partition of } [a, b]\text{ satisfying } x_i\leq x_{i+1}\text{ for } 0\leq i\leq n_P-1 \right\} &lt;/math&gt; of all [[partition of an interval|partitions]] of the interval considered.

If ''f'' is [[derivative|differentiable]] and its derivative is Riemann-integrable, its total variation is the vertical component of the [[arc length|arc-length]] of its graph, that is to say,

:&lt;math&gt; V_a^b(f) = \int _a^b |f'(x)|\,\mathrm{d}x.&lt;/math&gt;

{{EquationRef|2|Definition 1.2.}} A real-valued function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; on the [[real line]] is said to be of '''bounded variation''' ('''BV function''') on a chosen [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'', ''b'']⊂ℝ if its total variation is finite, ''i.e.''
:&lt;math&gt; f \in BV([a,b]) \iff V_a^b(f) &lt; +\infty &lt;/math&gt;

It can be proved that a real function ''ƒ'' is of bounded variation in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it can be written as the difference ''ƒ'' = ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of two non-decreasing functions on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;: this result is known as the [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Jordan_decomposition_%28of_a_function%29 Jordan decomposition of a function] and it is related to the [[Hahn decomposition theorem#Jordan measure decomposition|Jordan decomposition of a measure]].

Through the [[Stieltjes integral]], any function of bounded variation on a closed interval [''a'', ''b''] defines a [[bounded linear functional]] on ''C''([''a'', ''b'']). In this special case,&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{harvtxt|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|pp=374–376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Riesz representation theorem]] states that every bounded linear functional arises uniquely in this way. The normalised positive functionals or [[probability measure]]s correspond to positive non-decreasing lower [[semicontinuous function]]s. This point of view has been important in
[[spectral theory]],&lt;ref&gt;For a general reference on this topic, see {{harvtxt|Riesz|Szőkefalvi-Nagy|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in its application to [[spectral theory of ordinary differential equations|ordinary differential equations]].

===''BV'' functions of several variables===
Functions of bounded variation, BV [[function (mathematics)|functions]], are functions whose distributional [[directional derivative|derivative]] is a [[Wikt:finite|finite]]&lt;ref&gt;In this context, "finite" means that its value is never [[Infinity|infinite]], i.e. it is a [[finite measure]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radon measure]]. More precisely:

{{EquationRef|3|Definition 2.1.}} Let '''&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;''' be an [[open subset]] of ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. A  function '''&lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;''' belonging to '''[[Lp space|&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;]]''' is said of '''bounded variation''' ('''BV function'''), and written

:&lt;math&gt; u\in BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;

if there exists a [[Finite measure|finite]] [[vector-valued function|vector]] [[Radon measure]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle Du\in\mathcal M(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; such that the following equality holds

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = - \int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}, Du(x)\rangle
\qquad \forall\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)
&lt;/math&gt;

that is, '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' defines a [[linear functional]] on the space &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Smooth function|continuously differentiable]] [[Vector-valued function|vector functions]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; of [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]] contained in '''&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;''': the vector [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] '''&lt;math&gt;Du&lt;/math&gt;''' represents therefore the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Formal definition|distributional]] or [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;'''.

An equivalent definition is the following.

{{EquationRef|4|Definition 2.2.}} Given a function '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' belonging to '''&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''', the '''total variation of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;'''&lt;ref name="Tvar"/&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; V(u,\Omega):=\sup\left\{\int_\Omega u(x)\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x\colon\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n),\ \Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\le 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \Vert\;\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[essential supremum]] [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]]. Sometimes, especially in the theory of [[Caccioppoli set]]s, the following notation is used

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega\vert D u\vert = V(u,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;

in order to emphasize that &lt;math&gt;V(u,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the total variation of the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Formal definition|distributional]] / [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;'''. This notation reminds also that if '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' is of class  '''&lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;''' (i.e. a [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[differentiable function]] having [[continuous function|continuous]] [[derivative]]s) then its [[Total variation|variation]] is exactly the [[Integral (measure theory)|integral]] of the [[absolute value]] of its [[gradient]].

The space of '''functions of bounded variation''' ('''BV functions''') can then be defined as

:&lt;math&gt; BV(\Omega)=\{ u\in L^1(\Omega)\colon V(u,\Omega)&lt;+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;

The two definitions are equivalent since if &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle V(u,\Omega)&lt;+\infty &lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\left|\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x \right |\leq V(u,\Omega)\Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}
\qquad \forall \boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)
&lt;/math&gt;

therefore &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{\phi}\mapsto\,\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; defines a [[continuous linear functional]] on
the space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)
\subset C^0(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; as a [[linear subspace]], this [[continuous linear functional]] can be extended [[continuous function|continuously]] and [[linearity|linearily]] to the whole &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^0(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]]. Hence the continuous linear functional defines a [[Radon measure#Duality|Radon measure]] by the [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem|Riesz-Markov Theorem]].

===Locally ''BV'' functions===
If the [[function space]] of [[locally integrable function]]s, i.e. [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s belonging to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle L^1_{loc}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, is considered in the preceding definitions {{EquationNote|2|1.2}}, {{EquationNote|3|2.1}} and {{EquationNote|4|2.2}} instead of the one of [[integrable function|globally integrable functions]], then the function space defined is that of '''functions of locally bounded variation'''. Precisely, developing this idea for {{EquationNote|4|definition 2.2}}, a '''[[local property|local]] variation''' is defined as follows,
:&lt;math&gt; V(u,U):=\sup\left\{\int_\Omega u(x)\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x\colon\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(U,\mathbb{R}^n),\ \Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\le 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
for every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U\in\mathcal{O}_c(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, having defined &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{O}_c(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all [[Relatively compact subspace|precompact]] [[open subset]]s of '''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;''' with respect to the standard [[topology]] of [[dimension (mathematics)|finite-dimensional]] [[vector space]]s, and correspondingly the class of functions of locally bounded variation is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;BV_{loc}(\Omega)=\{ u\in L^1_{loc}(\Omega)\colon V(u,U)&lt;+\infty\; \forall U\in\mathcal{O}_c(\Omega)\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Notation===
There are basically two distinct conventions for the notation of spaces of functions of locally or globally bounded variation, and unfortunately they are quite similar: the first one, which is the one adopted in this entry, is used for example in references {{Harvtxt|Giusti|1984}} (partially), {{Harvtxt|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} (partially), {{Harvtxt|Giaquinta|Modica|Souček|1998}} and is the following one
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of globally bounded variation
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle BV_{loc}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of locally bounded variation
The second one, which is adopted in references {{Harvtxt|Vol'pert|1967}} and {{Harvtxt|Maz'ya|1985}} (partially), is the following:
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \overline{BV}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of globally bounded variation
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; identifies the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of functions of locally bounded variation

==Basic properties==
Only the properties common to [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s of one variable and to [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s of several variables will be considered in the following, and [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s will be carried on only for functions of several variables since the [[Mathematical proof|proof]] for the case of one variable is a straightforward adaptation of the several variables case: also, in each section it will be stated if the property is shared also by functions of locally bounded variation or not. References {{Harv|Giusti|1984|pp=7–9}}, {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} and {{Harv|Màlek|Nečas|Rokyta|Růžička|1996}} are extensively used.

===''BV'' functions have only jump-type or removable discontinuities===
In the case of one variable, the assertion is clear: for each point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a , b]&lt;/math&gt;⊂ℝ of definition of the function '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''', either one of the following two assertions is true

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^-}}\!\!\!u(x) = \!\!\!\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^+}}\!\!\!u(x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^-}}\!\!\!u(x) \neq \!\!\!\lim_{x\rightarrow x_{0^+}}\!\!\!u(x) &lt;/math&gt;

while both [[Limit of a function|limits]] exist and are finite. In the case of functions of several variables, there are some premises to understand: first of all, there is a [[Linear continuum|continuum]] of [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]s along which it is possible to approach a given point '''&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;''' belonging to the domain '''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;'''⊂ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. It is necessary to make precise a suitable concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]: choosing a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}}\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to divide '''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;''' in two sets

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{({\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)} = \Omega \cap \{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n|\langle\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0,{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}}\rangle&gt;0\} \qquad
\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)} = \Omega \cap \{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n|\langle\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0,-{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}}\rangle&gt;0\} &lt;/math&gt;

Then for each point '''&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;''' belonging to the domain &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; of the ''BV'' function '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''', only one of the following two assertions is true

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{({\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x}) = \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{({\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x}) \neq \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})
&lt;/math&gt;

or '''&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;''' belongs to a [[subset]] of '''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;''' having zero &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]]. The quantities

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{({\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})=u_{\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x}_0) \qquad \lim_{\overset{\boldsymbol{x}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}_0}{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{(-{\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}},\boldsymbol{x}_0)}}}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!u(\boldsymbol{x})=u_{-\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x}_0)&lt;/math&gt;

are called '''approximate limits''' of the ''BV'' function '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' at the point '''&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;'''.

===''V''(&amp;middot;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;) is lower semi-continuous on ''BV''(&amp;Omega;)===
The [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V(\cdot,\Omega):BV(\Omega)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; is [[semi-continuity|lower semi-continuous]]:
to see this, choose a [[Cauchy sequence]] of ''BV''-functions '''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{u_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;''' converging to '''[[locally integrable function|&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u\in L^1_\text{loc}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;]]'''. Then, since all the functions of the sequence and their limit function are [[integral|integrable]] and by the definition of [[lower limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}V(u_n,\Omega) \geq \liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty} \int_\Omega u_n(x)\,\mathrm{div}\, \boldsymbol{\phi}\, \mathrm{d}x \geq \int_\Omega \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} u_n(x)\,\mathrm{div}\, \boldsymbol{\phi}\, \mathrm{d}x = \int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}\, \mathrm{d}x \qquad\forall\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n),\quad\Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\leq 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Now considering the [[supremum]] on the set of functions &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\phi}\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Vert\boldsymbol{\phi}\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\leq 1 &lt;/math&gt; then the following inequality holds true

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}V(u_n,\Omega)\geq V(u,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the definition of [[semicontinuity|lower semicontinuity]].

===''BV''(&amp;Omega;) is a Banach space===
By definition '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is a [[subset]] of '''[[integrable function|&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;]]''', while [[linearity]] follows from the linearity properties of the defining [[integral]] i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_\Omega [u(x)+v(x)]\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x &amp; =
\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x +\int_\Omega v(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x = \\
&amp; =- \int_\Omega \langle\boldsymbol{\phi}(x), Du(x)\rangle- \int_\Omega \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}(x), Dv(x)\rangle
                                               =- \int_\Omega \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}(x), [Du(x)+Dv(x)]\rangle
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\phi\in C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; therefore &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u+v\in BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u,v\in BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_\Omega c\cdot u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x =
c\!\int_\Omega u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x =
-c\! \int_\Omega \langle \boldsymbol{\phi}(x), Du(x)\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle cu\in BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u\in BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The proved [[vector space]] properties imply that '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is a [[vector subspace]] of '''[[Lp space|&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;]]'''. Consider now the function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\|\;\|_{BV}:BV(\Omega)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\| u \|_{BV} := \| u \|_{L^1} + V(u,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\| \; \|_{L^1}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual '''[[Lp space#Lp spaces|&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; norm]]''': it is easy to prove that this is a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;'''. To see that '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is [[complete metric space|complete]] respect to it, i.e. it is a [[Banach space]], consider a [[Cauchy sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{u_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; in '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;'''. By definition it is also a [[Cauchy sequence]] in '''&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' and therefore has a [[limit of a sequence|limit]] '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' in '''&lt;math&gt;L^1(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''': since '''&lt;math&gt;u_n&lt;/math&gt;''' is bounded in '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' for each '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''', then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Vert u \Vert_{BV} &lt; +\infty &lt;/math&gt; by [[semicontinuity|lower semicontinuity]] of the variation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V(\cdot,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, therefore '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' is a ''BV'' function. Finally, again by lower semicontinuity, choosing an arbitrary small positive number '''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'''

:&lt;math&gt;\Vert u_j - u_k \Vert_{BV}&lt;\varepsilon\quad\forall j,k\geq N\in\mathbb{N} \quad\Rightarrow\quad V(u_k-u,\Omega)\leq \liminf_{j\rightarrow +\infty} V(u_k-u_j,\Omega)\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
From this we deduce that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V(\cdot,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous because it's a norm.

===''BV''(&amp;Omega;) is not separable===
To see this, it is sufficient to consider the following example belonging to the space '''&lt;math&gt;BV([0,1])&lt;/math&gt;''':&lt;ref&gt;The example is taken from  {{Harvtxt|Giaquinta|Modica|Souček|1998|p=331}}: see also {{harv|Kannan|Krueger|1996|loc=example 9.4.1, p. 237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for each 0&lt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;1 define
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_\alpha=\chi_{[\alpha,1]}=
\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \mbox{if } x \notin\; [\alpha,1] \\ 
              1 &amp; \mbox{if } x \in [\alpha,1]
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
as the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|left-closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[\alpha,1]&lt;/math&gt;. Then, choosing ''&amp;alpha;,&amp;beta;''∈&lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''&amp;alpha;''≠''&amp;beta;'' the following relation holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;\Vert \chi_\alpha - \chi_\beta \Vert_{BV}=2+|\alpha-\beta|&lt;/math&gt;
Now, in order to prove that every [[Dense set|dense subset]] of '''&lt;math&gt;BV(]0,1[)&lt;/math&gt;''' cannot be [[countable set|countable]], it is sufficient to see that for every ''&amp;alpha;''∈&lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to construct the [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]s
:&lt;math&gt;B_\alpha=\left\{\psi\in BV([0,1]);\Vert \chi_\alpha - \psi \Vert_{BV}\leq 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
Obviously those balls are [[Disjoint sets|pairwise disjoint]], and also are an [[indexed family]] of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s whose [[index set]] is &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that this family has the [[cardinality of the continuum]]: now, since any dense subset of '''&lt;math&gt;BV([0,1])&lt;/math&gt;''' must have at least a point inside each member of this family, its cardinality is at least that of the continuum and therefore cannot a be countable subset.&lt;ref&gt;The same argument is used by {{Harvtxt|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|loc=example 7, pp. 48–49}}, in order to prove the non [[Separable space|separability]] of the space of [[bounded sequence]]s, and also {{harvtxt|Kannan|Krueger|1996|loc=example 9.4.1, p. 237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This example can be obviously extended to higher dimensions, and since it involves only [[Local property|local properties]], it implies that the same property is true also for '''&lt;math&gt;BV_{loc}&lt;/math&gt;'''.

===Chain rule for ''BV'' functions===
[[Chain rule]]s for [[smooth function|nonsmooth function]]s are very important in [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]] since there are several important [[Mathematical model|physical model]]s whose behavior is described by [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] or [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s with a very limited degree of [[Smooth function|smoothness]].The following version is proved in the paper {{Harv|Vol'pert|1967|p=248}}: all [[partial derivative]]s must be intended in a generalized sense. i.e. as [[Generalized derivative#Basic idea|generalized derivative]]s

'''Theorem'''. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a function of class '''&lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;''' (i.e. a [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[differentiable function]] having [[continuous function|continuous]] [[derivative]]s) and let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=(u_1(\boldsymbol{x}),\ldots,u_p(\boldsymbol{x})) &lt;/math&gt; be a function in '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' with '''&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;''' being an [[open subset]] of &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f\circ\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})=f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))\in BV(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))}{\partial x_i}=\sum_{k=1}^p\frac{\partial\bar{f}(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))}{\partial u_k}\frac{\partial{u_k(\boldsymbol{x})}}{\partial x_i}
\qquad\forall i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\bar f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))&lt;/math&gt; is the mean value of the function at the point '''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x \in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;''', defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar f(\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}))=\int_0^1 f\left(\boldsymbol{u}_{\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x})t + \boldsymbol{u}_{-\boldsymbol{\hat a}}(\boldsymbol{x})(1-t)\right)dt&lt;/math&gt;

A more general [[chain rule]] [[formula]] for [[lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous functions]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^s&lt;/math&gt; has been found by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Gianni Dal Maso]] and is published in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|Dal Maso|1990}}. However, even this formula has very important direct consequences: choosing &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(u)=v(\boldsymbol{x})u(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt; is also a '''&lt;math&gt;BV&lt;/math&gt;''' function, the preceding formula gives the '''''[[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]''''' for '''&lt;math&gt;BV&lt;/math&gt;''' functions

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial v(\boldsymbol{x})u(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} = {\bar u(\boldsymbol{x})}\frac{\partial v(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} +
{\bar v(\boldsymbol{x})}\frac{\partial u(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that '''the product of two functions of bounded variation is again a function of bounded variation''', therefore '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is an [[Associative algebra|algebra]].

===''BV''(&amp;Omega;) is a Banach algebra===
This property follows directly from the fact that '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is a [[Banach space]] and also an [[associative algebra]]: this implies that if '''&lt;math&gt;\{v_n\}&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\{u_n\}&lt;/math&gt;''' are [[Cauchy sequence]]s of &lt;math&gt;BV&lt;/math&gt; functions converging respectively to [[function (mathematics)|function]]s '''&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;''' and  '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''' in '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''', then

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  vu_n\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{} vu \\
  v_nu\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{} vu
        \end{matrix}\quad\Longleftrightarrow
\quad vu\in BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;

therefore the ordinary [[Pointwise product|product of functions]] is [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] in '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' with respect to each argument, making this function space a [[Banach algebra]].

==Generalizations and extensions==

=== Weighted ''BV'' functions ===
It is possible to generalize the above notion of [[total variation]] so that different variations are weighted differently. More precisely, let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi : [0, +\infty)\longrightarrow [0, +\infty)&lt;/math&gt; be any increasing function such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi(0) = \varphi(0+) =\lim_{x\rightarrow 0_+}\varphi(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (the '''[[weight function]]''') and let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f: [0, T]\longrightarrow X &lt;/math&gt; be a function from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0 , T]&lt;/math&gt;⊂ℝ taking values in a [[normed vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'''-variation''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[0, T]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f) := \sup \sum_{j = 0}^{k} \varphi \left( | f(t_{j + 1}) - f(t_{j}) |_{X} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where, as usual, the supremum is taken over all finite [[partition of an interval|partitions]] of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, T]&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. all the [[finite set]]s of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;0 = t_{0} &lt; t_{1} &lt; \ldots &lt; t_{k} = T.&lt;/math&gt;

The original notion of [[Total variation|variation]] considered above is the special case of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi&lt;/math&gt;-variation for which the weight function is the [[identity function]]: therefore an [[integrable function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''weighted ''BV'' function''' (of weight &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if its &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \varphi&lt;/math&gt;-variation is finite.

:&lt;math&gt;f\in BV_\varphi([0, T];X)\iff \mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f) &lt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;

The space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle BV_\varphi([0, T];X)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological vector space]] with respect to the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]

:&lt;math&gt;\| f \|_{BV_\varphi} := \| f \|_{\infty} + \mathop{\varphi \mbox{-Var}}_{[0, T]} (f),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\| f \|_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual [[supremum norm]] of ''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;''. Weighted ''BV'' functions were introduced and studied in full generality by [[Władysław Orlicz]] and [[Julian Musielak]] in the paper {{Harvnb|Musielak|Orlicz|1959}}: [[Laurence Chisholm Young]] studied earlier the case &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varphi(x)=x^p&lt;/math&gt; where ''&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;'' is a positive integer.

===''SBV'' functions===
'''SBV functions''' ''i.e.'' ''Special functions of Bounded Variation'' were introduced by [[Luigi Ambrosio]] and [[Ennio de Giorgi]] in the paper {{Harv|Ambrosio|De Giorgi|1988}}, dealing with free discontinuity [[variational problem]]s: given an [[open subset]] '''&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;''' of ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', the space '''&lt;math&gt;SBV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is a proper [[linear subspace]] of '''&lt;math&gt;BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''', since the [[weak derivative|weak]] [[gradient]] of each function belonging to it consists precisely of the [[summation|sum]] of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-[[dimension]]al [[Support (mathematics)|support]] and an &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;-[[dimension]]al [[Support (mathematics)|support]] [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] and ''no intermediate-dimensional terms'', as seen in the following definition.

'''Definition'''. Given a [[locally integrable function]] '''&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;''', then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle u\in {S\!BV}(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if

'''1.''' There exist two [[Borel function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of [[Domain of a function|domain]] '''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;''' and [[codomain]] ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega\vert f\vert dH^n+ \int_\Omega\vert g\vert dH^{n-1}&lt;+\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

'''2.''' For all of [[Smooth function|continuously differentiable]] [[vector-valued function|vector functions]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\phi &lt;/math&gt; of [[support (mathematics)#Compact support|compact support]] contained in '''&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;''', ''i.e.'' for all &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \phi \in
C_c^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; the following formula is true:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega u\mbox{div} \phi dH^n = \int_\Omega \langle \phi, f\rangle dH^n +\int_\Omega \langle \phi, g\rangle dH^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-[[dimension]]al [[Hausdorff measure]].

Details on the properties of ''SBV'' functions can be found in works cited in the bibliography section: particularly the paper {{Harv|De Giorgi|1992}} contains a useful [[bibliography]].

===''bv'' sequences===
As particular examples of [[Banach spaces]], {{harvtxt|Dunford|Schwartz|1958|loc=Chapter IV}} consider spaces of '''sequences of bounded variation''', in addition to the spaces of functions of bounded variation. The total variation of a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] ''x''=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) of real or complex numbers is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;TV(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.&lt;/math&gt;

The space of all sequences of finite total variation is denoted by ''bv''. The norm on ''bv'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_{bv} = |x_1| + TV(x) = |x_1| +  \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.&lt;/math&gt;
With this norm, the space ''bv'' is a Banach space.

The total variation itself defines a norm on a certain subspace of ''bv'', denoted by ''bv''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, consisting of sequences ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) for which
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n =0.&lt;/math&gt;
The norm on ''bv''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_{bv_0} = TV(x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |x_{i+1}-x_i|.&lt;/math&gt;
With respect to this norm ''bv''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; becomes a Banach space as well.

===Measures of bounded variation===
A [[signed measure|signed]] (or [[complex measure|complex]]) [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' on a [[sigma-algebra|measurable space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be of bounded variation if its [[Total variation#Total variation in measure theory|total variation]]'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Vert \mu\Vert=|\mu|(X)&lt;/math&gt;'' is bounded: see {{harvtxt|Halmos|1950|p=123}}, {{harvtxt|Kolmogorov|Fomin|1969|p=346}} or the entry "[[Total variation]]" for further details.

==Examples==
[[File:Sin x^-1.svg|right|thumb|The function ''f''(''x'')=sin(1/''x'') is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,2 / \pi] &lt;/math&gt;.]]
The function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \mbox{if }x =0 \\ \sin(1/x), &amp; \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0, 2/\pi]&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Xsin(x^-1).svg|thumb|right|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x''&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''x'') is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,2 / \pi] &lt;/math&gt;.]]
While it is harder to see, the continuous function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \mbox{if }x =0 \\ x \sin(1/x), &amp; \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

is ''not'' of bounded variation on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0, 2/\pi]&lt;/math&gt; either.

[[File:X^2sin(x^-1).svg|thumb|right|The function ''f''(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;sin(1/''x'') ''is'' of bounded variation on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,2 / \pi] &lt;/math&gt;.]]
At the same time, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \mbox{if }x =0 \\ x^2 \sin(1/x), &amp; \mbox{if } x \neq 0 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

is of bounded variation on the interval &lt;math&gt; [0,2/\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''all three functions are of bounded variation on each interval'' &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; ''with'' &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Sobolev space]] '''&lt;math&gt; W^{1,1}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;''' is a [[proper subset]] of '''&lt;math&gt; BV(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;'''. In fact, for each '''&lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;''' in '''&lt;math&gt; W^{1,1}(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt;''' it is possible to choose a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \mu:=\nabla u \mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\mathcal L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lebesgue measure]] on '''&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;''') such that the equality

:&lt;math&gt; \int u\mathrm{div}\phi = -\int \phi\, d\mu = -\int \phi \nabla u \qquad \forall \phi\in C_c^1 &lt;/math&gt;

holds, since it is nothing more than the definition of [[weak derivative]], and hence holds true. One can easily find an example of a ''BV'' function which is not '''&lt;math&gt;W^{1,1}&lt;/math&gt;''':  in dimension one, any step function with a non-trivial jump will do.

==Applications==

=== Mathematics ===

Functions of bounded variation have been studied in connection with the set of [[classification of discontinuities|discontinuities]] of functions and differentiability of real functions, and the following results are well-known. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real number|real]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of bounded variation on an interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function|continuous]] except at most on a [[countable set]];
* &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has [[one-sided limit]]s everywhere (limits from the left everywhere in &lt;math&gt;(a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and from the right everywhere in &lt;math&gt;[a,b)&lt;/math&gt; ;
* the [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists [[almost everywhere]] (i.e. except for a set of [[measure zero]]).

For [[real number|real]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] of several real variables

* the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of a [[Caccioppoli set]] is a ''BV'' function: ''BV'' functions lie at the basis of the modern theory of perimeters.
* [[Minimal surface]]s are [[Graph of a function|graph]]s of ''BV'' functions: in this context, see reference {{Harv|Giusti|1984}}.

===Physics and engineering===
The ability of ''BV'' functions to deal with discontinuities has made their use widespread in the applied sciences: solutions of problems in mechanics, physics, chemical kinetics are very often representable by functions of bounded variation. The book {{Harv|Hudjaev|Vol'pert|1985}} details a very ample set of mathematical physics applications of ''BV'' functions. Also there is some modern application which deserves a brief description.

*The [[Mumford–Shah functional]]: the segmentation problem for a two-dimensional image, i.e. the problem of faithful reproduction of contours and grey scales is equivalent to the [[minimum|minimization]] of such [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]].

'''''Cocker's Decimal Arithmetick''''' is a [[grammar school]] [[mathematics]] textbook written by [[Edward Cocker]] (1631–1676) and published posthumously by John Hawkins in 1684.&lt;ref name=yeldham&gt;{{cite book | last=Yeldham | first=Florence | title=The Teaching of Arithmetic Through Four Hundred Years (1535-1935) | pages=75, 80–83, 85 | location=London | publisher=George G.

The concept of decimal fractions and the advantages of using them in calculations were well known, but a wide variety of different notations were in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jeff Miller | title=Earliest Uses of Symbols for Fractions | url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/fractions.html| work=Jeff Miller's Mathword | date=28 April 2008 | accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surveying various notations, ''Decimal Arithmetick'' recommends the [[decimal point]] notation introduced by [[John Napier]]:

:''A decimal fraction being written ... by having a point or prick prefixed before it ... being written according to the first direction, I conceive they may be most fit for calculation.''&lt;ref name=yeldham/&gt;

''Decimal Arithmetick'' gives instructions for calculations involving decimals, methods of extracting roots, and an overview of the concept of logarithms. There are many worked examples, some of which involve solid geometry or the calculation of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6364">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], a '''conditional variance''' is the [[variance]] of a [[random variable]] given the value(s) of one or more other variables.
Particularly in [[econometrics]], the conditional variance is also known as the '''scedastic function''' or '''skedastic function'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aris |last=Spanos |chapter=Conditioning and regression |title=Probability Theory and Statistical Inference |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-42408-9 |pages=339–356 [p. 342] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0_HxBubGAwC&amp;pg=PA342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditional variances are important parts of [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) models.

==Definition==
The conditional variance of a [[random variable]] ''Y'' given another random variable ''X'' is 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X) = \operatorname{E}((Y - \operatorname{E}(Y\mid X))^{2}\mid X).&lt;/math&gt;

The conditional variance tells us how much variance is left if we use &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(Y\mid X)&lt;/math&gt; to "predict" ''Y''.
Here, as usual, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(Y\mid X)&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[conditional expectation]] of ''Y'' given ''X'',
which we may recall, is a random variable itself (a function of ''X'', determined up to probability one).
As a result, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt; itself is a random variable (and is a function of ''X'').

==Explanation, relation to [[least-squares]]==
Recall that variance is the expected squared deviation between a random variable (say, ''Y'') and its expected value. 
The expected value can be thought of as a reasonable prediction of the outcomes of the random experiment (in particular, the expected value is the best constant prediction when predictions are assessed by expected squared prediction error). Thus, one interpretation of variance is that it gives the smallest possible expected squared prediction error. If we have the knowledge of another random variable (''X'') that we can use to predict ''Y'', we can potentially use this knowledge to reduce the expected squared error. As it turns out, the best prediction of ''Y'' given ''X'' is the conditional expectation. In particular, for any &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; measurable,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[ (Y-f(X))^2 ]
&amp;= \operatorname{E}[                   (Y-\operatorname{E}(Y|X)\,\,+\,\,  \operatorname{E}(Y|X)-f(X) )^2 ] \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E}[ \operatorname{E}\{ (Y-\operatorname{E}(Y|X)\,\,+\,\,  \operatorname{E}(Y|X)-f(X) )^2|X\} ] \\
&amp;= \operatorname{E}[\operatorname{Var}( Y| X )] + \operatorname{E}[(\operatorname{E}(Y|X)-f(X))^2]\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By selecting &lt;math&gt;f(X)=\operatorname{E}(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt;, the second, nonnegative term becomes zero, showing the claim.
Here, the second equality used the [[law of total expectation]].
We also see that the expected conditional variance of ''Y'' given ''X'' shows up as the irreducible error of predicting ''Y'' given only the knowledge of ''X''.

==Special cases, variations==
===Conditioning on discrete random variables===
When ''X'' takes on countable many values &lt;math&gt;S = \{x_1,x_1,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; with positive probability, i.e., it is a [[discrete random variable]], we can introduce &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt;, the conditional variance of ''Y'' given that ''X=x'' for any ''x'' from ''S'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x) = \operatorname{E}((Y - \operatorname{E}(Y\mid X=x))^{2}\mid X=x),&lt;/math&gt;

where recall that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(Z\mid X=x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Conditional_expectation#Conditional_expectation_with_respect_to_a_random_variable|conditional expectation of ''Z'' given that ''X=x'']], which is well-defined for &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt;.
An alternative notation for &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}_{Y\mid X}(Y|x).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt; defines a constant for possible values of ''x'', and in particular, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt;, is ''not'' a random variable.

The connection of this definition to &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:
Let ''S'' be as above and define the function &lt;math&gt;v: S \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;v(x) = \operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;v(X) = \operatorname{Var}(Y|X)&lt;/math&gt; [[almost surely]].

===Definition using conditional distributions===
The "conditional expectation of ''Y'' given ''X=x''" can also be defined more generally
using the [[conditional distribution]] of ''Y'' given ''X'' (this exists in this case, as both here ''X'' and ''Y'' are real-valued).

In particular, letting  &lt;math&gt;P_{Y|X}&lt;/math&gt;  be the (regular) [[conditional distribution]] &lt;math&gt;P_{Y|X}&lt;/math&gt; of ''Y'' given ''X'', i.e., &lt;math&gt;P_{Y|X}:\mathcal{B} \times \mathbb{R}\to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; (the intention is that &lt;math&gt;P_{Y|X}(U,x) = P(Y\in U|X=x)&lt;/math&gt; almost surely over the support of ''X''), we can define

&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x) = \int (y- \int y' P_{Y|X}(dy'|x))^2 P_{Y|X}(dy|x). &lt;/math&gt;

This can, of course, be specialized to when ''Y'' is discrete itself (replacing the integrals with sums), and also when the [[conditional density]] of ''Y'' given ''X=x'' with respect to some underlying distribution exists.

==Components of variance==
The [[law of total variance]] says

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \operatorname{E}(\operatorname{Var}(Y\mid X))+\operatorname{Var}(\operatorname{E}(Y\mid X)).&lt;/math&gt;

In words: the variance of ''Y'' is the sum of the expected conditional variance ''Y'' given ''X'' and the variance of the conditional expectation of ''Y'' given ''X''. The first term captures the variation left after "using ''X'' to predict ''Y''", while the second term captures the variation due to the mean of the prediction of ''Y'' due to the randomness of ''X''.

In [[game theory]], a '''cooperative game''' (or '''coalitional game''') is a game with competition between groups of players ("coalitions") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through [[contract law]]). Those are opposed to [[non-cooperative game]]s in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be [[Self-enforcing agreement|self-enforcing]] (e.g. through [[credible threat]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/Non-CooperativeGame.html|title=Non-Cooperative Game - Game Theory .net|last=Shor|first=Mike|website=www.gametheory.net|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative games are often analysed through the framework of '''cooperative game theory,''' which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional [[Non-cooperative game|non-cooperative game theory]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing [[Nash equilibria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/~chandra/documents/6311/coopgames.pdf|title=Cooperative Game Theory|last=Chandrasekaran|first=R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uib.cat/depart/deeweb/pdi/hdeelbm0/arxius_decisions_and_games/cooperative_game_theory-brandenburger.pdf|title=Cooperative Game Theory: Characteristic Functions, Allocations, Marginal Contribution|last=Brandenburger|first=Adam|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows the analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.

== Mathematical definition ==

A cooperative game is given by specifying a value for every coalition. Formally, the coalitional game consists of a finite set of players &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, called the ''grand coalition'', and a ''characteristic function'' &lt;math&gt; v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; from the set of all possible coalitions of players to a set of payments that satisfies &lt;math&gt; v( \emptyset ) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. The function describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition, and the game is sometimes called a ''value game'' or a ''profit game''. 

Conversely, a cooperative game can also be defined with a characteristic cost function &lt;math&gt; c: 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; c( \emptyset ) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. In this setting, players must accomplish some task, and the characteristic function &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; represents the cost of a set of players accomplishing the task together. A game of this kind is known as a ''cost game''. Although most cooperative game theory deals with profit games, all concepts can easily be translated to the cost setting.

==Harsanyi dividend ==

The ''Harsanyi dividend'' (named after [[John Harsanyi]], who used it to generalize the [[Shapley value]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-2527-9_3|title=Papers in Game Theory|last=Harsanyi|first=John C.|date=1982|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789048183692|series=Theory and Decision Library|pages=44–70|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2527-9_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) identifies the surplus that is created by a coalition of players in a cooperative game. To specify this surplus, the worth of this coalition is corrected by the surplus that is already created by subcoalitions. To this end, the dividend &lt;math&gt;d_v(S)&lt;/math&gt; of coalition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is recursively determined by

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d_v(\{i\})&amp;= v(\{i\}) \\
d_v(\{i,j\})&amp;= v(\{i,j\})-d_v(\{i\})-d_v(\{j\}) \\
d_v(\{i,j,k\})&amp;= v(\{i,j,k\})-d_v(\{i,j\})-d_v(\{i,k\})-d_v(\{j,k\})-d_v(\{i\})-d_v(\{j\})-d_v(\{k\})\\
&amp;\vdots \\
d_v(S) &amp;= v(S) - \sum_{T\subsetneq S }d_v(T)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An explicit formula for the dividend is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d_v(S)=\sum_{T\subsetneq S }(-1)^{|S\setminus T|}v(T)&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt; d_v:2^N \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is also known as the [[Möbius transformation|Möbius inverse]] of &lt;math&gt; v:2^N \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319306889|title=Set Functions, Games and Capacities in Decision Making {{!}} Michel Grabisch {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, we can recover &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;d_v&lt;/math&gt; by help of the formula &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v(S) = \sum_{T\subseteq S }d_v(T)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Harsanyi dividends are useful for analyzing both games and solution concepts, e.g. the [[Shapley value]] is obtained by distributing the dividend of each coalition among its members, i.e., the Shapley value &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v)&lt;/math&gt; of player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is given by summing up a player's share of the dividends of all coalitions that she belongs to, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi_i(v)=\sum_{S\subset N: i \in S }{d_v(S)}/{|S|}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Duality ==

Let &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; be a profit game. The ''dual game'' of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the cost game &lt;math&gt; v^* &lt;/math&gt; defined as

: &lt;math&gt; v^*(S) = v(N) - v( N \setminus S ), \forall~ S \subseteq N.&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, the dual game represents the [[opportunity cost]] for a coalition &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; of not joining the grand coalition &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. A dual profit game &lt;math&gt; c^* &lt;/math&gt; can be defined identically for a cost game &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;. A cooperative game and its dual are in some sense equivalent, and they share many properties. For example, the [[Core (economics)|core]] of a game and its dual are equal. For more details on cooperative game duality, see for instance {{harv|Bilbao|2000}}.

== Subgames ==

Let &lt;math&gt; S \subsetneq N &lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty coalition of players. The ''subgame'' &lt;math&gt; v_S : 2^S \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is naturally defined as

: &lt;math&gt; v_S(T) = v(T), \forall~ T \subseteq S.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, we simply restrict our attention to coalitions contained in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;. Subgames are useful because they allow us to apply [[#Solution concepts|solution concepts]] defined for the grand coalition on smaller coalitions.

== Properties for characterization ==
=== Superadditivity ===
Characteristic functions are often assumed to be [[superadditive]] {{harv|Owen|1995|p=213}}. This means that the value of a union of [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] coalitions is no less than the sum of the coalitions' separate values:

&lt;math&gt; v ( S \cup T ) \geq v (S) + v (T) &lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt; S, T \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt; S \cap T = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Monotonicity ===
Larger coalitions gain more:

&lt;math&gt; S \subseteq T \Rightarrow v (S) \le v (T) &lt;/math&gt;. 

This follows from [[superadditive|superadditivity]]. i.e. if payoffs are normalized so singleton coalitions have zero value.

=== Properties for simple games ===
A coalitional game {{mvar|v}} is considered '''simple''' if payoffs are either 1 or 0, i.e. coalitions are either "winning" or "losing".

Equivalently, a '''simple game''' can be defined as a collection {{mvar|W}} of coalitions, where the members of {{mvar|W}} are called '''winning''' coalitions, and the others '''losing''' coalitions.
It is sometimes assumed that a simple game is nonempty or that it does not contain an empty set. However, in other areas of mathematics, simple games are also called [[hypergraph]]s or [[Boolean functions]] (logic functions).

* A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''monotonic''' if any coalition containing a winning coalition is also winning, that is, if &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; imply &lt;math&gt;T \in W&lt;/math&gt;.
* A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''proper''' if the complement (opposition) of any winning coalition is losing, that is, if &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \notin W&lt;/math&gt;.
* A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''strong''' if the complement of any losing coalition is winning, that is, if &lt;math&gt;S \notin W&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \in W&lt;/math&gt;.
** If a simple game {{mvar|W}} is proper and strong, then  a coalition is winning if and only if its complement is losing, that is, &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; iff  &lt;math&gt;N\setminus S \notin W&lt;/math&gt;. (If {{mvar|v}} is a colitional simple game that is proper and strong, &lt;math&gt;v(S) = 1 - v(N \setminus S)&lt;/math&gt; for any {{mvar|S}}.)
* A '''veto player''' (vetoer) in a simple game is a player that belongs to all winning coalitions. Supposing there is a veto player, any coalition not containing a veto player is losing.  A simple game {{mvar|W}} is '''weak''' (''collegial'') if it has a veto player, that is, if the intersection &lt;math&gt;\bigcap W := \bigcap_{S\in W} S&lt;/math&gt; of all winning coalitions is nonempty.
** A '''dictator''' in a simple game is a veto player such that any coalition containing this player is winning.  The dictator does not belong to any losing coalition. ([[Dictator game]]s in experimental economics are unrelated to this.)
* A '''carrier'''  of a simple game {{mvar|W}} is a set &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; such that for any coalition {{mvar|S}}, we have &lt;math&gt;S \in W&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;S\cap T \in W&lt;/math&gt;.  When a simple game has a carrier, any player not belonging to it is ignored.  A simple game is sometimes called ''finite'' if it has a finite carrier (even if {{mvar|N}} is infinite).
* The '''[[Nakamura number]]''' of a simple game is the minimal number of ''winning coalitions'' with empty intersection.  According to Nakamura's theorem, the number measures the degree of rationality; it is an indicator of the extent to which an aggregation rule can yield well-defined choices.

A few relations among the above axioms have widely been recognized, such as the following
(e.g., Peleg, 2002, Section 2.1&lt;ref name=peleg02hbscw&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Peleg | first1 = B. | chapter = Chapter 8 Game-theoretic analysis of voting in committees | doi = 10.1016/S1574-0110(02)80012-1 | title = Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare Volume 1 | series = Handbook of Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 1 | pages = 195–201 | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780444829146 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;):

* If a simple game is weak, it is proper.
* A simple game is dictatorial if and only if it is strong and weak.

The restrictions that various axioms for simple games impose on their [[Nakamura number]] were also studied extensively. &lt;ref name= kumabe-m08scw&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kumabe | first1 = M. | last2 = Mihara | first2 = H. R. | title = The Nakamura numbers for computable simple games| journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | page = 621 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1007/s00355-008-0300-5 | url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/3684.htm| arxiv = 1107.0439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, a computable simple game without a veto player has a Nakamura number greater than 3 only if it is a ''proper'' and ''non-strong'' game.

== Relation with non-cooperative theory ==

Let ''G'' be a strategic (non-cooperative) game. Then, assuming that coalitions have the ability to enforce coordinated behaviour, there are several cooperative games associated with ''G''. These games are often referred to as ''representations of G''. The two standard representations are:&lt;ref&gt;Aumann, Robert J. "The core of a cooperative game without side payments." Transactions of the American Mathematical Society (1961): 539-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The α-effective game associates with each coalition the sum of gains its members can 'guarantee' by joining forces. By 'guaranteeing', it is meant that the value is the max-min, e.g. the maximal value of the minimum taken over the opposition's strategies.
* The β-effective game associates with each coalition the sum of gains its members can 'strategically guarantee' by joining forces. By 'strategically guaranteeing', it is meant that the value is the min-max, e.g. the minimal value of the maximum taken over the opposition's strategies.

== Solution concepts ==

The main assumption in cooperative game theory is that the grand coalition &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; will form.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The challenge is then to allocate the payoff &lt;math&gt; v(N) &lt;/math&gt; among the players in some fair way. (This assumption is not restrictive, because even if players split off and form smaller coalitions, we can apply solution concepts to the subgames defined by whatever coalitions actually form.)  A ''solution concept'' is a vector &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; that represents the allocation to each player. Researchers have proposed different solution concepts based on different notions of fairness. Some properties to look for in a solution concept include:

* Efficiency: The payoff vector exactly splits the total value: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{ i \in N } x_i = v(N) &lt;/math&gt;.
* Individual rationality: No player receives less than what he could get on his own: &lt;math&gt; x_i \geq v(\{i\}), \forall~ i \in N &lt;/math&gt;.
* Existence: The solution concept exists for any game &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;.
* Uniqueness: The solution concept is unique for any game &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;.
* Marginality: The payoff of a player depends only on the marginal contribution of this player, i.e., if these marginal contributions are the same in two different games, then the payoff is the same: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) = w( S \cup \{ i \} ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \} &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is the same in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and in &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
* Monotonicity: The payoff of a player increases if the marginal contribution of this player increase: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) \leq w( S \cup \{ i \} ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \} &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; is weakly greater in &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; than in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
* Computational ease: The solution concept can be calculated efficiently (i.e. in polynomial time with respect to the number of players &lt;math&gt; |N| &lt;/math&gt;.)
* Symmetry: The solution concept &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; allocates equal payments &lt;math&gt; x_i = x_j &lt;/math&gt; to symmetric players &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;. Two players &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; are ''symmetric'' if &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) = v( S \cup \{ j \} ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i, j \} &lt;/math&gt;; that is, we can exchange one player for the other in any coalition that contains only one of the players and not change the payoff.
* Additivity: The allocation to a player in a sum of two games is the sum of the allocations to the player in each individual game. Mathematically, if &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; are games, the game &lt;math&gt; ( v + \omega ) &lt;/math&gt; simply assigns to any coalition the sum of the payoffs the coalition would get in the two individual games. An additive solution concept assigns to every player in &lt;math&gt; ( v + \omega ) &lt;/math&gt; the sum of what he would receive in &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;.
* Zero Allocation to Null Players: The allocation to a null player is zero. A ''null player'' &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) = v( S ), \forall~ S \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \} &lt;/math&gt;. In economic terms, a null player's marginal value to any coalition that does not contain him is zero.

An efficient payoff vector is called a ''pre-imputation'', and an individually rational pre-imputation is called an [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]]. Most solution concepts are imputations.

=== {{vanchor|The stable set|von Neumann-Morgenstern solution}} ===

The stable set of a game (also known as the ''von Neumann-Morgenstern solution'' {{harv|von Neumann|Morgenstern|1944}}) was the first solution proposed for games with more than 2 players. Let &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; be a game and let &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; be two [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; ''dominates'' &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; if some coalition &lt;math&gt; S \neq \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt; x_i &gt; y _i, \forall~ i \in S &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sum_{ i \in S } x_i \leq v(S) &lt;/math&gt;. In other words, players in &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; prefer the payoffs from &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; to those from &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt;, and they can threaten to leave the grand coalition if &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; is used because the payoff they obtain on their own is at least as large as the allocation they receive under &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

A ''stable set'' is a set of [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] that satisfies two properties:

* Internal stability: No payoff vector in the stable set is dominated by another vector in the set.
* External stability: All payoff vectors outside the set are dominated by at least one vector in the set.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern saw the stable set as the collection of acceptable behaviours in a society: None is clearly preferred to any other, but for each unacceptable behaviour there is a preferred alternative. The definition is very general allowing the concept to be used in a wide variety of game formats.

==== Properties ====

* A stable set may or may not exist {{harv|Lucas|1969}}, and if it exists it is typically not unique {{harv|Lucas|1992}}. Stable sets are usually difficult to find. This and other difficulties have led to the development of many other solution concepts.
* A positive fraction of cooperative games have unique stable sets consisting of the [[Core (economics)|core]] {{harv|Owen|1995|p=240}}.
* A positive fraction of cooperative games have stable sets which discriminate &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt; players. In such sets at least &lt;math&gt;n-3&lt;/math&gt; of the discriminated players are excluded {{harv|Owen|1995|p=240}}.

=== The core ===
{{main article|Core (economics)}}

Let &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; be a game. The [[Core (economics)|''core'']] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the set of payoff vectors

: &lt;math&gt; C( v ) = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N: \sum_{ i \in N } x_i = v(N); \quad \sum_{ i \in S } x_i \geq v(S), \forall~ S \subseteq N \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the core is the set of [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] under which no coalition has a value greater than the sum of its members' payoffs. Therefore, no coalition has incentive to leave the grand coalition and receive a larger payoff.

==== Properties ====

* The [[Core (economics)|core]] of a game may be empty (see the [[Bondareva–Shapley theorem]]). Games with non-empty cores are called ''balanced''.
* If it is non-empty, the core does not necessarily contain a unique vector.
* The [[Core (economics)|core]] is contained in any stable set, and if the core is stable it is the unique stable set; see {{harv|Driessen|1988}} for a proof.

=== The core of a simple game with respect to preferences ===

For simple games, there is another notion of the core, when each player is assumed to have preferences on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of alternatives.
A ''profile'' is a list &lt;math&gt;p=(\succ_i^p)_{i \in N}&lt;/math&gt; of individual preferences &lt;math&gt;\succ_i^p&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;x \succ_i^p y&lt;/math&gt; means that individual &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; prefers alternative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; at profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
Given a simple game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and a profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, a ''dominance'' relation &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_v&lt;/math&gt; is defined
on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x \succ^p_v y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a winning coalition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;
(i.e., &lt;math&gt;v(S)=1&lt;/math&gt;) satisfying &lt;math&gt;x \succ_i^p y&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''core'' &lt;math&gt;C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; of the simple game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the profile &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences
is the set of alternatives undominated by &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_v&lt;/math&gt;
(the set of maximal elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\succ^p_v&lt;/math&gt;):

: &lt;math&gt;x \in C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is no &lt;math&gt;y\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y \succ^p_v x&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''Nakamura number'' of a simple game is the minimal number of winning coalitions with empty intersection.
''Nakamura's theorem'' states that the core &lt;math&gt;C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of ''acyclic'' (alternatively, ''transitive'') preferences
if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite ''and'' the cardinal number (the number of elements) of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is less than the Nakamura number of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
A variant by Kumabe and Mihara states that the core &lt;math&gt;C(v,p)&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty for all profiles &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of preferences that have a ''maximal element''
if and only if the cardinal number of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is less than the Nakamura number of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.  (See [[Nakamura number]] for details.)

=== The strong epsilon-core ===

Because the [[Core (economics)|core]] may be empty, a generalization was introduced in {{harv|Shapley|Shubik|1966}}. The ''strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core'' for some number &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of payoff vectors

: &lt;math&gt; C_\varepsilon( v ) = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N: \sum_{ i \in N } x_i = v(N); \quad \sum_{ i \in S } x_i \geq v(S) - \varepsilon, \forall~ S \subseteq N \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

In economic terms, the strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core is the set of pre-imputations where no coalition can improve its payoff by leaving the grand coalition, if it must pay a penalty of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; for leaving. Note that &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; may be negative, in which case it represents a bonus for leaving the grand coalition. Clearly, regardless of whether the [[Core (economics)|core]] is empty, the strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core will be non-empty for a large enough value of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; and empty for a small enough (possibly negative) value of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Following this line of reasoning, the ''least-core'', introduced in {{harv|Maschler|Peleg|Shapley|1979}}, is the intersection of all non-empty strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-cores. It can also be viewed as the strong &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;-core for the smallest value of &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; that makes the set non-empty {{harv|Bilbao|2000}}.

=== The Shapley value ===
{{main article|Shapley value}}

The ''Shapley value'' is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, and satisfies monotonicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=H. P.|date=1985-06-01|title=Monotonic solutions of cooperative games|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01769885|journal=International Journal of Game Theory|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=65–72|doi=10.1007/BF01769885|issn=0020-7276}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Lloyd Shapley]] {{harv|Shapley|1953}} who showed that it is the unique payoff vector that is efficient, symmetric, additive, and assigns zero payoffs to dummy players. The Shapley value of a [[superadditive]] game is individually rational, but this is not true in general. {{harv|Driessen|1988}}

=== The kernel ===

Let &lt;math&gt; v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; be a game, and let &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; be an efficient payoff vector. The ''maximum surplus'' of player ''i'' over player ''j'' with respect to ''x'' is

: &lt;math&gt; s_{ij}^v(x) = \max \left\{ v(S) - \sum_{ k \in S } x_k : S \subseteq N \setminus \{ j \}, i \in S \right\}, &lt;/math&gt;

the maximal amount player ''i'' can gain without the cooperation of player ''j'' by withdrawing from the grand coalition ''N'' under payoff vector ''x'', assuming that the other players in ''i'''s withdrawing coalition are satisfied with their payoffs under ''x''. The maximum surplus is a way to measure one player's bargaining power over another. The ''kernel'' of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] ''x'' that satisfy

* &lt;math&gt; ( s_{ij}^v(x) - s_{ji}^v(x) ) \times ( x_j - v(j) ) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and
* &lt;math&gt; ( s_{ji}^v(x) - s_{ij}^v(x) ) \times ( x_i - v(i) ) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for every pair of players ''i'' and ''j''. Intuitively, player ''i'' has more bargaining power than player ''j'' with respect to [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]] ''x'' if &lt;math&gt;s_{ij}^v(x) &gt; s_{ji}^v(x)&lt;/math&gt;, but player ''j'' is immune to player ''i'''s threats if &lt;math&gt; x_j = v(j) &lt;/math&gt;, because he can obtain this payoff on his own. The kernel contains all [[Imputation (game theory)|imputations]] where no player has this bargaining power over another. This solution concept was first introduced in {{harv|Davis|Maschler|1965}}.

=== The nucleolus ===

Let &lt;math&gt; v : 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; be a game, and let &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; be a payoff vector. The ''excess'' of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; for a coalition &lt;math&gt; S \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt; is the quantity &lt;math&gt; v(S) - \sum_{ i \in S } x_i &lt;/math&gt;; that is, the gain that players in coalition &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; can obtain if they withdraw from the grand coalition &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; under payoff &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and instead take the payoff &lt;math&gt; v(S) &lt;/math&gt;.

Now let &lt;math&gt; \theta(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{ 2^N } &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of excesses of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;, arranged in non-increasing order. In other words, &lt;math&gt; \theta_i(x) \geq \theta_j(x), \forall~ i &lt; j &lt;/math&gt;. Notice that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is in the [[Core (economics)|core]] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is a pre-imputation and &lt;math&gt; \theta_1(x) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. To define the nucleolus, we consider the lexicographic ordering of vectors in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{ 2^N } &lt;/math&gt;: For two payoff vectors &lt;math&gt; x, y &lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt; \theta(x) &lt;/math&gt; is lexicographically smaller than &lt;math&gt; \theta(y) &lt;/math&gt; if for some index &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; \theta_i(x) = \theta_i(y), \forall~ i &lt; k &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \theta_k(x) &lt; \theta_k(y) &lt;/math&gt;. (The ordering is called lexicographic because it mimics alphabetical ordering used to arrange words in a dictionary.) The ''nucleolus'' of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the lexicographically minimal [[Imputation (game theory)|imputation]], based on this ordering. This solution concept was first introduced in {{harv|Schmeidler|1969}}.

Although the definition of the nucleolus seems abstract, {{harv|Maschler|Peleg|Shapley|1979}} gave a more intuitive description: Starting with the least-core, record the coalitions for which the right-hand side of the inequality in the definition of &lt;math&gt; C_\varepsilon( v ) &lt;/math&gt; cannot be further reduced without making the set empty. Continue decreasing the right-hand side for the remaining coalitions, until it cannot be reduced without making the set empty. Record the new set of coalitions for which the inequalities hold at equality; continue decreasing the right-hand side of remaining coalitions and repeat this process as many times as necessary until all coalitions have been recorded. The resulting payoff vector is the nucleolus.

==== Properties ====

* Although the definition does not explicitly state it, the nucleolus is always unique. (See Section II.7 of {{harv|Driessen|1988}} for a proof.)
* If the core is non-empty, the nucleolus is in the core.
* The nucleolus is always in the kernel, and since the kernel is contained in the bargaining set, it is always in the bargaining set (see {{harv|Driessen|1988}} for details.)

== {{vanchor|Convex cooperative games|Convex games}} ==

Introduced by [[Lloyd Shapley|Shapley]] in {{harv|Shapley|1971}}, convex cooperative games capture the intuitive property some games have of "snowballing". Specifically, a game is ''convex'' if its characteristic function &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is [[supermodular]]:

: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup T ) + v( S \cap T ) \geq v(S) + v(T), \forall~ S, T \subseteq N.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown (see, e.g., Section V.1 of {{harv|Driessen|1988}}) that the [[supermodular]]ity of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to

: &lt;math&gt; v( S \cup \{ i \} ) - v(S) \leq v( T \cup \{ i \} ) - v(T), \forall~ S \subseteq T \subseteq N \setminus \{ i \}, \forall~ i \in N;&lt;/math&gt;

that is, "the incentives for joining a coalition increase as the coalition grows" {{harv|Shapley|1971}}, leading to the aforementioned snowball effect. For cost games, the inequalities are reversed, so that we say the cost game is ''convex'' if the characteristic function is [[submodular]].

=== Properties ===

Convex cooperative games have many nice properties:

* [[Supermodularity]] trivially implies [[superadditivity]].
* Convex games are ''totally balanced'': The [[Core (economics)|core]] of a convex game is non-empty, and since any subgame of a convex game is convex, the [[Core (economics)|core]] of any subgame is also non-empty.
* A convex game has a unique stable set that coincides with its [[Core (economics)|core]].
* The [[Shapley value]] of a convex game is the center of gravity of its [[Core (economics)|core]].
* An [[extreme point]] (vertex) of the [[Core (economics)|core]] can be found in polynomial time using the [[greedy algorithm]]: Let &lt;math&gt; \pi: N \to N &lt;/math&gt; be a [[permutation]] of the players, and let &lt;math&gt; S_i = \{ j \in N: \pi(j) \leq i \} &lt;/math&gt; be the set of players ordered &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;, for any &lt;math&gt; i = 0, \ldots, n &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; S_0 = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;. Then the payoff &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathbb{R}^N &lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt; x_i = v( S_{\pi(i)} ) - v( S_{\pi(i) - 1}  ), \forall~ i \in N &lt;/math&gt; is a vertex of the [[Core (economics)|core]] of &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;. Any vertex of the [[Core (economics)|core]] can be constructed in this way by choosing an appropriate [[permutation]] &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Similarities and differences with combinatorial optimization ===

[[Submodular]] and [[supermodular]] set functions are also studied in [[combinatorial optimization]]. Many of the results in {{harv|Shapley|1971}} have analogues in {{harv|Edmonds|1970}}, where [[submodular]] functions were first presented as generalizations of [[matroid]]s. In this context, the [[Core (economics)|core]] of a convex cost game is called the ''base polyhedron'', because its elements generalize base properties of [[matroid]]s.

However, the optimization community generally considers [[submodular]] functions to be the discrete analogues of convex functions {{harv|Lovász|1983}}, because the minimization of both types of functions is computationally tractable. Unfortunately, this conflicts directly with [[Lloyd Shapley|Shapley's]] original definition of [[supermodular]] functions as "convex".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, '''Dobiński’s formula'''&lt;ref&gt;G. Dobiński, "Summirung&lt;!-- "Summirung" is an archaic spelling, and it is the spelling that was used in this title. --&gt; der Reihe &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum\frac{n^m}{n!}&lt;/math&gt; für ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;…", ''Grunert's Archiv'', volume 61, 1877, pages 333–336 (Internet Archive: [https://archive.org/stream/archivdermathem88unkngoog#page/n346]).&lt;/ref&gt; states that the ''n''-th [[Bell number]] ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., the number of [[partition of a set|partitions of a set]] of size ''n'') equals

:&lt;math&gt;B_n = {1 \over e}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k^n}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula is named after G. Dobiński, who published it in 1877.

==Probabilistic content==

In the [[probability theory]] setting, Dobinski's formula represents the ''n''th [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the [[Poisson distribution]] with [[expected value]] 1. Sometimes Dobinski's formula is stated as the number of partitions of a set of size ''n'' equals the ''n''th moment of that distribution.

==Generalization==
Dobiński’s formula can be seen as a particular case, for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, of the more general relation:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over e}\sum_{k=x}^\infty \frac{k^n}{(k-x)!} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} B_{k} x^{n-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The proof given here is an adaptation to probabilistic language of the proof given by [[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Combinatorialists use the [[Pochhammer symbol]] (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to denote the falling factorial

:&lt;math&gt;(x)_n = x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

(whereas, in the theory of [[special function]]s, the same notation denotes the ''rising'' factorial).  If ''x'' and ''n'' are nonnegative integers, 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x'', then (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of [[one-to-one function]]s that map a size-''n'' set into a size-''x'' set.

Let ''&amp;fnof;'' be any function from a size-''n'' set ''A'' into a size-''x'' set ''B''.  For any ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B'', let ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''u'') = {''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A'' : ''&amp;fnof;''(''v'') = ''u''}.  Then {{nowrap|{''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''u'') : ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''B''}}} is a partition of ''A'', coming from the [[equivalence relation]] of "being in the same [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]".  This equivalence relation is called the "[[Kernel (set theory)|kernel]]" of the function ''&amp;fnof;''.  Any function from ''A'' into ''B'' factors into
* one function that maps a member of ''A'' to that part of the kernel to which it belongs, and
* another function, which is necessarily one-to-one, that maps the kernel into ''B''.
The first of these two factors is completely determined by the partition {{pi}} that is the kernel.  The number of one-to-one functions from {{pi}} into ''B'' is (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;|{{pi}}|&lt;/sub&gt;, where |{{pi}}| is the number of parts in the partition {{pi}}.  Thus the total number of functions from a size-''n'' set ''A'' into a size-''x'' set ''B'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_\pi (x)_{|\pi|},&lt;/math&gt;

the index {{pi}} running through the set of all partitions of ''A''.  On the other hand, the number of functions from ''A'' into ''B'' is clearly ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Therefore we have

:&lt;math&gt;x^n = \sum_\pi (x)_{|\pi|}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''X'' is a [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]] [[random variable]] with [[expected value]] 1, then we get that the ''n''th moment of this probability distribution is

:&lt;math&gt;E(X^n) = \sum_\pi E((X)_{|\pi|}).&lt;/math&gt;

But all of the [[factorial moment]]s E((''X'')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) of this probability distribution are equal to 1.  Therefore

:&lt;math&gt;E(X^n) = \sum_\pi 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and this is just the number of partitions of the set ''A''.  [[Q.E.D.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">In [[mechanical engineering]], many terms are associated into pairs called '''duals'''. A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging force (stress) and deformation (strain) in an expression.  

Here is a partial list of mechanical dualities:

* [[force]] &amp;mdash; [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]]
* [[stress (physics)|stress]]  &amp;mdash; [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] 
* [[stiffness method]] &amp;mdash; [[flexibility method]]

==Error tolerance (PAC learning)==
In [[Probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]], '''error tolerance''' refers to the ability of an [[algorithm]] to learn when the examples received have been corrupted in some way. In fact, this is a very common and important issue since in many applications it is not possible to access noise-free data. Noise can interfere with the learning process at different levels: the algorithm may receive data that have been occasionally mislabeled, or the inputs may have some false information, or the classification of the examples may have been maliciously adulterated.

==Notation and the Valiant learning model==
In the following, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be our &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional input space. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of functions that we wish to use in order to learn a &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued target function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be the distribution of the inputs over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The goal of a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is to choose the best function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that it minimizes &lt;math&gt;error(h) = P_{x \sim \mathcal{D} }( h(x) \neq f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. Let us suppose we have a function &lt;math&gt;size(f)&lt;/math&gt; that can measure the complexity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; Oracle(x)&lt;/math&gt; be an oracle that, whenever called, returns an example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and its correct label &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

When no noise corrupts the data, we can define '''learning in the Valiant setting''':&lt;ref&gt;Valiant, L. G. (August 1985). ''[http://www.ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-85-VOL1/PDF/107.pdf Learning Disjunction of Conjunctions]''. In IJCAI (pp. 560–566).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiant, Leslie G. "A theory of the learnable." Communications of the ACM 27.11 (1984): 1134–1142.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition:'''
We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Leslie Valiant|Valiant]] setting if there exists a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt; Oracle(x)&lt;/math&gt; and a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{\delta},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt; , a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; the condition &lt;math&gt;error(h) \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

In the following we will define learnability of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; when data have suffered some modification.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, P. D. (1988). ''[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-1-4613-1685-5%2F1.pdf Learning from good and bad data]''. Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, Michael. "Efficient noise-tolerant learning from statistical queries." Journal of the ACM 45.6 (1998): 983–1006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunk, Clifford A., and Michael J. Pazzani. "An investigation of noise-tolerant relational concept learning algorithms." Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Machine Learning. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification noise==
In the classification noise model&lt;ref name = "kv"&gt;Kearns, M. J., &amp; Vazirani, U. V. (1994). An introduction to computational learning theory, chapter 5. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; a '''noise rate''' &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \eta &lt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is introduced. Then, instead of &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x)&lt;/math&gt; that returns always the correct label of example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, algorithm &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can only call a faulty oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\eta)&lt;/math&gt; that will flip the label of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. As in the Valiant case, the goal of a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is to choose the best function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that it minimizes &lt;math&gt;error(h) = P_{x \sim \mathcal{D} }( h(x) \neq f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. In applications it is difficult to have access to the real value of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, but we assume we have access to its upperbound &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Angluin, D., &amp; Laird, P. (1988). ''[http://Fhomepages.math.uic.edu/~lreyzin/f14_mcs548/angluin88b.pdf Learning from noisy examples]''. Machine Learning, 2(4), 343–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that if we allow the noise rate to be &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, then learning becomes impossible in any amount of computation time, because every label conveys no information about the target function.

'''Definition:'''
We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the '''classification noise model''' if there exists a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\eta)&lt;/math&gt; and a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \eta \leq \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;0\leq \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\leq \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{1-2\eta_B}, \frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{\delta},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt; , a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  that satisfies with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; the condition &lt;math&gt;error(h) \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistical query learning==
Statistical Query Learning&lt;ref name = "kearns"&gt;Kearns, M. (1998). ''[www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/sq-journal.pdf Efficient noise-tolerant learning from statistical queries]''. Journal of the ACM, 45(6), 983–1006.&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[Active learning (machine learning)|active learning]] problem in which the learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can decide if to request information about the likelihood &lt;math&gt;P_{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; that a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; correctly labels example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and receives an answer accurate within a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, whenever the learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; calls the oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, it receives as feedback probability &lt;math&gt;Q_{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;Q_{f(x)} - \alpha \leq P_{f(x)} \leq Q_{f(x)} + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the '''statistical query learning model''' if there exists a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and polynomials &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any  &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; the following hold:
# &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; can evaluate &lt;math&gt;P_{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;q\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by &lt;math&gt;r\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; outputs a model &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;err(h)&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the confidence parameter &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; does not appear in the definition of learning. This is because the main purpose of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is to allow the learning algorithm a small probability of failure due to an unrepresentative sample. Since now &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; always guarantees to meet the approximation criterion &lt;math&gt;Q_{f(x)} - \alpha \leq P_{f(x)} \leq Q_{f(x)} + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the failure probability is no longer needed.

The statistical query model is strictly weaker than the PAC model: any efficiently SQ-learnable class is efficiently PAC learnable in the presence of classification noise, but there exist efficient PAC-learnable problems such as [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] that are not efficiently SQ-learnable.&lt;ref name = "kearns" /&gt;

==Malicious classification==
In the malicious classification model&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, M., &amp; Li, M. (1993). ''[www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/malicious.pdf Learning in the presence of malicious errors]''. SIAM Journal on Computing, 22(4), 807–837.&lt;/ref&gt; an adversary generates errors to foil the learning algorithm. This setting describes situations of [[Burst error|error burst]], which may occur when for a limited time transmission equipment malfunctions repeatedly. Formally, algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; calls an oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; that returns a correctly labeled example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; drawn, as usual, from distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; over the input space with probability &lt;math&gt;1- \beta&lt;/math&gt;, but it returns with probability &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; an example drawn from a distribution that is not related to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Moreover, this maliciously chosen example may strategically selected by an adversary who has knowledge of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, or the current progress of the learning algorithm.

'''Definition:'''
Given a bound &lt;math&gt;\beta_B&lt;  \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the malicious classification model, if there exist a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; and a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any  &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{1/2 - \beta_B},\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{\delta},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt; , a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  that satisfies with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; the condition &lt;math&gt;error(h) \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Errors in the inputs: nonuniform random attribute noise==
In the nonuniform random attribute noise&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, S. A., &amp; Robert, H. (1991). Sloan. The difficulty of random attribute noise. Technical Report WUCS 91 29, Washington University, Department of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, R. H. (1989). ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/38339/20770411.pdf?sequence=1 Computational learning theory: New models and algorithms]'' (Doctoral dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology).&lt;/ref&gt; model the algorithm is learning a [[Boolean function]], a malicious oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; may flip each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th bit of example &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; independently with probability &lt;math&gt;\nu_i \leq \nu&lt;/math&gt;.

This type of error can irreparably foil the algorithm, in fact the following theorem holds:

In the nonuniform random attribute noise setting, an algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can output a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;error(h)&lt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;\nu &lt; 2\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

'''FlowJo''' is a software package for analyzing [[flow cytometry]] data. Files produced by modern flow cytometers are written in the [http://www.isac-net.org/content/view/101/150/ Flow Cytometry Standard] format with an .fcs file extension. FlowJo will import and analyze cytometry data regardless of which FACS ('''F'''luorescence '''A'''ctivated '''C'''ell '''S'''orting) machine is used to collect the data.

==Operation==
In FlowJo, samples are organized in a "Workspace" window, which presents a hierarchical view of all the samples and their analyses (gates and statistics). Viewing an entire experiment in a Workspace permits organizing and managing complex cytometry experiments and produces detailed graphical reports. FlowJo's ability to automate repetitive operations facilitates the production of statistics tables and graphical reports when the experiment involves many samples, parameters and/or operations.

Within a workspace, samples can be grouped or sorted by various attributes such as the panel of antibodies with which they are stained, tissue type, or patient from whom they came. When an operation on a group is initiated, FlowJo can perform the same operation on every sample belonging to that group. Thus, you can apply a [[gate (cytometry)|gate]] to a sample, copy it to the group, and that gate will be automatically placed on all samples in the group.

FlowJo provides tools for the creation of:
* [[Histogram]] and other plot overlays
* [[Cell cycle]] analysis
* [[Calcium in biology|Calcium]] flux analysis
* [[Cell growth|Proliferation]] analysis
* Quantification
* Cluster identification and backgating display

==Development==
FlowJo became a commercial product in 1996. In 2002, Tree Star released a [[Windows]] version. FlowJo is currently developed by FlowJo LLC, a privately owned life sciences software company based in Ashland, Oregon. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150629006156/en/FlowJo-BD-Partner-Streamline-Flow-Cytometry-Data&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaetano Fichera''' (8 February 1922 – 1 June 1996) was an Italian [[mathematician]], working in [[mathematical analysis]], [[linear elasticity]], [[partial differential equation]]s and [[several complex variables]]. He was born in [[Acireale]], and died in [[Rome]].

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Acireale]], a town near [[Catania]] in Sicily, the elder of the four sons of Giuseppe Fichera and Marianna Abate.&lt;ref&gt;The main reference about his personal life is the book {{Harv|Colautti Fichera|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father Giuseppe was a professor of [[mathematics]] and influenced the young Gaetano starting his lifelong passion. In his young years he was a talented [[association football|football player]]. On 1 February 1943 he was in the [[Italian Army]] and during the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|events of September 1943]] he was taken prisoner by the [[Nazist]] troops, kept imprisoned in [[Teramo]] and then sent to [[Verona]]: he succeeded in escaping from there and reached the Italian region of [[Emilia-Romagna]], spending with partisans the last year of war. After the war he was first in Rome and then in [[Trieste]], where he met '''Matelda Colautti''', who become his wife in 1952.

=== Education and academic career ===
After graduating from the [[liceo classico]] in only two years, he entered the [[University of Catania]] at the age of 16, being there from 1937 to 1939 and studying under [[Pia Nalli]]. Then he went to the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|university of Rome]], where in 1941 he earned his [[laurea]] with [[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]] under the direction of [[Mauro Picone]], when he was only 19. He was immediately appointed by Picone as an assistant professor to his chair and as a researcher at the [[Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo]], becoming his pupil. After the war he went back to Rome working with [[Mauro Picone]]: in 1948 he became "Libero Docente" (free professor) of [[mathematical analysis]] and in 1949 he was appointed as full professor at the [[University of Trieste]]. As he remembers in {{Harv|Fichera|1991|p=14}}, in both cases one of the members of the judging commission was [[Renato Caccioppoli]], which become a close friend of him. From 1956 onward he was full professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] in the chair of [[mathematical analysis]] and then at the [[Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica]] in the chair of higher analysis, succeeding to [[Luigi Fantappiè]]. He retired from university teaching in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;His last lesson of the course of higher analysis was published in {{Harv|Fichera|1995a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but was professionally very active until his death in 1996: particularly, as a member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] and first director of the journal ''Rendiconti Lincei – Matematica e Applicazioni'',&lt;ref&gt;This [[scientific journal]] is the follow-up of the older and glorious ''Atti dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei – Classe di Scienze Fisiche, Matematiche, Naturali'', the official publication of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]].&lt;/ref&gt; he succeeded in reviving its reputation.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvtxt|Colautti Fichera|1997|p=14, footnote}}, and {{Harvtxt|Galletto|2007|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honours ===
He was member of several [[Academy|academies]], notably of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]], the [[Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL]] and of the [[Russian Academy of Science]].

=== Teachers ===
His lifelong friendship with his teacher [[Mauro Picone]] is remembered by him in several occasions. As recalled by {{Harvtxt|Colautti Fichera|2007|pp=13–14}}, his father Giuseppe was an assistant professor to the chair of Picone while he was teaching at the [[University of Catania]]: they become friends and their friendship lasted even when Giuseppe was forced to leave the academic career for economic reasons, being already the father of two sons, until Giuseppe's death. The young, in effect child, Gaetano, was kept by Picone in his arms. From 1939 to 1941 the young Fichera developed his research directly under the supervision of Picone: as he remembers, it was a time of intense work. But also, when he was back from the front in April 1945&lt;ref&gt;The episode is narrated in {{Harv|Colautti Fichera|2007|pp=30–31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he met Picone while he was in [[Rome|Roma]] in his way back to [[Sicily]], and his advisor was so happy to see him as a father can be seeing its living child. Another [[mathematician]] Fichera was influenced by and acknowledged as one of his teachers and inspirators was [[Pia Nalli]]: she was an outstanding [[mathematical analysis|analyst]], teaching for several years at the University of [[Catania]], being his teacher of [[mathematical analysis]] from 1937 to 1939. [[Antonio Signorini]] and [[Francesco Severi]] were two of Fichera's teachers of the Roman period: the first one introduced him and inspired his research in the field of [[linear elasticity]] while the second inspired his research in the field he taught him i.e. the [[Several complex variables|theory of analytic functions of several complex variables]]. Signorini had a strong long-time friendship with Picone: on a wall of the [[apartment building]] where they lived, in Via delle Tre Madonne, 18 in Rome, a memorial tablet which commemorates the two friends is placed, as {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1995b|p=47}} recalls. The two great mathematicians extended their friendship to the young Fichera, and as a consequence this led to the solution of the [[Signorini problem]] and the foundation of the theory of [[variational inequalities]]. Fichera's relations with Severi were not as friendly as with Signorini and Picone: nevertheless, Severi, which was one of the most influential Italian mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century, esteemed the young mathematician. During a course on the [[Several complex variables|theory of analytic functions of several complex variables]] taught at the [[Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica]] from the fall of 1956 and the beginning of the 1957, whose lectures were collected in the book {{Harv|Severi|1958}}, Severi posed the problem of generalizing his theorem on the [[Dirichlet problem]] for [[Several complex variables|holomorphic function of several variables]], as {{Harvtxt|Fichera|1957|p=707}} recalls: the result was the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1957}}, which is a masterpiece, although not generally acknowledged for various reasons described by {{Harvtxt|Range|2002|pp=6–11}}. Other scientists he had as teachers during the period 1939–1941 were [[Enrico Bompiani]], [[Leonida Tonelli]] and [[Giuseppe Armellini]]: he remembered them with great respect and admiration, even if he did not share all their opinions and ideas, as {{Harvtxt|Colautti Fichera|2007|p=16}} recalls.

=== Friends ===
A complete list of Fichera's friends includes some of the best scientists and [[mathematician]]s of the 20th century: [[Olga Oleinik]], [[Olga Ladyzhenskaya]], [[Israel Gel'fand]], [[Ivan Petrovsky]], [[Vladimir Gilelevich Maz'ya|Vladimir Maz'ya]], [[Nikoloz Muskhelishvili]], [[Ilia Vekua]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Fritz John]], [[Kurt Friedrichs]], [[Peter Lax]], [[Louis Nirenberg]], [[Ronald Rivlin]], [[Hans Lewy]], [[Clifford Truesdell]], [[Edmund Hlawka]], [[Ian Sneddon]], [[Jean Leray]], [[Alexander Weinstein]], [[Alexander Ostrowski]], [[Renato Caccioppoli]], [[Solomon Mikhlin]], [[Paul M. Naghdi|Paul Naghdi]], [[Marston Morse]] were among his friends, scientific collaborators and correspondents, just to name a few. He built up such a network of contacts being invited several times to lecture on his research by various universities and research institutions, and also participating to several [[academic conference]]s, always upon invitation. This long series of scientific journeys started in 1951, when he went to the USA together with his master and friend [[Mauro Picone]] and [[Bruno de Finetti]] in order to examine the capabilities and characteristics of the first [[electronic computer]]s and purchase one for the [[Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo]]: the machine they advised to purchase was the first computer ever working in [[Italy]]. The most complete source about his friends and collaborators is the book {{Harv|Colautti Fichera|2007}} by his wife Matelda: in those reference it is also possible to find a fairly complete description of Gaetano Fichera's scientific journeys.

The close friendship between [[Angelo Pescarini]] and Fichera has not his roots in their scientific interests: it is another war story. As {{Harvtxt|Oleinik|1997|p=12}} recalls, Gaetano, being escaped from [[Verona]] and hidden in a [[convent]] in [[Alfonsine]], tried to get in touch with the local group of partisans in order to help the people of that town who had been so helpful with him: they were informed about an assistant professor to the chair of higher analysis in Rome who was trying to reach them. Angelo, which was a student of mathematics at the [[University of Bologna]] under [[Gianfranco Cimmino]], a former pupil of [[Mauro Picone]], was charged of the task of testing the truth of Gaetano's assertions, examining him in mathematics: his question was:– "Mi sai dire una condizione sufficiente per scambiare un limite con un integrale (Can you give me a sufficient condition for interchanging limit and integration)?"–. Gaetano quickly answered:– "Non solo ti darò la condizione sufficiente, ma ti darò anche la condizione necessaria e pure per insiemi non limitati (I can give you not only a sufficient condition, but also a necessary condition, and not only for bounded domains, but also for unbounded domains)"–. In effect, Fichera proved such a theorem in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1943}}, his latest paper written in while he was in Rome before joining the army: from that moment on he often used to joke saying that good mathematicians can always have a good application, even for saving one's life.

One of his best friends and appreciated scientific collaborator was [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik]]: she cured the redaction of his last posthumous paper {{Harv|Fichera|1997}}, as {{Harvtxt|Colautti Fichera|2007|pp=202–204}} recalls. Also, she used to discuss his work with Gaetano, as he did with her: sometimes their discussion become lively, but nothing more, since they were extremely good friends and estimators of each one's work.

== Work ==

=== Research activity ===
He is the author of more than 250 papers and 18 books (monographs and course notes): his work concerns mainly the fields of [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] listed below. A common characteristic to all of his research is the use of the methods of [[functional analysis]] to prove [[existence theorem|existence]], [[uniqueness quantification|uniqueness]] and [[approximation theory|approximation theorems]] for the various problems he studied, and also a high consideration of the [[Mathematical analysis|analytic problems]] related to problems in [[applied mathematics]].

====Mathematical theory of elasticity====
His work in [[elasticity theory]] includes the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1961c}}, where Fichera proves the "[[Fichera's maximum principle]]", his work on [[variational inequality|variational inequalities]]. The work on this last topic started with the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1963}}, where he announced the existence and [[uniqueness quantification|uniqueness theorem]] for the [[Signorini problem]], and ended with the following one {{Harv|Fichera|1964a}},&lt;ref&gt;See also its English translation {{Harv|Fichera|1964b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the full proof was published: those papers are the founding works of the field of variational inequalities, as remarked by [[Stuart Antman]] in {{Harv|Antman|1983|pp=282–284}}.&lt;ref&gt;These are his only papers in the field of [[Variational inequality|variational inequalities]]: see the article "[[Signorini problem]]" for a discussion of the reasons why he left this field of research.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the [[Saint-Venant's principle]], he was able to prove it using a [[Calculus of variation|variational]] approach and a slight variation of a technique employed by [[Richard Toupin]] to study the same problem: in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1979a}}&lt;ref&gt;The same paper was previously published in Russian in a volume in honour of [[Ilia Vekua]]: see {{Harvtxt|Colautti Fichera|1997|p=29}} for the exact reference.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a complete proof of the principle under the [[hypothesis]] that the base of the [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] is a set with [[piecewise]] [[Smooth function|smooth]] [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]]. Also he is known for his researches in the theory of [[hereditary elasticity]]: the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1979b}} emphasizes the necessity of analyzing very well the [[constitutive equation]]s of materials with memory in order to introduce [[Scientific modelling|models]] where an existence '''and''' [[uniqueness quantification|uniqueness theorems]] can be proved in such a way that the proof does not rely on an implicit choice of the [[topology]] of the [[function space]] where the problem is studied. At last, it is worth to mention that Clifford Truesdell invited him to write the contributions {{Harv|Fichera|1972a}} and {{Harv|Fichera|1972b}} for [[Siegfried Flügge]]'s ''Handbuch der Physik''.

====Partial differential equations====
He was one of the pioneers in the development of the abstract approach through [[functional analysis]] in order to study general [[boundary value problem]]s for [[linear partial differential equation]]s proving in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1955a}} a theorem similar in spirit to the [[Lax–Milgram theorem]]. He studied deeply the [[Mixed boundary condition|mixed boundary value problem]] i.e. a [[boundary value problem]] where the boundary has to satisfy a [[mixed boundary condition]]: in his first paper on the topic, {{Harv|Fichera|1949}}, he proves the first existence theorem for the mixed boundary problem for [[self-adjoint operator]]s of {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2}} [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], while in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1955a|pp=22–29}} he proves the same theorem dropping the hypothesis of [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjointness]]. He is, according to {{Harvtxt|Oleinik|1997}}, the founder of the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s of [[characteristics of PDE|non-positive characteristics]]: in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1956}} he introduced the now called [[Fichera's function]], in order to identify [[subset]]s of the boundary of the [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domain]] where the [[boundary value problem]] for such kind of equations is posed, where it is necessary or not to specify the [[Boundary value problem|boundary condition]]: another account of the theory can be found in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1960}}, which is written in English and was later translated in Russian and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].&lt;ref&gt;See the bibliography {{Harv|Colautti Fichera|1997}}: some of the translated papers are available online from the [[All-Russian Mathematical Portal]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calculus of variation====
His contributions to the [[calculus of variation]] are mainly devoted to the proof of existence and [[uniqueness quantification|uniqueness theorems]] for [[maxima and minima]] of [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s of particular form, in conjunction with his studies on [[variational inequalities]] and [[linear elasticity]] in theoretical and applied problems: in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1964a}} a [[semicontinuity]] [[theorem]] for a functional introduced in the same paper is proved in order to solve the [[Signorini problem]], and this theorem was extended in {{Harv|Fichera|1964c}} to the case where the given [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] has general [[linear operator]]s as [[argument]]s, not necessarily [[partial differential operator]]s.

====Functional analysis and eigenvalue theory====
{{Main article|Fichera's existence principle}}
It is difficult to single out his contributions to functional analysis since, as stated at the beginning of this section, the methods of functional analysis are ubiquitous in his research: however, it is worth to remember paper {{Harv|Fichera|1955a}}, where an important existence theorem is proved.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[Fichera's existence principle]]: see the survey paper by {{harvtxt|Valent|1999|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions in the field of eigenvalue theory began with the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1955b}}, where he formalizes a method developed by [[Mauro Picone]] for the approximation of eigenvalues of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s subject only to the condition that their [[inverse function|inverse]] is [[compact operator|compact]]: however, as he admits in {{Harv|Fichera|1974a|pp=13–14}}, this method does not give any estimate on the approximation error on the value of the calculated (approximated) eigenvalues.

He contributed also to the classical [[eigenvalue|eigenvalue problem]] for [[symmetric operator]]s, introducing the [[method of orthogonal invariants]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Fichera|1974a|pp=33–127}}, {{Harv|Fichera|1978a}}, {{Harv|Weinberger|1999}} and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Approximation theory====
His work in this field is mainly related to the study of systems of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], possibly being particular solutions of a given [[partial differential equation]] or system of such equations, in order to prove their [[complete set|completeness]] on the boundary of a given [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domain]]. The interest of this research is obvious: given such a system of functions, every solution of a [[boundary value problem]] can be approximated by an [[infinite series]] or [[Fourier integral|Fourier type integral]] in the [[topology]] of a given [[function space]]. One of the most famous examples of this kind of theorem is [[Mergelyan's theorem]], which completely solves the problem in the class of [[holomorphic function]]s for a [[compact set]] in the [[complex plane]]. In his paper {{Harv|Fichera|1948}}, Fichera studies this problem for [[harmonic function]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See also the monograph {{Harv|Günther|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; relaxing the [[Smooth function|smoothness requirements]] on the boundary in the already cited work {{Harv|Fichera|1955a}}: a survey on his and others' work in this area, including contributions of [[Mauro Picone]], [[Bernard Malgrange]], [[Felix Browder]] and a number of other mathematicians, is contained in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1979c}}. Another branch of his studies on [[approximation theory]] is strictly tied to [[complex analysis|complex analysis in one variable]], and to the already cited [[Mergelyan's theorem]]: he studied the problem of approximating [[continuous function]]s on a [[compact set]] (and analytic on its [[Interior (topology)|interior]] if this is non void) of the [[complex plane]] by [[rational function]]s with prescribed [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]], simple or not. The paper {{Harv|Fichera|1974b}} surveys the contribution to the solution of this and related problems by [[Sergey Mergelyan]], [[Lennart Carleson]], [[Gábor Szegő]] as well as others, including his own.

====Potential theory====
His contributions to [[potential theory]] are very important. The results of his paper {{Harv|Fichera|1948}} occupy paragraph 24 of chapter II of the textbook {{Harv|Günther|1967|pp=108–117}}, as remarked by in {{Harvtxt|Oleinik|1997|p=11}}. Also, his researches {{Harv|Fichera|1975}} and {{Harv|Fichera|1976}} on the [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic behaviour]] of the [[electric field]] near [[Smooth function|singular points]] of the conducting surface, widely known among the specialists (as several works of [[Vladimir Gilelevich Maz'ya|V.G. Maz'ya]], [[S.A. Nazarov]], [[B.A. Plamenevsky]], [[B.W. Schulze]] and others testify) can be included in between his works in potential theory.

====Measure and integration theory====
His main contributions to those topics and are the papers {{Harv|Fichera|1943}} and {{Harv|Fichera|1954}}. In the first one he proves that a condition on a [[sequence]] of [[integrable function]]s previously introduced by [[Mauro Picone]] is both necessary and sufficient in order to assure that [[Limit (mathematics)|limit process]] and the [[integration (mathematics)|integration process]] commute, both in [[Bounded set|bounded and unbounded]] [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domains]]: the theorem is similar in spirit to the [[dominated convergence theorem]], which however only states a sufficient condition. The second paper contains an extension of the [[Lebesgue's decomposition theorem]] to [[Sigma additivity#Additive (or finitely additive) set functions|finitely additive]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s: this extension required him to generalize the [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]], requiring it to be a [[set function]] belonging to a given class and [[minimum|minimizing]] a particular [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]].

====Complex analysis of functions of one and several variables====
He contributed to both the classical topic of [[complex analysis]] in one variable and the more recent one of [[Several complex variables|complex analysis in several variables]]. His contributions to complex analysis in one variable are essentially [[approximation theory|approximation results]], well described in the survey paper {{Harv|Fichera|1974b}}.&lt;ref&gt;See also the "[[Gaetano Fichera#Approximation theory|Approximation theory]]" section.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of functions of several complex variables, his contributions were outstanding,{{According to whom|date=April 2011}} but also not generally acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;See the paper {{Harv|Range|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely, in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1957}} he solved the Dirichlet problem for [[Several complex variables|holomorphic function of several variables]] under the hypothesis that the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domain]] {{math|∂&amp;Omega;}} has a [[Hölder continuous]] [[normal vector]] (i.e. it belongs to the {{math|''C''{{Sup|{1,&amp;alpha;} }}}} class) and the [[Dirichlet boundary condition]] is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] belonging to the [[Sobolev space]] {{math|''H''{{sup|1/2}}(∂&amp;Omega;)}} satisfying the [[weak formulation|weak form]] of the [[tangential Cauchy–Riemann condition]],&lt;ref&gt;Introduced by him in the same paper.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Harv|Fichera|1986}}, where the theorem is presented in English and extended to the case that the normal vector and the Dirichlet boundary condition are only [[Continuous function|continuous]].&lt;/ref&gt; extending a previous result of [[Francesco Severi]]: this theorem and the [[Lewy–Kneser theorem]] on the [[Local property|local]] [[Cauchy problem]] for holomorphic functions of several variables, laid the foundations of the theory of [[CR-function]]s. Another important result is his proof in {{Harv|Fichera|1983}} of an extension of [[Morera's theorem]] to [[Several complex variables|functions of several complex variables]], under the hypothesis that the given [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''}} is only [[Locally integrable function|locally integrable]]: previous proofs under more restrictive assumptions were given by [[Francesco Severi]] in {{Harv|Severi|1931}} and [[Salomon Bochner]] in {{Harv|Bochner|1953}}. He also studied the properties of the [[real part]] and [[imaginary part]] of [[Several complex variables|functions of several complex variables]], i.e. [[pluriharmonic function]]s: starting from the paper {{Harv|Amoroso|1912}} he gives a [[Trace operator|trace condition]] analogous to the [[tangential Cauchy–Riemann condition]] for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for [[pluriharmonic function]]s in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1982a}}, and generalizes a theorem of [[Luigi Amoroso]] to the [[complex number|complex]] [[vector space]] {{math|ℂ{{sup|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;ℝ{{sup|2''n''}}}} for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2}} [[Several complex variables|complex variables]] in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1982b}}. Also he was able to prove that an [[integro-differential equation]] defined on the boundary of a [[smooth function|smooth]] [[Domain (mathematics)#Real and complex analysis|domain]] by Luigi Amoroso in his cited paper, the [[Amoroso integro-differential equation]], is a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for [[pluriharmonic function]]s when this domain is the [[sphere]] in {{math|ℂ{{sup|2}}&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;ℝ{{sup|4}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;The details can be found in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1982c}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exterior differential forms====
His contributions to the theory of [[exterior differential form]]s started as a war story:&lt;ref&gt;He tells this story in his last lesson {{Harv|Fichera|1995a|pp=18–19}}: see also {{Harv|Colautti Fichera|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; having read a famous memoir of [[Enrico Betti]] (where [[Betti number]]s were introduced) just before joining the army, he used this knowledge in order to develop a theory of [[exterior differential form]]s while he was kept prisoner in [[Teramo]] jail.&lt;ref&gt;This fact is not uncommon in talented people being kept in captivity, as the known experience of [[Jean Leray]] with [[sheaf theory]] shows.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was back in Rome in 1945, he discussed his discovery with [[Enzo Martinelli]], who very tactfully informed him that the idea was already developed by mathematicians [[Élie Cartan]] and [[Georges de Rham]]. However, he continued work on this theory, contributing with several papers, and also advised all of his students to study it, despite from the fact of being an [[Mathematical analysis|analyst]], as he remarks: his main results are collected in the papers {{Harv|Fichera|1961a}} and {{Harv|Fichera|1961b}}. In the first one he introduced {{mvar|k}}-measures, a concept less general than [[Current (mathematics)|currents]] but easier to work with: his aim was to clarify the [[Mathematical analysis|analytic structure]] of currents and to prove all relevant results of the theory i.e. the [[De Rham cohomology|three theorems of de Rham]] and [[Hodge theory|Hodge theorem on harmonic forms]] in a simpler, more analytic way. In the second one he developed an abstract [[Hodge theory]], following the [[axiomatic method]], proving an abstract form of Hodge theorem.

====Numerical analysis====
As noted in the "[[Gaetano Fichera#Functional analysis and eigenvalue theory|Functional analysis and eigenvalue theory]]" section, his main ''direct'' contribution to the field of [[numerical analysis]] is the introduction of the [[method of orthogonal invariants]] for the calculus of [[eigenvalues]] of [[symmetric operator]]s: however, as already remarked, it is hard to find something in his works which is not related to applications. His works on [[partial differential equation]]s and [[linear elasticity]] have always a constructive aim: for example, the results of paper {{Harv|Fichera|1975}}, which deals with the [[asymptotic analysis]] of the [[Potential theory|potential]], were included in the book {{Harv|Fichera|1978a}} and led to the definition of the [[Hp-FEM#Example: the Fichera problem|Fichera corner problem]] as a standard [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark problem]] for [[numerical method]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See also the recollections of Wendland in {{Harv|Wendland|2007|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of his work on quantitative problems is the interdisciplinary study {{Harv|Fichera|Sneider|Wyman|1977}}, surveyed in {{Harv|Fichera|1978b}}, where methods of [[mathematical analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]] are applied to a problem posed by [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;See also the research announcement {{Harv|Fichera|Sneider|Wyman|1977a}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that {{harvtxt|Oeinik|1993|pp=12–13}} describes it as a work in the theory of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, perhaps reflecting the difficulty of classifying such kind of research.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of mathematics====
his work in this field occupy all the volume {{Harv|Fichera|2002}}. He wrote bibliographical sketches for a number of mathematicians, both teachers, friends and collaborators, including [[Mauro Picone]], [[Luigi Fantappiè]], [[Pia Nalli]], [[Maria Adelaide Sneider]], [[Renato Caccioppoli]], [[Solomon Mikhlin]], [[Francesco Tricomi]], [[Alexander Weinstein]], [[Aldo Ghizzetti]]. His [[History of mathematics|historical]] works contain several observations against the so-called '''historical revisitation''': the meaning of this concept is clearly stated in the paper {{Harv|Fichera|1996}}. He identifies with the word '''revisitation''' the analysis of historical facts basing only on modern conceptions and points of view: this kind of analysis differs from the "true" historical one since it is heavily affected by the historian's point of view. The historian applying this kind of methodology to [[history of mathematics]], and more generally to the [[history of science]], emphasizes the sources that have led a field to its modern shape, neglecting the efforts of the pioneers.

=== Teaching activity ===
His teaching activity was almost as intense as his research activity: he also was a pioneer in encouraging gifted women to choose a career in mathematical research, as {{Harvtxt|Weinberger|1999|p=51}} recalls. An almost complete list of his doctoral students is reported below:

[[Image:Gérard Desargues.jpeg|thumb|Girard Desargues{{fact|date=November 2017}}]]

'''Girard Desargues''' ({{IPA-fr|dezaʁɡ|lang}}; 21 February 1591 &amp;ndash; September 1661) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and engineer, who is considered one of the founders of [[projective geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Swinden, B.A. "Geometry and Girard Desargues". The Mathematical Gazette. Vol. 34, No. 310 (Dec., 1950) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desargues' theorem]], the [[Desargues graph]], and the crater [[Desargues (crater)|Desargues]] on the [[Moon]] are named in his honour.
[[File:Bosse - Pratique du trait a preuves, 1643 - 1219339.jpg|thumb|''Pratique du trait a preuves'' (1643)]]

Born in [[Lyon]], Desargues came from a family devoted to service to the French crown. His father was a royal [[civil law notary|notary]], an investigating commissioner of the [[Seneschal|Seneschal's]] court in Lyon (1574), the collector of the [[tithe]]s on ecclesiastical revenues for the city of Lyon (1583) and for the [[diocese of Lyon]].

Girard Desargues worked as an [[architecture|architect]] from 1645. Prior to that, he had worked as a tutor and may have served as an engineer and technical consultant in the entourage of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]].

As an architect, Desargues planned several private and public buildings in Paris and Lyon. As an engineer, he designed a system for raising water that he installed near Paris. It was based on the use of the at the time unrecognized principle of the [[epicycloid]]al wheel.

His research on perspective and geometrical projections can be seen as a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry across the classical epoch in optics that stretched from al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]] ([[Alhazen]]) to Johannes [[Kepler]], and going beyond a mere synthesis of these traditions with Renaissance perspective theories and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=El-Bizri | first=Nader | authorlink=Nader El-Bizri | chapter=Classical Optics and the Perspectiva Traditions Leading to the Renaissance |  pages=11–30 | editor1-last=Hendrix | editor1-first=John Shannon | editor1link=John Shannon Hendrix | editor2-last=Carman | editor2-first=Charles H. | title=Renaissance Theories of Vision (Visual Culture in Early Modernity) | date=2010 | location=Farnham, Surrey | publisher=[[Ashgate]] | isbn=1-409400-24-7}}; {{cite book | last=El-Bizri | first=Nader | authorlink=Nader El-Bizri | chapter=Seeing Reality in Perspective: 'The Art of Optics' and the 'Science of Painting' | title=The Art of Science: From Perspective Drawing to Quantum Randomness | editor1-first=Rossella | editor1-last=Lupacchini | editor2-first=Annarita | editor2-last=Angelini | location=Doredrecht | publisher=Springer | date=2014 | pages=25–47}}; {{cite book | last=El-Bizri | first=Nader | authorlink=Nader El-Bizri | chapter=Desargues’ ''oeuvres'': On perspective, optics and conics | title=Visioning Technologies: The Architectures of Sight | editor-first=Graham | editor-last=Cairns | location=London | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=2016 | pages=36–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work was rediscovered and republished in 1864. A collection of his works was published in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=L'oeuvre mathématique de G. Desargues: Textes publiés et commentés avec une introd. biograph. et historique|year=1951|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|location=Paris|editor-last=Taton|editor-first=René}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1864 compilation remains in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desargues|first=Girard|title=Oeuvres de Desargues|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1108032583|editor-last=Poudra|editor-first=Noël Germinal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable work, often cited by others in mathematics, is "Rough draft for an essay on the results of taking plane sections of a cone" (1639).

Late in his life, Desargues published a paper with the cryptic title of ''DALG''. The most common theory about what this stands for is ''Des Argues, Lyonnais, Géometre'' (proposed by [[Henri Brocard]]).

He died in Lyon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">[[File:Bidiakis cube 3COL.svg|thumb|A 3-coloring of the [[bidiakis cube]], an example of a triangle-free planar graph.]]
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], '''Grötzsch's theorem''' is the statement that every [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] [[planar graph]] can be [[graph coloring|colored]] with only three colors. According to the [[four-color theorem]], every graph that can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings can have its vertices colored using at most four different colors, so that the two endpoints of every edge have different colors, but according to Grötzsch's theorem only three colors are needed for planar graphs that do not contain three mutually-adjacent vertices.

==History==
The theorem is named after German mathematician [[Herbert Grötzsch]], who published its proof in 1959.
Grötzsch's original proof was complex. {{harvtxt|Berge|1960}} attempted to simplify it but his proof was erroneous.&lt;ref name="g63"&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Carsten Thomassen&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Thomassen|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived an alternative proof from another related theorem: every planar graph with [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] at least five is [[list coloring|3-list-colorable]]. However, Grötzsch's theorem itself does not extend from coloring to list coloring: there exist triangle-free planar graphs that are not 3-list-colorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Glebov|Kostochka|Tashkinov|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Richard Steinberg and
Dan Younger&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Steinberg|Younger|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the first correct proof, in English, of the dual version of this theorem. In 2012, Nabiha Asghar&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Asghar|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a new and much simpler proof of the theorem that is inspired by Thomassen's work.

==Larger classes of graphs==
A slightly more general result is true: if a planar graph has at most three triangles then it is 3-colorable.&lt;ref name="g63"/&gt; However, the planar [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and infinitely many other planar graphs containing  ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, contain four triangles and are not 3-colorable. In 2009, [[Zdeněk Dvořák|Dvořák]], Kráľ, and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Thomas]] announced a proof of another generalization, conjectured in 1969 by L. Havel: there exists a constant ''d'' such that, if a planar graph has no two triangles within distance ''d'' of each other, then it can be [[graph coloring|colored]] with three colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = Three-coloring triangle-free graphs on surfaces V. Coloring planar graphs with distant anomalies
 | year = 2009| bibcode = 2009arXiv0911.0885D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work formed part of the basis for Dvořák's 2015 [[European Prize in Combinatorics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://eurocomb2015.b.uib.no/eurocomb/the-european-prize-in-combinatorics/|title=The European Prize in Combinatorics|work=EuroComb 2015|publisher=University of Bergen|date=September 2015|accessdate=2015-09-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem cannot be generalized to all nonplanar triangle-free graphs: not every nonplanar triangle-free graph is 3-colorable. In particular, the [[Grötzsch graph]] and the [[Chvátal graph]] are triangle-free graphs requiring four colors, and the [[Mycielskian]] is a transformation of graphs that can be used to construct triangle-free graphs that require arbitrarily high numbers of colors.

The theorem cannot be generalized to all planar ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-free graphs, either: not every planar graph that  requires 4 colors contains ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, there exists a planar graph without 4-cycles that cannot be 3-colored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Heckman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factoring through a homomorphism==
A 3-coloring of a graph ''G'' may be described by a [[graph homomorphism]] from ''G'' to a triangle ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In the language of homomorphisms, Grötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
Naserasr showed that every triangle-free planar graph also has a homomorphism to the [[Clebsch graph]], a 4-chromatic graph.
By combining these two results, it may be shown that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to a triangle-free 3-colorable graph, the [[tensor product of graphs|tensor product]] of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with the Clebsch graph.
The coloring of the graph may then be recovered by [[Function composition|composing]] this homomorphism with the homomorphism from this tensor product to its ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; factor.
However, the Clebsch graph and its tensor product with ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are both non-planar; there does not exist a triangle-free planar graph to which every other triangle-free planar graph may be mapped by a homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Naserasr|2007}}, Theorem 11; {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric representation==
A result of {{harvtxt|de Castro|Cobos|Dana|Márquez|2002}} combines Grötzsch's theorem with [[Scheinerman's conjecture]] on the representation of planar graphs as [[intersection graph]]s of [[line segment]]s. They proved that every triangle-free planar graph can be represented by a collection of line segments, with three slopes, such that two vertices of the graph are adjacent if and only if the line segments representing them cross. A 3-coloring of the graph may then be obtained by assigning two vertices the same color whenever their line segments have the same slope.

==Computational complexity==
Given a triangle-free planar graph, a 3-coloring of the graph can be found in [[linear time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dvořák|Kawarabayashi|Thomas|2009}}. For earlier work on algorithms for this problem, see {{harvtxt|Kowalik|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''hypograph''' or '''subgraph''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points lying on or below its [[graph of a function|graph]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{hyp} f = \{ (x, \mu) \, : \, x \in \mathbb{R}^n,\, \mu \in \mathbb{R},\, \mu \le f(x) \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

and the strict hypograph of the function is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{hyp}_S f = \{ (x, \mu) \, : \, x \in \mathbb{R}^n,\, \mu \in \mathbb{R},\,  \mu &lt;  f(x) \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set is empty if &lt;math&gt;f \equiv -\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The domain (rather than the co-domain) of the function is not particularly important for this definition; it can be an arbitrary set&lt;ref name="AliprantisBorder2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charalambos D. Aliprantis|author2=Kim C. Border|title=Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hIq6ExH7NoC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-32696-0|pages=8–9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the set of points on or above the function's graph is its [[Epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]].

==Properties==
A function is [[concave function|concave]] if and only if its hypograph is a [[convex set]]. The hypograph of a real [[affine function]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is a [[Half-space (geometry)|halfspace]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A function is [[Semi-continuity|upper semicontinuous]] if and only if its hypograph is [[Closed set|closed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">The '''International Symmetry Society''' ("International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry", abbreviated name '''SIS''') is a non-profit organization registered in Hungary (Budapest, Vármegye u. 7. II. 3., H-1052).
Its main objectives are: 
# to bring together artists and scientists, educators and students devoted to, or interested in, the research and understanding of the concept and application of symmetry (asymmetry, dissymmetry);
# to provide regular information to the general public about events in symmetry studies;
# to ensure a regular forum (including the organization of symposia, and the publication of a periodical) for all those interested in symmetry studies.

The topic was introduced for the first time by Russian and Polish scholars. Then in 1952, Hermann [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]] published his fascinating book ''Symmetry'',&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weyl, 1952. ''Symmetry''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-02374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later translated into 10 languages. Since then, it became an attractive subject of research in various fields. A variety of manifestations of the principle of symmetry in sculpture, painting, architecture, ornament, and design, in organic and inorganic nature has been revealed; the philosophical and mathematical significance of this principle has been studied.
During the 1980's the discussions concerning the nature of the world, whether it was essentially probabilistic or naturally geometric, revived the interest of the researchers to the topic. The intellectual atmosphere of this period facilitated the idea of establishment of a new institution devoted to the study of all forms of complexity and patterns of symmetry and orderly structures pervading science, nature and society, that ultimately led to the establishment of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry.

The Society's community comprises several branches of [[science]] and [[art]], while symmetry studies have gained the rank of an individual interdisciplinary field in the judgement of the scientific community. The Society has members in all continents, in over forty countries.

The Society was founded in 1989 following a successful international meeting in Budapest. 
It has operated continuously since its foundation, publishing printed and web journals and hosting an International Congress and Exhibition entitled '''''Symmetry: Art and Science''''' every three years:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12061">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''intersection homology''' is an analogue of [[singular homology]] especially well-suited for the study of [[Singularity theory|singular spaces]], discovered by [[Mark Goresky]] and [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|Robert MacPherson]] in the fall of 1974 and developed by them over the next few years.

Intersection cohomology was used to prove the [[Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures]] and the [[Riemann–Hilbert correspondence]]. It is closely related to [[L2 cohomology|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cohomology]].

==Goresky–MacPherson approach==
The [[homology group]]s of a compact, oriented, ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]] ''X'' have a fundamental property called [[Poincaré duality]]: there is a perfect pairing

:&lt;math&gt; H_i(X,\Q) \times H_{n-i}(X,\Q) \to H_0(X,\Q) \cong \Q.&lt;/math&gt;

Classically&amp;mdash;going back, for instance, to [[Henri Poincaré]]&amp;mdash;this duality was understood in terms of [[intersection theory]]. An element of

:&lt;math&gt;H_j(X)&lt;/math&gt;

is represented by a ''j''-dimensional cycle. If an ''i''-dimensional and an (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i'')-dimensional cycle are in [[general position]], then their intersection is a finite collection of points. Using the orientation of ''X'' one may assign to each of these points a sign; in other words intersection yields a ''0''-dimensional cycle. One may prove that the homology class of this cycle depends only on the homology classes of the original ''i''- and (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i'')-dimensional cycles; one may furthermore prove that this pairing is [[perfect pairing|perfect]].

When ''X'' has ''singularities''&amp;mdash;that is, when the space has places that do not look like &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash;these ideas break down. For example, it is no longer possible to make sense of the notion of "general position" for cycles. Goresky and MacPherson introduced a class of "allowable" cycles for which general position does make sense. They introduced an equivalence relation for allowable cycles (where only "allowable boundaries" are equivalent to zero), and called the group

:&lt;math&gt;IH_i(X)&lt;/math&gt;

of ''i''-dimensional allowable cycles modulo this equivalence relation "intersection homology". They furthermore showed that the intersection of an ''i''- and an (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i'')-dimensional allowable cycle gives an (ordinary) zero-cycle whose homology class is well-defined.

==Stratifications==
Intersection homology was originally defined on suitable spaces with a [[topologically stratified space|stratification]], though the groups often turn out to be independent of the choice of stratification. There are many different definitions of stratified spaces. A convenient one for intersection homology is an ''n'' -dimensional '''topological pseudomanifold'''. This is a (paracompact, Hausdorff) space ''X'' that has a filtration

:&lt;math&gt; \emptyset = X_{-1} \subset X_0 \subset X_1 \subset \cdots \subset X_n = X &lt;/math&gt;

of ''X'' by closed subspaces such that:

*for each ''i'' and for each point ''x'' of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, there exists a neighborhood &lt;math&gt; U \subset X &lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' in ''X'', a compact (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional stratified space ''L'', and a filtration-preserving homeomorphism &lt;math&gt; U \cong \R^i \times CL&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;CL&lt;/math&gt; is the open cone on ''L''.
*''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;
*''X'' − ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; is dense in ''X''.

If ''X'' is a topological pseudomanifold, the ''i''-dimensional '''stratum''' of ''X'' is the space ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Examples:
*If ''X'' is an ''n''-dimensional [[simplicial complex]] such that every simplex is contained in an ''n''-simplex and ''n''−1 simplex is contained in exactly two ''n''-simplexes, then the underlying space of ''X'' is a topological pseudomanifold.
*If ''X'' is any complex quasi-projective variety (possibly with singularities) then its underlying space is a topological pseudomanifold, with all strata of even dimension.

==Perversities==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Middle perversity]] --&gt;
Intersection homology groups I&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') depend on a choice of perversity ''p'', which measures how far cycles are allowed to deviate from transversality. (The origin of the name "perversity" was explained by {{harvtxt|Goresky|2010}}.)
A '''perversity''' ''p'' is a function from integers ≥2 to integers such that
*''p''(2) = 0
*''p''(''k'' + 1) − ''p''(''k'') is 0 or 1

The second condition is used to show invariance of intersection homology groups under change of stratification.

The '''complementary perversity''' ''q'' of ''p'' is the one with

:&lt;math&gt;p(k)+q(k)=k-2&lt;/math&gt;

Intersection homology groups of complementary dimension and complementary perversity are dually paired.

Examples:
*The minimal perversity has ''p''(''k'') = 0. Its complement is the maximal perversity with ''q''(''k'') = ''k'' − 2.
*The (lower) '''middle perversity''' ''m'' is defined by ''m''(''k'') = integer part of (''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)/2. Its complement is the upper middle perversity, with values the integer part of (''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2. If the perversity is not specified, then one usually means the lower middle perversity. If a space can be stratified with all strata of even dimension (for example, any complex variety) then the intersection homology groups are independent of the values of the perversity on odd integers, so the upper and lower middle perversities are equivalent.

==Singular intersection homology==
Fix a topological pseudomanifold ''X'' of dimension ''n'' with some stratification, and a perversity ''p''.

A map σ from the standard ''i''-simplex Δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''X'' (a singular simplex) is called '''allowable''' if

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^{-1} \left (X_{n-k}-X_{n-k-1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

is contained in the ''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''(''k'') skeleton of Δ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The complex ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is a subcomplex of the complex of singular chains on ''X'' that consists of all singular chains such that both the chain and its boundary are linear combinations of allowable singular simplexes. The singular intersection homology groups (with perversity ''p'')
:&lt;math&gt;I^pH_i(X)&lt;/math&gt;
are the homology groups of this complex.

If ''X'' has a triangulation compatible with the stratification, then simplicial intersection homology groups can be defined in a similar way, and are naturally isomorphic to the singular intersection homology groups.

The intersection homology groups are independent of the choice of stratification of ''X''.

If ''X'' is a topological manifold, then the intersection homology groups (for any perversity) are the same as the usual homology groups.

==Small resolutions==
A [[resolution of singularities]]
:&lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;
of a complex variety ''Y'' is called a '''small resolution''' if for every ''r'' &gt; 0, the space of points of ''Y'' where the fiber has dimension ''r'' is of codimension greater than 2''r''. Roughly speaking, this means that most fibers are small. In this case the morphism induces an isomorphism from the (intersection) homology of ''X'' to the intersection homology of ''Y'' (with the middle perversity).

There is a variety with two different small resolutions that have different ring structures on their cohomology, showing that there is in general no natural ring structure on intersection (co)homology.

==Sheaf theory==
Deligne's formula for intersection cohomology states that
:&lt;math&gt;I^pH_{n-i}(X) = I^pH^i(X) = H^{i}_c(IC_p(X))&lt;/math&gt;
where IC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is a certain complex of sheaves on ''X'' (considered as an element of the derived category, so the cohomology on the right means the [[hypercohomology]] of the complex). The complex IC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(X) is given by starting with the constant sheaf on the open set ''X''−''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''2''&lt;/sub&gt; and repeatedly extending it to larger open sets ''X''−''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and then truncating it in the derived category; more precisely it is given by Deligne's formula
:&lt;math&gt;IC_p(X) = \tau_{\le p(n)-n}Ri_{n*}\tau_{\le p(n-1)-n}Ri_{n-1*}\cdots\tau_{\le p(2)-n}Ri_{2*} \C_{X-X_{n-2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where τ&lt;sub&gt;≤''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a truncation functor in the derived category, ''i&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the inclusion of ''X''−''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''k''&lt;/sub&gt; into ''X''−''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\C_{X-X_{n-2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the constant sheaf on ''X''−''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''2''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Warning: there is more than one convention for the way that the perversity enters Deligne's construction: the numbers ''p''(''k'')−''n'' are sometimes written as ''p''(''k'').&lt;/ref&gt;

By replacing the constant sheaf on ''X''−''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt; with a local system, one can use Deligne's formula to define intersection cohomology with coefficients in a local system.

==Properties of the complex IC(''X'')==
The complex IC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') has the following properties
*On the complement of some closed set of codimension 2, we have
:&lt;math&gt;H^i(j_x^* IC_p) &lt;/math&gt; is 0 for ''i'' + ''m'' &amp;ne; 0, and for ''i'' = −''m'' the groups form the constant local system '''C'''
*&lt;math&gt;H^i(j_x^* IC_p) &lt;/math&gt; is 0 for ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0
*If ''i''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 then &lt;math&gt;H^{-i}(j_x^* IC_p) &lt;/math&gt; is zero except on a set of codimension at least ''a'' for the smallest ''a'' with ''p''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i''
*If ''i'' &gt; 0 then &lt;math&gt;H^{-i}(j_x^! IC_p) &lt;/math&gt; is zero except on a set of codimension at least ''a'' for the smallest ''a'' with ''q''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;(''i'')

As usual, ''q'' is the complementary perversity to ''p''. Moreover, the complex is uniquely characterized by these conditions, up to isomorphism in the derived category. The conditions do not depend on the choice of stratification, so this shows that intersection cohomology does not depend on the choice of stratification either.

[[Verdier duality]] takes IC&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; to IC&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; shifted by ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;dim(''X'') in the derived category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">In [[computer science]], '''Kosaraju's algorithm''' (also known as the '''Kosaraju–Sharir algorithm''') is a [[linear time]] [[algorithm]] to find the [[strongly connected component]]s of a [[directed graph]].  [[Alfred V. Aho|Aho]], [[John E. Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey D. Ullman|Ullman]] credit it to [[S. Rao Kosaraju]] and [[Micha Sharir]]—[[S. Rao Kosaraju| Kosaraju]] suggested it in 1978 but did not publish it, while [[Micha Sharir|Sharir]] independently discovered it and published it in 1981. It makes use of the fact that the [[transpose graph]] (the same graph with the direction of every edge reversed) has exactly the same strongly connected components as the original graph.

==The algorithm==
The primitive graph operations that the algorithm uses are to enumerate the vertices of the graph, to store data per vertex (if not in the graph data structure itself, then in some table that can use vertices as indices), to enumerate the out-neighbours of a vertex (traverse edges in the forward direction), and to enumerate the in-neighbours of a vertex (traverse edges in the backward direction); however the last can be done without, at the price of constructing a representation of the transpose graph during the forward traversal phase. The only additional data structure needed by the algorithm is an ordered list ''L'' of graph vertices, that will grow to contain each vertex once.

If strong components are to be represented by appointing a separate root vertex for each component, and assigning to each vertex the root vertex of its component, then Kosaraju's algorithm can be stated as follows.
# For each vertex ''u'' of the graph, mark ''u'' as unvisited. Let ''L'' be empty.
# For each vertex ''u'' of the graph do Visit(''u''), where Visit(''u'') is the recursive subroutine:
#: If ''u'' is unvisited then:
#:# Mark ''u'' as visited.
#:# For each out-neighbour ''v'' of ''u'', do Visit(''v'').
#:# Prepend ''u'' to ''L''.
#: Otherwise do nothing.
# For each element ''u'' of ''L'' in order, do Assign(''u'',''u'') where Assign(''u'',''root'') is the recursive subroutine:
#: If ''u'' has not been assigned to a component then:
#:# Assign ''u'' as belonging to the component whose root is ''root''.
#:# For each in-neighbour ''v'' of ''u'', do Assign(''v'',''root'').
#: Otherwise do nothing.
Trivial variations are to instead assign a component number to each vertex, or to construct per-component lists of the vertices that belong to it. The unvisited/visited indication may share storage location with the final assignment of root for a vertex.

The key point of the algorithm is that during the first (forward) traversal of the graph edges, vertices are prepended to the list ''L'' in [[Tree_traversal#Post-order|post-order]] relative to the search tree being explored. This means it does not matter whether a vertex ''v'' was first Visited because it appeared in the enumeration of all vertices or because it was the out-neighbour of another vertex ''u'' that got Visited; either way ''v'' will be prepended to ''L'' before ''u'' is, so if there is a forward path from ''u'' to ''v'' then ''u'' will appear before ''v'' on the final list ''L'' (unless ''u'' and ''v'' both belong to the same strong component, in which case their relative order in ''L'' is arbitrary). As given above, the algorithm for simplicity employs [[depth-first search]], but it could just as well use [[breadth-first search]] as long as the post-order property is preserved.

The algorithm can be understood as identifying the strong component of a vertex ''u'' as the set of vertices which are reachable from ''u'' both by backwards and forwards traversal. Writing &lt;math&gt;F(u)&lt;/math&gt; for the set of vertices reachable from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by forward traversal, &lt;math&gt;B(u)&lt;/math&gt; for the set of vertices reachable from &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; by backwards traversal, and &lt;math&gt;P(u)&lt;/math&gt; for the set of vertices which appear strictly before &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; on the list ''L'' after phase 2 of the algorithm, the strong component containing a vertex &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; appointed as root is
: &lt;math&gt; B(u) \cap F(u) = B(u) \setminus (B(u) \setminus F(u)) = B(u) \setminus P(u) &lt;/math&gt;.
Set intersection is computationally costly, but it is logically equivalent to a double [[set difference]], and since &lt;math&gt; B(u) \setminus F(u) \subseteq P(u) &lt;/math&gt; it becomes sufficient to test whether a newly encountered element of &lt;math&gt;B(u)&lt;/math&gt; has already been assigned to a component or not.

== Complexity ==
Provided the graph is described using an [[adjacency list]], Kosaraju's algorithm performs two complete traversals of the graph and so runs in Θ(V+E) (linear) time, which is [[asymptotically optimal]] because there is a matching lower bound (any algorithm must examine all vertices and edges). It is the conceptually simplest efficient algorithm, but is not as efficient in practice as [[Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm]] and the [[path-based strong component algorithm]], which perform only one traversal of the graph.

If the graph is represented as an [[adjacency matrix]], the algorithm requires ''Ο(V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' time.

In [[mathematics]], '''''Lehrbuch der Topologie''''' (German for "textbook of topology") is a book by [[Herbert Seifert]] and [[William Threlfall]], first published in 1934 and published in an English translation in 1980. It was one of the earliest [[textbook]]s on [[algebraic topology]], and was the standard reference on this topic for many years.

[[Albert W. Tucker]] wrote a review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tucker, A. W.|authorlink=Albert W.

In the mathematical discipline of [[graph theory]], the '''(''m'',''n'')-lollipop graph''' is a special type of [[graph (graph theory)|graph]] consisting of a [[complete graph]] (clique) on ''m'' vertices and a [[path graph]] on ''n'' vertices, connected with a [[bridge (graph theory)|bridge]].

'''Michael ("Mike") William Shields''' is a British [[computer scientist]].

==Overview==
Mike Shields has been an academic in the Department of Computing at the [[University of Surrey]] in [[Guildford]], southern [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/showstaff?M.Shields | title=Dr Mike W Shields | publisher=[[University of Surrey]] | location=UK | accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research contributions have been in [[theoretical computer science]], especially concerning [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. In particular, he has written books on [[automata theory]]&lt;ref name="mws1"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StJQAAAAMAAJ | title=An Introduction to Automata Theory | first=Michael W. | last=Shields | publisher=[[Blackwell Scientific Publications]] | year=1987 | isbn=978-0632017560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]] of [[parallel computing]].&lt;ref name="mws2"&gt;{{cite book|  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYxQAAAAMAAJ | title=Semantics of Parallelism: Non-interleaving representation of behaviour | first=Michael W. | last=Shields | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag|Springer]] | year=1997 | isbn=978-3540760597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting was held in 2006 at the [[British Computer Society]]'s offices in [[London]] to celebrate Shields' contribution to computer science (his "''innovative and elegant foundational work on models of concurrency''") on his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/computing/news/events/2006/models_of_concurrency_and_open_computing.htm | title=Models of Concurrency and Open Computing | publisher=[[University of Surrey]] |location=UK | date=24 November 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since moved to [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mike-shields/11/b51/359| title=Mike Shields | publisher=[[LinkedIn]] | accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==F. X. Reid==
'''F. X. Reid'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/fxreid | title=FXReid | publisher=LinkedIn | accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (aka '''FXR''') is a [[pen name]] that Shields has sometimes used in his more humorous writings and even within his serious work.&lt;ref name="mws1-fxr"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StJQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22F.+X.+Reid%22 | title=An Introduction to Automata Theory | first=M.

W. | last=Shields | year=1997 | pages=38, 56 ,66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid has been a long-time contributor to the [[British Computer Society]]'s [[BCS-FACS|FACS]] Specialist Group ''[[FACS FACTS]]'' newsletter in the past. For example, he has been an enthusiast for the [[COMEFROM]] statement and an expert on its semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| first=F. X. | last=Reid | title=On the Formal Semantics of the COMEFROM Statement. | work=FACS FACTS | publisher=BCS-FACS |url=http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/facts200603.pdf | volume=Issue 2006-1 | pages=18–20 |date=March 2006 | accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently reports of FXR's death in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| first=Victor | last=Zemantics | title=Obituary: F.X. Reid |work=FACS FACTS | publisher=BCS-FACS |url=http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/facts200603.pdf | volume=Issue 2006-1 | pages=12–14 |date=March 2006 | accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were untrue, and his musings continued after this time in the newsletter.

F. X. Reid's most widely known work is "''The Song of Hakawatha'',"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=F.

F. X. Reid has also been mentioned in computer science books.&lt;ref name="mws1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mws2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAEnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22F.+X.+Reid%22 | title=The Specification of Complex Systems | first1=Bernard | last1=Cohen | first2=William T. | last2=Harwood | first3=Melvyn I. | last3=Jackson | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | year=1986 | isbn=978-0201144000 | page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid has been quoted as saying ''In [[program proving]], only the presence of [[Software bug|bugs]] in one's proof is ascertainable, not their absence'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.freaknet.org/martin/tape/gos/crap/fxr | title=F.

Reid — The Movie ? | website=www.freaknet.org | publisher=FreakNet Medialab | location=Catalonia | accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to but not the same as a well-known quotation by [[E. W. Dijkstra]] about [[software testing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">'''Mitchell's embedding theorem''', also known as the '''Freyd–Mitchell theorem''' or the '''full embedding theorem''', is a result about [[abelian category|abelian categories]]; it essentially states that these categories, while rather abstractly defined, are in fact [[concrete category|concrete categories]] of [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. This allows one to use element-wise [[diagram chasing]] proofs in these categories. The theorem is named after [[Barry Mitchell (mathematician)|Barry Mitchell]] and [[Peter Freyd]].

==Details==
The precise statement is as follows: if '''A''' is a small abelian category, then there exists a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' (with&amp;nbsp;1, not necessarily commutative) and a [[full functor|full]], [[faithful functor|faithful]] and [[exact functor|exact]] [[functor]] ''F'': '''A''' → ''R''-Mod (where the latter denotes the category of all [[module (mathematics)|left ''R''-modules]]).

The functor ''F'' yields an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between '''A''' and a [[full subcategory]] of ''R''-Mod in such a way that [[kernel (category theory)|kernels]] and [[cokernel]]s computed in '''A''' correspond to the ordinary kernels and cokernels computed in ''R''-Mod. Such an equivalence is necessarily [[additive functor|additive]].
The theorem thus essentially says that the objects of '''A''' can be thought of as ''R''-modules, and the morphisms as ''R''-linear maps, with kernels, cokernels, [[exact sequence]]s and sums of morphisms being determined as in the case of modules. However, [[projective object|projective]] and [[injective object|injective]] objects in '''A''' do not necessarily correspond to projective and injective ''R''-modules.

== Sketch of the proof ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \subset \operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{A}, Ab)&lt;/math&gt; be the category of [[left exact functor]]s from the abelian category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[category of abelian groups]] &lt;math&gt;Ab&lt;/math&gt;. First we construct a [[Covariance and contravariance of functors|contravariant]] embedding &lt;math&gt;H:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;H(A) = h^A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h^A&lt;/math&gt; is the covariant hom-functor, &lt;math&gt;h^A(X)=\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{A}(A,X)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Yoneda Lemma]] states that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is fully faithful and we also get the left exactness of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; very easily because &lt;math&gt;h^A&lt;/math&gt; is already left exact. The proof of the right exactness of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is harder and can be read in Swan, ''Lecture Notes in Mathematics 76''.

After that we prove that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is an abelian category by using localization theory (also Swan). This is the hard part of the proof.

It is easy to check that the abelian category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[AB5 category|AB5]] category with a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] 
&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{A\in\mathcal{A}} h^A&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words it is a [[Grothendieck category]] and therefore has an injective cogenerator &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[endomorphism ring]] &lt;math&gt;R := \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{L}} (I,I)&lt;/math&gt; is the ring we need for the category of ''R''-modules.

By &lt;math&gt;G(B) = \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{L}} (B,I)&lt;/math&gt; we get another contravariant, exact and fully faithful embedding &lt;math&gt;G:\mathcal{L}\to R\operatorname{-Mod}.&lt;/math&gt; The composition &lt;math&gt;GH:\mathcal{A}\to R\operatorname{-Mod}&lt;/math&gt; is the desired covariant exact and fully faithful embedding.

Note that the proof of the [[Gabriel–Quillen embedding theorem]] for [[exact category|exact categories]] is almost identical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2369">In [[graph theory]], a '''moral graph''' is used to find the equivalent undirected form of a [[directed acyclic graph]]. It is a key step of the [[junction tree algorithm]], used in [[belief propagation]] on [[graphical models]].

{{multiple image|align=right
|image1=MoralGraph-DAG1.svg|caption1=A [[directed acyclic graph]]
|image2=Moralized graph1.svg|caption2=The corresponding moral graph, with newly added arcs shown in red}}
The moralized counterpart of a directed acyclic graph is formed by adding edges between all pairs of nodes that have a common child, and then making all edges in the graph undirected. Equivalently, a moral graph of a directed acyclic graph {{mvar|G}} is an undirected graph in which each node of the original {{mvar|G}} is now connected to its [[Markov blanket]]. The name stems from the fact that, in a moral graph, two nodes that have a common child are required to be ''married'' by sharing an edge.&lt;ref name="cdls"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Cowell |first1= Robert G. |last2= Dawid |first2= A.

Note that a moral graph is not necessarily [[Chordal graph|chordal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cowell|Dawid|Lauritzen|Spiegelhalter|1999}}, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moralization may also be applied to [[mixed graph]]s, called in this context "chain graphs". In a chain graph, a connected component of the undirected subgraph is called a chain. Moralization adds an undirected edge between any two vertices that both have outgoing edges to the same chain, and then forgets the orientation of the directed edges of the graph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">In [[numerical analysis]], '''mortar methods''' are [[discretization method]]s for [[partial differential equation]]s, which use separate [[finite element]] discretization on nonoverlapping subdomains.

The '''moving sofa problem''' or '''sofa problem''' is a two-dimensional idealisation of real-life furniture-moving problems and asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape of largest area ''A'' that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width.&lt;ref name="Neal Wagner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagner |first=Neal R. |title=The Sofa Problem |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=83 |issue=3 |year=1976 |pages=188–189 |doi=10.2307/2977022 |url=http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/pubs/corner/corner_final.pdf |jstor=2977022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area ''A'' thus obtained is referred to as the ''sofa constant''. The exact value of the sofa constant is an [[Unsolved problems in mathematics|open problem]].

==History==
The first formal publication was by the Austrian-Canadian mathematician [[Leo Moser]] in 1966, although there had been many informal mentions before that date.&lt;ref name="Neal Wagner"/&gt;

==Lower and upper bounds==
===Lower bounds===
[[Image:Hammersley sofa animated.gif|right|280px|thumb|The Hammersley sofa has area 2.2074 but is not the largest solution]]
[[Image:Gerver.png|right|280px|thumb|Gerver's sofa with 18 curve sections]]
Work has been done on proving that the sofa constant cannot be below or above certain values (lower bounds and upper bounds). One lower bound is &lt;math&gt;A \geq \pi/2 \approx 1.57079&lt;/math&gt;. This comes from a sofa that is a half-[[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of unit radius, which can rotate in the corner.

[[John Hammersley]] derived a lower bound of &lt;math&gt;A \geq \pi/2 + 2/\pi \approx 2.2074&lt;/math&gt; based on a shape resembling a telephone [[handset]], consisting of two quarter-disks of radius 1 on either side of a 1 by 4/π rectangle from which a half-disk of radius &lt;math&gt;2/\pi&lt;/math&gt; has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Croft |first1=Hallard T. |last2=Falconer |first2=Kenneth J. |last3=Guy |first3=Richard K. |authorlink3=Richard K. Guy |title=Unsolved Problems in Geometry |series=Problem Books in Mathematics; Unsolved Problems in Intuitive Mathematics |volume=II |editor-last=Halmos |editor-first=Paul R. |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-387-97506-1 |url=https://www.springer.com/mathematics/geometry/book/978-0-387-97506-1 |accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101427/http://mathcad.com/library/constants/sofa.htm Moving Sofa Constant] by Steven Finch at MathSoft, includes a diagram of Gerver's sofa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Gerver found a sofa described by 18 curve sections each taking a smooth analytic form. This further increased the lower bound for the sofa constant to approximately 2.2195.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerver |first=Joseph L. |title=On Moving a Sofa Around a Corner |journal=Geometriae Dedicata |issn=0046-5755 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=267–283 |year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF02414066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=MovingSofaProblem|title=Moving sofa problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A computation by Philip Gibbs produced a shape indistinguishable from that of Gerver's sofa giving a value for the area equal to eight significant figures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311900489_A_Computational_Study_of_Sofas_and_Cars Gibbs, Philip, A Computational Study of Sofas and Cars]&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidence that Gerver's sofa is indeed the best possible but it remains unproven.

===Upper bounds===
Hammersley also found an upper bound on the sofa constant, showing that it is at most &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.8284&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Neal Wagner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |title=Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into... |date=January 2004 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y. |isbn=0486431819 |url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486431819.html |accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoav Kallus and Dan Romik proved a new upper bound in June 2017, capping the sofa constant at &lt;math&gt;2.37&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallus|first=Yoav|last2=Romik|first2=Dan|date=December 2018|title=Improved upper bounds in the moving sofa problem|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000187081830416X|journal=Advances in Mathematics|volume=340|pages=960–982|arxiv=1706.06630|doi=10.1016/j.aim.2018.10.022|issn=0001-8708|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ambidextrous sofa ==
[[Image:Romik.png|right|280px|thumb|Romik's ambidextrous sofa]]
A variant of the sofa problem asks the shape of largest area that can go round both left and right 90 degree corners in a corridor of unit width. A lower bound of area approximately 1.64495521 has been described by Dan Romik. His sofa is also described by 18 curve sections.&lt;ref name="Dan Romik"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Romik |first=Dan |title=Differential equations and exact solutions in the moving sofa problem |journal=Experimental Mathematics |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=2017 |pages=?–? |doi=10.1080/10586458.2016.1270858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romik|first1=Dan|title=The moving sofa problem - Dan Romik's home page|url=https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/movingsofa/|website=UCDavis|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">In mathematics, '''Noether identities''' characterize the degeneracy of a Lagrangian system. Given a Lagrangian system and its [[Lagrangian system|Lagrangian]]&amp;nbsp;''L'', Noether identities can be defined as a [[differential operator]] whose kernel contains a range of the [[Lagrangian system|Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange operator]] of&amp;nbsp;''L''. Any  [[Lagrangian system|Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange operator]] obeys Noether identities which therefore are separated into the trivial and non-trivial ones. A [[Lagrangian system|Lagrangian]]&amp;nbsp;''L'' is called degenerate if the [[Lagrangian system|Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange operator]] of&amp;nbsp;''L'' satisfies non-trivial Noether identities. In this case [[Euler&amp;ndash;Lagrange equation]]s are not independent.

Noether identities need not be independent, but satisfy first-stage Noether identities, which are subject to the second-stage Noether identities and so on. Higher-stage Noether identities also are separated into the trivial and non-trivial once. A degenerate Lagrangian is called reducible if there exist non-trivial higher-stage Noether identities. [[Yang&amp;ndash;Mills theory|Yang&amp;ndash;Mills gauge theory]] and [[gauge gravitation theory]] exemplify irreducible Lagrangian field theories.

Different variants of [[Noether's second theorem|second Noether’s theorem]] state the one-to-one correspondence between the non-trivial reducible Noether identities and the non-trivial reducible [[gauge symmetry (mathematics)|gauge symmetries]]. Formulated in a very general setting, [[Noether's second theorem|second Noether’s theorem]] associates to the Koszul&amp;ndash;Tate complex of reducible Noether identities, parameterized by [[Batalin&amp;ndash;Vilkovisky formalism|antifields]], the BRST complex of reducible gauge symmetries parameterized by [[Faddeev&amp;ndash;Popov ghost|ghosts]]. This is the case of [[covariant classical field theory]] and Lagrangian [[BRST formalism|BRST theory]].

[[Probability theory]] and [[statistics]] have some commonly used conventions, in addition to standard [[mathematical notation]] and [[Table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]].

==Probability theory==
* [[Random variable]]s are usually written in [[upper case]] roman letters: ''X'', ''Y'', etc.
* Particular realizations of a random variable are written in corresponding [[lower case]] letters. For example, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; could be a [[random sample|sample]] corresponding to the random variable ''X''. A cumulative probability is formally written &lt;math&gt;P(X\le x) &lt;/math&gt; to differentiate the random variable from its realization.
* The probability is sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P} &lt;/math&gt; to distinguish it from other functions and measure ''P'' so as to avoid having to define " ''P'' is a probability" and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(X\in A) &lt;/math&gt; is short for &lt;math&gt;P(\{\omega \in\Omega: X(\omega) \in A\})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the event space and &lt;math&gt;X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable. &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt; notation is used alternatively.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}[A \cap B]&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability that events ''A'' and ''B'' both occur. The [[joint probability distribution]] of random variables ''X'' and ''Y'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;P(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt;, while joint probability mass function or probability density function as &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and joint cumulative distribution function as &lt;math&gt;F(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A \cup B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}[A \cup B]&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability of either event ''A'' or event ''B'' occurring ("or" in this case means [[inclusive or|one or the other or both]]).
*[[sigma-algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebras]] are usually written with uppercase [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt; for the set of sets on which we define the probability ''P'')
*[[Probability density function]]s (pdfs) and [[probability mass function]]s are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;f_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Cumulative distribution function]]s (cdfs) are denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Survival function]]s or complementary cumulative distribution functions are often denoted by placing an [[overbar]] over the symbol for the cumulative:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F}(x) =1-F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, or denoted as &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
*In particular, the pdf of the [[standard normal distribution]] is denoted  by &amp;phi;(''z''), and its cdf by &amp;Phi;(''z'').
*Some common operators: 
:* E[''X''] : [[expected value]] of ''X''
:* var[''X''] : [[variance]] of ''X''
:* cov[''X'', ''Y''] : [[covariance]] of ''X'' and ''Y''
* X is independent of Y is often written &lt;math&gt;X \perp Y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y&lt;/math&gt;, and X is independent of Y given W is often written 
:&lt;math&gt;X \perp\!\!\!\perp Y \,|\, W &lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;X \perp Y \,|\, W&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(A\mid B)&lt;/math&gt;, the ''[[conditional probability]]'', is the probability of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; ''given'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\textstyle A&lt;/math&gt; ''after'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is observed.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

==Statistics==
*Greek letters (e.g. &amp;theta;, &amp;beta;) are commonly used to denote unknown parameters (population parameters).
*A tilde (~) denotes "has the probability distribution of".
*Placing a hat, or caret,  over a true parameter denotes an [[estimator]] of it, e.g., &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[arithmetic mean]] of a series of values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is often denoted by placing an "[[overbar]]" over the symbol, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced "''x'' bar".
*Some commonly used symbols for [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] statistics are given below:
**the [[sample mean]] &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt;,
**the [[sample variance]] ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
** the [[sample standard deviation]] ''s'',
**the [[Pearson correlation coefficient|sample correlation coefficient]] ''r'',
**the sample cumulants ''k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''.
*Some commonly used symbols for [[Statistical population|population]] parameters are given below:
**the population mean ''&amp;mu;'',
**the population variance ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
** the population standard deviation ''&amp;sigma;'',
**the population [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation]] ''&amp;rho;'',
**the population [[cumulant]]s ''&amp;kappa;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*&lt;math&gt;x_{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is used for the &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[order statistic]], where &lt;math&gt;x_{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample minimum and &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample maximum from a total sample size ''n''.

==Critical values==
The &amp;alpha;-level upper [[critical value]] of a [[probability distribution]] is the value exceeded with probability &amp;alpha;, that is, the value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1 &amp;minus; &amp;alpha; where ''F'' is the cumulative distribution function. There are standard notations for the  upper critical values of some commonly used distributions in statistics:
*''z''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; or ''z''(&amp;alpha;) for the [[Standard normal distribution]]
*''t''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;&lt;/sub&gt; or ''t''(&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;) for the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]] with &amp;nu; [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]]
*&lt;math&gt;{\chi_{\alpha,\nu}}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{\chi}^{2}(\alpha,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; for the [[chi-squared distribution]] with &amp;nu; degrees of freedom
*&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha,\nu_1,\nu_2}&lt;/math&gt; or F(&amp;alpha;,&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for the [[F-distribution]] with &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;nu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom

==Linear algebra==
*[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] are usually denoted by boldface capital letters, e.g. '''A'''. 
*[[Column vector]]s are usually denoted by boldface lowercase letters, e.g. '''x'''.
*The [[transpose]] operator is denoted by either a superscript T (e.g. '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;) or a [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (e.g. '''A'''&amp;prime;).
*A [[row vector]] is written as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; or '''x'''&amp;prime;.

==Abbreviations==
Common abbreviations include:
*'''a.e.''' [[almost everywhere]]
*'''a.s.''' [[almost surely]]
* '''cdf''' [[cumulative distribution function]]
* '''cmf''' [[cumulative mass function]]
*'''df''' [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] (also &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;)
*'''i.i.d.''' [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]]
*'''pdf''' [[probability density function]]
*'''pmf''' [[probability mass function]]
* '''r.v.''' [[random variable]]
* '''w.p.''' with probability; '''wp1''' [[with probability 1]]

A '''one-dimensional symmetry group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]] that describes [[symmetry|symmetries]] in one dimension (1D). 

A pattern in 1D can be represented as a function ''f''(''x'') for, say, the color at position ''x''.

The only nontrivial point group in 1D is a simple [[Point reflection|reflection]]. It can be represented by the simplest [[Coxeter group]], A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, [ ], or [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node}}.

Affine symmetry groups represent [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]. Isometries which leave the function unchanged are [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s ''x'' + ''a'' with ''a'' such that ''f''(''x'' + ''a'') = ''f''(''x'') and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s ''a'' − ''x'' with a such that ''f''(''a'' − ''x'') = ''f''(''x''). The reflections can be represented by the [[affine Coxeter group]] [&amp;infin;], or [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node|infin|node}} representing two reflections, and the translational symmetry as [&amp;infin;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Coxeter-Dynkin diagram {{CDD|node_h2|infin|node_h2}} as the composite of two reflections.

==Point group==
For a pattern without translational symmetry there are the following possibilities (1D [[point group]]s):
* the symmetry group is the trivial group (no symmetry)
* the symmetry group is one of the groups each consisting of the identity and reflection in a point (isomorphic to ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

===Translational symmetry===
Consider all patterns in 1D which have translational [[symmetry]], i.e., functions ''f''(''x'') such that for some ''a'' &gt; 0, ''f''(''x'' + ''a'') = ''f''(''x'') for all ''x''. For these patterns, the values of ''a'' for which this property holds form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

We first consider patterns for which the group is [[Discrete group|discrete]], i.e., for which the positive values in the group have a minimum. By rescaling we make this minimum value 1.

Such patterns fall in two categories, the two 1D [[space group]]s or [[line group]]s.

In the simpler case the only isometries of '''R''' which map the pattern to itself are translations; this applies, e.g., for the pattern 
 '''− −−−  − −−−  − −−−  − −−−'''

Each isometry can be characterized by an integer, namely plus or minus the translation distance. Therefore the [[symmetry group]] is '''Z'''.

In the other case, among the isometries of '''R''' which map the pattern to itself there are also reflections; this applies, e.g., for the pattern

 '''− −−− −  − −−− −  − −−− −'''

We choose the origin for ''x'' at one of the points of reflection. Now all reflections which map the pattern to itself are of the form ''a''−''x'' where the constant "''a''" is an integer (the increments of ''a'' are 1 again, because we can combine a reflection and a translation to get another reflection, and we can combine two reflections to get a translation). Therefore all isometries can be characterized by an integer and a code, say 0 or 1, for translation or reflection.

Thus:
* &lt;math&gt;(a,0):x \mapsto x + a&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,1):x\mapsto a - x&lt;/math&gt;
The latter is a reflection with respect to the point ''a''/2 (an integer or an integer plus 1/2).

Group operations ([[function composition]], the one on the right first) are, for integers ''a'' and ''b'':
* &lt;math&gt;(a,0) \circ (b,0)=(a + b,0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,0) \circ (b,1)=(a + b,1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,1) \circ (b,0)=(a - b,1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a,1) \circ (b,1)=(a - b,0)&lt;/math&gt;
E.g., in the third case: translation by an amount ''b'' changes ''x'' into ''x'' + ''b'', reflection with respect to 0 gives−''x'' − ''b'', and a translation ''a'' gives ''a'' − ''b'' − ''x''.

This group is called the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of '''Z''',  Dih('''Z'''), and also D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[semidirect product]] of '''Z''' and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It has a [[normal subgroup]] of [[index of a subgroup|index]] 2 isomorphic to '''Z''': the translations. Also it contains an element ''f'' of order 2 such that, for all ''n'' in '''Z''',&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;: the reflection with respect to the reference point, (0,1).

The two groups are called [[Lattice (group)|lattice groups]]. The [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] is '''Z'''. As translation cell we can take the interval 0 ≤ ''x'' &lt; 1. In the first case the [[fundamental domain]] can be taken the same; topologically it is a circle (1-[[torus]]); in the second case we can take 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 0.5.

The actual [[discrete symmetry]] group of a translationally symmetric pattern can be:
* of group 1 type, for any positive value of the smallest translation distance
* of group 2 type, for any positive value of the smallest translation distance, and any positioning of the lattice of points of reflection (which is twice as dense as the translation lattice)

The set of translationally symmetric patterns can thus be classified by  actual symmetry group, while actual symmetry groups, in turn, can be classified as type 1 or type 2.

These space group types are the symmetry groups “up to conjugacy with respect to affine transformations”: the affine transformation changes the translation distance to the standard one (above: 1), and the position of one of the points of reflections, if applicable, to the origin. Thus the actual symmetry group contains elements of the form ''gag''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;= ''b'', which is a conjugate of ''a''.

===Non-discrete symmetry groups===
For a homogeneous “pattern” the symmetry group contains all translations, and reflection in all points. The symmetry group is isomorphic to Dih('''R''').

There are also less trivial patterns/functions with translational symmetry for arbitrarily small translations, e.g. the group of  translations by rational distances. Even apart from scaling and shifting, there are infinitely many cases, e.g. by considering rational numbers of which the denominators are powers of a given prime number.

The translations form a group of isometries. However, there is no pattern with this group as symmetry group.

==1D-symmetry of a function vs. 2D-symmetry of its graph==
Symmetries of a function (in the sense of this article) imply corresponding symmetries of its graph. However, 2-fold rotational symmetry of the graph does not imply any symmetry (in the sense of this article) of the function: function values (in a pattern representing colors, grey shades, etc.) are [[Level of measurement|nominal data]], i.e. grey is not between black and white, the three colors are simply all different.

Even with nominal colors there can be a special kind of symmetry, as in:
 −−−−−−− -- − −−−   − −  − 

(reflection gives the negative image). This is also not included in the classification.

==Group action==
[[Group action]]s of the symmetry group that can be considered in this connection are:
*on '''R'''
*on the set of real functions of a real variable (each representing a pattern)

This section illustrates group action concepts for these cases.

The action of ''G'' on ''X'' is called 
* ''transitive'' if for any two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists a ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''g'' · ''x'' = ''y''; for neither of the two group actions this is the case for any discrete symmetry group
* ''faithful'' (or ''effective'') if for any two different ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' such that ''g'' · ''x'' ≠ ''h'' · ''x''; for both group actions this is the case for any discrete symmetry group (because, except for the identity, symmetry groups do not contain elements that “do nothing”)
* ''free'' if for any two different ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''X'' we have ''g'' · ''x'' ≠ ''h'' · ''x''; this is the case if there are no reflections
* ''regular'' (or ''simply transitive'') if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for any two ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'' there exists precisely one ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''g'' · ''x'' = ''y''.

==Orbits and stabilizers==
Consider a group ''G'' acting on a set ''X''. The [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit]] of a point ''x'' in ''X'' is the set of elements of ''X'' to which ''x'' can be moved by the elements of ''G''. The orbit of ''x'' is denoted by ''Gx'':

:&lt;math&gt;Gx = \left\{ g\cdot x \mid g \in G \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Case that the group action is on '''R''':
*For the trivial group, all orbits contain only one element; for a group of translations, an orbit is e.g. {..,−9,1,11,21,..}, for a reflection e.g. {2,4}, and for the symmetry group with translations and reflections, e.g., {−8,−6,2,4,12,14,22,24,..} (translation distance is 10, points of reflection are ..,−7,−2,3,8,13,18,23,..). The points within an orbit are “equivalent”. If a symmetry group applies for a pattern, then within each orbit the color is the same.

Case that the group action is on patterns:
*The orbits are sets of patterns, containing translated and/or reflected versions, “equivalent patterns”. A translation of a pattern is only equivalent if the translation distance is one of those included in the symmetry group considered, and similarly for a mirror image.

The set of all orbits of ''X'' under the action of ''G'' is written as ''X''/''G''.

If ''Y'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', we write ''GY'' for the set {''g'' · ''y'' : ''y'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''Y'' and ''g''  &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''G''}. We call the subset ''Y'' ''invariant under G'' if ''GY'' = ''Y'' (which is equivalent to ''GY'' ⊆ ''Y''). In that case, ''G'' also operates on ''Y''. The subset ''Y'' is called ''fixed under G'' if ''g'' · ''y'' = ''y''for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''y'' in ''Y''. In the example of the orbit {−8,−6,2,4,12,14,22,24,..}, {−9,−8,−6,−5,1,2,4,5,11,12,14,15,21,22,24,25,..} is invariant under ''G'', but not fixed.

For every ''x'' in ''X'', we define the '''stabilizer subgroup''' of ''x'' (also called the '''isotropy group''' or '''little group''') as the set of all elements in ''G'' that fix ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;G_x = \{g \in G \mid g\cdot x = x\}.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''x'' is a reflection point, its stabilizer is the group of order two containing the identity and the reflection in''x''. In other cases the stabilizer is the trivial group.

For a fixed ''x'' in ''X'', consider the map from ''G'' to ''X'' given by ''g'' &lt;tt&gt;|-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ''g'' · ''x''. The [[image (mathematics)|image]] of this map is the orbit of ''x'' and the [[coimage]] is the set of all left [[coset]]s of ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. The standard quotient theorem of set theory then gives a natural [[bijection]] between ''G''/''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Gx''. Specifically, the bijection is given by ''hG&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;tt&gt;|-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ''h'' · ''x''. This result is known as the '''orbit-stabilizer theorem'''. If, in the example, we take ''x'' = 3, the orbit is {−7,3,13,23,..}, and the two groups are isomorphic with '''Z'''. 

If two elements ''x'' and ''y'' belong to the same orbit, then their stabilizer subgroups, ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]]. More precisely: if ''y'' = ''g'' · ''x'', then ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''gG''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. In the example this applies e.g. for 3 and 23, both reflection points. Reflection about 23 corresponds to a translation of −20, reflection about 3, and translation of 20.

The numbers in the right column are the [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]] numbers {{OEIS|A034968}}, which have the same parity as the permutation.]]
In [[mathematics]], when ''X'' is a [[finite set]] of at least two elements, the [[permutation]]s of ''X'' (i.e. the [[bijective function]]s from ''X'' to ''X'') fall into two classes of equal size: the '''even permutations''' and the '''odd permutations'''. If any [[total ordering]] of ''X'' is fixed, the '''parity''' ('''oddness''' or '''evenness''') of a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''X'' can be defined as the parity of the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversions]] for&amp;nbsp;σ, i.e., of pairs of elements {{math|1={{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}}} of ''X'' such that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x)&gt;\sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''sign''' or '''signature ''' or '''signum ''' of a permutation&amp;nbsp;σ is denoted '''sgn(σ)''' and defined as +1 if σ is even and &amp;minus;1 if σ is odd. The signature defines the '''alternating [[character (mathematics)|character]]''' of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Another notation for the sign of a permutation is given by the more general [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\sigma&lt;/math&gt;), which is defined for all maps from ''X'' to ''X'', and has value zero for [[bijection | non-bijective maps]].

The sign of a permutation can be explicitly expressed as
:{{math|1=sgn(σ) = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''N''(σ)&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;!-- do not use &lt;math&gt; here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 --&gt;
where ''N''(σ) is the number of [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]s in&amp;nbsp;σ.

Alternatively, the sign of a permutation&amp;nbsp;σ can be defined from its decomposition into the product of [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]] as
:{{math|1=sgn(σ) = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|m}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;!-- do not use &lt;math&gt; here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 --&gt;
where {{mvar|m}} is the number of transpositions in the decomposition. Although such a decomposition is not unique, the parity of the number of transpositions in all decompositions is the same, implying that the sign of a permutation is [[well-defined]].&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
Consider the permutation σ of the set {{math|{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}} which turns the initial arrangement 12345 into 34521.
It can be obtained by three transpositions: first exchange the numbers 2 and 4, then exchange 1 and 3, and finally exchange 1 and 5. This shows that the given permutation σ is odd. Following the method of the [[Permutation#Cycle_notation|cycle notation]] article, this could be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5\\
3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;2&amp;1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;3&amp;5\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}2&amp;4\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;5\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;3\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}2&amp;4\end{pmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;
There are many other ways of writing σ as a [[functional composition|composition]] of transpositions, for instance
:{{math|1=σ = (2 3) (1 2) (2 4) (3 5) (4 5)}},
but it is impossible to write it as a product of an even number of transpositions.

== Properties ==
The identity permutation is an even permutation.&lt;ref name="Jacobson" /&gt; An even permutation can be obtained as the composition of an [[even and odd numbers|even number]] and only an even number of exchanges (called [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]s) of two elements, while an odd permutation can be obtained by (only) an odd number of transpositions.

The following rules follow directly from the corresponding rules about addition of integers:&lt;ref name="Jacobson" /&gt;
* the composition of two even permutations is even
* the composition of two odd permutations is even
* the composition of an odd and an even permutation is odd
From these it follows that
* the inverse of every even permutation is even
* the inverse of every odd permutation is odd

Considering the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; of all permutations of the set {1, ..., {{mvar|n}}}, we can conclude that the map
:{{math|1=sgn: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; → {−1, 1} }}&lt;!-- do not use &lt;math&gt; here.  see https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594#c4 --&gt;
that assigns to every permutation its signature is a [[group homomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotman (1995), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=lYrsiaHSHKcC|page=9|text=sgn}} p. 9, Theorem 1.6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, we see that the even permutations form a [[subgroup]] of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Jacobson" /&gt; This is the [[alternating group]] on {{mvar|n}} letters, denoted by ''A''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Jacobson_a"&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the homomorphism sgn.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=l1TKk4InOQ4C|page=116|text=kernel of the sign homomorphism}} p. 116, definition 2.4.21]&lt;/ref&gt; The odd permutations cannot form a subgroup, since the composite of two odd permutations is even, but they form a [[coset]] of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; (in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Meijer &amp; Bauer (2004), [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ZakN8Y7dcC8C|page=72|text=these permutations do not form a subgroup since the product of two odd permutations is even}} p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 , then there are just as many even permutations in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; as there are odd ones;&lt;ref name="Jacobson_a" /&gt; consequently, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; contains [[factorial|{{mvar|n}}!]]/2 permutations. [The reason: if σ is even, then {{math|(1 2) σ}} is odd; if σ is odd, then {{math|(1 2) σ}} is even; the two maps are inverse to each other.]&lt;ref name="Jacobson_a" /&gt;

A [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] is even if and only if its length is odd. This follows from formulas like
:&lt;math&gt;(abcde)=(de)(ce)(be)(ae)\text{ or }(ab)(bc)(cd)(de).&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, in order to determine whether a given permutation is even or odd, one writes the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles. The permutation is odd if and only if this factorization contains an odd number of even-length cycles.

Another method for determining whether a given permutation is even or odd is to construct the corresponding [[permutation matrix]] and compute its determinant. The value of the determinant is the same as the parity of the permutation.

Every permutation of odd [[order (group theory)|order]] must be even.  The permutation (12)(34) in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; shows that the converse is not true in general.

== Equivalence of the two definitions ==

=== Proof 1 ===

Every permutation can be produced by a sequence of [[Transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]] (2-element exchanges): with the first transposition we put the first element of the permutation in its proper place, the second transposition puts the second element right etc. Since we cannot be left with just a single element in an incorrect position, we must achieve the permutation with our last transposition. Given a permutation&amp;nbsp;σ, we can write it as a product of transpositions in many different ways. We want to show that either all of those decompositions have an even number of transpositions, or all have an odd number.

Suppose we have two such decompositions:  
:''&amp;sigma;'' = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;
:''&amp;sigma;'' = ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;.
We want to show that ''k'' and ''m'' are either both even, or both odd.

Every transposition can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions of adjacent elements, e.g.
:(2 5) = (2 3) (3 4) (4 5) (4 3) (3 2).

To see this, note that if we have the transposition (''i''&amp;nbsp;''j'') on an ''n''-element set {1,...,''i'',...,''j'',...,''n''}, one way to decompose it is as [(''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;j)(''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;(''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)][(''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;''i'')(''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;(''j''&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)]. The right block of transpositions first frees up the ''j'' space by moving ''j'' over to the ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 space; then, ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 goes into the ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 space with ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 in the ''j'' space, ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 goes into the ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3 space with ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3 in the ''j'' space, etc., until ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ends up in the ''i'' space and ''i'' in the ''j'' space. Thus, each element from ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to ''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is in a space one to the left from where it ought to be. In the left block, each of those elements is restored one at a time to its original space, after resting in the ''i'' space for the duration of one permutation. ''j'' ends up in the ''i'' space, and ''i'' in the ''j'' space, with nothing else altered, as desired. The number of transpositions is (''j''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(j&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1), which is clearly odd.

If we decompose in this way each of the transpositions ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; above
into an odd number of adjacent transpositions, we get the new decompositions:
:''&amp;sigma;'' = ''T''*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''T''*&lt;sub&gt;''k''′&lt;/sub&gt;
:''&amp;sigma;'' = ''Q''*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''Q''*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''Q''*&lt;sub&gt;''m''′&lt;/sub&gt;
where all of the ''T*''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''T*&lt;sub&gt;k′&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''Q*''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''Q*&lt;sub&gt;m′&lt;/sub&gt;'' are adjacent, ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''′ is even, and ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m''′ is even.

Now compose the inverse of T*&lt;sub&gt;k′&lt;/sub&gt; (which happens to be the same permutation) with σ. ''T*''&lt;sub&gt;k'&lt;/sub&gt; is the transposition (''i'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) of two adjacent numbers, so, compared to σ, the new permutation σ (''i'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) will have exactly one inversion pair less (in case (''i'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) was an inversion pair for σ) or more (in case (''i'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) was not an inversion pair). Then apply the inverses of ''T*''&lt;sub&gt;''k''′−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T*''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;prime;−2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the same way, "unraveling" the permutation&amp;nbsp;''σ''. At the end we get the identity permutation, whose ''N'' (see above) is zero. This means that the original ''N''(''σ'') less ''k''' is even and also ''N''(''σ'') less ''k'' is even (addition modulo two is independent of sign).

We can do the same thing with the other decomposition, ''Q*''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&amp;prime;&lt;/sub&gt;...''Q''*&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and it will turn out that the original ''N''(''σ'') less ''m'' is even.

Therefore, ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' is even, as we wanted to show.

We can thus define the parity of ''σ'' to be that of its number of constituent transpositions, because we see that this can have only one value. And this must agree with the parity of the number of inversions under any ordering, as seen above, so the definitions are indeed well-defined and equivalent.

=== Proof 2 ===

An alternative proof uses the [[polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\prod_{i&lt;j} (x_i - x_j)&lt;/math&gt;

So for instance in the case {{mvar|n}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, we have

:&lt;math&gt;P(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_3)(x_1 - x_3)&lt;/math&gt;

Now for a given permutation&amp;nbsp;σ of the numbers {1, ..., {{mvar|n}}}, we define

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)=\frac{P(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(n)})}{P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(x_{\sigma(1)},\dots,x_{\sigma(n)})&lt;/math&gt; has the same factors as &lt;math&gt;P(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; except for their signs, if follows that sgn(σ) is either +1 or &amp;minus;1. Furthermore, if σ and τ are two permutations, we see that

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma\tau) &amp; = \frac{P(x_{\sigma(\tau(1))},\ldots,x_{\sigma(\tau(n))})}{P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)} \\[4pt]
&amp; = \frac{P(x_{\tau(1)},\ldots,x_{\tau(n)})}{P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)} \cdot \frac{P(x_{\sigma(\tau(1))},\ldots, x_{\sigma(\tau(n))})}{P(x_{\tau(1)},\ldots,x_{\tau(n)})} \\[4pt]
&amp; = \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\cdot\operatorname{sgn}(\tau)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since with this definition it is furthermore clear that any transposition of two elements has signature &amp;minus;1, we do indeed recover the signature as defined earlier.

=== Proof 3 ===

A third approach uses the [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of the group ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in terms of generators &lt;math&gt;\tau_1,\dots,\tau_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and relations
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_i^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; for all ''i''
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_i^{}\tau_{i+1}\tau_i = \tau_{i+1}\tau_i\tau_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for all ''i'' &lt; ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_i^{}\tau_j = \tau_j\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; if |''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''j''| ≥ 2.
[Here the generator &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the transposition (''i'', ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).] All relations keep the length of a word the same or change it by two. Starting with an even-length word will thus always result in an even-length word after using the relations, and similarly for odd-length words. It is therefore unambiguous to call the elements of ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' represented by even-length words "even", and the elements represented by odd-length words "odd".

=== Proof 4 ===

Recall that a pair &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(x) &gt; \sigma(y)&lt;/math&gt; is called an inverse. We want to show that the count of inverses has the same parity as the count of 2-element swaps. To do that, we can show that every swap changes the parity of the count of inverses, no matter which two elements are being swapped and what permutation has already been applied. 
Suppose we want to swap the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th and the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th element. Clearly, inverses formed by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; with an element outside of &lt;math&gt;[i, j]&lt;/math&gt; will not be affected. 
For the &lt;math&gt;n = j - i - 1&lt;/math&gt;elements within &lt;math&gt;(i, j)&lt;/math&gt;, assume &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; of them form inverses with &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; of them form inverses with &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; are swapped, those &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; inverses with &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; are gone, but &lt;math&gt;n - v_i&lt;/math&gt; inverses are formed. The count of inverses &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; gained is thus &lt;math&gt;n - 2v_i&lt;/math&gt;, which has the same parity as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. 
Similarly, the count of inverses &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; gained also has the same parity as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the count of inverses gained by both combined has the same parity as &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Now if we count the inverse gained (or lost) by swapping the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th and the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th element, we can see that this swap changes the parity of the count of inverses. 
Note that initially when no swap is applied, the count of inverses is 0. Now we obtain equivalence of the two definitions of parity of a permutation.

== Other definitions and proofs ==
The parity of a permutation of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points is also encoded in its [[cyclic permutation|cycle structure]].

Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma=(i_1 i_2 \dots i_{r+1})(j_1 j_2 \dots j_{s+1}) \dots (\ell_1 \ell_2 \dots \ell_{u+1})&lt;/math&gt; be the unique [[cycle notation|decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; into disjoint cycles]], which can be composed in any order because they commute. A cycle &lt;math&gt;(abc \dots xyz)&lt;/math&gt; involving &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; points can always be obtained by composing &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; transpositions (2-cycles):

:&lt;math&gt;(abc \dots xyz)=(ab)(bc) \dots (xy)(yz),&lt;/math&gt;

so call &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the ''size'' of the cycle, and observe that, under this definition, transpositions are cycles of size 1. From a decomposition into &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; disjoint cycles we can obtain a decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;  k_1 + k_2 + \dots + k_m &lt;/math&gt; transpositions, where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the {{mvar|i}}th cycle. The number &lt;math&gt;N(\sigma)=k_1+k_2+\dots+k_m&lt;/math&gt; is called the discriminant of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and can also be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;n \text{ minus the number of disjoint cycles in the decomposition of } \sigma&lt;/math&gt;

if we take care to include the fixed points of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as 1-cycles.

Suppose a transposition &lt;math&gt;(ab)&lt;/math&gt; is applied after a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are in different cycles of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;(ab)(a c_1 c_2 \dots c_r)(b d_1 d_2 \dots d_s) = (a c_1 c_2 \dots c_r b d_1 d_2 \dots d_s)&lt;/math&gt;,

and if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are in the same cycle of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;(ab)(a c_1 c_2 \dots c_r b d_1 d_2 \dots d_s) = (a c_1 c_2 \dots c_r)(b d_1 d_2 \dots d_s)&lt;/math&gt;.

In either case, it can be seen that &lt;math&gt;N((ab)\sigma) = N(\sigma) \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;, so the parity of &lt;math&gt;N((ab)\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; will be different from the parity of &lt;math&gt;N(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\sigma = t_1 t_2 \dots t_r &lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary decomposition of a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; into transpositions, by applying the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; transpositions &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; after &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; after ... after &lt;math&gt;t_r&lt;/math&gt; after the identity (whose &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is zero) observe that &lt;math&gt;N(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; have the same parity. By defining the parity of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the parity of &lt;math&gt;N(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, a permutation that has an even length decomposition is an even permutation and a permutation that has one odd length decomposition is an odd permutation.

Remarks:
* A careful examination of the above argument shows that &lt;math&gt;r\geq N(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, and since any decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; into cycles whose sizes sum to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a composition of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; transpositions, the number &lt;math&gt;N(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum possible sum of the sizes of the cycles in a decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, including the cases in which all cycles are transpositions.
* This proof does not introduce a (possibly arbitrary) order into the set of points on which &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; acts.

== Generalizations ==
Parity can be generalized to [[Coxeter group]]s: one defines a [[length function]] &lt;math&gt;\ell(v),&lt;/math&gt; which depends on a choice of generators (for the symmetric group, [[adjacent transposition]]s), and then the function &lt;math&gt;v \mapsto (-1)^{\ell(v)}&lt;/math&gt; gives a generalized sign map.

In [[mathematics]], a '''partition of a set''' is a grouping of the set's elements into non-empty [[subset]]s, in such a way that every element is [[Collectively exhaustive events|included in one]] and [[Mutually exclusive events|only one]] of the subsets.

Every [[equivalence relation]] on a set defines a partition of this set, and every partition defines an equivalence relation. A set equipped with an equivalence relation or a partition is sometimes called a [[setoid]], typically in [[type theory]] and [[proof theory]].

== Definition ==
A partition of a set ''X'' is a set of [[nonempty]] [[subset]]s of ''X'' such that every element ''x'' in ''X'' is in exactly one of these subsets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Halmos|first=Paul|title=Naive Set Theory R.|publisher=Springer|year=1960|isbn=9780387900926|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6cZBQ9qtgoC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., ''X'' is a [[disjoint union]] of the subsets).

Equivalently, a [[family of sets]] ''P'' is a partition of ''X'' if and only if all of the following conditions hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=John F.|title=Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=9780912675732|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jklsb5JUgoQC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The family ''P'' does not contain the empty set (that is &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \notin P&lt;/math&gt;).
*The [[union (set theory)|union]] of the sets in ''P'' is equal to ''X'' (that is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcup_{A\in P} A = X&lt;/math&gt;). The sets in ''P'' are said to '''cover''' ''X''.
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two distinct sets in ''P'' is empty (that is &lt;math&gt;(\forall A,B \in P)\; A\neq B \implies A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;). The elements of ''P'' are said to be [[pairwise disjoint]].

The sets in ''P'' are called the ''blocks'', ''parts'' or ''cells'' of the partition.{{sfn|Brualdi|2004|pp=44–45}}

The '''rank''' of ''P'' is |''X''| &amp;minus; |''P''|, if ''X'' is finite.

== Examples ==
*The [[empty set]] &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one partition, namely &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
*For any nonempty set ''X'', ''P'' = {''X''} is a partition of ''X'', called the '''trivial partition'''.
**Particularly, every [[singleton set]] {''x''} has exactly one partition, namely { {''x''} }.
*For any non-empty [[proper subset]] ''A'' of a set ''U'', the set ''A'' together with its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] form a partition of ''U'', namely, {''A'', ''U'' \ ''A''}.
*The set { 1, 2, 3 } has these five partitions (one partition per item):
** { {1}, {2}, {3} }, sometimes written 1|2|3.
** { {1, 2}, {3} }, or 12|3.
** { {1, 3}, {2} }, or 13|2.
** { {1}, {2, 3} }, or 1|23.
** { {1, 2, 3} }, or 123 (in contexts where there will be no confusion with the number).
*The following are not partitions of { 1, 2, 3 }:
** { {}, {1, 3}, {2} } is not a partition (of any set) because one of its elements is the [[empty set]].
** { {1, 2}, {2, 3} } is not a partition (of any set) because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
** { {1}, {2} } is not a partition of {1, 2, 3} because none of its blocks contains 3; however, it is a partition of {1, 2}.

== Partitions and equivalence relations ==
For any [[equivalence relation]] on a set ''X'', the set of its [[equivalence class]]es is a partition of ''X''. Conversely, from any partition ''P'' of ''X'', we can define an equivalence relation on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|''x'' ~ ''y''}} precisely when ''x'' and ''y'' are in the same part in ''P''. Thus the notions of equivalence relation and partition are essentially equivalent.{{sfn|Schechter|1997|p=54}}

The [[axiom of choice]] guarantees for any partition of a set ''X'' the existence of a subset of ''X'' containing exactly one element from each part of the partition. This implies that given an equivalence relation on a set one can select a canonical representative element from every equivalence class.

== Refinement of partitions ==
[[File:Set partitions 4; Hasse; circles.svg|thumb|left|300px|Partitions of a 4-set ordered by [[Partition refinement|refinement]]]]
A partition ''α'' of a set ''X'' is a '''refinement''' of a partition ''ρ'' of ''X''—and we say that ''α'' is ''finer'' than ''ρ'' and that ''ρ'' is ''coarser'' than ''α''—if every element of ''α'' is a subset of some element of ''ρ''. Informally, this means that ''α'' is a further fragmentation of ''ρ''.  In that case, it is written that ''α'' ≤ ''ρ''.

This ''finer-than'' relation on the set of partitions of ''X'' is a [[partially ordered set|partial order]] (so the notation "≤" is appropriate). Each set of elements has a [[least upper bound]] and a [[greatest lower bound]], so that it forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], and more specifically (for partitions of a finite set) it is a [[geometric lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lattice Theory|volume=25|series=Colloquium Publications|publisher=American Mathematical Society|first=Garrett|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff|edition=3rd|year=1995|isbn=9780821810255|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y8d-MdtVwkC&amp;pg=PA95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''partition lattice'' of a 4-element set has 15 elements and is depicted in the [[Hasse diagram]] on the left.

Based on the [[cryptomorphism]] between geometric lattices and [[matroid]]s, this lattice of partitions of a finite set corresponds to a matroid in which the base set of the matroid consists of the [[Atom (order theory)|atoms]] of the lattice, namely, the partitions with &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt; singleton sets and one two-element set. These atomic partitions correspond one-for-one with the edges of a [[complete graph]]. The [[Matroid#Closure operators|matroid closure]] of a set of atomic partitions is the finest common coarsening of them all; in graph-theoretic terms, it is the partition of the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the complete graph into the [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the subgraph formed by the given set of edges. In this way, the lattice of partitions corresponds to the lattice of flats of the [[graphic matroid]] of the complete graph.

Another example illustrates the refining of partitions from the perspective of equivalence relations. If ''D'' is the set of cards in a standard 52-card deck, the ''same-color-as'' relation on ''D'' – which can be denoted ~&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; – has two equivalence classes: the sets {red cards} and {black cards}.  The 2-part partition corresponding to ~&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; has a refinement that yields the ''same-suit-as'' relation ~&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the four equivalence classes {spades}, {diamonds}, {hearts}, and {clubs}.

==Noncrossing partitions==
A partition of the set ''N'' = {1, 2, ..., ''n''} with corresponding equivalence relation ~ is '''[[noncrossing partition|noncrossing]]''' if it has the following property: If four elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' of ''N'' having ''a'' &lt; ''b'' &lt; ''c'' &lt; ''d'' satisfy ''a'' ~ ''c'' and ''b'' ~ ''d'', then ''a'' ~ ''b'' ~ ''c'' ~ ''d''. The name comes from the following equivalent definition: Imagine the elements 1, 2, ..., ''n'' of ''N'' drawn as the ''n'' vertices of a regular ''n''-gon (in counterclockwise order). A partition can then be visualized by drawing each block as a polygon (whose vertices are the elements of the block). The partition is then noncrossing if and only if these polygons do not intersect.

The lattice of noncrossing partitions of a finite set has recently taken on importance because of its role in [[free probability]] theory.  These form a subset of the lattice of all partitions, but not a sublattice, since the join operations of the two lattices do not agree.

== Counting partitions ==
The total number of partitions of an ''n''-element set is the [[Bell numbers|Bell number]] ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first several Bell numbers are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1,
''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 5, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 15, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 52, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 203 {{OEIS|A000110}}. Bell numbers satisfy the [[recursion]]

: &lt;math&gt;B_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} B_k&lt;/math&gt;

and have the [[generating function|exponential generating function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{B_n}{n!}z^n=e^{e^z-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:BellNumberAnimated.gif|right|thumb|Construction of the [[Bell triangle]]]]
The Bell numbers may also be computed using the [[Bell triangle]]
in which the first value in each row is copied from the end of the previous row, and subsequent values are computed by adding two numbers, the number to the left and the number to the above left of the position. The Bell numbers are repeated along both sides of this triangle. The numbers within the triangle count partitions in which a given element is the largest [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]].

The number of partitions of an ''n''-element set into exactly ''k'' nonempty parts is the [[Stirling number of the second kind]] ''S''(''n'', ''k'').

The number of [[noncrossing partition]]s of an ''n''-element set is the [[Catalan number]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_n={1 \over n+1}{2n \choose n}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Paul Appell''' (27 September 1855 in [[Strasbourg]] – 24 October 1930 in [[Paris]]), also known as '''Paul Émile Appel''', was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] and [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[University of Paris]].  The concept of [[Appell sequence|Appell polynomials]] is named after him, as is rue Paul Appell in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]] and the minor planet [[988 Appella]].

==Life==
Paul Appell entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1873. 
He was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1892.

In 1895, he became a Professor at the [[École Centrale Paris]]. Between 1903 and 1920 he was [[dean (education)|Dean]] of the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris, then Rector of the University of Paris from 1920 to 1925.

Appell was the President of the [[Société astronomique de France|Société astronomique de France (SAF)]], the French astronomical society, from 1919-1921.&lt;ref name=BSAF1937&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96721072/f536.item''Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France'', November 1937, plates X-IX]&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter Marguerite Appell (1883–1969), who married the mathematician [[Émile Borel]], is known as a novelist under her pen-name [[Camille Marbo]].

Appell was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;MAUGIN, GRARD A. CONTINUUM MECHANICS THROUGH THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES: historical perspectives ... from john bernoulli to ernst hellinger. Place of publication not identified: SPRINGER, 2016. Print. ""he was an atheist"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
He  worked first on [[projective geometry]] in the line of [[Michel Chasles|Chasles]], then on [[algebraic function]]s, [[differential equation]]s, and [[complex analysis]]. Appell was the editor of the collected works of [[Henri Poincaré]]. Jules Drach was co-editor of the first volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Birkhoff, G. D.|authorlink=George David Birkhoff|title=The Work of Poincaré on Differential Equations|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1934|volume=40|issue=5|pages=363–366|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1934-40-05/S0002-9904-1934-05835-X/S0002-9904-1934-05835-X.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1934-05835-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appell series===
He introduced a set of four hypergeometric series ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of two variables, now called [[Appell series]], that generalize [[Gauss]]'s [[hypergeometric series]].

He established the set of [[partial differential equations]] of which these functions  are solutions, and found formulas and expressions of these series in terms of [[hypergeometric series]] of one variable. In 1926, with Professor [[Joseph Kampé de Fériet|Joseph-Marie Kampé de Fériet]], he authored a treatise on generalized hypergeometric series.

===Mechanics===
In mechanics, he proposed an alternative formulation of analytical mechanics known as 
[[Appell's equation of motion]].

He discovered a physical interpretation of the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] [[periodic function|period]] of the [[doubly periodic function]] whose restriction to [[real number|real]] arguments describes the motion of an ideal [[pendulum (mathematics)|pendulum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">In [[general relativity]], the '''peeling theorem''' describes the asymptotic behavior of the [[Weyl tensor]] as one goes to [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/null_infinity null infinity]. Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a [[null geodesic]] in a [[spacetime]] &lt;math&gt;(M, g_{ab})&lt;/math&gt; from a point p to null infinity, with [[affine parameter]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
A '''point source''' is a single identifiable ''localised'' source of something. A point source has negligible extent, distinguishing it from other source geometries. Sources are called point sources because in mathematical modeling, these sources can usually be approximated as a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]] to simplify analysis.

The actual source need not be physically small, if its size is negligible relative to other length scales in the problem. For example, in [[astronomy]], [[star]]s are routinely treated as point sources, even though they are in actuality much larger than the [[Earth]].

In [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], the density of something leaving a point source decreases in proportion to the [[inverse square]] of the [[distance]] from the source, if the distribution is [[isotropic]], and there is no [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or other loss.

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, a '''point source''' is a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] from which [[flux]] or flow is emanating. Although singularities such as this do not exist in the observable universe, &lt;!--NB black holes are not in the observable universe as they have an event horizon --&gt; mathematical point sources are often used as approximations to reality in [[physics]] and other fields.

==Light==
Generally, a [[light source|source of light]] can be considered a point source if the resolution of the imaging instrument is too low to resolve the source's apparent size.
There are two types and sources of light. A point source, and an extended source.

Mathematically an object may be considered a point source if its angular size, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, is much smaller than the resolving power of the telescope:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;&lt; \lambda / D&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of light and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the telescope diameter.

Examples:
* Light from a distant star seen through a small telescope
* Light passing through a [[pinhole]] or other small [[aperture]], viewed from a distance much greater than the size of the hole
* Light from a [[street light]] in a large-scale study of [[light pollution]] or street [[Lighting|illumination]]

==Electromagnetic radiation==
[[Radio wave]] sources which are smaller than one radio [[wavelength]] are also generally treated as point sources. Radio emissions generated by a fixed electrical circuit are usually [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]], producing [[anisotropic]] radiation. If the propagating medium is lossless, however, the radiant power in the radio waves at a given distance will still vary as the inverse square of the distance if the angle remains constant to the source polarization.

[[Gamma ray]] and [[X-ray]] sources may be treated as a point source if sufficiently small. [[Radiological contamination]] and nuclear sources are often point sources. This has significance in [[health physics]] and [[radiation protection]].

Examples:
*[[Antenna (radio)|Radio antennas]] are often smaller than one wavelength, even though they are many metres across
*[[Pulsars]] are treated as point sources when observed using [[radio telescopes]]
*In nuclear physics, a "hot spot" is a point source of [[radiation]]

==Sound==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
[[Sound]] is an oscillating [[pressure]] wave. As the pressure oscillates up and down, an audio point source acts in turn as a fluid point source and then a fluid point sink. (Such an object does not exist physically, but is often a good simplified model for calculations.)

Examples:
* [[Seismology|Seismic vibration]] from a localised seismic experiment searching for oil
* [[Noise pollution]] from a [[jet engine]] in a large-scale study of noise pollution
* A [[loudspeaker]] may be considered as a point source in a study of the [[acoustics]] of [[airport]] announcements

==Ionizing radiation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Geiger counter in use.jpg|thumb|[[Geiger-Müller counter]] with dual counts/dose rate display measuring a "point source".]]

Point sources are used as a means of calibrating ionizing radiation instruments. They are usually a sealed capsule and are most commonly used for gamma, x-ray and beta measuring instruments.

==Heat==
[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mushroom cloud]] as an example of a thermal plume. A nuclear explosion can be treated as a thermal point source in large-scale atmospheric simulations.]]
In [[vacuum]], heat escapes as [[radiation]] isotropically. If the source remains stationary in a [[compressible fluid]] such as [[air]], flow patterns can form around the source due to [[convection]], leading to an [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] pattern of heat loss. The most common form of anisotropy is the formation of a thermal [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] above the heat source.
Examples:
*Geological hotspots on the surface of the Earth which lie at the tops of thermal plumes rising from deep inside the Earth
*Plumes of heat studied in [[thermal pollution]] tracking.

==Fluid==
Fluid point sources are commonly used in [[fluid dynamics]] and [[aerodynamics]]. A point source of fluid is the inverse of a fluid point sink (a point where fluid is removed). Whereas fluid sinks exhibit complex rapidly changing behaviour such as is seen in [[vortex|vortices]] (for example water running into a plug-hole or [[tornado]]es generated at points where air is rising), fluid sources generally produce simple flow patterns, with stationary isotropic point sources generating an expanding sphere of new fluid. If the fluid is moving (such as wind in air or currents in water) a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] is generated from the point source.

Examples:
* [[Air pollution]] from a [[power plant]] [[flue gas stack]] in a large scale analysis of air pollution
* [[Water pollution]] from an [[oil refinery]] [[wastewater]] discharge outlet in a large scale analysis of water pollution
* Gas escaping from a pressurised pipe in a laboratory
* Smoke is often released from point sources in a [[wind tunnel]] in order to create a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] of smoke which highlights the flow of the wind over an object
* Smoke from a localised chemical fire can be blown in the wind to form a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] of pollution

==Pollution==
{{main article|Point source pollution}}
Sources of various types of pollution are often considered as point sources in large-scale studies of pollution.&lt;ref name=noaa_point&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories of Pollution: Point Source|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/pollution/03pointsource.html|website=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{stack|{{Binary relations}}}}

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''preorder''' or '''quasiorder''' is a [[binary relation]] that is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]]. Preorders are more general than [[equivalence relation]]s and (non-strict) [[partial order]]s, both of which are special cases of a preorder. An [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] preorder is a partial order, and a  [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] preorder is an [[equivalence relation]].

The name 'preorder' comes from the idea that preorders (that are not partial orders) are 'almost' (partial) orders, but not quite; they are neither necessarily anti-symmetric nor [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]].  Because a preorder is a binary relation, the symbol ≤ can be used as the notational device for the relation.  However, because they are not necessarily anti-symmetric, some of the ordinary intuition associated to the symbol ≤ may not apply.  On the other hand, a preorder can be used, in a straightforward fashion, to define a partial order and an equivalence relation.  Doing so, however, is not always useful or worthwhile, depending on the problem domain being studied.

In words, when ''a'' ≤ ''b'', one may say that ''b'' ''covers'' ''a'' or that ''a'' ''precedes'' ''b'', or that ''b'' ''reduces'' to ''a''.  Occasionally, the notation ← or &lt;math&gt;\lesssim &lt;/math&gt; is used instead of ≤.

To every preorder, there corresponds a [[directed graph]], with elements of the set corresponding to vertices, and the order relation between pairs of elements corresponding to the directed edges between vertices. The converse is not true: most directed graphs are neither reflexive nor transitive. In general, the corresponding graphs may contain [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].  A preorder that is antisymmetric no longer has cycles; it is a partial order, and corresponds to a [[directed acyclic graph]].  A preorder that is symmetric is an equivalence relation; it can be thought of as having lost the direction markers on the edges of the graph.  In general, a preorder's corresponding directed graph may have many disconnected components.

==Formal definition==

Consider some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''P'' and a [[binary relation]] ≤ on ''P''. Then ≤ is a '''preorder''', or '''quasiorder''', if it is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]], i.e., for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''P'', we have that:

:''a'' ≤ ''a'' (reflexivity)
: if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''c'' then ''a'' ≤ ''c'' (transitivity)

A set that is equipped with a preorder is called a '''preordered set''' (or '''proset''').&lt;ref&gt;For "proset", see e.g. {{citation
 | last1 = Eklund | first1 = Patrik
 | last2 = Gähler | first2 = Werner
 | doi = 10.1002/mana.19901470123
 | journal = Mathematische Nachrichten
 | mr = 1127325
 | pages = 219–233
 | title = Generalized Cauchy spaces
 | volume = 147
 | year = 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a preorder is also [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], that is, ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'' implies ''a'' = ''b'', then it is a [[partially ordered set|partial order]].

On the other hand, if it is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], that is, if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''b'' ≤ ''a'', then it is an [[equivalence relation]].

Equivalently, the notion of a preordered set ''P'' can be formulated in a [[category theory|categorical framework]] as a [[thin category]], i.e. as a category with at most one morphism from an object to another. Here the [[object (category theory)|objects]] correspond to the elements of ''P'', and there is one morphism for objects which are related, zero otherwise. Alternately, a preordered set can be understood as an [[enriched category]], enriched over the category '''2''' = (0→1).

A [[preordered class]] is a [[class (mathematics)|class]] equipped with a preorder. Every set is a class and so every preordered set is a preordered class.

==Examples==
* The [[reachability]] relationship in any [[directed graph]] (possibly containing cycles) gives rise to a preorder, where ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'' in the preorder if and only if there is a path from ''x'' to ''y'' in the directed graph. Conversely, every preorder is the reachability relationship of a directed graph (for instance, the graph that has an edge from ''x'' to ''y'' for every pair (''x'', ''y'') with ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''). However, many different graphs may have the same reachability preorder as each other. In the same way, reachability of [[directed acyclic graph]]s, directed graphs with no cycles, gives rise to [[partially ordered set]]s (preorders satisfying an additional anti-symmetry property).
* Every [[finite topological space]] gives rise to a preorder on its points by defining ''x'' ≤ ''y'' if and only if ''x'' belongs to every [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of ''y''. Every finite preorder can be formed as the [[Specialization (pre)order|specialization preorder]] of a topological space in this way. That is, there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between finite topologies and finite preorders. However, the relation between infinite topological spaces and their specialization preorders is not one-to-one.
* A [[net (mathematics)|net]] is a [[directed set|directed]] preorder, that is, each pair of elements has an [[upper bound]].  The definition of convergence via nets is important in [[topology]], where preorders cannot be replaced by [[partially ordered set]]s without losing important features.
* The relation defined by &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f(x) \le f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f'' is a function into some preorder.
* The relation defined by &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; if there exists some [[injective function|injection]] from ''x'' to ''y''. Injection may be replaced by [[surjection]], or any type of structure-preserving function, such as [[ring homomorphism]], or [[permutation]].
* The [[embedding]] relation for countable [[total order]]ings.
* The [[graph-minor]] relation in [[graph theory]].
* A [[category (mathematics)|category]] with at most one [[morphism]] from any object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to any other object &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a preorder. Such categories are called [[thin category|thin]].  In this sense, categories "generalize" preorders by allowing more than one relation between objects: each morphism is a distinct (named) preorder relation.

In computer science, one can find examples of the following preorders.
* [[Many-one reduction|Many-one]] and [[Turing reduction]]s are preorders on complexity classes.
* The [[Subtype|subtyping]] relations are usually preorders.
* [[Simulation preorder]]s are preorders (hence the name).
* [[Reduction relation]]s in [[abstract rewriting system]]s.
* The [[encompassment preorder]] on the set of [[term (logic)|term]]s, defined by ''s''≤''t'' if a [[Term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterm]] of ''t'' is a [[substitution instance]] of ''s''.

Example of a [[Strict weak ordering#Total preorders|total preorder]]:
* [[Preference]], according to common models.

==Uses==
Preorders play a pivotal role in several situations:
* Every preorder can be given a topology, the [[Alexandrov topology]]; and indeed, every preorder on a set is in one-to-one correspondence with an Alexandrov topology on that set.
* Preorders may be used to define [[interior algebra]]s.
* Preorders provide the [[Kripke semantics]] for certain types of [[modal logic]].

==Constructions==

Every binary relation R on a set S can be extended to a preorder on S by taking the [[transitive closure]] and [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|reflexive closure]], R&lt;sup&gt;+=&lt;/sup&gt;.  The transitive closure indicates path connection in R: ''x'' R&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''y'' if and only if there is an R-[[Path (graph theory)|path]] from ''x'' to y.

Given a preorder &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; on S one may define an [[equivalence relation]] ~ on S such that ''a'' ~ ''b'' if and only if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''a''.  (The resulting relation is reflexive since a preorder is reflexive, transitive by applying transitivity of the preorder twice, and symmetric by definition.)

Using this relation, it is possible to construct a partial order on the quotient set of the equivalence, S / ~, the set of all [[equivalence class]]es of ~.  Note that if the preorder is R&lt;sup&gt;+=&lt;/sup&gt;, S / ~ is the set of R-[[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] equivalence classes: ''x'' ∈ [''y''] if and only if ''x'' = ''y'' or ''x'' is in an R-cycle with y.  In any case, on S / ~ we can define [''x''] ≤ [''y''] if and only if ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''y''. By the construction of ~, this definition is independent of the chosen representatives and the corresponding relation is indeed well-defined. It is readily verified that this yields a partially ordered set.

Conversely, from a partial order on a partition of a set S one can construct a preorder on S. There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order).

For a preorder "&lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt;", a relation "&lt;" can be defined as ''a'' &lt; ''b'' if and only if (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' and not ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''a''), or equivalently, using the equivalence relation introduced above, (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' and not ''a'' ~ ''b''). It is a [[strict partial order]]; every strict partial order can be the result of such a construction. If the preorder is anti-symmetric, hence a partial order "≤", the equivalence is equality, so the relation "&lt;" can also be defined as ''a'' &lt; ''b'' if and only if (''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b'').

(We do ''not'' define the relation "&lt;" as ''a'' &lt; ''b'' if and only if (''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b'').  Doing so would cause problems if the preorder was not anti-symmetric, as the resulting relation "&lt;" would not be transitive (think of how equivalent non-equal elements relate).)

Conversely we have ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' if and only if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' or ''a'' ~ ''b''. This is the reason for using the notation "&lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt;"; "≤" can be confusing for a preorder that is not anti-symmetric, it may suggest that ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies that ''a'' &lt; ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b''.

Note that with this construction multiple preorders "&lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt;" can give the same relation "&lt;", so without more information, such as the equivalence relation, "&lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt;" cannot be reconstructed from "&lt;". Possible preorders include the following:
*Define ''a'' ≤ ''b'' as ''a'' &lt; ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b'' (i.e., take the reflexive closure of the relation). This gives the partial order associated with the strict partial order "&lt;" through reflexive closure; in this case the equivalence is equality, so we don't need the notations &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; and ~.
*Define ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' as "not ''b'' &lt; ''a''" (i.e., take the inverse complement of the relation), which corresponds to defining ''a'' ~ ''b'' as "neither ''a'' &lt; ''b'' nor ''b'' &lt; ''a''"; these relations &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; and ~ are in general not transitive; however, if they are, ~ is an equivalence; in that case "&lt;" is a [[strict weak order]]. The resulting preorder is [[total relation|total]], that is, a [[total preorder]].

Given a binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the complemented composition &lt;math&gt;R \backslash R \ = \ \overline{R^T \circ \bar{R}}&lt;/math&gt; forms a preorder called the [[heterogeneous relation#Preorder R\R|left residual]], where &lt;math&gt;R^T&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[converse relation]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\bar{R}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] relation of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[relation composition]].

==Number of preorders==
{{Number of relations}}

As explained above, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order). Thus the number of preorders is the sum of the number of partial orders on every partition. For example:
*for n=3:
**1 partition of 3, giving 1 preorder
**3 partitions of 2+1, giving 3 × 3 = 9 preorders
**1 partition of 1+1+1, giving 19 preorders
:i.e. together 29 preorders.
*for n=4:
**1 partition of 4, giving 1 preorder
**7 partitions with two classes (4  of 3+1 and 3 of 2+2), giving 7 × 3 = 21 preorders
**6 partitions of 2+1+1, giving 6 × 19 = 114 preorders
**1 partition of 1+1+1+1, giving 219 preorders
:i.e. together 355 preorders.

==Interval==
For ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'',''b''] is the set of points ''x'' satisfying ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', also written ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b''. It contains at least the points ''a'' and ''b''. One may choose to extend the definition to all pairs (''a'',''b''). The extra intervals are all empty.

Using the corresponding strict relation "&lt;", one can also define the interval (''a'',''b'') as the set of points ''x'' satisfying ''a'' &lt; ''x'' and ''x'' &lt; ''b'', also written ''a'' &lt; ''x'' &lt; ''b''. An open interval may be empty even if ''a'' &lt; ''b''.

Also [''a'',''b'') and (''a'',''b''] can be defined similarly.

Rev., 43 (2001), pp. 235–286.&lt;/ref&gt; (QEP)''', is to find [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] [[eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, left [[eigenvector]]s &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and right eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; Q(\lambda)x = 0\text{ and }y^\ast Q(\lambda) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q(\lambda)=\lambda^2 A_2 + \lambda A_1 + A_0&lt;/math&gt;, with matrix coefficients &lt;math&gt;A_2, \, A_1, A_0 \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt; and we require that &lt;math&gt;A_2\,\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, (so that we have a nonzero leading coefficient). There are &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; eigenvalues that may be ''infinite'' or finite, and possibly zero.  This is a special case of a [[nonlinear eigenproblem]]. &lt;math&gt;Q(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is also known as a quadratic matrix polynomial.

==Applications==
A QEP can result in part of the dynamic analysis of structures discretized by the [[finite element method]]. In this case the quadratic, &lt;math&gt;Q(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; has the form &lt;math&gt;Q(\lambda)=\lambda^2 M + \lambda C + K&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass matrix]], &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[damping matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stiffness matrix]].
Other applications include vibro-acoustics and fluid dynamics.

==Methods of solution==

Direct methods for solving the standard or generalized eigenvalue problems &lt;math&gt; Ax = \lambda  x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Ax = \lambda B x &lt;/math&gt;
are based on transforming the problem to [[Schur form|Schur]] or [[Generalized Schur form]]. However, there is no analogous form for quadratic matrix polynomials.
One approach is to transform the quadratic matrix polynomial to a linear [[matrix pencil]] (&lt;math&gt; A-\lambda B&lt;/math&gt;), and solve a generalized 
eigenvalue problem. Once eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear problem have been determined, eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the quadratic can be determined.

The most common linearization is the first companion  linearization 
:&lt;math&gt;
L(\lambda) = 
\lambda
\begin{bmatrix}
M &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; I_n 
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
C &amp; K \\
-I_n &amp; 0 
\end{bmatrix},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix, with corresponding eigenvector 
:&lt;math&gt;
z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda x \\
x
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We solve &lt;math&gt; L(\lambda) z = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, for example by computing the Generalized Schur form. We can then 
take the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; components of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; as the eigenvector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the original quadratic &lt;math&gt;Q(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:First_four_cycloalkanes.png|thumb|Four [[cycloalkane]]s, all of which exhibit simple rings]]
In [[chemistry]], a '''ring''' is an ambiguous term referring either to a [[Cycle (graph theory)|simple cycle]] of atoms and bonds in a molecule or to a connected set of atoms and bonds in which every atom and bond is a member of a cycle (also called a '''ring system'''). A ring system that is a simple cycle is called a '''monocycle''' or '''simple ring''', and one that is not a simple cycle is called a '''polycycle''' or '''polycyclic ring system'''. A simple ring contains the same number of [[sigma bond]]s as atoms, and a polycyclic ring system contains more sigma bonds than atoms. 

A molecule containing one or more rings is called a [[cyclic compound]], and a molecule containing two or more rings (either in the same or different ring systems) is termed a [[polycyclic compound]]. A molecule containing no rings is called an acyclic or [[open-chain compound]].

==Homocyclic and heterocyclic rings==
A homocycle or homocyclic ring is a ring in which all atoms are of the same [[chemical element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Homocyclic compounds |file=H02843 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[heterocyclic compound|heterocycle]] or heterocyclic ring is a ring containing atoms of at least two different elements, i.e. a non-homocyclic ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Heterocyclic compounds |file=H02798|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[carbocycle]] or carbocyclic ring is a homocyclic ring in which all of the atoms are [[carbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Carbocyclic compounds |file=C00818 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important class of carbocycles are [[alicyclic compound|alicyclic rings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Alicyclic compounds |file=A00216 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an important subclass of these are [[cycloalkane|cycloalkanes]].

==Rings and ring systems==
In common usage the terms "ring" and "ring system" are frequently interchanged, with the appropriate definition depending upon context. Typically a "ring" denotes a simple ring, unless otherwise qualified, as in terms like "[[polycyclic compound|polycyclic ring]]", "[[bicyclic molecule|fused ring]]", "[[spiro compound|spiro ring]]" and "[[indole|indole ring]]", where clearly a polycyclic ring system is intended. Likewise, a "ring system" typically denotes a polycyclic ring system, except in terms like "monocyclic ring system" or "[[pyridine|pyridine ring system]]". To reduce ambiguity, [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]'s recommendations on organic nomenclature avoid the use of the term "ring" by using phrases such as "monocyclic parent" and "polycyclic ring system".&lt;ref&gt;{{BlueBook2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This equation attracted a lot of attention in the 1970s due to the presence of [[soliton]] solutions.

== Origin of the equation and its name ==

There are two equivalent forms of the sine-Gordon equation. In the ([[real number|real]]) ''space-time coordinates'', denoted (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''t''), the equation reads:&lt;ref name="Rajaraman1989"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\, \varphi_{tt}- \varphi_{xx} + \sin\varphi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where partial derivatives are denoted by subscripts. Passing to the ''light cone coordinates'' (''u'',&amp;nbsp;''v''), akin to ''asymptotic coordinates'' where

: &lt;math&gt; u=\frac{x+t}2, \quad v=\frac{x-t}2, &lt;/math&gt;

the equation takes the form:&lt;ref name="Polyanin2004"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-1-58488-355-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{uv} = \sin\varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the original form of the sine-Gordon equation, as it was considered in the nineteenth century in the course of investigation of [[differential geometry of surfaces|surfaces]] of constant [[Gaussian curvature]] ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1, also called [[pseudospherical surface]]s. Choose a coordinate system for such a surface in which the coordinate mesh ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;constant, ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;constant is given by the [[asymptotic curve|asymptotic line]]s parameterized with respect to the arc length. The [[first fundamental form]] of the surface in these coordinates has a special form

: &lt;math&gt; ds^2 = du^2 + 2\cos\varphi \,du\, dv + dv^2,\, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt; expresses the angle between the asymptotic lines, and for the [[second fundamental form]], ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Then the [[Codazzi–Mainardi equation]] expressing a compatibility condition between the first and second fundamental forms results in the sine-Gordon equation. The study of this equation and of the associated transformations of pseudospherical surfaces in the 19th century by [[Luigi Bianchi|Bianchi]] and [[Albert Victor Bäcklund|Bäcklund]] led to the discovery of [[Bäcklund transformation]]s.

The name "sine-Gordon equation" is a pun on the well-known [[Klein–Gordon equation]] in physics:{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi_{tt}- \varphi_{xx} + \varphi\ = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The sine-Gordon equation is the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the field whose [[Lagrangian density]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\text{SG}(\varphi) = \frac{1}{2}(\varphi_t^2 - \varphi_x^2) - 1 + \cos\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Taylor series expansion of the [[cosine]] in the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\varphi) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-\varphi ^2)^n}{(2n)!},&lt;/math&gt;

it can be rewritten as the [[Scalar field theory#Linear .28free.29 theory|Klein–Gordon Lagrangian]] plus higher order terms

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\text{SG}(\varphi) &amp; = \frac{1}{2}(\varphi_t^2 - \varphi_x^2) - \frac{\varphi^2}{2} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-\varphi^2)^n}{(2n)!} \\
&amp; = \mathcal{L}_\text{KG}(\varphi) + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-\varphi^2)^n}{(2n)!}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Soliton solutions ==

An interesting feature of the sine-Gordon equation is the existence of [[soliton]] and multisoliton solutions.

=== 1-soliton solutions ===
The sine-Gordon equation has the following 1-[[soliton]] solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_\text{soliton}(x, t) := 4 \arctan \left(e^{m \gamma (x - v t) + \delta}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

and the slightly more general form of the equation is assumed:

:&lt;math&gt;\, \varphi_{tt}- \varphi_{xx} + m^2 \sin\varphi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The 1-soliton solution for which we have chosen the positive root for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''kink'', and represents a twist in the variable &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; which takes the system from one solution &lt;math&gt;\varphi=0&lt;/math&gt; to an adjacent with &lt;math&gt;\varphi=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. The states &lt;math&gt;\varphi=0\,(\textrm{mod}\,2\pi)&lt;/math&gt; are known as vacuum states as they are constant solutions of zero energy. The 1-soliton solution in which we take the negative root for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''antikink''.  The form of the 1-soliton solutions can be obtained through application of a Bäcklund transform to the trivial (constant vacuum) solution and the integration of the resulting first-order differentials:

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi^\prime}_u = \varphi_u + 2\beta\sin\left(\frac{\varphi^\prime + \varphi}{2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi^\prime}_v = -\varphi_v + \frac{2}{\beta} \sin\left(\frac{\varphi^\prime - \varphi}{2}\right)\text{ with }\varphi = \varphi_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all time.

The 1-soliton solutions can be visualized with the use of the elastic ribbon sine-Gordon model as discussed by ''Dodd and co-workers''.&lt;ref name="Dodd1982"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we take a clockwise ([[Right-hand rule|left-handed]]) twist of the elastic ribbon to be a kink with topological charge &lt;math&gt;\vartheta_{\textrm{K}}=-1&lt;/math&gt;. The alternative counterclockwise ([[Right-hand rule|right-handed]]) twist with topological charge &lt;math&gt;\vartheta_{\textrm{AK}}=+1&lt;/math&gt; will be an antikink.

=== 2-soliton solutions ===

Multi-[[soliton]] solutions can be obtained through continued application of the [[Bäcklund transform]] to the 1-soliton solution, as prescribed by a [[Bianchi lattice]] relating the transformed results.&lt;ref name="Rogers2002"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2-soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation show some of the characteristic features of the solitons. The traveling sine-Gordon kinks and/or antikinks pass through each other as if perfectly permeable, and the only observed effect is a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]]. Since the colliding solitons recover their [[velocity]] and [[shape]] such kind of [[interaction]] is called an [[elastic collision]].

|}

Another interesting 2-soliton solutions arise from the possibility of coupled kink-antikink behaviour known as a ''[[breather]]''. There are known three types of breathers: ''standing breather'', ''traveling large amplitude breather'', and ''traveling small amplitude breather''.&lt;ref name = "mir"&gt;Miroshnichenko A, Vasiliev A, Dmitriev S. ''[http://homepages.tversu.ru/~s000154/collision/main.html Solitons and Soliton Collisions].''&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

=== 3-soliton solutions ===

3-soliton collisions between a traveling kink and a standing breather or a traveling antikink and a standing breather results in a phase shift of the standing breather. In the process of collision between a moving kink and a standing breather,
the shift of the breather &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\textrm{B}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_B =\frac{2\textrm{arctanh}\sqrt{(1-\omega^{2})(1-v_\text{K}^2)}}{\sqrt{1-\omega^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_\text{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the kink, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the breather's frequency.&lt;ref name = "mir"/&gt; If the old position of the standing breather is &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, after the collision the new position will be &lt;math&gt;x_0 + \Delta_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

== FDTD (1D) video simulation of a soliton with forces ==

The following video shows a simulation of two parking solitons. Both send out a pressure-speed field with different polarity. Because the end of the 1D space is not termicated symmetricly - waves are reflected.

[[File:Soliton Sine Gordon 2015 08 07.ogv|thumb|Solitons according to the Sine-Gordon-Equation with forces]]

Lines in the video:

1) Cos() part of the soliton.
2) Sin() part of the soliton.
3) Angle acceleration of the soliton.
4) Pressure-Component of the field with different polarity.
5) Speed-Component of the field - direction dependent.

Steps:

1) Solitons send out not bound energy as waves.
2) Solitons send the p-v-field which reaches the peer.
3) Solitons begin to move.
4) They meet in the middle and annihilate.
5) Mass is spread as wave.

==Related equations==

The '''{{visible anchor|sinh-Gordon equation}}''' is given by&lt;ref&gt;Andrei D. Polyanin,Valentin F. Zaitsev, HANDBOOK OF NONLINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, SECOND EDITION p485 CRC PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{xx}- \varphi_{tt} = \sinh\varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}(\varphi_t^2 - \varphi_x^2) - \cosh\varphi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Another closely related equation is the '''elliptic sine-Gordon equation''', given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{xx} + \varphi_{yy} = \sin\varphi,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is now a function of the variables ''x'' and ''y''. This is no longer a soliton equation, but it has many similar properties, as it is related to the sine-Gordon equation by the [[analytic continuation]] (or [[Wick rotation]]) ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;i''t''.

The '''elliptic sinh-Gordon equation''' may be defined in a similar way.

A generalization is given by [[Toda field theory]].&lt;ref name=Yuanxi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuanxi|first=Xie|author2=Tang, Jiashi | title = A unified method for solving sinh-Gordon--type equations |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento B|date=February 2006|volume=121|issue=2|pages=115–121|doi=10.1393/ncb/i2005-10164-6|bibcode = 2006NCimB.121..115X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum version==

In quantum field theory the sine-Gordon model contains a parameter that can be identified with the [[Planck constant]]. The particle spectrum consists of a soliton, an anti-soliton and a finite (possibly zero) number of [[breather]]s. The number of the breathers depends on the value of the parameter. Multi particle productions cancels on mass shell. Vanishing of two into four amplitude  was explicitly checked in one loop approximation.

Semi-classical quantization of the sine-Gordon model was done by [[Ludwig Faddeev]] and [[Vladimir Korepin]].&lt;ref name="Faddeev1978"&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1016/0370-1573(78)90058-3
|bibcode = 1978PhR....42....1F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact quantum scattering matrix was discovered by [[Alexander Zamolodchikov]].
This model is [[S-duality|S-dual]] to the [[Thirring model]].

==In finite volume and on a half line==

One can also consider the sine-Gordon model on a circle, on a line segment, or on a half line. It is possible to find boundary conditions which preserve the integrability of the model. On a half line the spectrum contains [[boundary bound state]]s in addition to the solitons and breathers.

==Supersymmetric sine-Gordon model==

A supersymmetric extension of the sine-Gordon model also exists. Integrability preserving boundary conditions for this extension can be found as well.

In [[mathematics]], a '''topological module''' is a [[module (algebra)|module]] over a [[topological ring]] such that [[scalar multiplication]] and addition are [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]].

== Examples ==

A [[topological vector space]] is a topological module over a [[topological field]].

An [[abelian group|abelian]] [[topological group]] can be considered as a topological module over '''Z''', where '''Z''' is the [[ring of integers]] with the [[discrete topology]].

A topological ring is a topological module over each of its [[subring]]s.

A more complicated example is the ''I''-adic topology on a ring and its modules. Let ''I'' be an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of a ring ''R''. The sets of the form {{nowrap|''x'' + ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, for all ''x'' in ''R'' and all positive integers ''n'', form a [[base (topology)|base]] for a topology on ''R'' that makes ''R'' into a topological ring. Then for any left ''R''-module ''M'', the sets of the form {{nowrap|''x'' + ''I''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''M''}}, for all ''x'' in ''M'' and all positive integers ''n'', form a base for a topology on ''M'' that makes ''M'' into a topological module over the topological ring ''R''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5813">'''Willem Klein''' (4 December 1912 &amp;ndash; 1 August 1986), also known as '''Wim Klein''' or under his stage names '''Pascal''' and '''Willy Wortel''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[mathematician]] of [[Jewish]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;https://people.com/archive/a-dutch-mathematician-tries-to-come-up-with-the-73rd-root-of-a-499-digit-number-all-in-his-head-vol-6-no-13/&lt;/ref&gt; famous for being able to carry out very complicated calculations in his head very fast. On 27 August 1976, he calculated the 73rd root of a 500-digit number in 2 minutes and 43 seconds. This feat was recorded by the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]].

Wim Klein was born in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] on 4 December 1912 to Henry Klein, GP, and Emma Cohen. Klein had a rough childhood because his father wanted him to become a Doctor (as his father was), even though he was quite opposed to the idea. In addition to this pressure, his mother also committed suicide in 1929. In 1932, when Klein finished High School, despite wanting badly to pursue his love of mathematics, he gave in to his father's demands and enrolled at the University of Amsterdam for Medicine; he succeeded in getting his bachelor's degree in 1935.

When his father died in 1937, he initially continued with the path his father wanted, passing the first part of his doctoral exam, however he eventually gave up. Although he did not officially drop out of the doctoral program, he did not study any more and was therefore unable to advance. It was around this time that he discovered his homosexuality. Both Klein and his older brother Leo were regularly examined by a neurologist in Amsterdam, BB Stokvis, for their incredible computing capabilities. Stokvis labeled Wim as a "auditory calculator," and his brother Leo as a "visual calculator."

When  the Germans invaded in May 1940, Klein began working in a Jewish hospital and continued with his doctoral studies in 1941. In 1942, though, he had to hide, especially since his brother was captured and taken to the [[Sobibór extermination camp]], where he would eventually die. After the war, Klein returned to his doctoral studies, but he also worked in [[circus]]es in [[France]], [[Belgium]], and the Netherlands, performing fast calculations as an act, often under the stage name 'Pascal'. He lived a fairly nomadic lifestyle and performed in such shows until 1952, when his skills went to a more serious use.

In 1952, Klein was hired by the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematisch Centrum]] (English: Mathematical Center) in Amsterdam as a scientific calculator (Note that computers were only beginning to be developed, so calculations could be much more quickly and reliably done by a human like Klein). In 1954, the International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Amsterdam, so he attended. This inspired him to do shows again, so he went back to his nomadic lifestyle and performed internationally again for a few years until he was hired by [[CERN]] in 1958. This officially marked an end to his nomadic lifestyle. He was initially a great help to the physicists at CERN, but as computers became more powerful in the 1960s and physicists began programming more, Klein was more often used as a mascot for CERN who would do calculations for visitors. This disheartened him to the point where he would often say that Switzerland (the location of CERN) is a beautiful country, but it's a shame there are so many Swiss people living there ("Een mooi land. Alleen jammer dat er zoveel Zwitsers wonen," in Dutch). CERN often still recognizes him as their first computer though.

In 1975, the commemoration of the seven hundredth anniversary of the settlement of Amsterdam made him feel homesick, so in 1976, Klein retired early from CERN. He continued to do calculations for show, this time with the stage name 'Willy Wortel,' although this time he started to become more interested in breaking records, trying hard to improve his time and beat new records. This continued until 1 August 1986, when Klein's housekeeper found him dead in his home in Amsterdam, brutally murdered with a knife. Although a young man was arrested, there was no evidence of his involvement in the case and he was soon released. The murder remains unsolved to this day.

[[File:Young's lattice.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[Hasse diagram]] of Young's lattice]]
In [[mathematics]], '''Young's lattice''' is a [[partially ordered set]] and a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] that is formed by all [[partition (number theory)|integer partitions]]. It is named after [[Alfred Young]], who, in a series of papers ''On quantitative substitutional analysis,'' developed [[representation theory of the symmetric group]].  In Young's theory, the objects now called [[Young diagram]]s and the partial order on them played a key, even decisive, role. Young's lattice prominently figures in [[algebraic combinatorics]], forming the simplest example of a [[differential poset]] in the sense of {{harvtxt|Stanley|1988}}. It is also closely connected with the [[crystal base]]s for [[affine Lie algebra]]s.

== Definition ==
Young's lattice is a partially ordered set ''Y'' formed by all integer partitions ordered by inclusion of their Young diagrams (or [[Ferrers diagram]]s).

== Significance ==
The traditional application of Young's lattice is to the description of the irreducible representations of symmetric groups ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'', together with their branching properties, in characteristic zero. The equivalence classes of irreducible representations may be parametrized by partitions or Young diagrams, the restriction from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is multiplicity-free, and the representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with partition ''p'' is contained in the representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; with partition ''q'' if and only if ''q'' covers ''p'' in Young's lattice. Iterating this procedure, one arrives at ''Young's semicanonical basis'' in the irreducible representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with partition ''p'', which is indexed by the standard Young tableaux of shape&amp;nbsp;''p''.

== Properties ==
* The poset ''Y'' is [[graded poset|graded]]: the minimal element is &amp;empty;, the unique partition of zero, and the partitions of ''n'' have rank ''n''. This means that given two partitions that are comparable in the lattice, their ranks are ordered in the same sense as the partitions, and there is at least one intermediate partition of each intermediate rank.
* The poset ''Y'' is a lattice. The meet and the join of two partitions is given by the intersection and the union of the corresponding Young diagrams. Because it is a lattice in which the meet and join operations are represented by intersections and unions, it is a [[distributive lattice]].
* If a partition ''p'' [[covering relation|covers]] ''k'' elements of Young's lattice for some ''k'' then it is covered by ''k'' + 1 elements. All partitions covered by ''p'' can be found by removing one of the "corners" of its Young diagram (boxes at the end both of their row and of their column). All partitions covering ''p'' can be found by adding one of the "dual corners" to its Young diagram (boxes outside the diagram that are the first such box both in their row and in their column). There is always a dual corner in the first row, and for each other dual corner there is a corner in the previous row, whence the stated property.
* If distinct partitions ''p'' and ''q'' both cover ''k'' elements of ''Y'' then ''k'' is 0 or 1, and ''p'' and ''q'' are covered by ''k'' elements. In plain language: two  partitions can have at most one (third) partition covered by both (their respective diagrams then each have one box not belonging to the other), in which case there is also one (fourth) partition covering them both (whose diagram is the union of their diagrams).
* Saturated chains between ∅ and ''p'' are in a natural bijection with the standard [[Young tableaux]] of shape ''p'': the diagrams in the chain add the boxes of the diagram of the standard Young tableau in the order of their numbering. More generally, saturated chains between ''q'' and ''p'' are in a natural bijection with the skew standard tableaux of [[Young tableau#Skew tableaux|skew shape]] ''p''/''q''.
* The [[Incidence algebra|Möbius function]] of Young's lattice takes values&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;±1.  It is given by the formula
:: &lt;math&gt; \mu(q,p) = \begin{cases} (-1)^{|p| - |q|} &amp; \text{if the skew diagram }p/q\text{ is a disconnected union of squares} \\
&amp; \text{(no common edges);} \\[10pt]
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

== Dihedral symmetry ==

|image1=Young5.svg|caption1=Conventional diagram with partitions of the same rank at the same height

Conventionally, Young's lattice is depicted in a [[Hasse diagram]] with all elements of the same rank shown at the same height above the bottom.
{{harvtxt|Suter|2002}} has shown that a different way of depicting some subsets of Young's lattice shows some unexpected symmetries.

The partition

: &lt;math&gt; n + \cdots + 3 + 2 + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

of the ''n''th [[triangular number]] has a [[Ferrers diagram]] that looks like a staircase.  The largest elements whose Ferrers diagrams are rectangular that lie under the staircase are these:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c}
\underbrace{1 + \cdots\cdots\cdots + 1}_{n\text{ terms}} \\
\underbrace{2 + \cdots\cdots + 2}_{n-1\text{ terms}} \\
\underbrace{3 + \cdots + 3}_{n-2\text{ terms}} \\
\vdots \\
\underbrace{{}\quad  n\quad {}}_{1\text{ term}}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Partitions of this form are the only ones that have only one element immediately below them in Young's lattice.  Suter showed that the set of all elements less than or equal to these particular partitions has not only the bilateral symmetry that one expects of Young's lattice, but also rotational symmetry: the rotation group of order&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 acts on this poset.  Since this set has both bilateral symmetry and rotational symmetry, it must have dihedral symmetry: the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)th [[dihedral group]] [[group action|acts faithfully]] on this set.  The size of this set is&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, then the maximal element under the "staircase" that have rectangular Ferrers diagrams are

: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
: 2 + 2 + 2
: 3 + 3
: 4

The subset of Young's lattice lying below these partitions has both bilateral symmetry and 5-fold rotational symmetry.  Hence the dihedral group&amp;nbsp;''D''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; acts faithfully on this subset of Young's lattice.
