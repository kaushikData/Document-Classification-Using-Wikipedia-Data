'''2007 Broadway Stagehands Strike''' was a strike action by [[stagehand]]s represented by Theatrical Protective Union Number One (Local One) of the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) against the Shubert, Jujamcyn, and Nederlander theaters (represented by [[League of American Theatres and Producers]]).  The strike (the first in the union's 121-year history)&lt;ref name="Fairness"&gt;Steven Greenhouse and Campbell Robertson, "In Broadway Dispute, Questions of Fairness," ''New York Times,'' November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; commenced on November 10, 2007, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;A.M. in New York City. It was the second strike on Broadway in five years (the other was the [[2003 Broadway Musicians Strike]]).&lt;ref name="Day5"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gans |first=Andrew |title=Day 5: Most of Broadway Remains Dark |publisher=Playbill |date=November 14, 2007 |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112770.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116091348/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112770.html |archivedate=November 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, 2007, at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm, the two sides announced a settlement to end the strike, with shows beginning the evening of November 29. This was the longest strike to hit Broadway since a 25-day musicians' strike in 1975.&lt;ref name="nyt-end"&gt;{{cite news | last=Robertson | first=Campbell | title=Stagehands End Walkout on Broadway |work=New York Times | date=November 29, 2007 | accessdate=November 29, 2007 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/theater/29broadway.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
IATSE Local One engages in [[collective bargaining]] with the League of American Theatres and Producers (the League), an association of Broadway theater owners and producers.

IATSE Local One was formed in 1886, and represents about 3,000 stagehands and other theater workers in the New York City area. Roughly 350 to 500 of its members work for Broadway theaters, building, installing and operating scenery and sound and lighting equipment.&lt;ref name="Lowdown"&gt;Campbell Robertson, "Broadway's Showdown: The Lowdown," ''New York Times,'' November 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The League includes nearly every one of the 39 theaters on Broadway. The [[Jujamcyn Amusement Corporation]] owns five theaters, [[The Shubert Organization]] 17 theaters, and the [[Nederlander Organization]] nine theaters.  The remaining members of the League ([[Disney Theatrical]], [[Live Nation]] and six nonprofits) each own a single theater. Generally, Jujamcyn and the Shubert Organization are the only owners represented by the League in negotiations.  The Nederlander Organization has a separate contract, but a clause in the contract guarantees that its terms and conditions reflect the contract reached with the League.&lt;ref&gt;This is known as a "me too" contract.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining League members engage in individual contract negotiations with IATSE Local One.&lt;ref name="Bracing"&gt;Campbell Robertson, "Stagehands Bracing for Broadway Showdown," ''New York Times,'' July 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The [[collective bargaining]] agreement between Local One and the League expired in the summer of 2007. Members of Local One agreed to work without a contract and promised other unions in the entertainment industry that they would not strike until an agreement was reached. In late summer, Local One and the League, representing the Shubert and Jujamcyn theaters with the Nederlander Organization observing, entered into negotiations.&lt;ref name="Bracing" /&gt;

===Contract issues===
Contract negotiations generally focused on work rules. Broadway shows offer a standard eight performances per week ("performance calls"), each of which lasts three to four hours. Additionally, there are "load-ins" (periods during which a show moves into a theater), rehearsals, "maintenance calls" (during which scenery, lighting and sound equipment are serviced, repaired and maintained), and opportunities for overtime. The League has accused the union of using its contract to secure [[featherbedding]], a practice made illegal by the federal [[Taft-Hartley Act]]. Among the work rule changes sought by the League were:
* '''Loosening load-in rules:''' The load-in period may last several weeks and cost $1 million or more. Current work rules require producers to determine ahead of time how many stagehands are needed on each given day. These numbers cannot change once load-in begins, requiring producers to pay salaries even if no work occurs. The rule ensures that workers will not be on call (and unpaid for it) during the load-in period. The producers proposed essentially eliminating the rule. The union agreed to loosen the rule, but sought to keep a minimum number of stagehands at work each day.
* '''Overtime:''' The existing contract stated that if any stagehand is required to work overtime during a load-in, all workers must stay and be paid overtime. The producers proposed loosening the rule so that producers determined how many stagehands would stay and earn overtime. The union agreed to discuss modifying the contract, but only if the League agreed to strengthen other parts of the contract.
* '''Performance and continuity calls:''' The existing contract stated that stagehands could only perform work related to the performance during a performance call. If the producer wishes the stagehand to perform other duties, the producer must issue a one-hour "continuity call," even if the stagehand has no more work to do. If the one-hour continuity call is not long enough, producers are required to pay for a four-hour shift. Producers call the rule wasteful, but the union claimed the rule discouraged theaters from forcing employees to work past midnight. The union also noted that many stagehands supplement their income with daytime jobs, and late nights significantly interfere with these arrangements.&lt;ref name="Fairness" /&gt; Producers proposed widening the tasks stagehands may perform during performance calls and reducing the required four hours of pay. The union had agreed to discuss reducing the required four hours of pay in exchange for improving other benefits.
* '''Wages''': There are four classes of stagehands. Head carpenters and electricians, who are in the top category, made about $1,600 a week. Most stagehands (riggers, winch-workers and operators) were in the lowest class, making about $1,200 a week. The union claimed that the proposed rule changes would cut workers salaries by 38 percent. The League offered different pay raises for different classes of workers, but the union argued these did not make up for the lost income.&lt;ref name="Lowdown" /&gt;

Many labor relations experts said{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} that the negotiations were not about work rules or economics, but the relative power of the two sides. Producers, who pay the theater owners, are also part of the League, and for the first time they took a vocal and active role in pushing for contract changes in order to break the union's control over theater management. Subsequently the League established a $20 million "defense fund" to help theaters weather a strike.&lt;ref name="Fairness" /&gt; In response, the union established a $4 million fund to help its members during a possible job action.&lt;ref name="Bracing" /&gt;

===Negotiations and strike===
Contract negotiations stalled between the two parties and the league threatened Local One with a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] if it would not comply with their demands. On October 21, Local One held a special meeting and its membership voted to authorize the executive board of the union to take any action deemed necessary, including but not limited to a strike, in order to reach an  agreement between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, "Broadway, Next Week: Shows or Lockouts?", ''New York Times,'' September 26, 2007; "Theater Labor Talks Continue," ''New York Times,'' September 30, 2007; Campbell Robertson, "Manhattan: Broadway Talks Extended," ''New York Times,'' October 5, 2007; Campbell Robertson, "Broadway Shutdown Looms As Talks Reach an Impasse," ''New York Times,'' October 10, 2007; "Broadway's Labor Impasse Continues," ''New York Times,'' October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2007, talks between Local One and the League again ended in a stalemate. On October 16, the League imposed a portion of its final offer (primarily, the proposals regarding new work rules) on the union.  For two weeks Local One worked under these rules before talks with the League resumed.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, "Broadway Strike Possible as Producers Impose Their Rules," ''New York Times,'' October 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the Nederlander Organization announced it would not join the Jujamcyn or Schubert owners in imposing the final offer on the union.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, "Development In Theater Standoff," ''New York Times,'' October 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, talks with the League resumed, this time including [[Thomas C. Short]], international president of IATSE, for part of the negotiation session. After seeing progress being made, President Short left the talks early to assist members affected by the [[2007 Writers Guild of America strike]]. After his departure, the negotiations once more ground to a halt. On the evening of November 9, Local One President James Claffey, Jr. was directed by International President Short to begin a strike on Saturday, November 10, 2007 at 10:00&amp;nbsp;AM [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern time]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, "With Talks Stalled, Stagehands' Union Authorizes a Strike," ''New York Times,'' October 22, 2007; Campbell Robertson, "As Stagehands Strike, Shows Don't Go On," ''New York Times,'' November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations resumed between both sides on November 17, 2007 but broke off the following day.  All performances of the affected Broadway shows were canceled through November 25. Negotiations between the League and Local One resumed on November 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gans |first=Andrew |last2=Hetrick |first2=Adam |title=Day 17: Talks Adjourn, But Negotiations Will Resume Evening of Nov. 26 |publisher=Playbill |date=November 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2007 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112950.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128014119/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112950.html |archivedate=November 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations continued November 26 and November 27.  The first bargaining session began November 25, and lasted 20 hours. It recessed at dawn on November 26, and resumed later that evening. A 13-hour bargaining session lasted through the night into the early morning hours of November 27. The two sides agreed on work rules regarding "load-in"—the period when productions are moved into theaters. Talks concerning work rules governing rehearsals and other kinds of work progressed only slowly and incrementally. Economic issues, such as wages, had yet to be seriously discussed. Although producers canceled all shows through Wednesday, November 28, observers noted that the talks had only taken a break and had not appeared to actually break off.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell Robertson, "Broadway Talks Break Up Without a Deal," ''New York Times,'' November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strike's end===
Both sides applauded the agreement.  The union and League agreed to flexibility in the ability to dismiss stagehands during load-in, so long as there was a daily minimum of 17 stagehands on duty at all times. The parties also agreed to extend the continuity call to two hours before or after a performance. However, employees who work the post-performance continuity call earn double pay for the first hour of the two-hour continuity call. Union members also won raises significantly higher than the 3.5 percent increase the League had publicly offered.&lt;ref name="nyt-end" /&gt;

The strike was a costly one. At least one estimate placed losses by theater owners and producers at $34.8 million through Sunday, November 25. The New York City comptroller's office said the city had lost another $40 million in revenue through November 28.&lt;ref name="nyt-end" /&gt;

==Unions Honoring the Strike==
{{Portal|Organized labour}}
Below is a list of unions and IATSE Locals honoring Local One's strike:

* All Pink Contract IATSE Stagehands employed in affected buildings
* IATSE Theatrical Wardrobe Union, Local 764
* IATSE Treasurers and Ticket Takers, Local 751
* [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity Association, The union of professional Actors and Stage Managers (AEA)]]
* [[American Federation of Musicians]], Local 802
* IATSE Theater Ushers Union, Local 306
* United Scenic Artists, IATSE Local 829
* IATSE Hairstylist and Make-Up Artist Local 798

==Effects of the strike==
The first show to be affected by the strike was ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical]]'' at the St. James theater.  Stagehands reported to work at their normal time, and after one hour of working left the building and formed picket lines outside. However, because the controlling contract fell outside the union dispute, pickets in front of the theater ended.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;

The strike halted business for all other affected shows. However, unaffected Broadway shows, various [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] productions, and other live entertainment such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]'' and ''[[WINTUK (Cirque du Soleil)|Wintuk]]'', all experienced a boom in sales and attendance.&lt;ref name="Day5" /&gt;

The impact of the strike was severe.  The [[New York City Comptroller]] estimated that the city had lost $2 million a day in tax revenue because of the strike. Many businesses in and around [[Times Square]] also suffered significant financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell Robertson, "On Broadway, Gloom Hangs Over Holidays," ''New York Times,'' November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The charity group [[Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS]] saw a dramatic drop in donations due to the strike, because it normally relies on donations from theater patrons after performances.&lt;ref&gt;Viola, Tom.[http://www.broadwaycares.org/news/strike.pdf "Strike News Release"] BroadwayCares.org, November 12, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414114002/http://www.broadwaycares.org/news/strike.pdf |date=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BC/EFA launched an internet donation campaign called "Team Raiser" to offset losses.

Below is a list of shows affected and unaffected by the strike. All Off- and Off-Off-Broadway shows were unaffected.

===Affected shows that resolved their dispute===
''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (musical)|Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' was originally part of the strike, and shut down on November 10 like the other affected shows. The producers of this show were not members of the League, and because of the show's special schedule they had negotiated a separate contract with Local One that was not in dispute. On November 19, the union authorized its members return to work on the show.&lt;ref name="Reopen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gans |first=Andrew |title=UPDATE: Grinch Will Reopen at the St. James Theatre Nov. 23 |publisher=Playbill |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112995.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123074232/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/112995.html |archivedate=November 23, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the owners of the St. James Theater, Jujamcyn Theatres, locked out both producers and stagehands, keeping the show closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Papa |first=Juliet |title='Grinch' Won't Reopen Until Dispute on Broadway Ends |publisher=1010 Wins |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |url=http://www.1010wins.com/pages/1229454.php? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122200141/http://www.1010wins.com/pages/1229454.php |archivedate=November 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers then sought an injunction in the Manhattan Supreme Court to force the owners to reopen the theater, and on November 21 the judge granted the injunction, allowing the show to re-open on Friday, November 23 at 11:00&amp;nbsp;AM.&lt;ref name="Reopen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Anne.[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/nyregion/24grinch.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22The+Grinch%22&amp;st=nyt "Broadway Now Brighter as 'The Grinch' Reopens"] ''The New York Times,'' November 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jujamcyn Theatres had planned to appeal the ruling, but dropped the case, allowing ''Grinch'' to play its entire run.

==Plot synopsis==
During their summer vacation with their grandfather Mori, Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum take a test on an [[obstacle course]] in pitch blackness. They passed the test. Later that night, he overhears Rocky and Colt planning on not returning the next year, due to getting older and he becomes depressed at this.

Returning home, Tum-Tum is also becomes very depressed that his favorite TV Series Dave Dragon is going off the air soon and not even food can cheer him up, which confuses his mother Jessica. They meet a new neighbor, Amanda who accidentally sends her [[remote controlled]] helicopter into their house; she apologizes, and Jessica invites her to attend Tum-Tum's birthday party at Mega Mountain; an amusement park modeled after [[Six Flags]]. Once they get to the park, Rocky goes off on his own to be with his girlfriend Jennifer while Tum-Tum convinces Colt to go with him to a special live Dave Dragon show as his last performance. While the kids are enjoying themselves, a criminal named Mary Ann "Medusa" Rogers and her mens sneak in and commandeer the park, disabling many rides and shutting the place down to hold the patrons hostage in exchange for $10 Million from the park's owner Harry Jacobson. The boys and Amanda discover this and save Dave from being captured, as he seems to be the only viable threat to Medusa's plans. Amanda uses her [[laptop]] to try and override the controls, but Medusa's henchmen wrest control from her. Fearing they will interfere with her, she sends her idiot nephews out to capture them, but they are tricked by the boys and their access to an arsenal of small weapons and devices that Amanda possesses. Meanwhile, Dave sneaks into the command center, but is quickly discovered and captured.

Finding video of Rocky and his girlfriend, she sends her second-in-command Lothar Zogg out to make sure they don't interfere. Medusa's nephews captures Jennifer and ties her to the bottom of a roller coaster loop. Medusa threatens to release the breaks and crush her if they don't cooperate, but Rocky goes to rescue her, But he gets attacked by Lothar. After a fight leading Rocky and Lothar to the top of the coaster, Rocky sends him off and he bounces out of the park and into the hands of the [[FBI]]. He then manages to free Jennifer before the roller coaster can crush them. Jacobson arrives via helicopter with the money to pay the ransom, but Amanda manages to destroy one of the bags with her helicopter. She is quickly captured by Medusa and they escape underground with the remainder of the money. Darkening the halls, the boys must overcome their weakness in the dark in order to rescue Amanda, who is tied to a bomb. They manage to free her, but they are unable to disarm the bomb, they attach it to an oxygen tank and with Dave's help, they bat off the top of the tank, sending it like a torpedo down Medusa's escape route. Alerted to the explosion, the FBI manages to capture Medusa, who resigns herself to defeat.

Now hailed as heroes, the boys give the credit to Dave Dragon, hailing him as the real hero, to the press, the boys return home and assure Mori they will not be leaving their training. They also extend the offer to Amanda to come train with them the following year, and she gladly accepts.

==Development==
Filming began in 1996. Hulk Hogan, wrestling in [[World Championship Wrestling]] at the time, wore a wig for the film which resulted in him having a different hairstyle than his traditional bald look. As a result, he is seen in [[Halloween Havoc (1996)|Halloween Havoc 1996]] with a similar hairstyle as he had in the film. [[Elitch Gardens]], the park at which it was filmed, underwent a complete remodel, with all the signs for the park and rides being changed and renamed for the film. However, there are a few times when the real ones are seen in the background.

==Reception==
The film had universally negative reviews and is generally considered to be the worst of the four in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : '3 Ninjas: High Noon' a Lively Action Adventure|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/10/entertainment/ca-37770|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a 0% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on six reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rottentomatoes|3_ninjas_high_noon_at_mega_mountain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''A Brown Thanksgiving'''" is the seventh episode of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''. The episode aired on November 22, 2009 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States. In this episode [[Cleveland Brown]] celebrates his first Thanksgiving with his new family, including his own parents and [[Donna Tubbs|Donna]]'s [[Auntie Momma]].

==Plot==
Cleveland celebrates [[Thanksgiving]] with his new family and his parents, Cookie and [[LeVar "Freight Train" Brown]]. Things become hostile until Donna's Auntie Momma arrives. Cleveland soon discovers that Auntie Momma is a [[trans woman]] after he sees her urinating while standing. He tries to tell Donna but refrains because she would be crushed to learn the truth. LeVar becomes smitten with Auntie Momma. Cleveland tries to tell his father about her but refrains, believing it is best that his father find out the hard way. Cleveland also learns from [[Rallo Tubbs|Rallo]] that he had known all along from sitting on Auntie Momma's lap. When LeVar and Auntie Momma come back down from having sex, they start teasing each other at dinner by subtly acting out their antics with the food. Cleveland becomes so disgusted and surprised that his father did not notice that he vomits all over the table. 
Meanwhile, [[Roberta Tubbs|Roberta]] decides to spend a romantic Thanksgiving together with Federline, but Donna refuses to let her. Only Auntie Momma's influence convinces Donna to let her leave.  As the couple kiss by a river, Federline's car is stolen by two homeless men. They track the car to a mission where the poor (including [[Lester Krinklesac|Lester's]] family) are eating, being served by the Bear family. The homeless man who stole the car gives back the keys. Roberta notices the unity around her and realizes that family is more important. She returns home and apologizes to her mother.
Later Cleveland confronts Auntie Momma and learns that she is actually Uncle Kevin, who was acting as a strong, female influence for Donna in place of her parents. He disguised his physical sex from LeVar. Since she sees that Cleveland will take good care of Donna, "Auntie Momma" decides that it is time to leave. Soon after, Cleveland tells his father the truth, causing him to vomit over the front porch before convincing him to reconcile with Cookie.

==Production==
The episode  also  introduces Cleveland's father, Freight Train, who is portrayed by [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], Cleveland's mother, Cookie, who is portrayed by [[Frances Callier]], and Auntie Momma, who is portrayed by [[Kym Whitley]].

==Reception==
The episode was viewed by 6.32 million people being the third most viewed episode in its time slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=TV Ratings Sunday: American Music Awards Rivals Football; Cold Case No Better At 9pm|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/11/23/tv-ratings-sunday-american-music-awards-rivals-football-cold-case-no-better-at-9pm/34292/|work=Zap2it|publisher=TV by the Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' graded the episode a C+, stating "It's not a big deal if these shows don't want to do complicated character development (Lord knows ''Family Guy'' didn't need it), but ''Cleveland Show'' has headed in this direction so often that I was a bit disappointed the episode didn't tie all of this together better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/pranks-and-greensa-brown-thanksgivingjerome-is-the,35656/|title="Pranks and Greens"/"A Brown Thanksgiving"/"Jerome Is the New Black"/"My Morning Straitjacket"|work=The A.V.

"A Brown Thanksgiving" came under fire from the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) after Bil Browning of the LGBT blog [[The Bilerico Project]] expressed shock at the organization's lack of response to the portrayal of a [[transgender]] character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Auntie Mamma compliments Cleveland's mustache by saying "mustache all, putting [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to shame!", referencing Wilt Chamberlain's mustache. She also references [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s sexual exploits, more specifically the 20,000 women claim when she says that she should know, because she was number 8,433 and 11,760.

The '''Armatron''' was a toy robot made by [[TOMY]] and distributed by [[Radio Shack]] in the United States since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Hawkins |first=William J. |date=1984-03-01 |title=What's new in Electronics |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=rAAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=armatron&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q=armatron&amp;f=false |magazine=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like arm with two attached [[joystick]]s which could be manipulated to pick up small objects. It was essentially similar to industrial robots of the 1980s, though it was strictly user-controlled, with no automation built in.

The Armatron existed in both the original fixed version and a mobile version with a wired remote. It included an "energy level" indicator (actually a countdown timer) and a series of objects such as boxes and spheres designed to be manipulated by the arm. Models with alternate decals or coloring were marketed under slightly different names, including the Super Armatron and the Armatron II.

The original Radio Shack Armatron also came with a module pack of items the Armatron was able to lift and move.  The Module pack consisted of a Flat Module, with 2 cones and 2 globes as well as a "closed module" which also had impressions of the cones and globes on it as a second platform for the objects to be moved to and from.

Movement of the arm was almost purely mechanical; the only electronic component was the motor. The two joysticks selectively engaged or disengaged gears on a set of rotating drums to control the arm's movement.

== History ==

=== The 1970s ===
Gregory Fedin and his then wife Nina Krasavina, both born and trained in Russia, started a circus school to train future "first" generation circus performers. They started the small school in a lower [[Manhattan loft]].&lt;ref name="bigac" /&gt;

The circus couple worked with [[Paul Binder]] and Michael Christensen to develop the Big Apple Circus following the European style "one ring" circus. In 1977, they located and secured an open ground area, in [[Battery Park]], where the Big Apple Circus debuted. Headlining the early shows was a single [[trapeze]], a dog act, [[Tightrope walking|tight rope walking]], [[Juggling|jugglers]] and clowns, double trapeze artists, and a host of other performers.&lt;ref name="bigac" /&gt;

During 1978, the circus moved from [[Manhattan]]. By 1979, two circus arts schools had been opened with money raised from the circus shows.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== The 1980s ===
The Big Apple Circus began the 1980s with a special holiday celebration in honor of the circus and its staff. In 1981, the circus began performing at [[Damrosch Park]] of [[Lincoln Center]] for the first time, continuing until 2015. In 1982, the circus won a silver medal at a circus performing competition held in [[Paris, France|Paris]].&lt;ref name="bigac" /&gt;

The circus began to arrange tours across [[New England]] in 1983. They also received an [[Obie award]] that year.&lt;ref name="bigac" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/04/arts/big-apple-circus-pitches-a-tent-in-lincoln-center.html|title=BIG APPLE CIRCUS PITCHES A TENT IN LINCOLN CENTER|date=4 December 1981|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, the New York School for Circus Arts/Big Apple Circus relocated to [[East Harlem]]. The New York School for Circus Arts, in conjunction with [[New York City Public Schools]] and ArtsConnection, established the Young Talent Circus Training Program. The circus program mission was to teach talented children of diverse economic communities circus arts. One of the goals was to nurture and develop talent into potential circus performers. A core group of young circus "talent" participated in a circus competition resulting in a "Gold Medal" award. Three years later, another group from the pre-professional circus program (located in the Harbor School for the Performing Arts in East Harlem) would compete in the II Rampe International Circus School Competition in [[Monte Carlo, Monaco]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 1985, the [[Boston Pops]] teamed up with Big Apple Circus for what was touted as an extraordinary collaboration and live performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_22C386AF6EDB42F9979C8539CB420E29|title=Evening at Pops; Pops Joins The Circus|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1985 and for the next few years, BAC performers appeared as guest artists with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/arts/for-big-apple-aerialist-a-lifetime-in-the-circus.html|title=FOR BIG APPLE AERIALIST, A LIFETIME IN THE CIRCUS|date=27 December 1985|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1986, one of the biggest steps in the institution's history was taken, when the circus opened the [[Clown Care]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/sites/default/files/4_3.pdf|title=Clown as interpreters of emotions|last=Dionigi|first=Alberto|date=|website=simplycircus.com|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215310/http://www.simplycircus.com/sites/default/files/4_3.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circus celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1987 with a big celebration, as well as a new tent and seating system added. Topping the celebrations was a prestigious silver crown, which the circus won at the International Circus School competition in [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]], where six of the circus' [[Acrobatics|acrobats]]/[[Juggling|jugglers]] showcased their talent.&lt;ref name="bigac" /&gt;

During 1988 season, the Big Apple Circus participated in the first circus collaboration between China and the United States in history. "''East Meets West''" debut at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] [[Damrosch Park]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} 

In 1989, [[NYNEX]] started to sponsor metropolitan New York tours to residents of the area and tourists as well. The tour included a trip to the Big Apple Circus' grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.713-tickets.com/tickets/family/big-apple-circus-celebrate!-tickets/|title=Big Apple Circus - Celebrate!

=== The 1990s ===
In 1991, the circus appeared in a [[Hollywood]] film commemorating its 15th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2331105/|title=The Big Apple Circus|date=9 September 1991|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996, there was increased interest in Big Apple Circus and its performers in cities outside the New York/[[New England]] area. This was in part due to the circus' exposure in the Woody Allen film. In 1996, BAC traveled to both [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Michael Christensen received two more awards, including one named after [[Red Skelton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-02-01/news/2904913_1_youth-group-clown-care-unit-new-show|title=Bangor Man Clowns For Living `Mr. Stubs' Says His Craft Also Teaches, Is Not Mere Folly|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Big Apple Circus' performers participated in a collaboration between American and Russian circus performers.&lt;ref name="bigac" /&gt;

In 1993, the circus set a new attendance record. A new tent was purchased, and Michael Christensen was given a Parenting Achievement award by [[Parents (magazine)|''Parents'' magazine]], to recognize his work with Clown Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nymetroparents.com/article/For-hospitalized-childrenThe-Real-White-Glove-Treatment|title=For hospitalized children, The Real White Glove Treatment|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Dunning became the Big Circus' executive director in 1994. In addition, the coffee brand [[Chock full o'Nuts]] began sponsoring the circus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circusfans.org/news_detail.php?news_id=2690|title=CFA News Detail|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityseries.org/CS_aboutus/gdunning.htm|title=Gary Dunning - President and Executive Director - bio|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Grauer|Peter T.

In 1996, the circus' Art in Education program began to work in different grade schools. [[Clown Care]] continued to develop, opening chapters in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://schools.nyc.gov/offices/teachlearn/arts/files/ACES_June2016.pdf schools.nyc.gov, New York City Department of Education, NYC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 saw new attendance records set, as an estimated 170,000 people went to see the circus' "Medicine Show" production over a total of 114 New York City performances. Furthermore, Clown Care completed 150,000 hospital visits in one year for the first time in the program's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/big-apple-circus-fun-core-sick-tired-old-routine-friend-medicine-show-cure-article-1.744881|title=Big Apple Circus: Fun to its Very Core Sick and Tired of the Same Old Routine, Friend?

During 1998, the circus was able to break attendance records again, as it celebrated twenty years of operation with engagements at New York's [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] and in [[Boston]]. The Boston engagement was particularly pleasant for the circus' performers, as it was one of the longest stays in that city that they had ever experienced. [[TJ Maxx]] began to sponsor Big Apple Circus appearances in [[Chicago]] and in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] by bringing the "Circus of the Senses" to those cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/circus.htm|title=What's Hot|last=Gener|first=Randy|date=1999-12-01|website=www.nytheatre-wire.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://business.highbeam.com/53/article-1G1-19907071/big-apple-circus-augment-season-bigname-presenting|title=Big Apple Circus to augment season with big-name presenting sponsors.

In 1999, co-founder Michael Christensen was inducted into [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]'s Ambassador David A.

=== The 2000s ===
Once again in 1999, "Circus of the Senses" attracted a large number of special children, with 9,000 kids participating. The circus dropped plans for a second unit that was to play in theaters after less than successful financial results during a trial run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.necn.com/entertainment/the-scene/Circus-of-the-Senses-297741801.html|title=Circus of the Senses|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostoncentral.com/events/big-apple-circus-boston/p40494.php|title=Big Apple Circus: The Grand Tour - Boston Central|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Big Apple Circus became a [[501(c)(3) nonprofit organization|501(c)3 non-profit organization]] in March 2000.

Started in 1987, Circus of the Senses is a circus performance specifically geared towards children and adults with vision or hearing impairments, as well as special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigapplecircus.org/circus-of-the-senses|title=Circus of the Senses|last=|first=|date=|website=Big Apple Circus|publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|access-date=2017-01-14|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206001654/http://bigapplecircus.org/circus-of-the-senses|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sign language interpreters and sound augmentation for deaf patrons allow the audience to experience the circus as never before. In 1999, over 6,000 children took advantage of these performances. The program is run by the Big Apple Circus.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigapplecircus.com/about/bac-gives-back/|title=BAC Gives Back|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Former Programs ===

==== Clown Care ====
Founded in 1986, the Big Apple Circus Clown Care program is composed of over 80 professional clowns, trained extensively in hospital procedures, circus skills, and improvisation, who make rounds as 'clown doctors' at various pediatric hospitals around the U.S. It is estimated that the clowns make more than 225,000 visits to children every year "in both inpatient and outpatient units, including intensive care, emergency room, physical therapy, bone marrow transplant, pediatric AIDS, and hematology/oncology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nicklauschildrens.org/news-and-events/press-releases/big-apple-circus-clown-care-celebrates-15-years|title=Big Apple Circus Clown Care® Celebrates 15 Years of Bringing Smiles to Hospitalized Children at Nick - Nicklaus Children's Hospital|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rednoses.eu/news/interview-michael-christensen/#.WAU1KyRmVLI|title=RED NOSES Clowndoctors: Interview Michael Christensen|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigapplecircus.org/clown-care|title=Clown Care|last=|first=|date=|website=Big Apple Circus|publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|access-date=2017-01-14|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206001659/http://bigapplecircus.org/clown-care|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuation of Clown Care programs were not included in Big Apple Circus' bankruptcy sale and have since been taken over by various local organizations.

==== Circus After School ====
Big Apple Circus' Circus After School program gives opportunities for "at-risk youth to develop life-enhancing skills such as teamwork, commitment, and responsible risk-taking through a structured program of learning and performing the circus arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigapplecircus.org/circus-after-school|title=Circus After School|last=|first=|date=|website=Big Apple Circus|publisher=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|access-date=2017-01-14|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206001644/http://bigapplecircus.org/circus-after-school|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since emerging from bankruptcy, it is no longer a program of the Circus.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Billie Sellen''' (February 28, 1908 – November 27, 2002), better known professionally as '''Billie Bird''', was an American actress and [[comedian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba8773aa9|title=Billie Bird|work=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Pocatello, Idaho]], Bird was discovered at the age of eight while living at an orphanage. As a child, she worked in [[vaudeville]], and later in [[theater]]/[[cabaret]] before moving on to [[television]] and [[film]]s.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/06/local/me-passings6.2|title=Billie Bird, 94; Actress Had Character Roles in Movies, on TV|date=2002-12-06|publisher=''The LA Times''|accessdate=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She is credited with an appearance in a 1921 film ''Grass Widowers'', but it is not clear if this is accurate. Otherwise, she broke into films in 1950, later making a brief, uncredited appearance in ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' as a [[maid|chambermaid]]. Her only line was "Goodnight", which was said to Felix Ungar, who responded, "Goodbye." Bird often was cast by director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and appeared in many of his 1980 and 1990s films, such as ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', and ''[[Dennis the Menace (film)|Dennis the Menace]]'', the latter two of which both paired her with veteran Hughes actor [[Bill Erwin]] playing her husband. She also starred as Mrs. Lois Feldman in ''[[Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol|Police Academy 4]]''. Her last film appearance was in 1995's ''[[Jury Duty (film)|Jury Duty]]'', with [[Pauly Shore]].

In addition to films, Bird made numerous appearances on various television series, including roles on ''Silver Spoons'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[Eight Is Enough]]'', ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', and ''[[Knots Landing]]''. She was also a regular cast member on the sitcoms ''[[It Takes Two (U.S. TV series)|It Takes Two]]'' in 1982 and ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]'' from 1984 to 1986. In 1988, she joined the cast of ''[[Dear John (U.S. TV series)|Dear John]]'' starring [[Judd Hirsch]]. Her last acting role was a brief appearance in 1997 on an episode of the sitcom ''[[George and Leo]]'', which starred [[Bob Newhart]] and Bird's former co-star, Hirsch.

==Personal life==
Bird was married to Edwin Sellen until his death in 1966; they had three children.

==Death==
Bird died on November 27, 2002 in [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles|Granada Hills]], [[California]] at the age of 94 after a long battle with [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; She is buried in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].

The '''Byzantine lyra''' or '''lira''' ({{lang-gr|λύρα}}) was a [[Medieval music|medieval]] [[Bow (music)|bowed]] string musical instrument in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]]. In its popular form the lyra was a [[pear-shaped]] instrument with three to five [[Strings (music)|strings]], held upright and played by stopping the strings from the side with fingernails. Remains of two actual examples of Byzantine lyras from the [[Middle ages]] have been found in excavations at [[Novgorod]];&lt;ref&gt;The city Novgorod (or Holmgård) has been a major station on the [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|trade route from the Baltics to Byzantium]]&lt;/ref&gt; one dated to 1190 AD.&lt;ref name=Bates109&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|1992|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known depiction of the instrument is on a Byzantine ivory casket (900–1100 AD), preserved in the [[Bargello]] in [[Florence]] (''Museo Nazionale, Florence, Coll. Carrand, No.26'').&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Versions of the Byzantine lyra are still played throughout the former lands of the Byzantine Empire: [[Greece]] ([[Politiki lyra]], lit. "lyra of the City" i.e. [[Constantinople]]), Crete ([[Cretan lyra]]), [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Croatia]] ([[Dalmatia|Dalmatian]] [[Lijerica]]), Italy ([[Calabrian lira]]) and [[Turkey]].

==History==
The first recorded reference to the bowed lyra was in the 9th century by the [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lyra (lūrā) as the typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyra spread widely via the [[Byzantine]] [[trade routes]] that linked the three continents; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms ''[[fiddle]]'' and ''lira'' interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments.&lt;ref name=brytanica&gt;{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the [[rabāb]], the bowed string instrument of the Arabic world, was introduced to Western Europe possibly through the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and both instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments such as the medieval [[rebec]], the Scandinavian and Icelandic [[talharpa]]. A notable example is the Italian ''[[lira da braccio]]'',&lt;ref name="brytanica"/&gt; a 15th-century [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] which is considered by many as the predecessor of the contemporary violin.&lt;ref name=Arkenberg109&gt;{{harvnb|Arkenberg|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
From the organological point of view, the Byzantine lyra is in fact an instrument belonging to the family of bowed lutes; however, the designation ''lyra'' (''Greek: λύρα ~ lūrā, English: lyre'') constitute of a terminological survival relating to the performing method of an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] instrument. The use of the term ''lyra'' for a bowed instrument was first recorded in the 9th century, probably as an application of the term [[lyre]] of the [[stringed musical instrument]] of [[classical antiquity]] to the new bowed string instrument.
The Byzantine lyra is sometimes informally called a ''medieval fiddle'', or a ''pear-shaped rebec'', or a ''kemanche'', terms that may be used today to refer to a general category of similar stringed instruments played with a horsehair bow.

==Characteristics==
The Byzantine lyra had rear tuning pegs set in a flat peg similarly to the medieval [[fiddle]] and unlike the [[rabāb]] and [[rebec]]. However, the strings were touched by the nails laterally and not pressed from above with the flesh of the finger such as in the violin.
The lyra depicted on the Byzantine ivory casket of Museo Nazionale, Florence (900 – 1100 AD) has two strings and [[pear-shaped]] body with long and narrow neck. The [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] is depicted without [[soundhole]]s and as a distinct and attached piece, however this might be due to stylistic [[abstraction]]. The lyras of Novgorod (1190 AD) are closer morphologically to the present bowed lyras (''[[#Gallery|see gallery]]''): they were [[pear-shaped]] and 40&amp;nbsp;cm long; they had [[semi-circular]] [[soundhole]]s and provision for three strings.&lt;ref name="Bates109"/&gt; The middle string served as a [[drone (music)|drone]] while fingering the others by finger or fingernail alone, downwards or sidewards against the string, for there was no [[fingerboard]] to press them against: a method which gives the notes as clearly as the violin and remains normal in lyras both in Asia as well as on present bowed instruments in post-Byzantine regions such as the [[Cretan lyra]].&lt;ref name="Bates109"/&gt;

==In use today==
The lyra of the [[Byzantine empire]] survives in many post-Byzantine regions until the present day even closely to its [[archetype]] form. Examples are the ''Politiki lyra'' (i.e. lyra of the Polis, or City, referring to Constantinople) ({{lang-gr|πολίτικη λύρα}}) also known as the [[Kemenche|Classical Kemenche]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Klasik kemençe or Armudî kemençe) from [[Constantinople]], used in today's [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]], the [[Cretan lyra]] ({{lang-gr|κρητική λύρα}}) and the one used in the Greek islands of the [[Dodecanese]], the [[gadulka]] ({{lang-bg|Гъдулка}}) in [[Bulgaria]], the [[gusle]] in Serbia and [[Montenegro]], the [[Calabrian lira]] ({{lang-it|lira Calabrese}}) in Italy, and the [[Pontic lyra]] (Greek: ποντιακή λύρα; Turkish: Karadeniz kemençe) in the [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] communities, that existed (or still exist) around the shores of the [[Black Sea]]. The [[gudok]], a historical Russian instrument that survived until the 19th century, is also a variant of the Byzantine lyra.

Similarly to the lyras found at Novgorod, the [[Cretan lyra]], the [[Gadulka]], the [[Calabrian Lira]] and the Greek lyras of [[Karpathos]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Mount Olympus]] are manufactured from a single wood block ([[wikt:monobloc|monoblock]]), sculpted into a pear-shaped body. The slightly rounded body of the lyra is prolonged by a neck ending on the top in a block which is also pear-shaped or spherical. In that, are set the pegs facing and extending forward. The [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]] is also carved with a shallower arch and has two small semi-circular, D-shaped [[soundhole]]s. The [[Cretan lyra]] is probably the most widely used surviving form of the Byzantine lyra, except that in [[Crete]] instrument-making has been influenced by that of the violin. Currently, numerous models tend to integrate the shape of the scroll, the finger board and other morphology of some secondary characteristics of the violin.

The modern variants of the lyra are tuned in various ways: '''LA–RE–SO''' (or '''a–d–g''', i.&amp;nbsp;e. by [[Perfect fifth|fifth]]s) on the [[Cretan lyra]]; '''LA–RE–SO''' (or '''a–d–g''', where SO [=g] is a [[perfect fourth]] higher than RE [=d] rather than a fifth lower) in [[Thrace]] and on [[Karpathos]] and the [[Dodecanese]]; '''LA–LA–MI''' ('''a–a–e''', with the second LA [=a] an [[octave]] lower), in [[Drama, Greece|Drama]]; '''MI–SO–MI''' ('''e–g–e''', i.&amp;nbsp;e. a [[minor third]] and a [[major sixth]]) on the [[gadulka]]; '''LA–RE–LA''' ('''a–d–a''', a fifth and a fourth) on the Classical Kemenche.{{clarify|date=September 2011}}

The '''Royal Theatre Carré''' (Dutch: {{Lang|nl|Koninklijk Theater Carré}}) is a [[Neo-Renaissance]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] in [[Amsterdam]], located near the river [[Amstel]]. When the theatre was founded in 1887, it was originally meant as a permanent [[circus]] building. Currently, it is mainly used for [[Musical theatre|musicals]], [[cabaret]] performances and [[pop concert]]s.

==History==
German circus director {{ill|Oscar Carré|nl}}, looking for a location for circus performances in the winter, opened Circus Carré on 3 December 1887. In the beginning, it was just a wooden building with a stone [[façade]]. In the first years, it was only in use in the winter, but from 1893 on, Dutch theatre producer Frits van Haarlem brought [[vaudeville]] shows in the summer months. The shows became very successful, thus changing the circus building to a theatre for all forms of popular entertainment. In 1920, it changed its name to ''Theater Carré''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeamsterdam.nl/news/amsterdam-nightlife/high-arts/royal-theatre-carre.html Free Amsterdam, Royal Theatre Carré]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century the building was mainly used for vaudeville and [[revue]] shows, occasionally [[Italian opera]]s and [[operetta]]s. Dutch stars like [[Lou Bandy]] and [[Louis Davids]] and international celebrities like [[Josephine Baker]] and the clown [[Grock]] performed here.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amsterdamsights.com/nightlife/carre.html Amsterdam Sights, Royal Theatre Carre]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, revues and winter circuses remained popular. In 1956, Carré introduced [[musical theatre]] to the Netherlands with ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. The [[one-person show|one-man show]] followed in 1963, when [[Toon Hermans]] gave his first solo [[cabaret]] show. At the end of the 1960s, the theatre was in danger of being demolished. After protests from artists, the municipality of Amsterdam finally refused permission for demolition. In 1977 the municipality bought the building. In 1987, at the centenary, the [[Koninklijk|Royal Predicate]] was granted and the name was changed to ''Koninklijk Theater Carré''. In 2004, the theatre was completely renovated. The historic façade and interior design have been retained.

[[Image:Chindonya Okubo Tokyo.jpg|thumb|250px|Chindon'ya street performers in [[Shin-Okubo Station|Okubo]], [[Tokyo]], advertising for the opening of a [[pachinko]] parlor.]]
'''''Chindon'ya''''' (チンドン屋), also called '''Japanese marching band''', and in the old times also called '''''tōzaiya''''' (東西屋) or '''''hiromeya''''' (広目屋 or 披露目屋) are a type of elaborately costumed street musicians in [[Japan]] that [[advertising|advertise]] for shops and other establishments. The performers advertised the opening of new stores and other venues, or promoted special events such as price discounts. Nowadays, chindon'yas are rare in Japan.  The word consists of [[Japanese sound symbolism]] ''chin'' and ''don'' to describe the instruments, and the ''-ya'' suffix which roughly equates to the English "-er" suffix in this context.

==History==
{{weasel words|section|date=September 2009}}

===Origin as single performers in Osaka===
Street performers existed in Japan for a long time. However, the connection with advertising forming a ''chindon'ya'' first appeared in [[Osaka]] during the 19th century (Late [[Edo period]] and early [[Meiji period]]) at the beginning of industrialization. The first known ''chindon'ya'' is generally considered to be a candy seller in Osaka named Amekatsu,{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} who around 1845 used singing and a noise making toy to attract attention to his own portable candy stall, as many other salespeople, especially candy sellers. Due to his strong voice he was well known in Osaka, and hence tried to sell not candy but rather advertise for other stores and a theater, wearing a large hat and straw sandals, and small bells at his belt, and used a wooden ''hyogoshi'' noisemaker. He was succeeded by a former bath attendant ''Isamikame'', who also used to shout ''tozai'' (Literally ''East-West'', equivalent to ''Listen up'' or ''welcome'' (come one come all)). Subsequently, such advertising street performers were called ''tozaiya'' in Osaka up to [[World War II]]. He soon received competition from another advertiser called ''Matemoto'', and they split their business, with one covering the [[Uemachi]] region and the other covering the [[Shinmachi]] region of Osaka. After Maemoto died in 1891, his brother, also called ''Maemoto'' took over the business, and he was soon joined by his son and daughter, probably the first female ''chindon'ya''.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Maemoto is also famous as being the first person in Osaka to die from [[electric shock]] in 1893.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Other well-known performers from this time are ''Tanbataya Kurimaru'', a former [[Sweet Chestnut]] seller, and ''Satsumaya Imosuke'', a former [[bean]] seller. These two also occasionally added a second performer to their band.

===Group performers in Tokyo===
At the early Meiji period, such advertising was still unknown in [[Tokyo]], and advertising was mainly done on curtains (''[[noren]]''), billboards (''kanban''), and [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] (''hikifuda''). Stalls also advertised for themselves by making noise and wearing colorful clothes, an at the time widely known example being the extremely colorful dressed [[pharmacist]] ''Iwashiya''. During this time, [[newspapers]] and posters also started to appear in Japan and were used for advertising. The military also started to popularize western style [[marching band]]s, and at the same time public [[Band (music)|bands]] started to appear. In 1885 an advertising agency in [[Tokyo]] ''hiromeya''(wide eyes) hired musicians for advertising. ''Hiromeya'' was founded by a former ''tozaiya'' from Osaka ''Akita Ryukichi''. He soon found out that a one-person band was not as popular in Tokyo as in Osaka, and hired larger bands of more than 10 performers for advertising purposes, following the popularity of military and public bands. His band also provided entertainment at festivals and parties, and also created background music for [[silent film]]s. He was also hired by the [[Kirin Brewery Company|Kirin]] beer company, whose advertising campaign spread out to Osaka. In Osaka, this form of group bands was yet unknown, as only individual performers were hired for advertising. The police also had to stop some of the larger performances in Osaka, as they hindered traffic, partially also caused by the 2 meter tall beer bottle the group was equipped with. The Hiromeya business grew, and they were even asked to perform at the burial of [[Emperor Meiji]] in 1912. The business still exists nowadays, although they now do mainly decorations.

===Evolution of the modern ''chindon'ya''===
''Tanbataya Kurimaru'' and ''Satsumaya Imosuke'' in Osaka were inspired by the bands of ''hiromeya'' during the Kirin advertising campaign. They enlarged their groups and equipped them with drums and even fancier clothes, often matching the products of the advertised shop. However, they neglected rhythm and quality of the music over volume, and occasionally got arrested by the police. Some bigger engagements lasted for up to six months and reached out to [[Kyūshū]] and [[Shikoku]].

The technological advances opened up many other ways of advertising that competed with the ''chindon'ya''. Since 1910 they had to compete with [[newspapers]]. Around 1920 balloons and airplanes carried large banners through the air, and around that time [[neon sign]]s appeared in Tokyo. With the appearance of [[sound film]] in Japan in 1929 about 3000 street advertisers in Japan lost their jobs. A strike in 1930 had no effect and did not improve the situation. In response to the economic environment, the groups reduced their size to 4 to 5 people, and became known as ''chindon'ya''. For many this was the last step before unemployment and poverty, and hence the ''chindon'ya'' were considered to be of very low social status. The [[great depression]] in 1930 reduced the ''chindon'ya'' in Japan even more, and during [[World War II]] street performances were forbidden altogether.

===The golden age===
The chindonya had a revival again between 1946 and 1956, and between 1950 and 1960 there were up to 2,500 ''chindon'ya'' active in Japan. They often performed on [[black market]]s. Many stores also moved from a street stall to fixed locations, generating business for ''chindon'ya'', as did the rise of the [[pachinko]] business. One well known group in Osaka was ''Aozora Gakudan'', founded by former actor ''Saeki Yosan''. This group played with up to 18 members, and many other ''chindon'ya'' joined this group. The introduction of [[TV]] and [[radio]] advertising had only a small effect on the ''chindon'ya'', as these new mediums were too expensive for the small shops that used the ''chindon'ya'' services, and not targeted enough for the customers living nearby the stores.

===Decline===
Since the 1960s the number of ''chindon'ya'' has declined again, accelerated by the [[1973 oil crisis]] with the subsequent [[recession]]. Around 1970, street performances were also banned in many large cities, as they hindered the traffic. In 1985 there remained around 150 ''chindon'ya'', with an average age of about 60 years. Public performances were also banned for several months during the illness and the death of emperor [[Hirohito]] in 1989.

==Present==
[[File:Chindon'ya group - performing at waseda graduation march 25 2015.ogv|thumb|(video) A chindon'ya group performing at the 2015 [[Waseda University]] graduation.]]
Nowadays they are a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 professional ''chindon'ya'' (''puro no chindon'ya'') still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby ''chindon'ya'' (''shirōto chindon'ya'') performing at festivals. In recent years, however, there seems to be a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke [[nostalgia]]. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, ''chindon'ya'' hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, ''Chindon Tsūshinsha'' (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group ''Adachi'' in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]] was formed five years ago and is still doing a good business, including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the [[unicycle]], or displaying [[juggling]], and [[balloon modelling]] performances.

Since 1955, a national contest of chindon bands has been held in [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama-shi]]. Each April, dozens of groups join together to perform and compete.

Many ''chindon'ya'' also use the internet to advertise for their services.

==Performance==
''Chindon'ya'' are a small number of artists and musicians, both male and female. They are made up of usually at least three people, with some larger groups including 7 people. The first person in the group is called ''hatamochi'' or ''hatadori'', carrying the flag and handing out leaflets. This person is followed by the ''oyakata'', who usually carries the chindon drum and a large paper umbrella. As the drum weighs up to 15&amp;nbsp;kg, this is the most physically demanding job. Some references call the ''hatamochi'' the group leader, while other references call the ''oyakata'' the group leader. The third person used to play the [[shamisen]], but may nowadays also use the drum and hence is the ''doramuya''. He is followed by one or more ''gakkiya'' that play wind instruments.

They are dressed in colorful clothes, usually in an eccentric version of traditional [[Japanese clothing|Japanese clothes]]. Women may be dressed up like a [[Geisha]], with heavy make up. Men usually have their hair in a [[Chonmage|top knot]], although nowadays they are usually wigs, and some may wear fancy hats. They parade through the streets playing various instruments, including both traditional [[Music of Japan|Japanese instruments]] and western instruments. Usually, one person carries a combined instrument consisting of a small gong (giving the ''chin'' sound in ''chindon'ya'') and two small drums (giving the ''don'' sound in ''cindonya''). Additional instruments by other performers may include a larger drum and a [[woodwind instrument]], as for example a [[clarinet]], a [[trumpet]] or a [[saxophone]]. They often play [[Min'yo|traditional Japanese tunes]], military marches, or [[jazz]].

Through their performance they try to attract attention to themselves, and more importantly, to the advertising signs and banners they are carrying. These may be boards hanging on the back of the performers or banners and flags hanging from large poles on the back of the performers. Some even carried umbrellas with advertising messages. They advertise for new shops, special sales in shops, the opening of a gaming parlor or [[pachinko]] parlors, or for [[cabarets]]. They may also distribute flyers.

Nowadays, a performer earns around 15.000 [[yen]] per day (roughly US 150), working from around 10:30 to 17:00. Hence a typical group of three to four people costs around 45.000 to 60.000 yen per day (roughly US 450 to 600). Only an estimated 10%-20% of the acts are ordered by shops, most performances are at festivals and private parties.

==Language references==
''Chindonya'' also is a colloquial derogatory term meaning "an elaborate showy parade or scene made specifically to divert attention away from some scam", as in ''Nani Kono Chindonya''  ("What the hell are they trying to pull?")  It can be applied to anything nowadays, but especially politics and commerce.  It references to the commonly held view that Chindonya were very low status, very poor and, therefore, untrustworthy.

'''Colin "Bomber" Harris vs Colin "Bomber" Harris''' is a ''[[Monty Python]]'' comedy sketch in which wrestler Colin Harris ([[Graham Chapman]]) fights himself. As Colin fights himself, a commentator ([[John Cleese]], with [[Michael Palin]] as MC in both versions) hastily reports the events. 

Sir Arthur Harris was the Air Marshal of the RAF during the second World War. His heavy use of four engine bombers during the war earned him the nickname "Bomber Harris".

The routine dates back to Chapman's college days and he also performed it in the first episode of ''[[At Last The 1948 Show]]'', broadcast in the UK on 15 February 1967. It was later adopted by the Pythons, who filmed a version for the second ''[[Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus]]'' episode, broadcast in Germany on 18 December 1972. The routine also featured in many of the troupe's live shows and can be seen in the film of [[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]] (1982). It was also cited in ''[[Monty Python's Personal Best]]'' as one of Graham Chapman's best sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/ddysmf/monty-pythons-personal-best--series-1---2-graham-chapmans-personal-best | title = Monty Python's Personal Best: Series 1 - 2. Graham Chapman's Personal Best | work = RadioTimes | publisher = Immediate Media Company Limited | date = 22 February 2006 | quote = John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin pay tribute to Graham Chapman, who died in 1989.

==Harris holds==
The sketch includes the following moves:

# The "Hand Hold" in which Colin simultaneously attempts to grab his own hand while trying to fight it away, eventually failing.  Cleese remarks, "He's going for the hand hold...he's got it."
# Working on his 'weak left knee'
# Biting his own foot, which earns him a public warning from the referee and much ire from himself.
# The "Double Overhead Nostril", where Colin brings his arm upwards, lowering his hand over his face and inserting his middle and index fingers into his nose.
# Colin succeeds in gaining a fall by lying on the ground and bringing his legs up beside his head, locking his knees in his elbows called the "Double Overhead" in the Fliegender Zirkus Version.
# A "Strawberry whip", "Vanilla whip", and "Chocolate whip", called "the flying Welshman" and "the half Egyptian" in the Fliegender Zirkus version, usually consisting of three forward somersaults while he elbows himself in the back of his neck.
# "Colin's most famous hold, the one-neck-over-shoulder-[[Gerald Ford|Gerry Ford]]" (Known as "The famous over-right-shoulder-Gerry Ford in the City Center version) called the half-crab in the Fliegender Zirkus version, where Colin's right leg is brought over his shoulder, and he crawls along the ground in a pained manner with his remaining arm and leg.  He manages to crawl to the ropes, and Cleese remarks that he was "lucky there".
# Colin manages to catch himself by surprise by bringing his arms around his neck, his hands firmly pressing the ground in an attempt to pin; this move is known as the "Double [[Eydie Gormé]]" and is called "the neck pin" in the Fliegender Zirkus version.  He is able to twist out of it.

==Match result==
* The match ends with Colin hitting himself in the head with his forearm, effectively knocking himself out.  He is declared the winner, but is announced to meet himself again in the coming finals.

The '''Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃sɛj sypeʁjœʁ də lɔdjɔvizɥɛl|lang}}, ''Superior Council of the Audiovisual''), abbreviated '''CSA''', is a French institution created in 1989 whose role is to regulate the various electronic media in France, such as radio and television. The creation of the ''Haute Autorité de la Communication Audiovisuelle'' was a measure found in the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]'s electoral program of 1981, called [[110 Propositions for France]].

The CSA replaced the [[National Commission for Communication and Liberties|''Commission Nationale de la Communication et des Libertés'']] (CNCL), which itself replaced the [[:fr:Haute Autorité de la communication audiovisuelle|''Haute Autorité de la Communication Audiovisuelle'']], created in 1982 to supervise the attribution of radio frequencies to the private radio sector, which was judged better than allowing the anarchic creation of the [[Pirate radio in France|''radios libres'']] ("free radios"), mainly composed of amateurs and NGOs.

The CSA always acts [[prior restraint|after content has been shown]] on a TV channel or heard on a radio, so it is not a [[censorship]] instance.

For example, the CSA asked the French government to forbid [[Al-Manar TV]] in 2005 because of charges of [[hate speech]]; it also claimed that [[MED TV]] was close to the [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurdish]] [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]], on grounds not of "evidences" but of "concording elements".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-23_Medias_-Les-Kurdes-prives-de-leur-tele Les Kurdes privés de leur télé], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 23 February 2004 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clandestineradio.com/crw/news.php?id=212&amp;stn=684&amp;news=345 Medya TV CEO Denies Links with PKK], ''[[Clandestine Radio]]'', 25 February 2004 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Decker''''' is an American comedy [[web series]] and [[television series]] created by [[Tim Heidecker]] and [[Gregg Turkington]]. The show is a [[web series|web]] spinoff/tie-in to the series ''[[On Cinema|On Cinema at the Cinema]]'' and began on July 17, 2014. Many recurring jokes and the personas and mutual antipathies expressed by Decker and Kington carry over from the relationship of the "real" actors, Heidecker and Turkington, in ''On Cinema''.

The series is a spoof of action films, with intentionally bad production for comedic effect. It focuses on Special Agent Jack Decker (Heidecker), who attempts to stop terror attacks before they occur. At his side is Special Agent Kington (Turkington), with recurring appearances from many guests of the ''On Cinema'' series, such as [[Joe Estevez]] as President Davidson, and [[Mark Proksch]] as Abdul.

The series is part of the "''On Cinema'' universe" which has a cult following, especially through social media. In response, Heidecker and Turkington started ''Decker-Con'', where new episodes of ''Decker'' are screened and the cast appears as their "On Cinema" characters, meeting and talking to fans.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{citeweb|title="'Decker,' 'On Cinema' and the various, intertwined universes of comedian Tim Heidecker"|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-tim-heidecker-20170609-story.html|publisher=''[[The L.A. Times]]''|date=9 June 2017|author=Robert Llyod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially a [[Adultswim.com]] series, it was announced to be moving to TV on December 17, 2015, and its fourth season premiered on June 17, 2016, on [[Adult Swim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snierson |first=Dan |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/04/check-it-out-dr-steve-brule-season-4-premiere-clip |title=Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule sneak a peek at the season 4 premiere |publisher=EW.com |date=2016-05-04 |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Petski |first=Denise |url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/robot-chicken-the-walking-dead-special-series-john-krasinski-adult-swim-2016-17-upfront-1201753871/ |title=‘Robot Chicken: Walking Dead’ Special on Adult Swim’s 2016-17 Slate |publisher=Deadline cdate=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was renewed for a fifth and sixth season, both of which aired in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/decker-unclassified-renewed-second-season-adult-swim-1201850101/|title='Decker: Unclassified' Renewed For Second Season At Adult Swim|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timheidecker.tumblr.com/post/155044455806/2016-year-in-review 2016 Year in Review]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Heidecker announced on his Twitter account that the next season of the series is called ''Decker: China Connection''  and that it will be aired early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/timheidecker/status/980464084146577409|title=Father on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
''Decker'' follows the adventures of Jack Decker (Heidecker), a [[Jack Bauer]]-esque [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[CIA]] agent, in his attempts to defeat enemies including the [[Taliban]], [[ISIS]], [[Count Dracula]], [[environmental science]], and the inept, cowardly [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[President of the United States|President]] Jason Davidson ([[Joe Estevez]]). In his quest to save America, Decker is aided by the CIA's "master of codes", the movie-obsessed Jonathan Kington (Turkington), whose name is frequently mispronounced as either Kingston or Klington.

The series is a tie-in to ''On Cinema'', acting as the passion project of the fictional version of Tim Heidecker. In the series, the production is extremely low quality, with CGI errors, notably overt political grandstanding, very low quality animations, misquotes and bad editing, all for comedic effect. The series is also party to overdrawn scenes, such as in season 2, where the main character sings "Our Values Are Under Attack," a partisan political song created by Tim. As the series progressed, more CGI was used, but used ineffectively, where sometimes effects would seem unfinished.

==Characters==

===Main characters===

* Tim Heidecker as CIA Special Agent Jack Decker (Senior and Junior).Decker frequently  ramble about his views on climate change or weak liberal politicians and in general spouts the political views of Tim's On Cinema persona.Many traits of the character are based on [[Donald Trump]] mannerisms.
* Joe Estevez as President Jason Davidson (Senior and Junior).
* Gregg Turkington as Special Agent, and master [[cryptography|code-breaker]] Jonathan Kington.He is an avid movie buff who snacks on popcorn, has the largest film collection in the United States, and during Season 2 is shown dubbing tapes and trying to get a Guinness World Record for watching 500 movies in 500 days,mirroring Gregg's On Cinema persona obsessions.The ending of the fifth season reveals that Kington is a double agent working for hostile aliens.
* Sally Kellerman as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] Janet Rothman Davidson, main antagonist of the first season. She's an obvious parody of [[Hillary Clinton]].

===Recurring characters===

* James Mane Jr. as Lanoi Arnold - Decker's former CIA partner from [[Hawaii]] turned restaurateur. He double-crosses Decker and allies himself with the terrorists in exchange of money to pay his debt and renovate his bar.
* [[John Aprea]] as General Jeffrey Cotter , the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]
* Mark Proksch as Abdul Sharif - a [[Saudi Arabian]] terrorist ,the main antagonist and Decker nemesis.Proksch also play various other roles in the series.

==Production==
Heidecker has said of production that there is, to an extent, purposefully little preparation in the process to make the show appear as low-quality as possible, as well as stating: "We'll also go off-script and rant a bit to get everyone confused.” &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Tim Heidecker Turns Political With Decker: Unsealed|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/06/tim-heidecker-turns-political-with-decker-unsealed.html|publisher=[[Paste Magazine]]|author=Jake Lauer|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sincityfinishedfilmcomparis.png|thumb|right|250px|An example of the digital backlot as used on the film [[Sin City (film)|Sin City]] (2005).{{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
A '''digital backlot''' (also known as a '''virtual backlot''') is a motion picture set that is neither a genuine location nor a constructed studio; the shooting takes place entirely on a stage with a blank background (often a [[greenscreen]]) that will later on project an artificial environment put in during post-production. Digital backlot is more often used in certain genre of films, like sci-fi and comics, in order to achieve what would otherwise be too expensive or outright impossible to build as a real set.

==Notable films==
Among the first films to introduce the technique was ''[[Mini Moni ja Movie: Okashi na Daibōken!|Mini Moni the Movie]]'' by [[Shinji Higuchi]] in 2002, predated by ''Rest In Peace'' by Stolpskott Film (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4949148852704740890 |title=Rest in Peace |publisher=Video.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include:

The '''Half Moon Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.halfmoonfestival.com/|title=Half Moon Festival|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an outdoor [[dance music]] ([[rave]]) event on the island of [[Ko Pha Ngan]], [[Thailand]] held on the [[Lunar phase#Phases of the moon|half moon]], one week before and one week after the [[full moon]]. The promoters mainly employ local [[Disc jockey|DJs]] using [[Compact Disc|CD]] decks rather than [[Gramophone record|vinyl]]. Various guest DJs play unannounced sets but the event does not book big name stars.

The Half Moon Festival complements the bigger [[Full Moon Party]] events. It is held in its own venue in a forest north of the Ban Tai village, between Thong Sala and Haad Rin.

The '''Horace''' video game series was created in the 1980s by [[William Tang (video game author)|William Tang]] for [[Beam Software]]. The series comprised ''Hungry Horace'', ''Horace Goes Skiing'' and ''Horace and the Spiders''.

''Hungry Horace'' and ''Horace and the Spiders'' were two of the few [[ZX Spectrum]] games also available in ROM format for use with the [[ZX Interface 2|Interface 2]].

==Hungry Horace==
: ''"Hungry Horace" is also the name of an unrelated character from the UK's [[The Dandy|Dandy]], [[Sparky (comics)|Sparky]] and [[The Topper (comics)|Topper]] comics.''
[[Image:HungryHoraceGame.png|256px|thumb|left|The second maze of ''Hungry Horace'']]
The original Horace game, ''Hungry Horace'' was written as a simple ''[[Pac-Man]]'' clone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/06/runit.htm |title=CRASH 6 – Run It Again |publisher=Crashonline.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1982. In it, Horace must gather food from around a park and move onto the next section while avoiding park guards. It is possible for him to collect a bell to panic the guards and render them vulnerable, like the power pills in ''Pac-Man''. This title was available on the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Dragon 32]]. The ZX Spectrum original was marketed and distributed by Sinclair themselves, the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions by [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]].

The Commodore 64 version also included a level editor which allowed the game owner to create, edit and save to cassette tape their own levels of the game. These could be shared with other owners of the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A DOS-hosted level editor was written for the ZX Spectrum version in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.sys.sinclair/browse_thread/thread/92c2e9c14c2db7ca/42c7c925379aece9 |title=HHEDIT release announcement on Usenet |publisher=Groups.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Horace Goes Skiing==
[[Image:HoraceSkiingGame1.png|256px|thumb|right|In-game screen of ''Horace'' crossing the road]]

In 1982 Tang also produced ''Horace Goes Skiing'', in which Horace must cross a dangerous road teeming with traffic, à la ''[[Frogger]]'', to rent out a pair of skis, then get back over the road and successfully navigate a ski course.

This title is not a true sequel, as it does not follow on from an original story and is only similar in that it features the same character.  Like ''Hungry Horace'', this title was available on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Dragon 32. As before, Sinclair distributed the Spectrum version, Melbourne House the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions. In 2017, the game placed on [[Eurogamer]]'s "10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Graeme|title=10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-09-10-games-that-defined-the-zx-spectrum|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=10 April 2017|date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horace and the Spiders==
[[Image:HoraceSpidersGame3.png|256px|thumb|left|In-game screen of ''Horace'' in the Spiders' Lair]]

In 1983, Tang produced the third title in the series, ''Horace and the Spiders''. This was primarily a platform game with the Horace sprite retained from the first two games. The first level sees Horace climbing a hill while jumping over spiders. The second level involves crossing a bridge by swinging on spider threads. The third level is the final confrontation with the spiders – he must create holes in the web, luring the spiders into the holes to fix them and consequently jumping on them.

Unlike the earlier two titles, this game was only released for the ZX Spectrum. The first stage of this game shared similarities with both ''[[Pitfall!|Pitfall]]'' and the [[Colecovision]] game ''[[Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle]]'', whilst the third platform stage is essentially a ''[[Space Panic]]'' clone.

==Horace to the Rescue==
This title was announced in 1985 but the game never appeared, due to the author Tang suffering a collapsed lung and being unable to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/39/taylor.htm |title=CRASH 29 – TAYLOR MADE FOR MELBOURNE |publisher=Crashonline.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horace in the Mystic Woods==
Horace made a comeback in 1995 with the platform based game ''Horace in the Mystic Woods'' for the [[Psion Series 3|Psion 3-Series]] of palmtop computers. This fourth entry in the Horace series is a platform game split into one-screen levels in the style of ''[[Manic Miner]]'' and was coded by Michael Ware of Proteus Developments. It is Series 3a/3c and 3mx compatible.

In 2010, a conversion of the game to the ZX Spectrum was released by indie coder Bob Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0025136 |title=Horace in the Mystic Woods conversion at World of Spectrum |publisher=Worldofspectrum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
In the Spectrum version of the 1987 game ''[[Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear]]'', Gadget has to make his way through several scrolling worlds. In the first of these, he is hindered by Horaces travelling in the opposite direction; if he trips over too many of them, he loses a life.

A reference to Horace is also present in the 2003 [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[Dog's Life]]'', which features a shop named ''Horace's Ski Shop''. The name is written in a font similar to the one used on the ZX Spectrum, and is accompanied by a Spectrum-style rainbow pattern.

'''Implementation theory''' is an area of research in [[game theory]] concerned with whether a class of mechanisms (or institutions) can be designed whose equilibrium outcomes implement a given set of normative goals or welfare criteria.&lt;ref name = "palfrey"&gt;Palfrey, Thomas R. "Chapter 61 Implementation Theory." Handbook of Game Theory with Economic Applications, 2002. {{doi|10.1016/S1574-0005(02)03024-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two general types of implementation problems: the economic problem of producing and allocating public and private goods and choosing over a finite set of alternatives.&lt;ref name = "maskin"&gt;Maskin, Eric. "Implementation Theory." Science, 2002. {{doi|10.1111/j.1477-9552.2010.00281.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of producing and allocating public/private goods, solution concepts are focused on finding dominant strategies.

In his paper "Counterspeculation, Auctions, and Competitive Sealed Tenders," William Vickrey showed that if preferences are restricted to the case of quasi-linear utility functions then the mechanism dominant strategy is dominant-strategy implementable.&lt;ref&gt;Vickrey, William. "Counterspeculation, Auctions, and Competitive Sealed Tenders." The Journal of Finance 16, no. 1 (1961): 8–37. {{doi|10.1111/j.1540-6261.1961.tb02789.x}}. {{JSTOR|2977633}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; "A [[social choice]] rule is dominant strategy incentive compatible, or strategy-proof, if the associated revelation mechanism has the property that honestly reporting the truth is always a dominant strategy for each agent."&lt;ref name="maskin" /&gt; However, the payments to agents become large, sacrificing budget neutrality to incentive compatibility.

In a game where multiple agents are to report their preferences (or their type), it may be in the best interest of some agents to lie about their preferences.  This may improve their [[outcome (game theory)|payoff]], but it may not be seen as a fair outcome to other agents.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Matthew O. "A Crash Course in Implementation Theory." Social Choice and Welfare 18, no. 4 (2001): 655–708. {{doi|10.1007/s003550100152}}. {{JSTOR|41106420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although largely theoretical, implementation theory may have profound implications on policy creation because some social choice rules may be impossible to implement under specific game conditions.&lt;ref name="palfrey" /&gt;

[[File:Bill Dana Danny Thomas 1961.JPG|thumb|180px|Dana as José Jiménez with [[Danny Thomas]], 1961.]]
[[File:Bill Dana Jose Jimenez astronaut Bill Dana Show 1963.JPG|thumb|180px|Jiménez as an astronaut, 1963.]]

'''José Jiménez''' was a [[fictional character]] created and performed by comedian [[Bill Dana (comedian)|Bill Dana]] on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in 1959 and who became increasingly popular during the 1960s. This character introduced himself with the catch phrase: "My name... José Jiménez". Dana played José in three non-variety shows: ''[[Make Room For Daddy]]'', which spun off ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]'', and a cameo in an episode of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' ([[List of Batman (TV series) episodes|"The Yegg Foes in Gotham"]], October 20, 1966).

==Astronaut==
During the course of his José Jiménez acts, Bill Dana (who was of [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[Jew]]ish ancestry, unlike the [[Bolivia]]n character he played) took his character through various roles including elevator operator, sailor, and submariner until settling into the most famous occupation that José would hold: [[astronaut]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;'''José Jiménez''': "My name... José Jiménez."
'''[[Ed Sullivan]]''': "Well, now I see you have some of your space equipment with you. Uh, what is that called, the crash helmet?"
'''José Jiménez''': "Oh, I hope not."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;'''Ed Sullivan''': "Now, what do you consider the most important thing in rocket travel?"
'''José Jiménez''': "To me the most important thing in the rocket travel is the blast-off."
'''Ed Sullivan''': "The blast-off."
'''José Jiménez''': "I always take a blast before I take off. Otherwise I wouldn't go near that thing."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The routine was later released as a double-sided single: "The Astronaut (Part 1 and 2)" made the ''Billboard'' charts, peaking at #19 in September 1961. Writer/producer Don Hinkley (who Dana had met when they were writers for the Allen show) played the part of the newscaster, asking José questions about his purported spaceflight. An LP, ''José Jiminez in Orbit (Bill Dana on Earth)'' (Kapp KL-1257), featuring similar routines, was issued in 1962.

The character of José Jiménez caught on with the seven real [[Mercury astronauts]], and Dana became good friends with them: "Okay, José, you're on your way!" [[Deke Slayton]] quipped as [[Alan Shepard]]'s famous first flight launched. José became the program's unofficial mascot, and Dana was even made an honorary [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronaut. (Coincidentally, there was a real test pilot named [[Bill Dana (pilot)|Bill Dana]], who flew as high as 59 miles up and qualified for NASA's [[Astronaut Badge]].)

==Decline==
As time passed, Dana realized that such [[ethnic]] humor was becoming offensive, and Hispanic groups began protesting Dana's portrayal of the dim-witted Hispanic character. In 1970, Dana announced to ten thousand Mexican-Americans attending a cultural pride festival that "after tonight, José Jiménez is dead",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Steven W. |last=Bender |year=2003 |title=Greasers and Gringos: Latinos, Law, and the American Imagination |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anv9M7ZIwnsC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Jos%C3%A9+Jim%C3%A9nez+Bill+Dana+protests |series=Critical America |location=New York |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |page=180 |isbn=9780814798874}}&lt;/ref&gt; later holding a mock funeral for José on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. In 1997 Dana received an image award from the National Hispanic Media Coalition.

== José Jiménez in popular culture ==
In the 1983 film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', [[Alan Shepard]] (played by [[Scott Glenn]]) is a fan of the character and uses the catchphrase in radio talk while piloting his airplane in for a carrier landing. Later he is warned by a very large, rather intimidating Hispanic medical aide (played by [[Anthony Muñoz]]) that the way he uses it is offending people, and he stops. Footage of the character's appearance as an astronaut on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' was also seen in the film.

In the 1987 film ''[[The Pink Chiquitas]]'', one of the characters reads a passage from a book describing an expedition by the "explorer" José Jiménez.

In his demo of the song "Wonderful Toys" written for the aborted [[Batman]] musical, [[Jim Steinman]] does a parody of [[Eminem]], which includes the lines "My name is—my name is—my names is—José Jiménez!". The song is meant to be sung by The Joker.

In the ''[[Farscape]]'' season 4 episode, "Unrealized Reality", the lead character, John Crichton (who commonly quotes pop culture throughout his misadventures), experiences another possible reality of a scene from the first episode of the series.  When asked his name, instead of saying John Crichton he replies, "My name José Jiménez."

In the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the puppet character of Crow uses the phrase "My name José Jiménez."

In the third episode of the [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', called "We Have Cleared the Tower", someone mentions Bill Dana during the [[Apollo 7]] pre-launch breakfast. This inspires Commander [[Wally Schirra]] (played by [[Mark Harmon]]) to recite some of José Jiménez's lines, to the great amusement of everyone at the table.

In a cameo appearance in the ''[[Get Smart]]'' episode, "Supersonic Boom", Dana alludes indirectly to Jiménez, in that his only line was "Sorry fella, don't speak Spanish. Boy, are you in the wrong neighborhood."

In season 4 episode 10 of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', Arthur argues that José had been an inspiration to children because he was the "first Hispanic in space".

In the episode "Day One" of ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', Kevin Arnold's teacher calls him, " "a regular José Jiménez" when Kevin interrupts a class lecture. Earlier in the episode Kevin made a joke and embarrassed the same teacher.

[[File:Norblin Les Marionettes polonaises.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Pierre Norblin de La Gourdaine]], ''Les Marionettes polonaises'' ([[National Museum, Warsaw]])]]

A '''marionette''' is a [[puppet]] controlled from above using wires or strings depending on regional variations.  A marionette's puppeteer is called a '''marionettist'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Puppetry Today'' by Helan Binyon, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Marionettes are operated with the puppeteer hidden or revealed to an audience by using a vertical or horizontal control bar in different forms of theatres or entertainment venues. They have also been used in films and on television. The attachment of the strings varies according to its character or purpose.

==Etymology==
In French, ''marionette'' means "little Mary". In France, during the Middle Ages, string puppets were often used to depict biblical events, with the Virgin Mary being a popular character, hence the name. Additionally, one of the first figures to be made into a marionette was the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shershow|first=Scott Cutler|title=Puppets and "popular" Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Fg4m1H7EsoC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-3094-1|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the word ''marionette'' can refer to any kind of puppet, but elsewhere it typically refers only to string puppets.

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:5016 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Dolls - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek terracotta puppet dolls, 5th–4th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
{{main|Puppetry}}

Puppetry is an ancient form of performance. Some historians{{Who|date=November 2015}} claim that they predate actors in theatre.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} There is evidence that they were used in Egypt as early as 2000 BC when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread, and other string-controlled objects. Wire-controlled, articulated{{specify|is this a puppetry term?|date=January 2011}} puppets made of clay and ivory have been found in Egyptian tombs. Marionette puppetry was used to display rituals and ceremonies using these string-operated figurines back in ancient times and is used today.{{specify|date=January 2011}}

Puppetry was practiced in [[Ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevróspastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spáō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) discusses puppets in his work ''[[On the Motion of Animals]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The movements of animals may be compared with those of automatic puppets, which are set going on the occasion of a tiny movement; the levers are released, and strike the twisted strings against one another.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On the Motion of Animals'', 350 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archimedes is known to have worked with marionettes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Plato]]'s work also contains references to puppetry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the "common people" in the 5th century [[Before Christ|BC]]. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of [[Dionysus]] at the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Blumenthal, Eileen, ''Puppetry and Puppets'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greece and Rome clay and ivory dolls, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, some of which had an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, exactly as is done today in Sicilian puppetry.  A few of these dolls had strings in place of the rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were mere toys and not puppets due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/definitions/historical/chapter1.html Observations - Chapter One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian word ''sutradhara'', from ''[[wikt:sutra|sutra]]'', refers to the show-manager of theatrical performances (or a puppet-player), and also means literally "string-puller" or "string-holder".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Sicilian marionettes===
{{main|Opera dei Pupi}}
The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood, an art form called "L'Opera deî Pupi" ("Opera of the puppets") in Sicilian. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorî (singers of tales) are rooted in the [[Provence|Provençal]] [[troubadour]] tradition in [[Sicily]] during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of [[Palermo]], Sicily.

===Marionette operas===

In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionettes. [[Mozart]] as a child had seen marionettes. [[Gluck]], [[Haydn]], [[de Falla]] and [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] all composed adult operas for marionettes. [[Lewis Carroll]] composed marionette operas and plays for his siblings' entertainment. Today in [[Salzburg]] in Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own theatre.

The ''Opera dei Pupi'', Sicilian puppet theatre, was relisted on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] in 2008.

===Marionettes and marionette theatre in modern times===
Marionettes are sometimes referred to as "puppets", but the term "marionettes" is more precise, distinguishing them from other forms of puppetry, such as finger, glove, rod and shadow puppetry.

In the UK the renaissance of Marionettes during the late 19th and early 20th century was driven by W. H. Whanslaw and [[Waldo Lanchester]], two of the co-founders of the ''[[British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild]]''. The only purpose-built UK marionette theatre is ''[[The Harlequin Puppet Theatre]]'' (built 1958) in Rhos on Sea, North Wales, Founded by Eric Bramall FRSA and continued by Chris Somerville. Other theatres that occasionally perform with marionettes are the [[Little Angel Theatre]] founded by John and Lyndie Wright in Islington, London, Whose first ever show ''[[The Wild Night Of The Witches]]'' was a marionette play, It opened the theatre in 1961 and was revived for the 50th anniversary in 2011 The Norwich Puppet Theatre founded by Ray &amp; Joan DaSilva sometimes present marionette shows and the [[Puppet Theatre Barge]] continue to perform using long string marionettes throughout the year, founded by Gren Middleton and Juliet Rogers. The barge is based in Little Venice, London during the winter months and tours to places such as Richmond Upon Thames during the summer.

In Scotland, Dr Malcolm Knight has championed the art form and over the last 25 years the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishmaskandpuppetcentre.co.uk/ |title=Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; has acted as a catalyst, a lead agency, and as a resource centre for all those with an interest in mask and puppet theatre.

In Germany, the [[Augsburger Puppenkiste]] since 1948 has produced theatrical adaptations of fairy tales and serious pieces. In 1953, it began producing television series with productions such as ''[[Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer]]'' and ''[[Urmel aus dem Eis]]''.

In Austria the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1913 by Professor [[Anton Aicher]]. Aicher was heavily influenced by [[Count Franz Pocci]] who founded the Munich Marionette Theatre in Germany in 1855. Until 2012, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was under the artistic direction of his granddaughter, [[Gretl Aicher]], who commented on her lasting interest in marionettes, "What then is the fascination of a life with marionettes? Is it the pleasure of performing? The appeal of mastering an 'instrument' to the point of virtuosity? The transformation of one's own self? For me, it is the process of empathizing with mind and soul, of feeling at one with music and movement that bring these much loved creatures to life. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre performs mainly operas such as ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and a small number of ballets such as ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are welcome. There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna. Marionette theatre also had a very long history in entertainment in Prague,

In the Czech Republic Marionette theatre has a very long history in entertainment in Prague, An important organisation is the National Marionette Theatre. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of Mozart's famous ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The production has period costumes and a beautifully designed 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies including, [[Buchty a Loutky]] ("Cakes and Puppets") founded by [[Marek Bečka]]. ''[[Rocky IX]]'' and ''Tibet'' are just two works in the repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;''Czech Puppet Theatre'' by Alice Dubska, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, like in many other countries, there is a continuing tradition of marionette puppetry. [[Norman Hetherington]] OAM, [[Peter Scriven]], founder of the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]], [[Richard Bradshaw OAM]] and David Splatt (Smallpox Theatre) are notable puppeteers.

In [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]], [[Lafleur (marionette)|Lafleur]] is a marionette from [[Amiens]]. The ''[[Cabotans d'Amiens]]'' are hand carved, using wood, with a central rod and strings for the arms and legs. In France, the most famous puppet is the [[Guignol]] which is a [[hand puppet]] created in [[Lyon]] in 1808.

In the United States, several groups have established permanent theatres or touring programs dedicated to spotlighting marionette performances.  The [[Cole Marionettes]] were founded by George and Lucille Cole in Chicago circa 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heise |first=Kenan |title=George Cole, Master Of Cole Marionettes |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-10-21/news/8603190250_1_puppet-mr-cole-carve |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=21 October 1986 |access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bob Baker Marionette Theater]] in Los Angeles is now considered a historical landmark, presented a variety of cabaret marionette shows.  The [[Puppetworks]] theatre in New York under the direction of Nick Coppola has been in operation since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puppetworks.org/Our%20History/our%20history.htm |title=Our History |website=www.puppetworks.org |access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Puppetry Arts]] in Atlanta develops and fosters marionette performers from across the globe. [[Le Theatre de Marionette]] in Dallas has recreated a traditional marionette theatre with puppeteer bridge and full stage productions.  The theatre is open year-round.  The [[National Marionette Theater]] with David Syrotiak at its helm has developed some of the most artistically staged shows to grace the American stage.  The Fratello Marionettes, with its founder Kevin Menegus of Danville, California are wonderful marionette creators and performers, with shows that are well crafted and display an almost Disney-esque quality.  The [[Bil Baird]] theatre in Greenwich Village closed in 1987 but was a nationally recognized treasure that presented countless shows to families for over a decade, including their contribution to film and television with the famous [[Lonely Goatherd]] scene from ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''.  The Frisch Marionettes in Cincinnati also produce some of the best marionettes and manipulation in performances today.  Kevin Frisch has been considered one of the best stage marionette artists performing in his time and his puppet creations are meticulously lifelike.  His manipulation and ability to transfer lifelike movement to the inanimate has been compared to the German master puppeteer, [[Albrecht Roser]]. Joseph Cashore has been touring the United States for over 30 years with a collection of self-designed marionettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cashoremarionettes.com |title=The Cashore Marionettes |access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise in popularity of television and film, marionettes found a rise in popularity especially in children's programming. The story of [[Pinocchio]] and its [[Disney]] adaptation (''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''), which was released in 1940, is a story about a marionette. In 1947, ''[[Howdy Doody]]'' introduced marionettes to children's television, with Howdy Doody (the main character) being a marionette, as well as some other characters.

In the 1950s, [[Bil Baird]] and Cora Eisenberg presented a great number of marionette shows for television, and were also responsible for the [[Lonely Goatherd]] sequence from the classic film ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. Bil Baird also wrote a classic book on his work.&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of the Puppet'' by Bil Baird&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, a program called ''[[Mr. Squiggle]]'', using a marionette central character of the same name, ran for just over 40 years (1959–1999). Another program for children using puppetry was the ''[[Magic Circle Club]]'' featuring puppets Cassius Cuckoo and Leonardo de Funbird.

From the 1940s onwards, the BBC in the United Kingdom, produced a wide series of marionette programmes for children and then created The ''[[BBC Television Puppet Theatre]]''  based in ''[[Lime Grove Studios]]'' from 1955–1964, Usually under the title ''[[Watch With Mother]]'' The various programmes included ''[[Whirligig]]'', ''[[The Woodentops]]'', ''[[Flower Pot Men|Bill and Ben]]'', ''[[Muffin The Mule]]'', ''[[Rubovia]]'' a series created by [[Gordon Murray (puppeteer)|Gordon Murray]] and ''[[Andy Pandy]]''. Later in the 1960s, [[Gerry Anderson]] with his wife, [[Sylvia Anderson]] and colleagues made a number of hit series, ''[[Fireball XL5]]'', ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' and ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', which pioneered a technique combining marionettes and [[electronics]]. This allowed for radio control moving of the mouth of a marionettes. The technique was patented and called "[[supermarionation]]". The programs have been shown all around the world and are now widely distributed on DVD. Anderson also made two films, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/anderson/thunderbirds/page1.shtml |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |title=Cult - Gerry Anderson - Thunderbirds}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s in the UK TV series using marionettes include ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'', ''[[Mumfie]]'' and ''[[Cloppa Castle]]''. Some marionettes appear in ''[[Pipkins]]'' namely Octavia Ostrich.
More recently marionettes are starting to re emerge on the TV screen, ''[[Coca-Cola]]'' have used marionettes to create a series of adverts based in an office and music videos use them regularly as metaphors.

Marionettes are featured in the 1999 film, ''[[Being John Malkovich]]''.  John Cusack played a manipulator who referred to himself as a puppeteer.

The BBC children's show ''Playbus'' (later ''[[Playdays]]'') used many puppets during their commission, notably a singing and dancing marionette called Lizzie Dreams, sometimes paired up with another marionette called Nick.

''[[Team America: World Police]]'' is a 2004 movie made by ''[[South Park]]'' creators [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] which uses a crude, naive, child like style of supermarionation as in ''Thunderbirds''. Matt Stone and Trey Parker dubbed their version "Supercrappymation" due to the fact they intentionally left the strings visible among other reasons.

Also appearing in 2004 was the full-length, award-winning marionette fantasy film ''[[Strings (2004 film)|Strings]]'', directed by Dane Anders Rønnow Klarlund.

A marionette was also used in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]".

==Types of marionette control bar==

===Chinese / Asian paddle control===
This type of control has many strings attached to a rounded rectangular paddle with a short handle, all the strings are attached and hang from the outer edge of the paddle and are used by selecting each string with the opposite hand and pulling to control the figure which hangs below.

===Horizontal control===
This control is a bar which is held in the hand in a horizontal plane.  There can be numerous bars at right angles to the central bar, which in turn attaches via wires to the hands, shoulders, back, etc. A smaller plate is usually hung under the main bar, and this carries the head strings; likewise, a detachable clip usually holds the leg bar. This style of control is generally used in the USA for human figures and is also known as the American control.  A similar control is almost universally used for quadruped animals; as it emulates the basic shape of the animal, rocking it from side to side will control the leg movements in unison.  The Salzburg Marionette Theatre in Austria also uses a variant of this style for its human characters.

===Vertical control===
This type of control is an upright bar which has various smaller bars inserted at right angles from which the head, shoulder, back etc. strings etc. are attached to. This control usually has a detachable leg bar which controls walking when held in the opposite hand. The arms are controlled by wires which are inserted into a hole in the shaft bent at approximately 45 degrees to the shaft and hang loosely with a loop at the end to attach the hand strings, these are then moved by the fingers holding the main shaft. A tilt of the main upright, controls the head and body with a fine nuance, This type of control is usually called the British control.
Another variation of the vertical control is found in Europe usually a rigid wire rod extends from the centre of the head upwards and fixed rigidly to the control, The leg bar is inserted through the main upright but pivots on a pin to allow movement of the legs.

==Styles of marionettes==

===Sicilian marionettes===
Sicilian marionettes are among the simplest marionettes to operate. They are usually carved out of wood and have a sturdy rod which extends up through the body into the head. This rod, and one string attached to the hand, controls the manipulation of the puppet.

===Czech marionettes===

Czech rod marionettes are similar to Sicilian ones though they are more complex. They are hand carved, usually using lime wood. The marionettes have the central rod like the Sicilian marionette but also have strings for the arms and legs. Sometimes they also use string to control a mouth or movable ears. These require more skilled manipulation. Czechs also have marionettes that have no central rod and strings that are attached to the head, shoulders and back. These are the most difficult marionettes to manipulate due to the absence of the central rod. [[Miroslav Trejtnar]] is an acknowledged master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette making skills.

===Burmese marionettes===
[[File:Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette]]
{{main|Yoke thé}}

Burmese marionettes are all string operated and are a popular art in Burma. Marionettes are called [[Yoke thé]] (lit. miniatures) and are almost always performed in operas. A Burmese marionette troupe must have 27 characters, including a king, animals such as horse, elephant, tiger, monkey and parrot, ministers, prince and princess and buffoons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Burmese Culture: General and Particular |last=Khin Zaw |first=U |year=1981 |publisher=[[Sarpay Beikman Corporation]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scUcAAAAMAAJ |location= Yangon |isbn=&lt;!--none--&gt; |oclc=31011080 |pages=14–28 |accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hsaing waing]], a traditional Burmese orchestra usually provides the music. Burmese marionettes are very intricate and dexterous as they employ 18 (for male characters) or 19 (for female) wires, each puppet controlled only by one puppeteer.

'''Martin Flood''' (born {{start date|df=yes|1964|07|04}}) is an [[Australia]]n [[quiz show]] contestant who competed and won on the show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (Australian game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', and participated in the short-lived program ''[[The Master (Australian quiz show)|The Master]]''. Flood was an I.T. analyst for [[Westpac]] [[bank]] at the time of winning ''Millionaire''.  He lives in [[New South Wales]] and retired from working altogether six months after the big win.

Harbouring an ambition to become a quiz champion, he studied general knowledge intensively for five years before appearing on the show, collecting information from trivia nights and also analysing past episodes of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Martin Flood made his fortune|url=http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=100347|work=[[Money (magazine)|Money]]|date=April 2006|accessdate=2007-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909174302/http://www.money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=100347|archivedate=9 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' ==
Flood was the second person to win the $1,000,000 major prize on the Australian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', after [[Rob "Coach" Fulton]]. He won the prize on the 14 November 2005 episode after being asked: "Who was never [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] Man of the Year?" A - [[Adolf Hitler]], B - [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], C - [[Joseph Stalin]] or D - [[Mao Zedong]]. The answer was Mao Zedong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Aussie 'Millionaire' winner emerges|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/11/14/1131951103121.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He answered the question only after using his final lifeline, the 50/50. 

His appearance on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' spawned some controversies, as it was marred by suggestions that he may have cheated.&lt;ref name ="Coughing Millionaire sparks probe"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nine Network's ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' focused on a moment when an audience member coughed as Flood mentioned an answer (creating links to convicted English quiz show cheat [[Charles Ingram]]) and on suggestions that Flood was behaving erratically. Flood, who was unaware of the suggestion until after taping the second episode on which he appeared, was publicly cleared by the network of any improper conduct.&lt;ref name ="No cheat"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood was the last winner of the original incarnation of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' in Australia. Six further contestants, who then appeared on the ''[[Millionaire Hot Seat|Hot Seat]]'' edition of the show, attempted to succeed him as Australia's Millionaire, and all six failed (the most recent of which was Kevin Short in 2013). That was until 2016 however, when Edwin Daly, a 67-year-old retiree from [[South Australia]], managed to correctly answer the fifteenth and final question for the first time in almost 11 years.

== ''The Master'' ==
Flood was a key member of Australian quiz show ''[[The Master (Australian quiz show)|The Master]]'',&lt;ref name ="Trivia master rises from the ashes"&gt;{{cite news

The show was brought back in December (after the 2006 ratings period had ended) with the six remaining produced episodes going to air at an earlier timeslot of Monday nights at 7:30pm (which ''[[The Weakest Link (Australian game show)|The Weakest Link]]'' had previously occupied from 2001 to early 2002).

== ''Australia's Brainiest Quizmaster'' ==
Flood also participated in this special show which was part of a series spin-off of ''[[Australia's Brainiest]]'' but did not make it past the second round. The show aired on 19 February 2006.

'''MySpace Secret Shows''' is a free concert series where [[MySpace]] users are alerted that a band is playing a free show through a series of [[blog]] posts and bulletins. These bulletins and blogs are sent out from both the artist's page and the official MySpace Secret Shows' profile two or three days before the show. The series began on January 29, 2006 when [[Jenny Lewis]] of Rilo Kiley played at the [[Hotel Café]] in Hollywood. The opening act, [[The Elected]], was fronted by Lewis' bandmate Blake Sennett and at the end of the evening, the two played a handful of Rilo Kiley songs.

Over the years [[The Cure]], [[Neko Case]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Slayer]], [[Moby]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[The Killers]], [[Gnarls Barkley]], [[Maroon 5]], [[Sigur Rós]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[DragonForce]] and [[Glasvegas]] have all played a MySpace Secret Show. MySpace Secret Shows have taken place all over the world, including shows in USA, Mexico, France, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany and Turkey.

On June 8, 2008 the series celebrated its 150th show worldwide with Gnarls Barkley, Battles and Janele Monae playing at the Irving Plaza in New York City.

The '''NZWPW Heavyweight Championship''' is the top [[professional wrestling]] [[championship (professional wrestling)|championship title]] in the [[New Zealand]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling]] (NZWPW). It was the original [[championship (professional wrestling)#Weight class championships|super heavyweight title]] of Wellington Pro Wrestling and introduced as the WPW Super Heavyweight Championship on 3 December 2004. The inaugural champion was Ruamoko, who defeated Les Barrett in a tournament final in [[Lower Hutt|Lower Hutt, New Zealand]] on 25 April 1992. The title became vacant when Ruamoko suffered an injury in early-2005 and, after the promotion became New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling, it was replaced by the current heavyweight championship first won by Island Boy Si on 25 March 2005. The current champion is Axl in his first reign.

===Unrecognised Reigns===
On 17 November 2018 at Capital Pro Wrestling's MitchellMania event, NZWPW owner Martin Stirling was seen taking the NZWPW Heavyweight Championship from the then current champion Bryant. Bryant was told by Stirling that he took it for "maintenance".

The following Tuesday NZWPW announced on its Facebook page that Bryant's as well as the previous champion, Wayne La Perfeccion's reigns are not official. The reason given by NZWPW was that title changes after "Dreamcatcher" Phil Woodgate left as CWO are no longer official. 

Therefore, the following 2 championship reigns were previously recognised, but are no longer recognised by the promotion as of 20 November 2018:

The '''NZWPW Tag Team Championship''' is the top [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]] [[championship (professional wrestling)|championship title]] in the [[New Zealand]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling]]. The title was first won by The Superlatives (Jean Miracle and Nick Silver), who won a tournament final at Power Play IV in [[Lower Hutt|Lower Hutt, New Zealand]] to win the titles on 14 April 2007. It was the first title of its kind to be established by a major promotion since the [[NWA Australasian Tag Team Championship]] during the early 1980s and remains the oldest currently active tag team championship in New Zealand. The current champions are The Wainui Express (Hayden Thiele and Jade Priest) in their second reign.

Avalanche attempted to defend the title in a singles match against Axl, however, he was attacked mid-match by Circus of Tragedy who then stole the belts. After previously missing a scheduled title defence at Te Ra O Te Raukura, the NZWPW’s Chief Wrestling Officer (CWO) said he would strip the champions and retire the titles if they did not appear at Bringing Down The House.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3877">The '''Ontario Motion Picture Bureau''' was established by the [[Government of Ontario]] in 1917 and was the first state-founded film organization in the world, preceding the [[Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau]] by a year. Its mandate was to carry out “educational work for farmers, school children, factory workers and other classes,” to promote the province and its resources and “to encourage the building of highways and other public works.”

Initially, the Bureau hired private film companies in Toronto to produce films under its editorial control. By 1923, the OMPB acquired its own studio, in [[Trenton, Ontario]], previously owned by [[Adanac Films]], and began producing its own educational films distributing 1,500 reels monthly by 1925. These films were mostly screened in churches, schools and community institutions.

By the late 1920s, its films were increasingly viewed as outdated, while the Bureau itself was being criticised as having a large and unwieldy bureaucracy. It was dissolved on October 26, 1934 by the new [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] government of [[Mitchell Hepburn]], who had pledged during the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 provincial election]] to cut the size of government. The Bureau's property in Trenton was donated as a community hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wise|first1=Wyndham|title=Ontario's Film Industry: A History of Provincial Policy|date=1991|publisher=Graduate Programme in Film and Video, York University|location=Toronto|url=https://www.library.yorku.ca/find/Record/1115611|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wise|first1=Wyndham|title=A History of Ontario's Film Industry: 1896-1985|journal=Take One: Film &amp; Television in Canada|date=Summer 2000|volume=9|issue=28|pages=21–24|url=http://takeone.athabascau.ca/index.php/takeone/issue/view/29|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter|title=Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema 1895-1939|date=1978|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Monteal|isbn=0 7735 0323 4|pages=64–82; 148–158|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c08BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=embattled+shadows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=embattled%20shadows&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbXCzrd8dc#t=26 ''Tiny's Troublesome Tooth''], early animated film produced by Filmart Motion Pictures for the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau (modern soundtrack added).
*''Her Own Fault'', 1921 educational film produced for the Bureau on behalf of the  Division of Industrial Hygiene of the Ontario Provincial Board of Health to demonstrate the consequences of unhealthy lifestyle choices. The story follows two factory women, Mamie and Eileen, throughout their daily activities. ''Her Own Fault'' is an educational film that would have originally been shown in schools, churches and other public venues.
*''Transport in the North'', 1925 film about life in northern Ontario produced by OMPB's studio in Trenton.
*''Carry On, Sergeant!'', 1928, promoted as Canada's first epic film, a silent, expensive financial failure shot at the Trenton Studios, directed by [[Bruce Bairnsfather]].

In 2015, MP Rikkos Mappourides called for prostitution in [[Cyprus]] to be legalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christou|first1=Jean|title=Uproar over call to legalise prostitution - Cyprus Mail|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/03/24/uproar-over-call-to-legalise-prostitution/|website=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=18 February 2018|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek goddess]] of love, [[Aphrodite]] was reputed to have been born near [[Paphos]], and a temple was built on the site. From the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century BC [[sacred prostitution]] took place at the temple. Every woman in the land was expected to make a journey to the temple once in her lifetime and have sex in exchange for money in the temple grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Andrea|title=It was an ancient form of sex tourism|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20161017-it-was-an-ancient-form-of-sex-tourism|website=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2018|language=en|date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the island coming under [[Cyprus#Cyprus under the British Empire|control of the British]], [[prostitute]]s were required to be registered.  In the [[Larnaca]] Town Museum the 1916 registration book is on display, which contains photographs of the town's prostitutes. [[Brothel]]s were outlawed by the Governor, [[Ronald Storrs]], in 1931, but there were exceptions during [[WW2]] for the use of [[Allies of World War II|allied troops]].&lt;ref name="british"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Tabitha|title=Sweet and Bitter Island: A History of the British in Cyprus|date=2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857731029|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Aqj3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Prostitution+in+Cyprus#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitution%20in%20Cyprus&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to reduce the spread of [[Sexually transmitted Infection|STIs]], the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|Army Medical Corps]] introduced a card system for prostitutes. In 1941 300 cards were issued. The prostitutes had to have a daily health check, and if clear of infections the card was stamped. If infected the women were treated and their card was withheld until they were cleared of the infection. [[Prophylactic]] centres were set up for the troops to attend prior to visiting the brothels where they were issued [[condom]]s.&lt;ref name="british" /&gt;

In 1942 it was estimated that there were 740 prostitutes working on the island, mainly in [[Nicosia]], [[Famagusta]] and [[Limassol]]. Every major town except [[Kyrenia]] had a venereal clinic. 12 prophylactic centres were established and a 200 bed venereal ward at Nicosia General Hospital.&lt;ref name="british" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Cyprus}}
Cyprus is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Women, primarily from [[Eastern Europe]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]], are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking occurs in private apartments and hotels, on the street, and within commercial sex outlets in Cyprus including bars, pubs, coffee shops, and cabarets. Some female sex trafficking victims are recruited with false promises of marriage or work as barmaids or hostesses. Unaccompanied children, children of migrants, [[Romani people|Romani]], and asylum-seekers are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyprus 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271175.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law 60(I) of 2014 prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment. The government investigated 13 suspects for sex trafficking in 2016 (seven in 2015).&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Cyprus as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 1]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyprus 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282642.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Cyprus==
The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] is only recognised as a separate state by [[Turkey]]. Prostitution is illegal, however in nightclubs, "konsomatrices", who sit with, eat with or entertain customers for money are allowed. Konsomatrices are not allowed to have sex with customers, but this restriction is frequently flouted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Sex Work and State Regulations in North Cyprus |last= Rodrígueza |first= Leopoldo |last2= Güven-Lisaniler |first2= Fatma |last3= Uðural
 |first3= Sevin |date= |publisher= The Pennsylvania State University |quote= |citeseerx = 10.1.1.691.6938}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, authorities issued 1,314 six-month “hostess” and “barmaid” work permits for individuals working in nightclubs and two pubs operating in the north. During this period, 351 women worked under such permits. Nightclub owners hired female college students during this period to bypass the cap on the number of employees legally permitted in each club and avoid taxes and monitoring.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;  Enforcement is generally lax, but in July 2006 the Nicosia District Court ordered the first prostitution-related imprisonment. After pleading no contest to the charges, the manager of Mexico nightclub, Mesut Kilicarslan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison for encouraging and profiting from prostitution. By the year's end three more suspects were sentenced to imprisonment for encouraging and profiting from prostitution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

NGOs reported a number of women entered the “TRNC” on three-month tourist or student visas and engaged in prostitution in apartments in north Nicosia, Kyrenia, and Famagusta.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

Northern Cyprus has become a destination for [[sex tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cyprusupdates.com/2011/06/sex-tourism-is-booming-in-northern-cyprus/ |title= Sex tourism is booming in Northern Cyprus |last= |first= |date= 7 June 2011 |website= Cyprus Updates |publisher= |access-date= 25 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex trafficking in Northern Cyprus===
The area is increasingly a destination for women from [[Central Asia]], Eastern Europe, and Africa who are subjected to [[forced prostitution]] in nightclubs licensed and regulated by the Turkish Cypriot administration. Nightclubs provide a significant source of tax revenue for the Turkish Cypriot administration; media reports estimated nightclub owners pay between 20 and 30 million Turkish lira ($5.7-8.5 million) in taxes annually.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

As the TRNC is not recognised by the [[US]], the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons does not give the area a country ranking. If it did it would be Tier 3.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Red Light Center''' (RLC) is a privately owned Massively Multi-User Reality (sm) site that was made available to the public early in 2006 by Utherverse Inc.. Its tag line is "EXPAND Your Fantasy". Red Light Center is modeled after Amsterdam’s [[Red-light district|Red Light District]]. The online community site offers users virtual nightclubs, hotels, bars, movie theaters and stores.  There is a virtual currency called Rays, which members can earn and use for services in the community, Zaby apartments, Gifts for other members, and various other purposes. Rays can also be sold on an open Marketplace for real currency.

The last press release noting RLC membership, in March 2008, estimated the registered userbase at over 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2008/03/interview-uther.html Virtualworldsnews.com March 21, 2008 "Interview: Utherverse Looks to Partner Up with Flirt.com for Online Dating"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

A player can own their own Zaby apartment within the 3D World. It is possible to install televisions with streaming video, or a jukebox with music. One can color the walls, and place furniture. The Zaby apartments vary in size from a small one-bedroom apartment to a large country house.

There are other worlds attached to Red Light Center, the largest of which being Virtual Vancouver, modeled on the city of Vancouver, which includes notable landmarks and buildings. Virtual Vancouver hosts Art Gallery shows, streaming concerts, book festivals, and other cultural events.

Red Light Center offers Community Events, such as classes, meeting rooms, live music with dancing and art-gallery openings. Users also have the ability to put on their own events. In many locations, one can smoke [[hookah]]s of [[marijuana|ganja]] and eat [[magic mushroom]]s, which can have their effects shaken off at the user's choice.

As an adult playground, RLC features a sex function for VIP members. The users are represented by [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]], which may be customized personally to suit a user's tastes, and may be used to have virtual sex with another. Certain areas of RLC provide a bed for the users and cater to various popular fantasies. Users have access to underwater caves, locker rooms, a hotel, and bordello rooms, all of  which are private spots. There are several themed and equipped rooms available for BDSM play. The avatars are all anatomically correct and the sexual activity is detailed and animated. Users choose a position or action from a menu and then watch it happen with their avatar partner. Since both partners have the same menu to choose from, the result is a visual [[cybersex]].

== Roles ==

Within the RLC [[metaverse]], there are several roles and functions which are provided solely by currently active members of the RLC community.

''Working Girls/Guys'' are members that are allowed to sell sexual services for in-game currency, which can be exchanged for U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Working Girls/Guys|url=http://www.redlightcenterjobs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guides'' have the role of helping new members learn their way around, giving tours, answering questions, and helping with minor disputes.

''Greeters'' take over where the guides leave off. The job of greeters is to make new members feel welcome and to ensure that everyone has a good time. Greeters help the members have a good time and party. They introduce new members to other members so they will get to know people sooner. Greeters are a staff position. Ambassadors are the volunteer counterparts.

The next role is ''Leader'', which is a promotion for those guides who have shown themselves to be seriously dedicated to helping the community. They now have the added responsibility of helping the guides, trying to settle disputes, and assisting the protectors in any way they can.

A ''Protector'' is the highest role that most members can reach. This is someone who has proven themselves to be very dedicated to the community; they are essentially moderators. Protectors are entrusted with helping the guides, leaders, and all the other members. Protectors step into situations that the leaders or others can't get under control. Protectors try to reason with members, and if after an ample amount of time and warnings, booting a member if needed.

''Community Supervisor'' is in charge of helping, training, and moderating the guides, recommending promotions, as well as assisting the leaders. They are protectors or leaders who have been promoted to this leadership position. They have the same roles as the leaders and guides, but with these added responsibilities. They also work closely with the protectors and Community Moderators.

''Community Moderator'' was created in tandem with the growing number of members joining the community. In addition to being protectors, community moderators are there to assist everyone. They help guides, leaders, and protectors with any problems or complaints they may have, and act as a main pipeline to the higher staff. They also help with members' complaints and problems. This position has all but been replaced by the Staff Moderators.

''Staff Moderators'' are a special staff position created to ensure a better staff involvement with in-world issues. They oversee and assist the duties of both the Community Moderators and Supervisors, therefore assisting with the oversight of this branch of volunteers. They also provide a conduit between volunteers/members and higher staff as well as handle any in-world issues that need attention.

==The Concept==
Essentially, the "Utherverse" besides being the parent company is namely also the universe or "[[Metaverse]]" that engulfs all of the cities that make up the environment. Cities such as Red Light Center, [[LokiLand3d|Loki Land]] and Virtual Vancouver, while both a part of the big picture, are each separate entities connected to each other by "transport centers" linking them together.

In keeping with its suggestion that there should eventually be "millions of worlds, all of them connected, searchable, and customized..." the company claims it will license the use of its software infrastructure to anyone who wishes to create entire worlds on the scale of either of its existing properties, or much larger, on terms of a franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zarry|first=Zak|title=White Label Licenses &amp; Franchise Information|url=http://www.utherverse.net/whitelabel.html|work=Utherverse Inc.|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has recently released the groundwork for this with its Virtual World Web (VWW) option to its service. This enables any member to create a virtual world of their own for personal or business intent.

The Utherverse social center, is comparable to Myspace or Facebook but with less content limitation and with some dating flavor.

Freedom of speech and expression, within the confines of the law, are a key factor to the concept's appeal. There is a rewards system namely an in-world currency, referred to as 'Rays', in memory of Ray Schwartz, the late co-founder of Utherverse, which pays you for browsing profiles, rating pictures, creating and selling clothing etc. This currency and the vast amount of creativity in the Utherverse is also the driving force of the in-world economy.

[[File:Moreau Voltaire Tancrede.jpg|thumb|hochkant|[[Jean-Michel Moreau]]: Illustration of ''Tancrède'' 1784]]

'' '''Tancrède''' '' is a tragedy in five acts by [[Voltaire]] that premiered on 3 September 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Davidson|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFU0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214|date=2012-03-12|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-68177-039-0|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Action ==
The character names Tancrède and Aménaïde are taken from [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', but the plot does not owe anything to this work. The action takes place in the year 1005 in Norman-ruled [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] at the time [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] was throwing off the rule of the [[Saracens]]. Aménaïde, daughter of Argire, is betrothed to Orbassan.  However she loves Tancred, who has gone onto hiding after being placed under [[Imperial ban]] at the initiative of Orbassan.  A letter from Aménaïde to Tancrède is intercepted and falsely said to be intended for the Saracen Solamir; she is then held prisoner until she can be tried. Tancrède, thinking he has been deceived by Aménaïde, seeks death in an attack on Solamir, whom he kills. As Tancrède too dies, Aménaïde declares her innocence and her love before escaping her father and dying of a broken heart next to Tancrède's body.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Detemple: ''Voltaire: Die Werke. Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag.'' Berlin 1994, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
In 1759 there was a change in the practices of the [[Comédie-Française]] which Voltaire had long advocated - the removal of rows of spectators from the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|title=Voltaire, Rousseau, Condorcet, Mirabeau, Madame Roland, Madame De Stael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzoOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|year=1840|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that for the first time the full width of the stage could be used; a grander spectacle could be presented, with more action in each scene. This change prompted Voltaire to write a drama that would take full advantage of these new performance conditions, creating an elaborate visual spectacle.&lt;ref name="Pitou"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pitou |first1=Spire |title=Voltaire's Tancrède at Versailles in 1770 |journal=Australian Journal of French Studies |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=310- |doi=10.3828/AJFS.10.3.310 |url=https://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/AJFS.10.3.310?journalCode=ajfs&amp; |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his emphasis on action rather than intense exploration of character, the play produced a somewhat operatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voltaire Drama Analysis |url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/voltaire/critical-essays/analysis-1 |website=enotes.com |publisher=enotes.com |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire began work on the play in 1759 and claimed to have written it in just four weeks.&lt;ref name="Couvreur"&gt;Manuel Couvreur: ''Tancrède.'' In: ''Dictionnaire Voltaire,'' Hachette Livre, 1994, p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tancrède'' was a departure from some of the other norms of French tragedy established by [[Racine]]. Until 1760 all of Voltaire's tragedies had been written in rhyming Alexandrine couplets, the normal form of dramatic poetry in the French theatre of the time. ''Tancrède'' however was written in [[French alexandrine#16th to 18th centuries|'vers croisés']] which gave the language a somewhat more natural and less declamatory quality. Voltaire also concentrated on filling the action with pathos, tenderness and chivalric sentiment. When [[Jean-François Marmontel]] visited Ferney before the manuscript was sent to the actors in Paris, Voltaire gave him a copy to read. When he returned it Voltaire said to him 'your tears tell me eloquently what I most desired to know.' As well as for its moving action, the play was noted for some particular instances of realism unusual at the time.  For example after being arrested Aménaïde appeared on stage in fetters, and Tancrède actually threw down a gauntlet when he challenged Orbassan to combat.&lt;ref name="Ardent"&gt;{{cite book|title=The French Stage in the Eighteenth Century|last=Hawkins |first=Frederick |publisher=Haskell House Publishers |date=1969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIPqXRbHUsQC&amp;pg=PA433|pages=84-87 |id=GGKEY:LB24T09PYN0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial rehearsals in [[Tournai]] there was a private performance at Voltaire's house theatre in [[Ferney-Voltaire|Ferney]] in October 1759; following alterations the play had its public premiere on 13 September 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TANCRÈDE |url=http://lagrange.comedie-francaise.fr/notice?ref=00003654&amp;p=1 |website=Base la Grange |publisher=Comédie-Française |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere in the [[Comédie-Française]] with [[Lekain]] in the title role and [[Claire Clairon]] as Aménaïde&lt;ref name="Scholler"/&gt; was a success and prompted the creation of two parodies by [[Antoine-François Riccoboni]] in the [[Théâtre-Italien]]: ''La nouvelle joute'' and ''Quand parlera-t-elle?'' However as a result of various intrigues the play was taken off the stage after only thirteen performances.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Besterman: ''Voltaire.'' Winkler, München 1971, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; 

As well as enjoying public success, ''Tancrède'' was also appreciated at court.  When a play was required for the celebration of the wedding of the dauphin (the future [[Louis XVI]]) and [[Marie Antoinette]] in 1770, ''Tancrède'' was selected and performed.&lt;ref name="Pitou"/&gt; The accession of Louis XVI in 1775 thus offered Voltaire some hope that the court would no longer be so firmly opposed to his return to Paris.  While the new king remained implacable however, Marie Antoinette was better disposed towards Voltaire and in 1776 she requested that Lekain perform ''Tancrède'' at court once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin A. Carlson|title=Voltaire and the Theatre of the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoIaRFoCG-4C&amp;pg=PA121|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30302-9|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denis Diderot]] attended the premier and wrote to Voltaire afterwards with his critical views.  He praised many aspects of the play, notably the third act; he admired the scene where Aménaïde faints when she unexpectedly sees Tancrède.  He found the mute scene particularly powerful, because the acting alone, he felt, imparted the tragedy more effectively than words could have; it reminded him of [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin's]] painting (es) [[:es:Ester ante Asuero (Poussin)|Esther before Ahasuerus]]. His main criticisms were around the reactions by two characters in the play which did not seem probable to him.  The first was in Act 2 when Aménaïde's father Argire appears to have no qualms about agreeing that his daughter is a traitor and readily assenting to her punishment. 'Make him more of a father', he wrote to Voltaire. The other fault he found was in Act 4 where Aménaïde is indignant that Tancrède too is so ready to believe her a traitor; in Diderot's view she should have been able to better appreciate how matters appeared to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buffat |first1=Marc |title=Diderot devant le theatre de Voltaire: pour un inventaire |journal=Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopedie |date=2012 |volume=47 |issue=issue |pages=119-134 |doi=10.4000/rde.4935 |url=https://journals.openedition.org/rde/4935#tocto1n10 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Élie Catherine Fréron]] also praised the play, welcoming the feelings of chivalry which it inspired and describing it as a new kind of spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L'arioste en France - Des Origines a la Fin Du Xviii Siecle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KAovx2J_3eoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA132|publisher=Slatkine|page=132|id=GGKEY:90DYUJW5J4F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorothea Celesia]] produced an adaptation of ''Tancrède''  in English under the title "Almida" which was staged at Drury Lane in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Women Dramatists 1550–1801|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sk1dDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|date=2016-01-14|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-349-26275-5|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] published a German translation in 1802 and [[Gioacchino Rossini]] made his great international breakthrough with his opera ''[[Tancredi]]'' in 1813, inspired by Voltaire's tragedy.&lt;ref name="Scholler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scholler |first1=Catherine |title=Tancrède de Voltaire |url=https://www.forumopera.com/v1/opera-n17/3_tancrede_voltaire.htm |website=forumopera.com |publisher=Forum Opera |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Printed editions ==
The play was printed by Prault in 1760, together with a dedication by Voltaire to [[Madame de Pompadour]], an admirer of Tasso. This dedication secured the assistance of Madame de Pompadour in ensuring that first minister [[Étienne-François de Choiseul]] allowed the book to be published.  Numerous reprints and pirated prints followed immediately.

'''''Schir Johine the Ros, ane thing thair is compild''''', also known as ''The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie'', is the earliest surviving example&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley, James ed. ''William Dunbar, Poems'' OUP 1958, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; of the Scottish version of the [[flyting]] genre in poetry. The genre takes the form of a contest, or "war of words",&lt;ref&gt;Meier, Nicole, ed. ''The Poems of Walter Kennedy'', Scottish Text Society, 2008. p.ci&lt;/ref&gt; between two poets, each trying to outclass the other in vituperation and verbal pyrotechnics. It is not certain how the work was composed, but it is likely to have been publicly performed, probably in the style of a poetic [[Jousting|joust]] by the two combatants, [[William Dunbar]] and [[Walter Kennedy (poet)|Walter Kennedy]], before the Court of [[James IV of Scotland]].

There are clues in the poem that suggest some of the features that the show must have contained. Each of the combatants had a ''commissar'', both of whom are named in the work and sometimes directly addressed by the performers. These are (respectively) Sir [[John the Ross]] for Dunbar and [[Quentin Shaw]] for Kennedy, both of whom were actual persons. Shaw (certainly) and Ross (probably) were also poets, and it seems possible that they played some material part in the performance.

Ross, Shaw, and Kennedy are all three named as a group in the closing stanzas of Dunbar's ''[[Lament for the Makaris]]''.

==Outline and performance==
In the poem as it survives, there are two exchanges. Dunbar opens with a three-stanza address to his commissar which pours lofty scorn on the poetic pretensions of Kennedy and his commissar, describing what must happen if their [[self-promotion]] should move him to reluctantly unleash his own far superior powers; which [[hubris|boast]] Kennedy answers, also in three stanzas, with a direct, highly personalised address to Dunbar, knocking his claims down to size and commanding him to [[shut up|bide his wheesht]]. Needless to say, Dunbar does not obey the injunction and a sustained poetic attack follows (25 stanzas) which Kennedy matches with a longer and equally sustained reply thirteen stanzas longer again (38).

In keeping with the [[Literary genre|genre]] there is a great show of outrageous verbal dexterity and invention by both combatants. Each makar eventually closes their performance with a showy verbal [[Climax (figure of speech)|climax]] involving doubling and tripling of rhymes and much-intensified [[alliteration]].

[[Image:Breaking Wheel.jpg|left|340px|thumb|''Evill farit and dryit, as Denseman on the [[Breaking wheel|rattis]]...'' (''The Flyting'', l.51)]]

The content of the insults involves a wide range of [[strategies]] in mock [[character assassination]], from the low [[scatological]] to the high political. Many accusations involve the [[capital crime]]s of [[theft]], [[treason]], and [[heresy]], which, at moments (especially if the context was the [[royal court]]), add a potentially dangerous sense of political ''frisson'' (Kennedy goes so far as to describe the Dunbar [[coat of arms]] as being a [[noose]] with "Hang Dunbar" written underneath). Both combatants took great relish describing the terrible punishments that would be meted out upon their opponent and the pictures evoked imply the proximity of instruments of execution in the medieval landscape as bleak as that in many images of the time in art.

Most of the insults thrown by Dunbar are returned or matched in kind by Kennedy, which gives the poem a balance in overall structure. The insults are graphic and personal, and were not necessarily arbitrary. Dunbar characterises Kennedy as speaking a barbarous [[Scottish Highland|Highland]] dialect, as being physically hideous and withered like a sort of living [[memento mori]], as being poor and hungry, and of having intercourse with [[mare]]s. Kennedy, by contrast, suggests that Dunbar was descended from [[Beelzebub]], is a [[dwarfism|dwarf]], and has no control of his bowel movements (to the point of almost sinking a ship in which he is travelling). Both cast doubt on the other's poetic skill; Kennedy states that while he ascends [[Mount Parnassus]] to drink of the insiprational waters of the [[Castalian Spring]], Dunbar goes "in Marche or Februere" to a farm pond and drinks the [[frogspawn]]. The [[satire]] may perhaps give us [[caricature]] impressions of the physical appearance and moral vulnerabilities of the two men, even if no actual portraits of either man are known to have survived.

Anthologies often print Dunbar's contribution alone, but the contest was evenly matched; Dunbar may seem stronger on "fireworks", but Kennedy employs greater tonal subtlety.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[George Bannatyne]], in his manuscript copy, added the postscript ''Iuge ye now heir quha gat the war''.&lt;ref&gt;Which means, "Judge here now for yourselves who won the contest."&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Dunbar uses the standard eight-line [[ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]] stanza for his major attack, his opening stanzas use the variant rhyme scheme ABABBCCB, and it is this variant that Kennedy employs throughout in both of his replies. The lines are [[pentameter (disambiguation)|pentameter]].

==Influence==
Kennedy and Dunbar's '''Flyting''' seems to have been a popular and influential poem and was almost a ''de rigueur'' inclusion in Scottish anthologies of verse for the next two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Meier, 2008. p.xcviii&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the earliest works to be printed by [[Chepman and Myllar Press|Chepman and Myllar]][http://www.nls.uk/firstscottishbooks/] after they were granted the King's licence to operate as printers in [[Edinburgh]] (1507).&lt;ref&gt;Meier, 2008. p.xcix&lt;/ref&gt; The bardic bout seems to have inspired a legacy of similar contests, most famous of which are the Flyting between [[David Lyndsay|Lyndsay]] and [[James V of Scotland|King James V]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1536),&lt;ref&gt;Hadley Williams, Janet, ed. ''Sir David Lyndsay, Selected Poems''ASLS Volume 30, 2000. p.257.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Flyting of [[Alexander Montgomerie|Montgomerie]] and [[Patrick Hume of Polwarth|Polwarth]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1598).&lt;ref&gt;Bawcut and Riddy, ''Longer Scottish Poems, Vol I'', Scottish Academic Press, 1987. p.279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators of the 19th and 20th centuries tended to be less favourable towards the poem.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The makar and critic [[Tom Scott (poet)|Tom Scott]] regarded it as a crude and offensive work unworthy of critical attention.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Scott [?1967]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has been broadcast in more than 30 countries worldwide, and was shot at [[Hollywood Center Studios]] in Los Angeles (as was the original series). The series was taped in front of a live studio audience, though a laugh track is used for some scenes. The series is the second spin-off of a Disney Channel series (after the short-lived ''[[That's So Raven]]'' spinoff ''[[Cory in the House]]''); as well as the last Disney Channel series to debut broadcasting exclusively in [[Standard-definition television#Standard Definition|standard definition]], and the first of three Disney Channel shows to transition from standard definition to [[High-definition television|high definition]], which occurred on August 7, 2009 with the season 2 premiere, "The Spy Who Shoved Me," and the third multi-camera comedy (after ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'') to utilize a [[Filmizing|filmized]] appearance instead of the [[Filmlook]] appearance that was used in the first season.

On March 25, 2011, a film based on ''The Suite Life on Deck'' and its parent series titled ''[[The Suite Life Movie]]'' aired on the Disney Channel. The series' forty-minute finale episode, "[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep71|Graduation on Deck]]", aired on Disney Channel on May 6, 2011, officially ending the series.

* [[Zack Martin (Suite Life)|Zack Martin]], portrayed by [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Dylan Sprouse]], is typically the fun-loving, rebellious, and immature twin. He works in the juice bar on the ship as a result of using up both Cody's and his money for the semester. Cody is forced to obtain the job as a towel boy.&lt;ref name="Yo Us!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelifeondeck/yous/ |title=Their blog Yo Us! Meet Cody &amp; Zack |publisher=Tv.disney.go.com|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack does not perform particularly well academically, but he managed to graduate in the series' finale episode. He performs very well physically and enjoys physical sports, especially basketball and football. Zack acts selfish at times but he also sincerely cares for his brother and friends, even if he does not always show it. He flirts with most of the girls on the ship by using various pick-up lines, although he rarely ever stays with them for more than one episode. At the beginning of the third season, he starts to develop strong feelings for a new student on the ship named Maya. At first, she refuses to go out with him since he was a "player," but eventually he wins her over by throwing a surprise party for her. He then surprises his friends by being a good boyfriend. Although initially there is confusion as to whether he loved her or whether he was just taking her on as a challenge, he proves to have strong feelings for her in later episodes. She breaks up with him in the episode "Graduation on Deck" because of a Peace Corps assignment she accepts, but they remain close friends.
* [[Cody Martin]], portrayed by [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse|Cole Sprouse]], is typically the intelligent, kind-hearted, and sensitive twin. Cody performs well academically, is a straight A student, and has shown to have a great interest in academics; however, he does not perform well in sports. Cody has been noted to be ten minutes younger than Zack and often plays into Zack's crazy schemes. Cody is usually picked on by Zack, but Zack becomes very defensive when other people do it. Likewise, Cody cares very deeply for Zack, despite his picking on him constantly. At the end of season one, Cody begins dating Bailey Pickett, but they pause their romantic relationship in the second-season finale due to a misunderstanding in Paris. However, near the end of the third season, they get back together again after confessing that they never stopped loving each other. In "[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep54|Das Boots]]", it is revealed that he has multiple allergies, said by Sasha, a [[Russians|Russian]] girl who lost to him in a [[chess]] championship. Also, in "[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep64|A London Carol]]", a future version of Cody and Bailey are married.
* [[London Tipton]], portrayed by [[Brenda Song]], is the [[socialite]] of the four main teenage characters. She is a parody of [[Paris Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiest|first1=Brianna|title=People Think Paris Hilton STOLE This Meme About “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody”|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/paris-hilton-accused-stealing-viral-post|website=Teen Vogue|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the daughter of [[List of recurring characters in The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody#Tipton staff|Wilfred Tipton]], a multi-billionaire and the owner of the Tipton Hotel chains, including the one in Boston and the SS ''Tipton''. London is typically selfish, dim-witted, spoiled, gullible and meticulous about her appearance but she is happy and heartwarming, and she does care for her friends (even if she can't remember the difference between Zack and Cody). She also has a [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranian]] pet dog named Ivana. When she is happy, she usually claps her hands and repeatedly jumps up and down while saying her catchphrase, "Yay me!" Mr. Moseby fools London into thinking that she is on the SS ''Tipton'' for a vacation, to trick her into boarding the ship. London gets enrolled at the Seven Seas High School program because her father wants her to live in the real world. London does not live in a first class suite on the SS ''Tipton'', but a small cabin. London reluctantly agrees to accept Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) as her new roommate, although she does so after unsuccessfully trying to bribe Bailey into leaving as she did with her previous roommate. The two later become good friends. In ''The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody'', when London resided at the Tipton Hotel, it seemed that she was living in her own bubble. On the SS ''Tipton'', London became more aware of the real world and faced several difficulties to help her when she takes over her father's business.
* [[Bailey Pickett]], portrayed by [[Debby Ryan]], is a teenage girl from the fictional town of Kettlecorn, [[Kansas]]. She is very intelligent just like Cody, seemingly the perfect girl-next-door and has been described as a "small town, down-to-earth girl." She shares a room with the wealthy  London Tipton, in which the two later form a close friendship and end up becoming best friends. Bailey is a student at Seven Seas High and attends classes with her new friends Zack, Cody, London, and Woody. She boarded the ship to leave Kettlecorn, where she lived on a farm, because she longed for the big city. She pretends to be a boy in the pilot in order to get a room on the SS ''Tipton'' because the girls' cabins were filled. Eventually, she moves in with London after people find out she is a girl. London tries to bribe her not to move in, but Bailey refuses. Both Zack and Cody have a crush on her at the beginning of the series, but when they find out more about Bailey's life and her ex-boyfriend, Zack lets Cody have her, claiming that she was "carrying too much baggage." However, a couple seasons later he says that he doesn't blame Cody for not being able to get over Bailey and called her "smokin'," showing he still thinks she's attractive even if he doesn't like her "that way". Cody tries several times throughout the first season to attract Bailey, but is unsuccessful until the crossover episode "[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]" in which they start dating. They eventually end their romantic relationship in the second-season finale due to a misunderstanding in Paris. However, near the end of the third season, they get back together again after confessing that they still loved each other. In "[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep64|A London Carol]]", a future version of Cody and Bailey are married. In the series finale, she reveals that she chose to attend Yale University. 
* [[Mr. Moseby|Marion Moseby]], portrayed by [[Phill Lewis]], the uptight and serious former manager of [[the Tipton Hotel]] in ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'', is now the chaperon and manager of the SS ''Tipton''. He speaks with a wide vocabulary and an urbane vernacular, minimal tolerance for fun of any kind, and is therefore often annoyed by Zack and Cody's schemes. He has raised London Tipton like his own daughter. His repeated catch phrases, "Good luck with that," and "If you'll excuse me," have become his trademark. He loves bad jokes, has a passion for collecting handkerchiefs, and has a penchant for ballet, which becomes a running joke throughout the series. Though he acts as though he does not care about Zack and Cody, he actually has a great deal of affection for them and tells them he will miss them in the end of the Graduation on Deck episode. He's constantly running from stem to stern keeping the Martin twins and London out of trouble. Moseby is a father figure in London's life, because of London's father's absence in the series. He looks after her constantly and cares for her very deeply. Moseby reportedly tricked London in order for her to be enrolled in the Seven Seas High School program. He told London she was going on a vacation on the SS ''Tipton'' to get her on the ship. Mr. Moseby is continuously trying to "court" Ms. Tutwieler and, in the final episode of the series, proposes to her, deciding he wants them to be together rather than apart. In an act of true bravery in the final episode, Moseby tells off Mr. Tipton for having the ship dismantled during graduation; he follows up by telling the shocked crowd that he was already losing his job anyway.

* [[Marcus Little]], portrayed by [[Doc Shaw]], (episode 30-55) is a former singing sensation, Lil' Little, who comes aboard the SS ''Tipton''. After hitting [[puberty]], causing his voice to change, he lost his fame and career. He attends Seven Seas High and shares a room with Zack. Marcus lived in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], as mentioned on his sash in "The Beauty and the Fleeced." He first appears in the second-season episode "[[List of The Suite Life on Deck episodes#ep30|Roomies]]". He has a crush on London, and is shown to be quite gullible, often believing Woody's tall tales. Marcus has as many famous contacts as London does; however, he is sensitive about the loss of his fame because he believes his celebrity friends won't like him, though he was later proven wrong in the episode "Crossing Jordin." Marcus eventually leaves the ship in the episode "Bon Voyage" after choosing to star in a musical based on his hit song "Retainer Baby." Cody is proud of him for this because he'll be entertaining people while promoting proper dental care.

==Production==

===Development===
On February 4, 2008, it was announced that the [[Disney Channel]] was developing a new contemporary sequel to the Disney channel sitcom  ''The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody''. The announcement was made by [[Gary Marsh]], the President of the Disney Channel. He stated, "Our audience has shown us that after 88 episodes, 'The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody' remains one of their favorite sitcoms ever, we decided to find a new way for Zack, Cody, London, and Mr. Moseby to live 'The Suite Life' in a whole new setting – this time aboard a luxury cruise liner."&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcmedianet.com/DNR/2008/doc/SLonDeck.doc|title=Disney Media Net|publisher=Disney Media Net|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004072040/http://www.dcmedianet.com/DNR/2008/doc/SLonDeck.doc|archivedate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series original creator, [[Danny Kallis]] was announced to be involved with the project. The elements from the original series remain the same though the setting is completely different.&lt;ref name="DC" /&gt;

In December 2008, it was reported that the Disney Channel had renewed the series for a thirteen episode second season.&lt;ref name="buddytv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody/disney-orders-more-suite-life-25049.aspx|title=Disney Orders More 'Suite Life' and 'Hannah Montana'|author=Kris De Leon|publisher=Buddy TV|date=December 6, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426122400/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody/disney-orders-more-suite-life-25049.aspx|archive-date=2009-04-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2009, Disney issued a press release stating that the second season had been extended to include a larger number of episodes than the original thirteen. [[Gary Marsh]], the president of Disney Channels Worldwide said: "With this second-season extension, the cast of ‘The Suite Life’ makes Disney Channel history by becoming the longest running continuous characters on our air – 138 half-hour episodes. We are thrilled for them, and for the brilliant, inspired production team that made this extraordinary run possible."&lt;ref name=mores2eps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/05/11/disney-channel-orders-more-the-suite-life-on-deck/18461|title=Disney Channel orders more ''The Suite Life on Deck''|author=Robert Siedman|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=May 11, 2009|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, ''The Suite Life'' series holds the record (162 episodes) for having the longest running continuous characters on air and the most canon episodes for any Disney Channel series.

===Settings===
According to show creators and producers, the choice of setting was made to appeal to an international audience with different ports-of-call, such as India, Greece, Italy, Morocco, the United Kingdom and Thailand. An on-board theater serves as an "organic" set-up for musical numbers.&lt;ref name="Spinoff"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iade5585233ac618013bedad814a85e61|title=Spinoff voyage for Zack and Cody|first=Kimberly|last=Nordyke|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 4, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415023958/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iade5585233ac618013bedad814a85e61|archivedate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the action in the series occurs on board the SS ''Tipton''. However, the ship travels to a variety of places around the world which are often unfamiliar places to both Zack and Cody Martin.

====SS ''Tipton''====
{{anchor|SS Tipton}}The SS ''Tipton'' is a [[cruise ship]] belonging to [[London Tipton]]'s father. The ship had its first canon appearance in ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'' episode "[[List of The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody episodes#21|Let Us Entertain You]]". Unlike most cruise ships it also includes a school, Seven Seas High School, which is a common setting on the ship, as are the Sky Deck, the lobby, the corridors outside the students' cabins and the cabins themselves. In the third season, the Aqua Lounge, a newly refurbished space on the ship, was shown, and it replaced the Sky Deck as the main hangout (although the Sky Deck is still commonly shown). There are also various areas on the SS ''Tipton'' that are mentioned, but never seen, including several decks and the ship's putt-putt golf course, where the captain spends most of his time. In the [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode of ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', "[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana#Cast-Away (To Another Show)|Cast-Away (To Another Show)]]," [[Mr. Moseby]] reveals that the ship itself weighs 87,000 [[ton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Cast-Away (To Another Show)|series=Wizards of Waverly Place| season=2|number=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the events in "Graduation on Deck" the SS ''Tipton'' was sold and later dismantled. Mr Moseby mentioned in the season 1 episode "Cruisin' for a Bruisin'", that the ship was not the first ship with the SS ''Tipton'' name (indicating that the Tipton cruiseline had been in service long before the events of the first series). [[Wilfred Tipton|Mr Tipton]] commissioned a scale model "replica-in-a-bottle" of the first SS ''Tipton'' as a gift for Captain Lansferd.

====Other settings====
&lt;!-- In order to qualify as a "setting", the location must actually be shown, not merely mentioned. If all action is shown on the ship, then the ship is the setting. --&gt;

===Theme song and opening sequence===
The show's theme song, "Livin' the Suite Life," was written by John Adair and Steve Hampton (who also wrote the themes for fellow Disney Channel series ''The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody'', ''[[Phil of the Future]]'', and ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', as well as the theme for the [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] series ''[[Power Rangers: RPM]]''), with music composed by Gary Scott (who also composed the music cues to signal scene changes and promo breaks, some of which are styled similarly to the theme), and is performed by British singer [[Steve Rushton]] (who is only credited for performing the theme in the second season).

The series was one of only 4 of Disney Channel shows still running in 2011 whose theme song is not performed by a star of the series (''[[Phineas and Ferb]],'' ''[[Fish Hooks]]'' and ''[[Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)|Shake It Up]] '' are the others).

==Abandoned continuation==
In 2013, during an interview with ''[[Gawker]]'', Dylan Sprouse revealed he and his brother had pitched an idea to the Disney Channel about continuing the ''Suite Life'' series. The show would see Zack and Cody return to the Tipton Hotel in Boston to live with their mother, and would become mentors to a boy who lived with his father at the hotel. Disney rejected the idea initially, but contacted the twins a year later with an edited concept that retained the boy and his father storyline, but Zack and Cody would move to a [[Miami]] hotel instead, [[Selena Gomez]] would also star and the twins would not get producer credits like they had requested. The Sprouses rejected the concept, leaving the project abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2013/05/29/child_stars_mara_wilson_and_dylan_sprouse_speak_out_about_hazards_of_child_fame/ Child stars Mara Wilson and Dylan Sprouse speak out about hazards of child fame]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25256">The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' ('''TO''')   describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Augusto Boal]] first elaborated in the 1970s, initially in [[Brazil]] and later in [[Europe]]. Boal was influenced by the work of the educator and theorist [[Paulo Freire]]. Boal's techniques use theatre as means of promoting social and political change in alignment originally with [[Far-left politics|radical left]] politics and later with [[center left]] ideology. In the Theatre of the Oppressed, the audience becomes active, such that as "spect-actors" they explore, show, analyse and transform the reality in which they are living.
[[File:Augusto Boal nyc5.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Augusto Boal''' presenting a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]

==History==
The Theatre of the Oppressed, a term coined by Augusto Boal, is a series of theatrical analyses and critiques developed in the 1950s. Boal was an avid supporter of utilizing interactive techniques, especially in the context of theatre. Many of his ideas are considered as "a new media perspective", despite the relatively early birth of these ideas. Since then, these ideas have been developed more, giving them meaning in a modern-day context. The creation of the Theatre of the Oppressed is largely based on the idea of dialogue and interaction between audience and performer. Moreover, these ideas have served as a framework for the development and evolution of stronger ideas.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

==Terminology==

===Joker/facilitator/difficultator===
Much of [[Augusto Boal]]'s theatrical process requires a neutral party to be at the centre of proceedings. This individual is usually called the "facilitator". In Boal's literature this role is referred to as the "joker", in reference to the neutrality of the [[Joker (playing card)|Joker card]] in a deck of playing cards.

This person takes responsibility for the logistics of the process and ensures a fair proceeding, but must never comment upon or intervene in the content of the performance, as that is the province of the "spect-actors". Fairness in this context means making sure that the problem story, which by its nature involves a situation of oppression that must be overcome, is not solved—that is, that the participants (the "{{not a typo|spectactors}}") focus on solving the problem in as realistic and plausible a way as possible, even though it is being played out in a fictional theatrical piece. The result should be something like group "brainstorming" about social problems within the community.

===Spect-actor===
This is a term created by Augusto Boal to describe those engaged in Forum theatre. It refers to the dual role of those involved in the process as both spectator and actor, as they both observe and create dramatic meaning and action in any performance.

Equally, the term "spect-actor" can be attributed to the participants in invisible theatre (who are unaware that they are part of a theatrical production, but nevertheless contribute to the discussion) and image theatre (who, upon viewing the image created, may alter it to reflect their own ideas).

Boal emphasizes the critical need to prevent the isolation of the audience. The term "spectator" brands the participants as less than human; hence, it's necessary to humanize them, to restore to them their capacity for action in all its fullness. They must also be a subject, an actor on equal plane with those accepted as actors, who in turn must also be spectators. This will eliminate any notions of the ruling class and the theatre solely portraying their ideals while the audience members are the passive victims of those images. This way the spectators no longer delegate power to the characters either to think or act in their place. They free themselves; they think and act for themselves. Boal supports the idea that theatre is not revolutionary in itself but is rehearsal of revolution. (Wardrip-Fruin, 352)&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort. "From Theatre of the Oppressed." The NewMediaReader. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2003. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}, p. 339-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major branches==

During the development of Theatre of the Oppressed, Boal worked with many populations and tried many techniques. These techniques eventually coalesced into different theatrical styles, each using a different process to achieve a different result. Boal often organized these theatrical systems as a tree, with images, sounds and words as the roots, games, Image Theatre and Forum Theatre ascending up the trunk, and then other techniques represented as limbs stemming from these.&lt;ref name="TO Tree"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theatre of the Oppressed?|url=http://theforumproject.org/whatisto/|work=Tree of the Theatre of the Oppressed|publisher=The Forum Project|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more T.O. systems evolved, Boal and others have made slight modifications to which techniques appear on various limbs, but the Tree of Theatre of the Oppressed has mostly remained consistent:

===Image theatre===
{{main article|Image theatre}}
Image theatre is a performance technique in which one person, acting as a sculptor, moulds one or more people acting as statues, using only touch and resisting the use of words or mirror-image modelling. Boal claims this form of theatre to be one of the most stimulating because of its ease of enactment and its remarkable capacity of portraying thought in a concrete form due to the absence of language idiom. Each word has a denotation common for all as well as a connotation that is unique for each individual. Each will have his own interpretation of "revolution", and to demonstrate such idea provides a clearer understanding of their intention in definition when shown rather than told. (Wardrip-Fruin, 344). For instance, one can "embrace" another in many ways (in a tight, harassing manner or a loose soft manner), however the word has the same definition of clasping another person in the arms.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Forum theatre===
{{main article|Forum theatre}}
[[File:Theatre of the Oppressed1.jpg|thumb|300px| Participants in a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
While practicing in South America earlier in his career, Boal would apply 'simultaneous [[dramaturgy]]'. In this process, the actors or audience members could stop a performance, often a short scene in which a character was being oppressed in some way (for example, a typically [[chauvinist]] man mistreating a woman or a factory owner mistreating an employee). In early forms of 'simultaneous dramaturgy', the audience could propose any solution, by calling out suggestions to the actors who would improvise the changes on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto, Boal (1993). Theater of the Oppressed p. 132-133. New York: Theatre Communications Group. {{ISBN|0-930452-49-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to undo the traditional audience/actor partition and bring audience members into the performance, to have an input into the dramatic action they were watching.

Forum Theatre was essentially born from 'simultaneous dramaturgy.' The concept of the 'spect-actor' became a dominant force within and shaped Boal's theater work, gradually helping it shift into what he called Forum Theatre (due to the acting's taking on the character of a public discussion or series of proposals, only in dramatic format). The audience were now encouraged to not only imagine change but to actually practise that change, by coming on stage as 'spect-actors' to replace the protagonist and act out an intervention to "break the oppression." Through this process, the participant is also able to realize and experience the challenges of achieving the improvements he/she suggested (Wardrip-Fruin, 344).&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt; The actors who welcome the spectactor volunteering onto the stage play against the spectactor's attempts to intervene and change the story, offering a strong resistance so that the difficulties in making any change are also acknowledged.

[[File:Augusto Boal nyc2.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Augusto Boal''' presenting a workshop on the ''Theatre of the Oppressed'' in New York City. [[Riverside Church]], May 13, 2008.]]
Thus, Boal's current manifestation of Forum theatre is as follows: the actors (either professional actors or non professionals drawn from oppressed communities) perform a play with a scripted core, in which an oppression relevant to the audience is played out. After reaching the scripted conclusion, in which the oppressed character(s) fail to overturn their oppression, the actors begin the production again, although often in a condensed form. At any point during this ''second'' performance, any spect-actor may call out "stop!" and take the place of the actor portraying the ''oppressed'' individual (this actor stays on stage but to the side, giving suggestions to the spect-actor who has replaced him/her).

If and when the oppression has been overthrown by the spect-actors, the production changes again: the spect-actors now have the opportunity to replace the ''oppressors'', and find new ways of challenging the oppressed character. In this way a more realistic depiction of the oppression can be made by the audience, who are often victims of the oppression. The whole process is designed to be [[dialectic]], coming to a conclusion through the consideration of opposing arguments, rather than [[Didacticism|didactic]], in which the moral argument is one-sided and pushed from the actors with no chance of reply or counter-argument.

Boal clarifies that this practice is not intended to show the correct path, but rather to discover all possible paths which may be further examined. The theatre itself is not revolutionary; but it offers a chance to rehearse for revolution. The spectators learn much from the enactment even though the acting is fiction, because the fiction simulates real-life situations, problems, and solutions. It stimulates the practice of resistance to oppression in reality, and offers a "safe space" for practicing making change. When faced in reality with a similar situation they've rehearsed in theatre, participants who have experienced Forum Theatre ideally will desire to be proactive, and will have the courage to break oppressive situations in real life, since they feel much more prepared and confident in resolving the conflict. Another way of thinking about it is that rehearsing the actions helps spectactors to develop their own courage and makes them desire action for change in real life. The practice of this form creates an uneasy sense of incompleteness that seeks fulfillment through real action. (Wardrip-Fruin, 346) &lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Invisible theatre===
{{main article|Invisible theatre}}
Invisible theatre is a form of theatrical performance that is enacted in a place where people would not normally expect to see one—for example in the street or in a shopping centre. The performers attempt to disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, encouraging the spectators (or rather, unknowing spect-actors) to view it as a real event. The Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal &amp; Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during Boal's time in Argentina in the 1970s as part of his Theater of the Oppressed work, which focused on oppression and social issues.

===Newspaper theatre===
A system of techniques devised to give the audience a way to transform daily news articles or any non-dramatic pieces to theatrical scene. The strategies are as follows (Wardrip-Fruin, 346):&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

* ''Simple Reading'': news item read, detached from the context of the newspaper (which makes it false or controversial).
* ''Crossed Reading'': two news item are read in alternating form, complementing or contrasting each other in a new dimension.
* ''Complementary Reading'': information generally omitted by the ruling class are added to the news.
* ''Rhythmical Reading'': article is read to a rhythm (musical), so it acts as a critical "filter" of the news, revealing the true content initially concealed in the newspaper.
* ''Parallel Action'': actors mimic the actions as the news is being read. One hears the news and watches its visual complement.
* ''Improvisation'': news is improvised on stage to exploit all its variants and possibilities.
* ''Historical'': data recurred from historical moments, events in other countries, or in social systems are added to the news.
* ''Reinforcement'': article is read accompanied by songs, slides, or publicity materials.
* ''Concretion of the Abstract'': abstract content in news is made concrete on stage, i.e. hunger, unemployment, etc.
* ''Text out of Context'': news is presented out of context in which it was originally published.

===Rainbow of Desire===
'''Rainbow of Desire''' is a technique and also a family of techniques explained by Boal in his book of the same name. Rainbow techniques stem from Image theatre and tend to focus on forms of internalized oppression played out by a [[protagonist]] in relation to an [[antagonist]]. While in his earlier work Boal eschewed the use of Theatre of the Oppressed as "[[drama therapy]]", he later began to espouse these more introspective techniques as a form of "theatre and therapy."&lt;ref name=ROD&gt;{{cite book|last=Boal|first=Augusto|title=The Rainbow of Desire : the Boal method of theatre and therapy|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-415-10349-5|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative theatre===
When Boal was a ''Vereador'' ([[Alderman|city councilman]]) in Rio de Janeiro, he created a new form of theatre called "legislative theatre" to give his voters the opportunity to voice their opinions. The objective is to open up a dialogue between citizens and institutional entities so that there is a flow of power between both groups. Boal calls this type of legislative process a "transitive democracy," which lies in between direct democracy (practiced in ancient Greece) and delegate democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://ospiti.peacelink.it/giolli/giolli_gb/node5.html#SECTION02360000000000000000&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to forum theatre; however, the subject of the production is based on a proposed law to be passed. Spect-actors may take the stage and express their opinions, thereby helping with the creation of new laws. Some 13 laws were created through legislative theatre during Boal's time in government. The technique has since been used overseas in countries including [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Other techniques==

===Analytical theatre===
A story is told by one of the participants and immediately the actors improvise it. Afterward each character is broken down into their social roles and the participants are asked to choose a physical object to symbolize each role. For instance for one community the symbol for the head of the family may be a piggy bank, since that individual is the one who controls the finances (power). Having analyzed the characters, a fresh attempt to tell the story is made, however this time removing some of the symbols from each character, and consequently some social roles as well. For example, the story would be perceived differently if the robber had the police uniform and the hostage possessed a revolver. Through this method, the participants will realize that human actions are not the exclusive and primitive result of human psychology; the individual speaks of their class as well. (Wardrip-Fruin, 351)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Breaking repression===
Boal explains that the technique of breaking repression involves asking the participant to remember a particular moment when he or she felt especially repressed, accepted it, and submitted to act in a manner contrary to his or her own desires. It is necessary, he explains, that the choice is a particular incident rather than a general sense of oppression. The participant describes that incident, which is then reconstructed and re-enacted with other participants of his choosing. This performance is repeated, except that this time the repressed is asked to fight to impose his or her will while the others involved are invited to maintain the repression.

The conflict that results helps to measure the possibility one has to resist in situations where one  fails to do so, as well as to measure the true strength of the enemy. Having rehearsed a resistance to oppression prepares the individual to resist effectively in similar situations that may be encountered in the future.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

Boal states that the process to be realized in doing this type of theater is the one that ascends from the phenomenon toward the law; from the phenomena presented in the plot toward the social laws that govern those phenomena.(Wardrip-Fruin,349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Photo-romance&lt;!--'Photo-romance' and 'Photoromance' redirect here--&gt;===
{{main|Photo comics}}
'''Photo-romance'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a romantic narrative illustrated with sequential photographs in the style of a comic strip, usually published in magazines and such. The technique involves introducing to the participants the general plot without revealing the source of the photo-romance. Then, the participants are asked to act out the story, which is then compared to the actual story as described in the source. The differences are discussed thereafter.

A particular story interpreted and acted out may be a predictable, pathetic one, however at the same time this result serves as a magnificent example of ideological insight. Boal argues that if they first act out the story themselves then afterwords read the original version, the participants will no longer assume a passive, expectant attitude, but instead a critical, comparative one. They will also be prepared to detect the poison infiltrating the pages of those photo-stories, or the comics and other forms of cultural and ideological domination. This technique is also useful to analyze television programs, a dominant source of poison directed against the people. (Wardrip-Fruin, 349)&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

===Rituals and masks===
This technique attempts to reveal the [[Ideology|ideological]] [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of a society in the form of its rituals. "Rituals" in this sense describes the patterns of human relationships and the masks of behaviour that those patterns impose on the participants according to the roles that they play in society. For example: a man goes to a priest to confess his sins; despite the individual identities of the man and priest (i.e. the priest and the parishioner are landlords, the priest is a landlord and the parishioner is a peasant, etc.) the pattern of behavior will remain the same as other examples of this interaction. This will cause different scenarios to play out even though the confession is the same.  Boal argues that this is an extraordinarily rich technique that has many variants: for example, the same ritual may be explored by its participants exchanging masks or it may be enacted by people from different social classes.&lt;ref name=NMR/&gt;

==Organizations==

===International Theatre of the Oppressed Organisation===
Inspired by Augusto Boal, this Organisation links other Theatre of the Oppressed groups to one another. The idea is that others will help groups organize themselves and create new centers for Theatres of the Oppressed. There are links to other organisations involved with this projects so anyone can contact anyone else involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatreoftheoppressed.org/en/index.php?nodeID=1&lt;/ref&gt; This online Organisation allows others to share information about the Theatre of the Oppressed.

The largest single organisation in the Theatre of the Oppressed network is Jana Sanskriti. Set up by Sanjoy Ganguly in the Sunderbans, a rural area outside Calcutta in the Bay of Bengal, Jana Sanskriti has a membership of over 40,000, 30 theatre teams, and an impressive record of art and activism which has resulted in major improvements in health, infrastructure, welfare benefits, education and social awareness through the region.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjoy Ganguly, Forum Theatre and Democracy in India, London, Routledge, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Boal's ideas have been widely accepted and used by theatre groups in [[Mozambique]] after the end of the civil war in 1992 to explain the need for reconciliation and to discuss topics such as avoiding landmines, voting in the first democratic elections and the rights of peasants under the new land law.
Grupo de Teatro dos Oprimidos - Maputo was founded in 2001 after Alvim Cossa spent six months studying theater methodology in Rio de Janeiro by a grant from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.  It has presented plays such as ''[[O meu marido esta a negar]]'' (My Husband is in Denial), documented as a film by [[Rogério Manjate]], which discusses HIV/AIDS avoidance and treatment. This play is presented in public places - markets, schools and businesses - and the public is invited to attend and present their own solutions to the unequal power relations shown in the play. The result is more effective than a lecture in Portuguese or distribution of written material to a largely illiterate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''prop''', formally known as '''(theatrical) property''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/property Oxford Dictionaries Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817070616/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/property |date=2016-08-17 }} "old-fashioned term for prop"&lt;/ref&gt; is an object used on stage or on screen by [[actors]] during a [[performance]] or [[Filmmaking#Production|screen production]]. In practical terms, a prop is considered to be anything movable or portable on a stage or a set, distinct from the actors, scenery, costumes, and electrical equipment. Consumable food items appearing in the production are also considered props.&lt;ref name="Nesfield-Cookson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nesfield-Cookson |first=Mary |title=Small Stage Properties and Furniture |year=1934 |publisher=G.

==Term==
The earliest known use of the term "properties" in English to refer to stage accessories is in the 1425 CE [[morality play]], ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.props.eric-hart.com/education/first-use-of-property-in-the-theatrical-sense/ |title = First use of "Property" in the theatrical sense |last = Hart |first = Eric |date = 19 October 2009 |work = Prop Agenda |accessdate = 7 April 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041525/http://www.props.eric-hart.com/education/first-use-of-property-in-the-theatrical-sense/ |archivedate = 22 February 2014 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stage Properties |first=Dutton |last=Cook |magazine=Belgravia |volume=35 |pages=282–284 |year=1878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds the first usage of "props" in 1841, while the singular form of "prop" appeared in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;prop, n./6; Third edition, September 2009; online version November 2010. &lt;http://www.oed.com:80/Entry/152851&gt;; accessed 13 January 2011. An entry for this word was first included in New English Dictionary, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Renaissance]] in [[Europe]], small acting troupes functioned as cooperatives, pooling resources and dividing any income. Many performers provided their own costumes, but special items—stage weapons, furniture or other hand-held devices—were considered "company property"; hence the term "property."&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;[[Eric Partridge]] ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English: Second Edition''. Random House 1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macgowan"&gt;Kenneth Macgowan and William Melnitz ''The Living Stage''. Prentice-Hall 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts however seem to think that the term comes from the idea that stage or screen objects "belong" to whoever uses them on stage.&lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

There is no difference between props in different media, such as theatre, film, or television. Bland Wade, a properties director, says, "A coffee cup onstage is a coffee cup on television, is a coffee cup on the big screen." He adds, "There are definitely different responsibilities and different vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Through the Eyes of the Property Director |first=Blande |last=Wade |journal=Theatre Symposium |volume=18 |page=8 |year=2010 |issn=1065-4917 |isbn=978-0-8173-7005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On stage and backstage==
[[Image:Fundus Nationaltheater Mannheim.jpg|thumb|right|Props storage room of the National Theatre, Germany]]
The term "theatrical property" originated to describe an object used in a stage play and similar entertainments to further the action. Technically, a prop is any object that gives the scenery, actors, or performance space specific period, place, or character.{{inconsistent}} The term comes from live-performance practice, especially theatrical methods, but its modern use extends beyond the traditional plays and musical, circus, novelty, comedy, and even public-speaking performances, to film, television, and electronic media.

Props in a production originate from off stage unless they have been preset on the stage before the production begins. Props are stored on a prop table backstage near the actor's entrance during production then generally locked in a storage area between performances. The person in charge of handling the props is generally called the "props master". Other positions also include coordinators, production assistants and interns as may be needed for a specific project.

==Modern usage==
The term has readily transferred to [[television]], [[motion picture]] and [[video game]] production, where they are commonly referred to by the phrase '''movie prop''', '''film prop''' or simply '''prop'''. In recent years, the increasing popularity of [[movie memorabilia]] (a broader term that also includes costumes) has added new meaning to the term "prop", broadening its existence to include a valuable after-life as a prized collector's item. Typically not available until after a film's premiere, movie props appearing on-screen are called "screen-used", and can fetch thousands of dollars in online auctions and charity benefits.&lt;ref name="Mohr"&gt;Ian Mohr ''[[Daily Variety]]''. Reed Business Information, February 27, 2006 [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117938954.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 "Movie props on the block: Mouse to auction Miramax leftovers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021080710/http://variety.com/article/VR1117938954.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;David James, ''[[People Magazine]]'', Time, Inc. February 24, 2007 [http://offtherack.people.com/2007/02/dress_like_a_dr.html#comment-66215834 "Bid on Dreamgirls Costumes for Charity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226152128/http://offtherack.people.com/2007/02/dress_like_a_dr.html |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many props are ordinary objects. However, a prop must "read well" from the [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of theatre terms#H|house]] or on-screen, meaning it must look real to the audience. Many real objects are poorly adapted to the task of looking like themselves to an audience, due to their size, durability, or color under bright lights, so some props are specially designed to look more like the actual item than the real object would look. In some cases, a prop is designed to behave differently from how the real object would, often for the sake of safety.

Examples of special props are:
* A prop sack representing a [[burlap bag]], might have another black fabric bag sewn, discreetly inside the burlap, giving it strength, hiding the contents and creating a visual void to the audience view.
* A prop mop, representing a string [[mop]], but built out of a rectangular shape covered with fabric, so the mop can be slid across the stage to another actress as part of a musical number (as in ''Fiddler on the Roof''{{'}}s song "Matchmaker").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.trinity.edu/sgilliam/SLG/FIDDLER/TROIKA//PROPS/STOCK/HOUSEINTERIOR/homepage.html|title=HOUSE INTERIOR PROPS|author=|date=|website=faculty.trinity.edu|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430152902/http://faculty.trinity.edu/sgilliam/SLG/FIDDLER/TROIKA//PROPS/STOCK/HOUSEINTERIOR/homepage.html|archivedate=30 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[prop weapon]] (such as a stage gun or a stage sword) that looks functional, but lacks the intentional harmfulness of the corresponding real weapon. In the theater, prop weapons are almost always either non-operable replicas, or have safety features to ensure they are not dangerous. Guns fire caps or noisy blanks, swords are dulled, and knives are often made of plastic or rubber. In film production, fully functional weapons are mostly used, but typically only with special [[smoke blank]]s with blank adapted guns instead of real bullets. Real cartridges with bullets removed are still dangerously charged which has caused several tragic instances when used on stage or film. The safety and proper handling of real weapons used as movie props is the premiere responsibility of the ''[[prop master]]''. [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] and other law enforcement agencies may monitor the use of real guns for film and television, but this is generally not necessary with stage props as these guns are permanently "plugged".
* Breakaway objects, or ''stunt props,'' such as [[balsa]]-wood furniture, or [[sugar glass]] (mock-glassware made of crystallized sugar) whose breakage and debris look real but rarely cause injury due to their light weight and weak structure. Even for such seemingly safe props, very often a [[stunt double]] will replace the main actor for shots involving use of breakaway props. Rubber bladed-weapons and guns are examples of props used by [[Stunt performer|stuntmen]] to minimize injury, or by actors where the action requires a prop which minimizes injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coyle |first=Richard |title=A Collector's Guide To Hand Props |url=http://www.racprops.com/issue3/editorial/ |work= |publisher=RACprops |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195326/http://racprops.com/issue3/editorial/ |archivedate=3 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Hero" props are the more detailed pieces intended for close inspection by the camera or audience. The hero prop may have legible writing, lights, moving parts, or other attributes or functions missing from a standard prop; a hero prop [[Weapons in Star Trek#Phaser|phaser]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, for example, might include a depressible trigger and a light-up muzzle and display panel (all of which would make the hero prop more expensive and less durable). The term is also used on occasion for ''any'' of the items that a main character would carry in film and television (which are often hero props in the first sense as well). The term may sometimes be used in stage production, as many props from film find their way into theatre from common rental and purchase shops.

'''''Thomas &amp; Friends'' merchandise''' has been produced to capitalize on the success of the television series ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends]]'' (formerly ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends]]''). Whilst merchandise was produced alongside due to the popularity of the first of [[The Railway Series]] books by the [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] since [[1945]], and the original broadcast of the television series in [[1984]] in the [[United Kingdom]], large numbers of manufacturers have sought to produce ''Thomas''-branded items after the television series was broadcast in [[United States|America]] and [[Japan]].

The most popular and wide-ranging items of merchandise are the models of the characters, which have been produced in many different ranges, some including accompanying railway systems. The [[W.V. Awdry|Rev. W. Awdry]] created the original toy model of [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], which inspired the character, soon after the first book of stories was complete. In 1927, while still at school, he built [[Annie and Clarabel|Annie]], and in 1948, he built [[Annie and Clarabel|Clarabel]]. Other popular products include videos, books and magazines, and computer games.  'Thomas' merchandise has also included such diverse items as: [[audiobooks]], [[Annual publication|annuals]], colouring and activity books, [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw]]s, board games, [[stationery]], clothing, cutlery, household items such as curtains, duvet covers and lampshades, and soft drinks and spaghetti shapes.

Thomas &amp; Friends ranked number one in the preschool toys category in the U.S. and made the top 10 for the entire U.S. toy industry in 2010.  In January 2011, Thomas &amp; Friends ranked as the number-one preschool toy property in the U.K. for the 11th year in a row. Thomas is also a top-selling toy property in Australia, Germany, Japan and Korea. While the total traditional toy industry in the United States increased 1.9 per cent in 2010, overall Thomas &amp; Friends toy sales increased over 47.1 per cent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Tops U.S. Preschool Toys|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/thomas-tops-us-preschool-toys|website=licensemag.com|accessdate=November 5, 2017|date=Jan 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a version of the [[Nabi SE]] Android tablet themed after the series received FCC certification and was to be released alongside the [[American Girl]], [[Barbie]] and [[Hot Wheels]] tablets&lt;ref name="fccapproval"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fccid.io/PJONBTY07SMKG/External-Photos/External-Photos-3086543|title=NBTY07SMKG Tablet External Photos  Arima Communication Corporation|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but as of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} no mention of such a device was made on Nabi or the series' official website. In 2015 Mattel made Thomas and Friends Minis to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Thomas. In 2016, the brand was so popular it was around for longer.

==Companies==

===Pre-Cut Model Engine Book===
The first commercial models released alongside [[The Railway Series]], in 1957, were 'Pre-cut Model Engine Books'. These were full-colour printed cardboard kits whose pieces could be pressed out, folded and glued together to make fairly realistic models. They were produced through the 1960s. Four titles were published:
*"Thomas, with Annie the Coach"
*"Percy, with Clarabel the Coach"
*"Gordon the Big Engine and his Tender"
*"James the Red Engine and his Tender"
The advertisements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Clutterbuck| first =Martin| title ='Awdryania'| work =(includes photos of adverts for card models)| publisher =The Real Lives of Thomas the Tank Engine| url =http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/awdryania.htm| accessdate =2007-05-09 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
on the back of the Railway Series books promised, "Other models are being prepared", although, even if ever prepared, they were never published.

A 12-page "Thomas the Tank Engine Press-out Model Book" ({{ISBN|0434927589}}) by the Rev. W. Awdry and [[Ken Stott (illustrator)|Ken Stott]], was released in September 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Awdry |author2=Ken Stott  |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0434927589 |title=Thomas the Tank Engine Press-out Model Book |publisher=Heinemann Young Books |date=September 1987 |isbn=978-0-434-92758-6 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a new range of press-out models was released, this time drawn by Ken Stott instead of [[C. Reginald Dalby]]. Each book came with accessories, track and a station. The range comprised the following characters: [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]], [[Percy the Small Engine|Percy]], [[James the Red Engine|James]], [[Toby the Tram Engine|Toby]], [[Annie and Clarabel|Annie]], [[Annie and Clarabel|Clarabel]], [[Bertie the Bus]], [[Harold the Helicopter]].

===Meccano===
In 1967, [[Meccano Ltd]] released a train set featuring a [[clockwork]] model of [[Percy the Small Engine]] with some trucks — a yellow open wagon and a red closed van — and a circle of blue track. The model of Percy was a fair likeness of the pictures in the books and was about the size of an [[O gauge]] engine. The box featured special artwork by [[Peter and Gunvor Edwards|Peter Edwards]] and included the title, "Percy the Small Engine, brought to life by Meccano".

The plastic track was advertised as: "Gauge O track that clicks together and includes Brake Rail for automatic braking. Rails specially designed to make it easy to put train on the track." In practice, although it was advertised as 'Gauge O', this only indicated the size of the model, since the track design was not compatible with anything else (the models were effectively 'flangeless').

Adverts for the set, which showed the model train 'emerging' from the book ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Percy the Small Engine|Percy the Small Engine]]'', appeared in ''Meccano Magazine'' and on the back of the dust-covers for several of [[The Railway Series]] books in print at the time.

The train set was only produced in 1967, and is now extremely rare. It is notable as the last O Gauge train to be made at Meccano's famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool, where the Hornby tinplate trains were made.

Photographs of the set and the adverts may be found here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/awdryania.htm |title=Miscellaneous Awdryania (Merchandising) |publisher=Pegnsean.net |date=2007-12-23 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a close-up of Percy may be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pegnsean.net/~railwayseries/percy.htm |title=Railway Series Characters: Percy the Small Engine |publisher=Pegnsean.net |date=2008-04-12 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ertl Company===
[[Ertl Company|Ertl]] was the first company to manufacture Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends characters and sets from 1985 in the UK and from 1989 in the US. Production ceased for the US market in 2001, and for the UK market in 2004 after [[RC2 Corporation]] acquired Ertl and discontinued the ranges to avoid conflict with the then existing Thomas license held by Learning Curve Brands, which produced the similar Take Along Thomas and Friends system.

====Die-cast range====
The most notable of the Ertl Company's Thomas ranges was a line of die-cast models and playsets. The range was very popular in the UK, and the nature of the subject matter encouraged collecting.

Thomas, Henry, and James were the first models to be released. The original Thomas featured a decal sticker sheet which allowed him to have different expressions. Percy, Toby, Annie and Clarabel, and Bertie followed in late 1985, with updated versions of Thomas, Henry, and James with red [[buffer beam]]s to replace the older white ones. Edward and Gordon came out in 1988. In 1990, characters were updated with fixed plastic faces as the "sticker-face" models were prone to losing their faces. New vehicles were produced on a near-yearly basis, such as recently introduced characters to tie-in with their TV series appearance, as well as characters who had only appeared in [[The Railway Series]] books. In later years, special vehicles were created, such as metallic variants of engines, a Gold Thomas to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Railway Series, and a Millennium Silver Thomas in 2000.

The vehicles first used [[pin hook coupling]]s to couple up and create trains. Locomotives had a moulded coupling 'eye' at each end, while rolling stock had one 'hook' coupling and one 'eye' coupling on the other end. In 2002, the vehicles were updated to use U-hook couplings, with less 'give', but they were more prone to breakage. The majority of locomotive models and some road vehicles had a diecast metal body with a moulded plastic chassis and plastic wheels. The bodies were fully painted and lined. They were free-wheeling although the chassis was rigid (locomotives were not fitted with separate bogies), and a steam locomotive's tender was part of the same moulding as its body. Models of coaches and trucks were assembled from self-coloured plastic mouldings, with some surface detail (such as coach sides) being applied using self-adhesive labels.

Sets and destinations were produced for the vehicles. The original playsets composed of playmats with illustrations of scenery and rails and moulded destinations. Later sets consisted of a grey connectable track system, with additional add-on destinations and pieces of track included with engines. The track system was updated in 2002 with detailed rail stickers and a green border.

====Thomas Mini World====
Miniatures was a Thomas line released in 1991. It featured main characters with sticker faces which were previously used in the die-cast range. Included with the character was a connectable block base in the form of a destination, such as a turntable, windmill, level crossing, or viaduct, made from plastic components to insert into the base, and an indented track section which requires adhesive stickers to be placed. The destinations can be connected to form a playset. Characters were also sold individually, and in multi-packs of three. The range was discontinued in 1992. The engines were later re-released as Keyrings.

In 2004, the line was re-released as Thomas Mini World. The characters were updated with moulded faces, and the bases were updated to a style similar to LEGO where the track pieces and buildings can be placed in different positions.

====Gold Rail Series====
Gold Rail Series was a Thomas line released in 1993. The products were from the Thomas Engine Collection Series made in Japan by Bandai. The vehicles have magnetic couplings which can connect to other vehicles using a connected switch. The playsets have a moulded section for track with self-adhesive labels for detail, have ramps on the edges for the engines to exit the destination, and feature detailed trackside accessories.

====Large versions====
Large Motorized versions of Thomas and Percy were released in 1985. These used the same designs as the die-cast versions, and can move when pulled back. A Remote Control Thomas and a Personalized Money Box was also released in 1985, similar in design to the Motorized version.

====Wind up versions====
A range called Pull Back and Go! featuring pullback versions of Thomas, Percy, Toby, and Bertie were released under Shining Time Station. A large wind-up Sir Topham Hatt was also produced, and later a Wind Up series with Thomas, Percy, James, Henry, Bill, Ben, and Bertie.

====Collector Cards====
Sets containing eight collector cards of vehicles were made from 1996 to 1999, similar to the existing cards on the packaging design from those corresponding years which could be cut out.

===Merit===
Merit produced several push-along toys to tie-in with the TV series. These included a sit-on Thomas built for toddlers which had a black handle on the rear which enabled it to be pushed along by the parent, large push along versions using hook couplings of Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel and Percy with Troublesome Trucks, a small push along version of Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel using stronger pivot couplings, a Thomas toy with shaped holes and a set of blocks which could be inserted into the correct holes on the Thomas, and some larger scale battery-operated toys.

===Hornby Railways===
In 1985, [[Hornby Railways]] produced a series of [[00 gauge]] model engines, track, accessories, and sets, based on Thomas and Friends, designed to be compatible with other Hornby trains, thus allowing an easy migration to more prototypical modelling. The range mainly utilised modified versions of existing Hornby engines, rolling stock and lineside accessories. Over the following years, the range expanded to include some of the main characters and rolling stock as well as train sets. During the 1990s, very few new products were made, and some vehicles discontinued. Some characters were gradually reintroduced towards the end of the decade, and more new items including major and minor characters were released from 2000. New sets were also made using a themed radio control operating system and a Trak-Mat system that sets in Hornby's existing lines used, were customers are encouraged to buy additional track packs, scenery packs, and other scenic materials to create the full printed layout. In 2005, the range revamped due to the 60th Anniversary of The Railway Series and two characters only seen in the book series were introduced, Flying Scotsman and Bear. Several pieces of rolling stock, most seen in Season 8 were also introduced, including a circus series with a total of twelve wagons, as well as three tents and stalls. The sets were redesigned using the regular analogue controllers, and a range of resin buildings seen in the television series designed for adult collectors were introduced. New items were introduced during the next three years to tie in with recent seasons of the television series and the special, The Great Discovery. In 2008 and 2009, new sets were made with the updated Midi-Mat system, replacing the Trak-Mat. From 2010, more items were again discontinuing due to their poor sales. The range was discontinued in 2014, but was relaunched in December 2015, albeit with only Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, and Percy as locos, and limited rolling stock consisting of Troublesome Trucks, Annie and Clarabel, freight wagons, and James and Gordon's coaches. The other parts of the range were not reintroduced due to declining sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas &amp; Friends|url=http://www.hornby.com/uk-en/shop/brands/thomas-friends.html|website=hornby.com|accessdate=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models are designed for somewhat older children than most Thomas toys, as placing them correctly on the rails requires a certain degree of dexterity, and the plastic-bodied rolling stock may break if dropped. However, the level of detail is more basic than the 'real' models produced by the company, with the result that the trains can be handled safely by inexperienced hands without fear of damaging delicate parts.

Other products made by Hornby apart from the OO scale range was a range of clockwork 'Playtrains'. The range first featured Thomas and Percy in sets using 00 track. A new range was then released featuring Thomas, Percy, Toby, Bill and Ben, Annie and Clarabel, and Troublesome Trucks, which ran on red track. The track system also used a playmat similar to a Trak-Mat where additional track and buildings could be placed on the mat illustrations. A battery-powered set featuring Thomas, Annie, Clarabel and [[Bertie the Bus]] was also released, which allowed a story recreation of Thomas and Bertie's race. Thomas was unpowered, being pushed along by a motor in Annie.

===Fisher-Price===

====Thomas &amp; Friends Wooden Railway====
See [[Thomas &amp; Friends Wooden Railway]] for a detailed article on this topic.

====Take-n-Play Thomas &amp; Friends====
'''Take-n-Play Thomas &amp; Friends''' (formerly '''Take Along Thomas &amp; Friends''') is a series of die-cast 'Thomas' models made by Learning Curve and designed for [[preschool]] children. The models have superseded the [[Ertl Company|Ertl]] die-cast models range, which has now been discontinued. The two ranges are incompatible as the new models use special 'two-way' magnets instead of the hook-and-loop couplers provided on the Ertl models.

First released at the start of 2002, the models are generally much chunkier, and considerably less accurate, than the Ertl range. Many items in the Ertl range were passable as 'scale' models of the TV Series characters, but the Take Along products are much more obviously toys.

The range includes all the major and minor characters from the TV series and Movies, plus Mike, Culdee, and D199 from [[The Railway Series]]. The rolling stock models include many of the 'special' (non-speaking) trucks that have featured in single episodes, and the vehicles include the members of The Pack. As well as the individual characters, a number of play-sets have been produced, either containing two or more characters, or a single engine with play scene and DVD. Some specials have been produced with a metallic finish, and a few models are fitted with sound chips and lights.

In 2006, two playsets called Train Yard Set and Working Hard Set were introduced. These were`much bigger than other playsets, being more than 1×1 metres. Original sets were less than 30×30 centimetres.

In 2010, Take-Along was bought by Mattel and became a Fisher-Price line and renamed ''Take-n-Play''. New characters were released and the old models were re-released with upgraded paints and faces.

In 2013, the production of the Take-n-Play models was relocated to [[Thailand]] (whereas all prior models were manufactured in [[China]], as were the Ertl range models).  Coinciding with the move, further changes were made to the models, including redesigned wheels, updated faces that more closely resemble those of the CGI series rather than the model series, and other additional changes.

In 2017, Mattel retooled the line into Thomas Adventures. There are characters from ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends: Journey Beyond Sodor|Journey Beyond Sodor]]'' and other recent Thomas movies in this line as well as the models recycled from Take-n-Play. Some of these are just the Collectible Railway models repackaged. All of these models have hook couplers similar to Mattel's own trains that they made for [[Hot Wheels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= Feb 27, 2011|title=  Track Time: Rapid Transit Trains by Hot Wheels|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiN3E1KgDlA|access-date= November 4, 2017|format= YouTube video|time= |location= |publisher= RaceGrooves|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Matchbox-Adventure-Heavy-Railer-Train/dp/B01A9EUP0G |title= Matchbox 2016 MBX Adventure City Heavy Railer Train 1/125, Red |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2016|website= amazon.com |publisher= unknown |access-date= November 4, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas TrackMaster====
In 2007, [[HIT Entertainment]]'s subsidiary HIT Toy Company picked up the license to produce the Thomas Motor Road and Rail range. The TrackMaster engines were compatible with Tomy's Motor Road and Rail merchandise. TrackMaster's light brown coloured track was easily connected to the previous blue track from TOMY by track adapters, which were included in every set until new releases after 2008. An innovation in this range was special editions of certain engines, including remote-controlled and face changing variations. In 2010, the rights were put under the ownership of [[Fisher Price]].

In 2014, Mattel decided to take TrackMaster and completely reinvent it. The trains from this range would now be faster and be able to go up tall hills. This range also saw the track made more realistic. The coaches and rolling stock didn't receive that treatment - they were made smaller so that the engines could go up hills without struggling because of big rolling stock.

===Tomy===
[[Tomy]] have made several ranges of 'Thomas' models.
This line was later reworked into [[Plarail]], a Japanese version of [[Tomy]].
[[Tomy]] did many models, the most odd choice was Oliver only being released in UK-JPN but not in the US. Thomas had many variations, including a talking variant. You can tell the engines apart from [[Trackmaster]] because early [[Trackmaster]] has grey [[Traction Tyres]], While [[Tomy]] has Peach-coloured.
[[Tomy]] Got cancelled when [[Hit toy company]] took over.

====Thomas Motor Road and Rail====
''See [[#Thomas Motor Road &amp; Rail|Thomas Motor Road &amp; Rail]] below.''

====Capsule Plarail====
In 1997 Tomy made a range of wind-up models that 'have an action when you wind them up'. The range was small and included only a few of the 'major' characters.

In 2006 another range was introduced. More characters were modelled than previously, and some had moving side rods. Additional models from the range were released in Japan.

====Tomix====
From 1998 onwards, a significant range from [[Tomix]] has been introduced providing an electric N gauge Thomas system which was still unique in 2007 and which then included 4 locomotives: Thomas, Percy, James and Henry. Some of the rolling stock looked similar to [[Graham Farish]] items.

====Traction Tyres (Tomy and Trackmaster)====
[[Tomy and Plarail]] have Peach-Couloured Traction Tyres, While [[Trackmaster]] has Grey-Coloured Traction Tyres.

===Golden Bear===

====My First Thomas &amp; Friends====
'''My First Thomas &amp; Friends''' is a range of chunky plastic toys, produced by British toy company: [[Golden Bear Toys]].

The range started  in 1994, and was advertised for young infants who enjoyed the series. The models were safe for younger fans to play with.

The range started with only a dozen or so models, and has now grown to around 40–45, the range was (for a short-lived amount of time) available in America, under the company [[Tomy]]. The toys are still available in many good retail toy shops all around the UK, and despite speculation that perhaps the range has discontinued, after the absence of three years without new products; brand new models have started to appear on Amazon.

The range included most of the major and minor characters from the TV Series.

This brand name was used in the Oscar-winning short film ''[[Logorama]]''.

;Talking My First Thomas &amp; Friends
The talking versions of the My First models were first released in the year 2000. The models are more complex than the basic ones, their eyes move, and they speak familiar phrases from the original stock narrations of [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Michael Angelis]].

===Bandai===

====Thomas Engine Collection Series====
A large number of die-cast vehicles released resembled the "Gold Rail" models made by Ertl. However, this series had more characters, although none from [[The Railway Series]]. Most characters from Seasons 1–5 were made. The last new model, to date, is Jack the Frontloader. There have been 4 sets made for this range. Other than this [[Bandai]] had made small plastic toys (as big as an index finger) labelled "Pocket Thomas." There is another series where plastic models (as big as the die-casts) are sold mostly at convenience stores along with candy such as mints and feature more minor characters such as the Mailvan.

===Bachmann Industries===
In 2002, [[Bachmann Industries|Bachmann]] USA made their own [[H0 scale|H0]]-scale electric Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends range for the US and Canada markets.&lt;ref name=Playthings&gt;{{cite web | title = Bachmann expands 'Thomas' rights | publisher = [[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]] | date = 2009-01-27 | url = http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6632584.html | accessdate = 2009-01-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090211145355/http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6632584.html | archive-date = 2009-02-11 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The models are made with new body tools, to resemble the characters in the TV series. So far over two dozen models have been produced, along with character-themed train sets. Unlike Hornby's products, Bachmann's models have moving eyes.

In January 2009, Bachmann announced that, in an agreement with HiT Entertainment, a line of large scale Thomas electric trains will be produced, under the title "Large Scale Thomas &amp; Friends".

In 2015, Bachmann announced a line of Narrow Gauge HOn30 Scale trains.

===Marklin===
[[Märklin]], a German model train maker, released a limited range of [[Thomas &amp; Friends]] merchandise in HO scale. Because of copyright reasons (using Hornby's toolings), they were only available in Germany, [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], but they did leak out to other countries. They are designed for young children as they have metal frames and plastic shells. They are compatible with the rest of the Märklin range, but are extremely basic and have no extra features. They were only released in 2006.

===LEGO===
In 2005, [[LEGO]] introduced the first sets in their [[Lego Duplo|Duplo]] 'Thomas' series. Four sets were made, featuring: James the Red Engine, Thomas the Tank Engine, a Troublesome Truck, Toby the Tram Engine, and Percy the Small Engine. Subsequently, in line with usual Lego practice, new sets had been released each year, featuring different scenes and characters, until Mega Bloks picked up the license in 2010 and have produced Thomas sets of their own.

Duplo is designed for very young children, so the sets have relatively few pieces (between 7 and 62) to assemble.

===MV Sports===
In 2006 MV Sports made their own self-assembly Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends engines and buildings. The range consists of the following models:

*Thomas, Toby and Mavis Three Pack Set
*Percy Track Set
*James and Station Set
*Edward and Engine Shed Set

===Mega Bloks===
In 2009 [[Mega Bloks]] made buildable Thomas &amp; Friends models such as Percy, Thomas and Diesel and sets too. This line was ended in 2017.

In 2017, Mega Bloks made larger versions of Diesel, Thomas Percy, James and a few others in their attempt of "preschoolizing" the toys. They made new sets to go along with these. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.megabloks.com/en-us/brands/thomas-and-friends|title= Thomas and Friends|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= Jan 1, 2017|website= megabloks.com|publisher= |access-date= November 4, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games==
A number of different educational software packages and video games, all based on a 'Thomas' theme, have been released for a variety of different computer platforms.

* '''''Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends''''' is a video game based on ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' and the ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends|Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends]]'' television series released on August 2, 1993 in [[North America]] On [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and September 30, 1993 in [[North America]], and December 31, 1993 in [[Europe]] On [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. The game was developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]] and [[Malibu Comics|Malibu Interactive]] and published by [[THQ]] and was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] platforms.

'''''Thrillville''''' is a [[Strategy game#Simulation|simulation and strategy]] [[video game]] that depicts [[theme park]] management, very similar to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon (series)|RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'', which [[Frontier Developments]] also developed. ''Thrillville'' is available for [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and, in North America, [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].

== Plot ==
The player is left a [[voice message]] by the player’s Uncle Mortimer (Brian Greene), an eccentric inventor and theme park owner with a voice and personality similar to [[Emmett Brown]], who has reviewed the player's roller coaster designs. Enamored with the designs, he tasks the player with managing his theme park, Thrillville. After successfully managing Thrillville, a competitor, billionaire Vernon Garrison, enters the market with his brand Globo-Joy. The player is assigned to manage Thrillville Timewarp, a park with many rides and attractions that are broken down. Additionally, it is discovered that Globo-Joy is sabotaging the park. After restoring Timewarp and undoing Globo-Joy's sabotage, the player is sent to manage Thrillville Paradise, where Globo-Joy is using bugs to commit corporate espionage and steal Mortimer's ideas. After discovering the bugs, Mortimer designs a fake [[flea]]-themed park, which Mortimer allows Garrison to think is a real idea. Meanwhile, the player must manage Thrillville Adventures to compete with the increasing popularity of Globo-Joy parks. Finally, Garrison is tricked into stealing Mortimer's idea and creating [[Louse|Lice]] Land, whose catastrophic failure leads Garrison to file for bankruptcy. The player is then given access to Treasures of Thrillville, the fifth and final park.

==Gameplay==
The concept of the game is to design and build a [[theme park]] that will satisfy tourists looking for a thrill. Park guests must be kept happy by use of [[roller coaster]]s and race tracks, carnival rides, and games like [[bumper cars]] and [[arcade game]]s. In party play mode, players can play all the [[Minigame|minigames]] available against the computer or friends. The player can build facilities that would be available in amusement parks, such as bathrooms, food stalls, drink stalls, and even hat and balloon stalls. The player may also talk and interact with their guests to become friends. If using a teen character, the player may also flirt with the opposite sex. The player can play minigames to gain money, make loans, and hire staff to clean, entertain, and fix rides. Keeping park guests happy will increase publicity and money. 

The game provides missions to the players, divided into five categories: upkeep, which involves taking control of staff to keep the park in working order; build, which involves building and upgrading attractions; games, which involves playing and winning games throughout the park; business, which involves managing the park's finances, advertisement campaigns, etc.; and guests, which involves interacting with the park's guests. After completing enough missions, the player is allowed to move onto another theme park.

There are five parks in total: Thrillville, Thrillville Timewarp, Thrillville Paradise, Thrillville Adventures, and Treasures of Thrillville; each park is divided into three sections with their own unique theme.

The game received "average" reviews on all platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPSP/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions a B, saying: "You'll be extremely busy when you get started. Luckily, the game is forgiving, so you don't have to worry about going out of business if you'd rather go off and train cheerleaders. It's your park; have fun with it."&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; However, ''[[The Times]]'' gave the PS2 and PSP versions three stars out of five, saying: "There is plenty to do in the management of the park and great rewards for success. However, all this is undermined because it is much more fun to play one of the driving, mini-golf, shooting or football games than do all the menial things."&lt;ref name=TheTimes/&gt; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' gave the PS2 version two stars out of five, saying that "A trip to Thrillville takes you on a long, unnecessary detour through Dullsville."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/game-reviews/thrillville/2006/12/17/1166290406422.html|title=Thrillville (PS2)|last=Fish|first=Eliot|date=December 18, 2006|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=April 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407055333/https://www.smh.com.au/news/game-reviews/thrillville/2006/12/17/1166290406422.html|archive-date=April 7, 2017|dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victoria Chaplin''' (born May 19, 1951) is a British-American circus performer. She is the daughter of film actor and comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] from his fourth wife, [[Oona O'Neill]], and the granddaughter of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]].

Chaplin was born in the United States, but grew up in [[Switzerland]]. As a teenager, she appeared as an extra in her father's last film, ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1966). Her father also wanted her to star in the main role of a winged girl found from the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] rainforest in his next planned film, ''[[The Freak]]'', in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 619&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was never filmed because of his declining health and because Victoria eloped with the French actor [[Jean-Baptiste Thierrée]].&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/01/07/080107ta_talk_ross Interview with James Thiérrée, The New Yorker, 7 January 2008]. Retrieved 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaplin and Thierrée had first come into contact after he read about Chaplin's aspiration of becoming a circus clown in a magazine article of her father, and asked her to form a new type of circus with him.&lt;ref name=Ross/&gt; Soon after their elopement they briefly appeared as two clowns in [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'' (1970), and the next year performed for the first time with the [[contemporary circus]] ''Le Cirque Bonjour'', which they had founded together, at [[Festival d'Avignon]].&lt;ref name="rondpoint"&gt;[http://2006-2007.theatredurondpoint.fr/pdf/dp_30370.pdf Le Cirque Invisible, Theatre du Rond Point ]. Retrieved 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, they founded a new, smaller circus, ''Le Cirque Imaginaire'', which centered only on their, and occasionally their children's, performances, and from 1990 onwards have performed under the name ''Le Cirque Invisible''.&lt;ref name="rondpoint"/&gt;

Chaplin and Thierrée have two children, Aurélia Thierrée, (born 24 September 1971),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/326997 Aurélia Thierree, BFI Film &amp; TV database]. Retrieved 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Thiérrée|James Thierrée]], (born 2 May 1974), who are also performing artists. In addition to performing in ''Le Cirque Invisible'', Chaplin has also helped in creating her children's shows, and in 2006 was awarded the French national theatre prize, the [[Molière Award]], for designing the costumes for her son's show, ''The Junebug Symphony''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesmolieres.com/2006 Lauréats 2006, Les Molières, ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103221257/http://www.lesmolieres.com/2006 |date=2013-11-03 }}.

[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2.JPG|thumb|250px|Performance of the water puppet theatre Thăng Long in [[Hanoi]]]]
'''Water puppetry''' ({{lang-vi|Múa rối nước}}, lit. "Making [[puppets]] dance on water") is a tradition that dates back as far as the 11th century when it originated in the villages of the [[Red River Delta]] area of northern [[Vietnam]]. Today's Vietnamese water puppetry is a unique variation on the ancient Asian puppet tradition.

The puppets are made out of wood and then [[lacquer]]ed. The shows are performed in a waist-deep pool. A large bamboo rod supports the puppet under the water and is used by the puppeteers, who are normally hidden behind a screen, to control them. Thus the puppets appear to be moving over the water.  When the rice fields would flood, the villagers would entertain each other using this form of puppet play.

==Performance==

[[File:Water Puppet Theater Show.JPG|thumb|A water puppet theater show in Hanoi, Vietnam. The players were presenting themselves at the end of the show.]]
Modern water puppetry is performed in a pool of water 4 meters square with the water surface being the stage.  Performance today occurs on one of three venues—on traditional ponds in villages where a staging area has been set up, on portable tanks built for traveling performers, or in a specialized building where a pool stage has been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley. M.(ed.) 2009. Drama from the Rim: Asian Pacific Drama Book. Drama Victoria. Melbourne. 2009. (p44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 8 puppeteers stand behind a split-bamboo screen, decorated to resemble a temple facade, and control the puppets using long bamboo rods and string mechanism hidden beneath the water surface. The puppets are carved out of wood and often weigh up to 15&amp;nbsp;kg.

Rice, the main staple of the Vietnamese diet, grows in a water paddy. The original water puppet festivals were literally held inside a rice paddy, with a pagoda built on top to hide the puppeteers who stand in the waist-deep water. The water acts as the stage for the puppets, and as a symbolic link to the rice harvest. It also hides the puppet strings and puppeteer movements, improves the musical and vocal acoustics, and provides a shimmering lighting effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learnnc.org/lp/multimedia/3740&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional Vietnamese orchestra provides background music accompaniment.  The instrumentation includes vocals, drums, wooden bells, cymbals, horns, [[Đàn bầu]] (monochord), [[gong]]s, and bamboo flutes. The bamboo flute's clear, simple notes may accompany royalty while the drums and cymbals may loudly announce a fire-breathing dragon's entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/vniden/2003/08/219962/ |title=The long cultural strings of Water Puppetry |accessdate=2009-01-23 |work=VietNamNet |date=14 August 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223071727/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/vniden/2003/08/219962/ |archivedate=December 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singers of [[chèo]] (a form of opera originating in north Vietnam) sing songs which tell the story being acted out by the puppets.  The musicians and the puppets interact during performance; the musicians may yell a word of warning to a puppet in danger or a word of encouragement to a puppet in need.

The puppets enter from either side of the stage, or emerge from the murky depths of the water.

Spotlights and colorful flags adorn the stage and create a festive atmosphere.

==Content==
The theme of the skits is rural and has a strong reference to Vietnamese folklore. It tells of day-to-day living in rural Vietnam and Vietnamese folk tales that are told by grandparents to their grandchildren. Stories of the harvest, of fishing and of festivals are highlighted.

Legends and national history are also told through short skits. Many of the skits, especially those involving the tales of day-to-day living, often have a humorous twist.

''Wild Side Story'' first opened officially at the Ambassador III on August 8, 1973,&lt;ref name="Facebook" /&gt; and by 1974 moved down 22nd Street to [[Stonewall Inn#Riots|Larry Boxx]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2015/07/03/70349 Article] by Jim Burroway in ''Box Turtle Bulletin'' 2015-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; new Stonewall of Miami Beach; the Florida performances starred Rena Del Rio (Rene Zequeira).&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim Ekemar (January 6, 1976) ''Wild Side Story at Showcase [[Alexandra Charles|Alexandra's]] Stockholm'' ([https://ask.kb.se/F/R4TUDQ2JFSM1M29GJFIEHY2PFLIT4MBVL8MM1NBVQU7KN4363B-02127?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=012142&amp;set_entry=000002&amp;format=999 playbill] registered at [[National Library of Sweden]]) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1975 Lars Jacob went back to [[Sweden]] and produced shows for one of the earliest [[Stockholm]] nightclubs&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra Charles]] (1986) ''Alexandra on the Rocks'' {{ISBN|91-7684-105-7}} pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandra Charles|Alexandra’s]], thus introducing drag shows to Sweden.&lt;ref name="Kalle"&gt;Kalle Westerling (2006) ''La Dolce Vita'' {{ISBN|91-85505-15-3}} pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he brought his ''Wild Side Story'' to the stage there with local people,&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; since a [[Europe]]an [[Concert#Concert tour|tour]], which [[Danny La Rue]]&lt;ref name="Island"&gt;''Island Connections'' [[Los Cristianos]] (April 7, 2000) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; had tried to help him set up, had failed to materialize with the Florida cast because of their refugee status.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; A few months later he went back to the [[United States]] and a [[Receptionist|front desk]] job at [[The Beverly Hills Hotel]].&lt;ref name="Eva" /&gt; On the side he again built up an [[Underground music|underground]] [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] which intermittently played ''Wild Side Story'', with a few adjustments to [[California]]n culture, at alternating venues from 1977 until the beginning of the 1980s, most prominently at [[Thank God It's Friday (film)#Production|Osko's]]. In 1976 his basic [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of ''Wild Side Story'' had been registered with the [[Writers Guild of America West]] by Jacob and business partner Richard Max Mersky of Mimical Productions, and in California they called their show a ''mimical [[Parody|lampoon]]''.&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Rob Stevens (October 26, 1979) ''Data Boy Pacific Southwest'' [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[:en:Eric Knight (musician)#Music Industry Career|Ritch M. Esra]] was their [[stage manager]].

Until 2004 the show was performed more than 500 times in Florida,&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; Stockholm,&lt;ref name="Eva" /&gt; [[Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;[[Michael Kearns]] (November 30, 1979) ''[[San Diego]] Update / L.A.

==Method==
[[Image:Jessica Kilo &amp; Chiena Chinette 1974 Wild Side Story slides.jpg|thumb|left|Two of the [[Reversal film|slides]] used to introduce ''The Dance at the Gym'' since 1974.]]
In the beginning all the songs were performed to [[Playback singer|playback]] recordings; later individual combinations of playback, live singing and sound recordings were arranged. That is to say that practically throughout the one-hour show, the cast carried out its roles by [[lip sync]]hing to pre-recorded songs.&lt;ref name="Eva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Göran"&gt;Göran Sellgren (January 9, 1976) ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; An overdone type of lip and tongue movement enhanced the cast’s [[Satire|satirical]] treatment of the original recordings used,&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt; and of the plot.

The actors were usually young [[amateur]]s from the respective local scenes, who made their stage [[:wikt:debut|debut]]s,&lt;ref name="Eva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; such as designer [[Christer Lindarw]], model Jimmie Kersmo, drama college graduates [[Helena Mattsson]], [[Mohombi Moupondo]] and Patrik Hont, as well as eventual [[Counter Strike]] champion Miguel Bonett. Lars Jacob and his Californian production assistant Rosalie De La Torre have both been given credit for discovering Lindarw, who soon became a big star in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christer Lindarw]] and Christina Kellberg in ''This Is My Life'' {{ISBN|978-91-7424-533-2}} pp. 75-76, 122 &amp; 264&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles and in later Swedish productions the piece was played by professional casts and with enhanced [[scenography]] and [[technology]].

Three of the nine roles call for male actors to play exaggerated [[drag queen]]s, and since 1976 three of the roles are also cast with three real women,&lt;ref name="Göran" /&gt; one of whom plays a [[drag king]]. Suddenly when an audience is getting used to the constant lip synching, the character Tony breaks out into a live satire on the ''[[Maria (West Side Story song)|Maria]]'' song,&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt; called ''Maria in Tony's Thoughts''.&lt;ref&gt;[[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXOERTk-T60 video] (2013) of ''Maria in Tony’s Thoughts''&lt;/ref&gt; Show-goers are also taken by surprise with a staged technical failure where one of the actresses stomps her foot and begins swearing out loud till her number just as unexpectedly resumes. 
[[File:Wild Side Story "America" 1977.jpg|thumb|Steve Vigil as Bernardo and other cast members in ''[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]'', Los Angeles 1977]]
A few more effects, such as loud foot drumming in ''[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]'', [[strobe light]]ing to slow motion movement and live screams in the catastrophic street ''Rumble'' – and intermittent projection of [[Reversal film|slide photos]] (some taken in ballet [[Tutu (clothing)|tutus]] in the gymnasium of [[Miami Beach High School]]) and [[Super 8 film]], have completed the multimedia experience.&lt;ref name="Kathy"&gt;Kathy Riley (July 16, 1997) ''Stockholm International'' [[SR International – Radio Sweden]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded [[narration]] was added in Los Angeles in 1977 to help audiences grasp plot [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

Costumes especially designed and created in 1976 by Maria Knutsson of Sweden's popular [[Filippa K#History|Gul&amp;Blå]] boutiques&lt;ref&gt;Kim Ekemar (January 6, 1976) ''Wild Side Story at Showcase Alexandra's Stockholm'' (see above) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; have continued to be used since then, and the same [[body language]] that the director found in the young Cubans already in 1972 has also been preserved to a large extent.

==Parody features==

With about half the music from the classic [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''West Side Story'',&lt;ref name="Baren"&gt;''Baren'' (June 2000 four segments) [[TV3 (Sweden)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in several versions including instrumentals and comedy renditions, of course that musical is parodied,&lt;ref name="Linda"&gt;Linda Romanus, ''Tidningen [[Södermalm]] / Nöjesrepubliken'', 24. Juni 2000, S. 22&lt;/ref&gt; especially its suicidal ''[[Romeo and Juliet ]]'' theme.

Other songs are included with [[Bette Midler]], [[La Lupe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alma Cogan]] (material provided by [[Adam Faith]]), [[Patti Page]] and [[Peggy Lee]],&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linda" /&gt; as well as spicy comments from old [[Mae West]] movie scenes,&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Göran" /&gt; all creating vital parts of the lampoon. In the [[Finale (music)|finale]], a [[Las Vegas]] performance by [[Diana Ross]] of ''[[Somewhere (song)|Somewhere]]'' comes up, where she quotes "Doctor [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]" and his dream, while [[slot machine]]s are making huge money for the hotel. School dancing, sexual and other [[stereotype]]s, senseless violence, [[Lovesickness|lovesick]] carelessness causing blond drunkenness, [[hippie]] [[hypocrisy]] and the type of [[comedy of errors]] reminiscent of [[Oscar Wilde]] are also parodied. Pick-pockets, male and female [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] pigs, obstructive false eyelashes, mistaken murder and misplaced false boobs are additional spoofed elements.&lt;ref name="Baren" /&gt;

==Plot==
The central character José ''Maria'' González dresses up so cleverly as a woman, to try to get a job in a drag show, that Tony falls indiscriminately in love, which leads to the main comedy confusion in the plot,&lt;ref name="Linda" /&gt; and an opening for the cast to satire ''Romeo and Juliet'' rather severely. 
[[Image:Helena Mattsson "You Don't Know What Love Is" Wild Side Story 2003.jpg|left|thumb|[[Helena Mattsson]]'s ''[[Angst]]'' as a deserted Betty-Sue in ''[[You Don't Know What Love Is]]'' 2003]]
Competing for that work, and creating a side plot, are two [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] drag queens Consuelo and Obvióla who make the misunderstood star's life in New York even more miserable, doing ''[[Maria (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|A Problem Like Maria]]'' in stolen [[Religious habit|nuns’ habits]],&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt; while Tony stumbles through the streets&lt;ref&gt;Kim Ekemar (January 6, 1976) ''Wild Side Story at Showcase Alexandra's Stockholm'' (see above) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and sings (even in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or [[German language|German]] when called for): "Maria, I would never have known or guessed it, but she really is rather flat-chested …".&lt;ref&gt;[[YouTube]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNFoJlkhBhQ video] (1997) of ''Maria in Tony’s Thoughts''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mimed [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim]] lyrics are re-performed with new meaning when Maria feels "[[I Feel Pretty|pretty and witty and gay]]" and "hardly can believe I’m real" or an infuriated Anita (to a [[Carol Burnett]] version) shouts "[[A Boy Like That|stick to your own kind]]!". A reinterpretation of the ''[[Tonight (1956 song)|Tonight]]'' song has Tony torn between self-destructive love pangs and ensuing [[Human body|anatomical]] suspicion, while Maria to the audience begins to regret causing so much trouble, just to find employment, and finally removes his girl clothes and make-up.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; [[Shirley Bassey]] supplies the lyric in the [[Drag queen|drag show]] favorite ''This Is My Life''. In ''Wild Side Story'' the singer’s famous female voice gradually becomes secondary to an increasingly reclaimed masculinity performed by the actor.

Eventually, Maria's brother Bernardo and Tony himself and his dumped girlfriend Betty-Sue, created especially for ''Wild Side Story'', all get killed, but they arise from the dead when a fabulously attired soul goddess invokes the spirit of Dr. King (see above) to bring everyone back to life for a ''happy-go-lucky'' ending.

==Reception==
[[File:Wild Side Story 1974 Tampa Tour group (2).jpg|thumb|1974 cast members Rena Del Rio, Logan Carter, Peaches Del Monte and Tony Del Valle on tour in [[Tampa]]]]
Two of the young Cuban men in the first cast were so convincing as women that a serious and reputable [[Miami]] periodical did a cover story on them as "women who look like women and smell like women and wear frills and satin and ruffles and lace … featuring two such dedicated lovelies modeling the latest in feminine fashions for real women".&lt;ref&gt;Ella Smilkstein (February 1974) ''The [[Miami]] Magazine'' 24:14, cover &amp; pp. 2, 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; The first show‘s eventual success has been described by eyewitnesses as "a smash hit … Florida’s great names in female impersonation acted out their bizarre rolls in this bizarre story so the audiences screamed".&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt;

In Stockholm in the autumn of 1975 Lars Jacob, with [[Anders Eljas]] as his debuting band leader and [[Graham Tainton]] as his choreographer, had already succeeded well with his first cabaret ''AlexCab'',&lt;ref&gt;Lisbeth Borger-Bendegard (September 14, 1975) ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]] / I vimlet'' p. 20; (October 24, 1975) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lasse (November 21, 1975) ''[[Expressen#GT|Göteborgs-Tidningen]]'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; where drag numbers of an American type were performed for the first time in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Kalle" /&gt; Respected critic [[Poppius journalistskola|Sten Hedman]] in 1976 called Jacob’s next production ''Wild Side Story'' the "best show in town … decadent, fun, exciting, talented", with the soon famous [[Christer Lindarw]], playing Obvióla, almost [[Prophecy|prophetically]] named as the best in the show.&lt;ref&gt;[[Poppius journalistskola|Sten Hedman]] (January 14, 1976) ''Damernas Värld'' [[Stockholm]] p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Writers in major newspapers like ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' and '' [[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' noticeably had a hard time knowing whether to praise or bash such a totally new phenomenon as ''Wild Side Story'', and their reviews came out somewhat perplexed.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Hedlund (January 17, 1976) ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The latter of the two did single out Steve Vigil in the leading role, as well as [[Ulla Jones]] as Betty-Sue and [[Cabaret#Swedish cabaret (from 1970s)|Agneta Lindén]] as Anita, for charisma and knowhow.&lt;ref name="Göran" /&gt; (Vigil had seen ''Wild Side Story'' in Florida as early as 1974 and went on after Stockholm to play Bernardo in the California production 1977-1980.)&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;   
[[File:Steve Vigil &amp; Lars Jacob 1974.jpg|left|thumb|Steve Vigil and Lars Jacob at the ''Miss [[David Atlanta|David]] Pageant'' in Florida in 1974.]]
A few years later in Los Angeles, journalist [[Michael Kearns]] headlined his review with ''Wild Side Story'' as "the talk of the town", mentioned celebrities in the audience (such as [[Lehman Engel]] and [[Boz Scaggs]]) and added "the most unusual thing you’ve ever seen",&lt;ref name="Michael" /&gt; while a local gay magazine called it a "fun, campy evening’s entertainment" and "the cast is lively and Jacob’s direction is fast paced … a dashing Tony … beautiful, touching, tender Maria …" and the two drag queens "the riotous part of the show".&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;

[[File:Wild Side Story Spain Tour 2000 (1).jpg|thumb|Cast members in [[Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria]] in Spain in 2000]]
In 1997, again in Stockholm, reviewers made comments like "a completely wild evening"&lt;ref name="Eva" /&gt; and "a hilarious parody, an inspiring show of ingenuity, an alternative hysterical",&lt;ref name="Kathy" /&gt; and in Spain in 2000 the show’s  and its director’s histories were highlighted advantageously.&lt;ref name="Island" /&gt; Later that year another Stockholm writer for the first time called ''Wild Side Story'' a "[[Cult following|cult show]]".&lt;ref name="Linda" /&gt; In 2003 and 2004 the capital city‘s tourism people in their magazine called the piece "a cult classic … wonderful evening of singing, dancing and music in a fast-paced parody", with "laughter, fun, pantomime, dancing and music, ''Wild Side Story'' pokes fun at the foibles of human behavior and much more".&lt;ref&gt;''What’s On'' by the City of [[Stockholm]] (July 2003) p. 16; (July 2004) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the drag queens were noted by Sweden’s leading [[gay]] publication as played by "rather beefy guys with hairy armpits".&lt;ref&gt;''[[QX (magazine)|QX]]'' (August 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core themes==
[[File:Lars Jacob, Gert Fylking &amp; Wild Side Story cast 1997.jpg|thumb|Lars Jacob with 1997 cast members at the end of a TV interview conducted by [[Gert Fylking]]]]
Lars Jacob has been interviewed on television in Sweden about ''Wild Side Story''. In a live broadcast for the public access station [[List of television stations in Sweden#Public access stations|Öppna Kanalen]] in 1997 he said: "Since I was 13-14 years old I’ve always found it so confusing with all the sexual [[hypocrisy]] we have in society, and religious hypocrisy and political hypocrisy, so I’m an anti-hypocrisy fanatic – that’s the only thing I’m fanatic about, being against hypocrisy – so that makes it great fun to joke around with double standards and the over-[[Romance (love)|romantization]] of society, which means that young people hardly have a chance to make it, with all this propaganda we have for romance.“&lt;ref&gt;[[List of television stations in Sweden#Public access stations|Öppna Kanalen]] Stockholm (July 22, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Again in 2000 he appeared as the director of ''Wild Side Story'' on [[TV3 (Sweden)|Channel 3]] in four segments of a popular TV series by [[Strix (TV production company)|Strix]] (''[[The Bar (TV series)|Baren]]''), where he said "there’s nothing really lewd in the show, but there’s a lot of fun poked at sexuality and romance and ''True Love'' and all that", and speaking of yet another brave cast of his, "I think it‘s great with people who dare, and people who make something special out of life, not like [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland|Princess Madeleine]] like 'I want to live a regular life' – huh? My God! She belongs to five of the most unusual families in the world, this girl, and the poor thing is forced to say things like 'I want to live a regular life'!".&lt;ref name="Baren" /&gt;

'''Rosella O'Connor Russell''' (October 24, 1883 - February 1, 1952) was a [[vaudeville]] star from about 1912 to the late 1940s on the [[Columbia circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', many articles advertising Columbia circuit shows.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Possibly Zella O. Russell 24 Oct 1883	Worcester, Massachusetts--&gt;

==Biography==
She was born in the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] area of [[Massachusetts]] and began her career as a pianist in the [[Silent film|silent movie]] theaters the Palace and the Dreamland in the [[Boston]] area. She moved into vaudeville, joining Al Reeves show "Big Burlesque Review" both with a piano act and acting in light [[comedy routine]]s. Her piano specialty was playing pop tunes of the day in a classical arrangement. Her playing was so popular that it often "stopped" the show, the audience demanding she keep playing. Newspaper profiles of the day credit her with attending the [[New England Conservatory of Music]], but this cannot be confirmed by their records.

She married [[Harry Kennedy Morton]], a fellow vaudevillian.&lt;ref name=morton&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Harry K. Morton, Ex-Vaudevillian. Musical Comedy Player in 1920's Dies.

She died in February 1, 1952 in the [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] area.  Her husband died in May 1956.&lt;ref name=morton/&gt;
