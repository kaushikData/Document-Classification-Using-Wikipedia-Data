[[File:Ali-chamsi-wikipedia-1.jpg|thumb|elder Egyptian statesman]]

'''Ali Shamsi Pasha''' (also spelled Shamsy, Shemsi, or Chamsi) was an Egyptian statesman.

==Life==
He was born in [[Egypt]] in 1885 the scion of senior members of the Tufenkjians, an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] mounted military corps dating back to the 17th century when Egypt was ruled by ''walis'' or governors appointed by the [[sultan]] in [[Istanbul]].

===Family===
Among Ali's ancestors we find the five Tufenkjian brothers who were exiled to the [[Hedjaz]] in 1768 for their attempt at toppling the incumbent governor. Wrapping up four generations of righteous Tufenkjian officers, Ali Shamsi's ancestor, ''Serwan-Pasha'' Mohammed Tufkenjian-Shamsi, was [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Mohammed Ali Pasha]]. Having recently restored the Timraz al-Ahmadi Mosque in Cairo's Darb al-Shamsi (Sayeda Zeinab district), Mohammed was buried therein circa 1817. The mosque had already been renovated the previous century by Mohammed's uncle ''al-Sharif'' Hassan Tufenkjian-Shamsi, a devout member of the [[Sufi]] al-Qadiriyah Order founded by his maternal ancestor Abdel Qader al-Jilani.

In addition to being a leading industrialist and head of the [[Ashraaf syndicate]] in his Delta province, Ali Shamsi's father, [[Amin Shamsi Pasha]], was also Sharkia's ''[[ser-tujar]],'' or  merchant provost, as well as its recurring representative to the Egyptian legislature up to 1913 despite his much publicized imprisonment for his decisive support of the failed 1882 [[Orabi Revolt]].

===Role in Politics===
As Amin pasha exits the scene, Ali Shamsi Pasha takes over his father's seat at the legislature in 1914. His mission was to define the concept of a distinct Egyptian people blended out of an ethnic mix of [[Copts]], [[Fellah]]s, [[Bedouin]]s, [[Circassians]], Turks, [[Balkans]], Levantine, [[Kurds]] and [[Nubians]].

===Exile===
He was subsequently exiled to Europe for his political convictions he returns triumphantly several years later to cofound with [[Saad Zaghloul]] Pasha the nationalist [[Wafd Party]]. Ali Shamsi MP became in turn minister of finance and later education and was a sometime candidate to the post of prime minister. He was also Egypt's first representative to the [[League of Nations]]. He would later head the National Bank of Egypt (functioned as a Central bank at the time) which heretofore was traditionally chaired by a Briton.

Having spent most of his student and [[exile]] years in [[Switzerland]], Ali Shamsi Pasha wed Helene Emile Burnet at Geneva's Eaux Vives neighborhood on 15 August 1928. Absenting himself from the political scene, he joined the board of several leading companies, including the Paris-based [[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]] up until its nationalization in 1956.

==Death==
Ali Shamsi died in February 1962.

==Political relations==
To be noted three of Ali Shamsi's nephews spent time in jail for their political beliefs. [[Hussein-Zulfiqar Sabry]], a disillusioned [[welterweight]] prizefighter and brash [[World War II]] military-plane hijacker, strived for Sudan's independence prior to becoming the nation's de facto foreign policy chief. Wing Commander [[Ali Sabry]] poised at the epicenter of power, first as prime minister and later as party boss only to be outfoxed by his nemesis [[Anwar al-Sadat]]. [[Wahid Raafat]], a civil rights advocate calling for a constitutional democracy and the return of the military to their barracks. Later, he would confound the neo-Wafd and play a crucial role in the landmark [[Taba, Egypt|Taba]] arbitration.

The 25th anniversary of the AAW was celebrated in 2011 at the annual symposium held in Saint Paul. Phil McDonald is executive director of the organization.

==Mission and background==
The AAW states: "''Our purpose is to foster a wider understanding and appreciation of lathe-turning as a traditional and contemporary craft and a form of art among the general public and amateur, part-time, and professional woodturners. This will be accomplished by providing education, information, organization, technical assistance, and publications related to woodturning''." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodturner.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodturning, which has experienced exceptional growth and interest since AAW's founding, is a pursuit that goes back 4,000 years in human history – using craft’s most organic material, wood, as its primary medium. Woodturners create utilitarian, artistic, and sculptural wooden objects on mechanical lathes. The craft differs from most other forms of woodworking in that the wood stock rotates rapidly while sharpened cutting skews, gouges, and other tools are maneuvered by hand to shape the material.

Membership in AAW brings a variety of benefits, including a bimonthly magazine, insurance coverage, scholarships, national symposiums, educational opportunities for newcomers and youth, and a website where turners can display and market their woodturnings.

The AAW was founded at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts[http://www.arrowmont.org] in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and remains closely affiliated with that institution, as well as with the John C. Campbell Folk School[http://www.folkschool.org] in Brasstown, North Carolina, and the Anderson Ranch[http://www.andersonranch.org] in Snowmass Village, Colorado.

==Organization==
The AAW, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, is administered by a nine-member Board of Directors, all volunteers who serve three-year terms. Three board members are elected by the full membership each year and begin their terms in January. The Board employs an executive director and an editor, and appoints a Board of Advisors along with various committee members serving specific purposes, such as organizing the national symposium and overseeing AAW financial grants to clubs and individuals.

==''American Woodturner'' Journal==
The AAW magazine, ''American Woodturner'', is published in print and online editions six times a year. Subscriptions to the journal are included with AAW membership, and individual copies are available on newsstands. Members may view all issues online. The publication contains articles aimed at both novice woodturners as well as intermediate craftspersons and professionals.

==Chapters==
The AAW is affiliated with more than 350 local chapters, or clubs, and three "virtual" chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodturner.org/community/chapters/LocalChapters.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140039/http://www.woodturner.org/community/chapters/LocalChapters.asp |archive-date=2010-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local chapters are primarily in the United States but encompass groups in many other nations, including Canada, England, New Zealand, Taiwan, [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]. Virtual chapters are not geographically based but are organized around specific woodturning techniques. The three virtual chapters include the Ornamental Turners International, Segmented Woodturners, and Pen Turners [http://www.principallypens.com www.principallypens.com]. Ornamental woodturners specialize in the use of an [[Lathe#Ornamental_turning_lathes|ornamental lathe]] such as the [[Rose engine lathe]]. [[Segmented turning|Segmented woodturning]] involves joining individual pieces of wood together prior to turning to create intricate patterns and dramatic visual effects. Pen turners specialize in making pens and other writing instruments out of both wood and synthetic materials.

==Symposium==
Annual symposiums have been sponsored and organized by the AAW each year since 1987, alternating in cities around the United States. The first symposium was held in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]] in 1987. The symposium will be in Kansas City in 2017 and Portland in 2018. The gathering typically includes live presentations, an auction of selected woodturnings, an instant gallery that showcases current woodturning craft, a rotation of how-to and hands-on demonstrations, the world's largest trade show of commercial woodturning vendors, and a youth training center.

==AAW Gallery of Wood Art==
[[File:Gallery of Wood Art.jpg|thumb|right|The AAW Gallery of Wood Art]]
The AAW operates the '''AAW Gallery of Wood Art''' [http://www.galleryofwoodart.org www.galleryofwoodart.org] in Saint Paul's historic [[Landmark Center (St. Paul)|Landmark Center]]. The gallery features changing exhibits of art of all kinds made from wood, and there also is a gift shop. Admission is free to the gallery, which is open daily except Monday and Saturday.
The AAW works in partnership with Collectors of Wood Art[http://www.collectorsofwoodart.org] to promote the development and appreciation of studio wood art among collectors, artists, educators, art critics, galleries, museums, and the general public.

'''Anson Greene Phelps Dodge''' (August 25, 1834 &amp;ndash; May 28, 1918) was an [[Americans|American]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] lumber dealer and political figure. He represented [[York North]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1872 to 1874 as a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] member.&lt;ref name="parl"&gt;{{Canadian Parliament links|ID=6518|nolist=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="parl"/&gt; the son of [[William E. Dodge]]&lt;ref name="morgan"/&gt; and Melissa Phelps,&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Canadian Directory of Parliament 1867-1967 |last=Johnson |first=J.K. |year=1968 |publisher=Public Archives of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; and educated in [[England]]. He married Rebecca Wainwright Grew (1836–1925) in 1859. In 1872, he was naturalized by an act of parliament. Dodge established lumber mills on [[Georgian Bay]].&lt;ref name="morgan"&gt;[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?doc=32947 ''The Canadian parliamentary companion'', HJ Morgan (1873)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a variety of occupations, Anson Dodge began his own lumber career in 1864 at [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania]]. First attracted to the forests of [[Ontario]] in 1866, with an invitation from [[Henry W. Sage]], possibly at a time when Sage was considering disposing of his [[Bell Ewart, Ontario|Bell Ewart]] mill. After a tour of the facilities at Bell Ewart, Anson continued his trek northward to Oakley township in [[Muskoka]] where Sage had recently acquired timber berths. Anson also purchased timber in the township and a small mill on [[Lake Simcoe]] at Atherly, near [[Orillia, Ontario|Orillia]]. Dodge continued his spending spree, purchasing timber berths and mills with various partners, establishing his Georgian Bay Lumber Company in 1869, with a new mill at [[Byng Inlet, Ontario|Byng Inlet]].

At Parry Sound, he was one of [[John Classon Miller]]'s partners in the establishment of the Parry Sound Lumber Company in 1872.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Murray | first = Florence B.  | title = John Classon Miller | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]] | year = 1982 | url = http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5710 | accessdate = 2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodge's rapid expansion into the Canadian lumber trade left him financially exposed.  When the [[Panic of 1873]] hit he was unable to survive and was declared bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Angus|first1=James T.|title=A Deo Victoria|date=1994|publisher=Severn Publications Limited|location=Orillia|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anson's share of the Parry Sound firm was sold to J C  Miller in 1877.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

==Election to Canadian Parliament==
Agreement was reached with several of Dodge's Canadian associates that he should run for election as a member of the Canadian Parliament for the constituency of [[York North]], Ontario. This was the location where he was known and respected by the locals.  One of the major obstacles in his way was that he was an American citizen, and had not been resident in Canada long enough to qualify for naturalisation.  To overcome this an act of Parliament was required, and this was passed in June 1872 allowing Anson Dodge to naturalise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Royal assent to public and private bills|journal=Journals of the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada : [Journals of the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada from the 11th April to the 14th June, 1872 ... being the 5th session of the 1st Parliament of Canada, session 1872|date=14 June 1871|page=332|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_07171_5/343?r=0&amp;s=1|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having qualified almost at the last minute, Dodge went on to win the seat at the [[Canadian federal election, 1872|general election]], held between July and October 1872.  However, a letter from a clergyman in New Jersey, published by Dodge to provide a character reference, proved to be fake and became a source of embarrassment to him after the election.  Although he survived this scandal, his time in Parliament was short lived as a new election was held on [[Canadian federal election, 1874|22 January 1874]] and he did not stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Angus|first1=James T.|title=A Deo Victoria|date=1994|publisher=Severn Publications Limited|location=Orillia|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to the United States to manage family lumber interests in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;

==Georgia lumber==
Anson's father, William Earle Dodge Sr. had been involved with the lumber business for nearly forty years.  He started to acquire large tracts of timber land in Pennsylvania for [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps, Dodge, &amp; Co]] in the 1830s. He was a partner in this with his father-in-law [[Anson Green Phelps]], and brother-in-law [[Daniel James (businessman)|Daniel James]].  Later he began to invest his own money in the procurement of forested land and often entrusted the management to his sons Norman, George, Arthur and Anson.  William was a cautious business man (unlike Anson) and he knew the risks involved with the production and sale of lumber.  An example of this was where he took the known costs and returns for a particular stand of timber and extrapolated it to a larger scale whilst adding safety margins:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=D. Stuart|title=Memorials of William E. Dodge|date=1887|publisher=Anson D F Randolf|location=New York|page=38|url=https://archive.org/stream/memorialsofwilli00dodgiala#page/38/mode/2up|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For fear of errors, deduct one half; to be very careful, deduct one half again ; in these days of speculation we will once more deduct one half; as everything appears to be going to the bottom, we will another time deduct a half; on account of the destruction of the United States Bank we will go another half. Half of this final amount will be the share of Phelps, Dodge, &amp; Co. Now deduct the original cost, and the remainder will be profit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the American Civil War, William Dodge with partners started to buy thousands of acres of timbered land in Georgia.  One estimate put the size of this holding at 300,000 acres.  He built infrastructure, including saw mills at St Simon's Island.  Anson was put in charge of the business called ''The Georgia Land and Lumber Company''.  Legislative changes introduced in 1877, that would have forced the company to incorporate in the state of Georgia, were circumvented by transferring ownership of the business to one of William’s other sons, George Egleston Dodge (1849-1904).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowitt|first=Richard|title=A Merchant Prince of the Nineteenth Century|year=1954|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=Chapter 14|asin=B001DJ0E5S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After about six years in Georgia Anson moved on; he was said to have set up a logging venture in Minnesota with a former colleague, but records are elusive.  He later retired to Danville, Illinois where he was known as General A G P Dodge.  He built a mansion but this burnt down soon after completion during a party being given for an estimated 200 guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caused a Panic|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16965137/|accessdate=29 January 2018|publisher=Star Tribune|date=25 May 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge's marriage to Rebecca Drew ended in divorce in about 1883 and he remarried in 1886 to Rose Voorhees (1853-1910).  There was one child from each marriage, Anson Jr. and Julia Voorhees Dodge (1892-1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Phyllis B|title=Tales of the Phelps-Dodge Family|date=1987|publisher=New York Historical Society|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dodge died in Illinois in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/N7SR-1HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Find A Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11795542/anson-greene_phelps-dodge), memorial page for Anson Greene Phelps Dodge, Sr (25 Aug 1834–28 May 1918), Find A Grave Memorial no. 11795542, citing Spring Hill Cemetery and Mausoleum, Danville, Vermilion County, Illinois, USA ; Maintained by Tony Cannon (contributor 46527423)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anson Greene Phelps Dodge Jr.==
In 1878 Dodge’s eighteen year old son, Anson Jr.(1860-1898), eloped with his sixteen year old cousin, Ellen Ada Doge (daughter of [[Reverend David Stuart Dodge]])  The parents gave chase and the incident was reported widely in both the national and international newspapers; eventually they were located in Washington where they were attempting to get a marriage license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youthful runaways|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16844530/dodge_cousins_elope/|accessdate=25 January 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=4 September 1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were separated, but permitted to marry two years later in London; sadly Ellen Ada died in 1883 whilst visiting India with her husband.  Her body was returned to the United States and buried in the church on St Simon's Island, Georgia.  Anson was ordained after studying at the General Theological Seminary, New York, and returned to St Simon's Island where he became the rector at this same church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anson Green Phelps Dodge|url=http://www.dodgefamily.org/History/Dodges/AnsonGreenPhelps.shtml|website=The Dodge Family Association|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Find A Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/46526583/anson-greene_phelps-dodge : accessed 29 January 2018), memorial page for Rev Anson Greene Phelps Dodge, Jr (30 Jun 1860–20 Aug 1898), Find A Grave Memorial no. 46526583, citing Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery, Saint Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia, USA ; Maintained by Find A Grave (contributor 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15246">'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 "Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Some of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery – [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Those focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8". ''finduslaw.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, "like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together."&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 "Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.

=== Contemporary anti-sweatshop movement ===
With the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. "Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas." ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see "worker internationalization" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticisms of sweatshops ==
The criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, deal largely with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitive nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Zwolinski, Matt. “Sweatshops, Choice, and Exploitation”. ''Business Ethics Quarterly'' 17.4 (2007): 689–727. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;  Matt Zwolinski argues that though technically sweatshop laborers "choose" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not "fully voluntary" and that though sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker "consents" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that overall cause more harm than good to the laborer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Yet another criticism of sweatshops is the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages, often requiring that they be taken out of school, and thus disrupt their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that can endanger their health.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Laura Pincus, and Denis Gordon Arnold. "Worker rights and low wage industrialization: How to avoid sweatshops." ''Human Rights Quarterly''28.3 (2006): 676-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. “Movements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000”. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425–451. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

=== Sweatshops offer opportunities that might otherwise not exist ===
Some people such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f argue that the anti-sweatshop movement "risks harming the very people it is aiming to help"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html
| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops
| website = www.nytimes.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty that would otherwise not be available to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Increasing regulations or wages would increase unemployment ===
Even if a company does not move to another country to find somewhere with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good costs, the less the demand for it is.  Because of this, it is possible to argue, as some economists have, that even though the labor is "exploitative," it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. "The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment." ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not all economists support sweatshops ===
Most economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external’s point of view. An economist pointed out “as simple as this: ‘Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don’t,’ as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">'''Information security''' has emerged as a significant concern for banks, mobile phone companies and other businesses that use [[call center]]s or [[business process outsourcing]], or '''BPO'''. There have been instances of theft of personal data reported from call centers.

Britain's [[Financial Services Authority]] examined standards in India in April 2005 and the [[Banking Code Standards Board]] audited eight India-based call centres in 2006, handling more than a million calls per month from the UK. the examinations did not extend to Africa-based call centres staffed by workers of Indian origin.

The BCSB report stated that "Customer data is subject to the same level of security as in the UK. High risk and more complex processes are subject to higher levels of scrutiny than similar activities onshore." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/2006/oct/07bpo.htm Outsourcing thriving in Britain despite India bash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

India's [[NASSCOM]] has said that they take breach in security extremely seriously and will assist the police in their probe.

==Common countermeasures==

There are three identifiable types of illicit activities concerning fraud emanating from call centers:
# Crooks who pretend to be legitimate call centres.
# Hackers who gain access to call centre information through illegal means
# Call centre agents who illegally misuse the information they have access to in call centres.
# 3rd and 4th party software implementation, allowing for "back-doors" to be entered remotely, sometimes under the "credentials" of security.
While items '''1''' and '''2''' are mostly subject to police action, call centres can use internal procedures to minimise risk. Such mitigation measures include but are not limited to:

# Creating a paperless environment, preventing employees from writing down and removing information by ensuring that all work processes are done on the computer, without having to record anything on forms or notes.
# Prohibiting the use of cellphones and cameras on the floor.
# Prohibiting paper, pens and digital recording devices from being brought onto the floor.
# Preventing internet access for employees on the floor.
# Limiting functionality and access of personal computers or terminals used by call center agents (for example, disabling USB ports). Companies may also use data loss prevention software to block attempts to download, copy, or transmit sensitive electronic data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csoonline.com/article/356064 Call Center Security How: to Protect Employees and Customers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
===1897–1947===
BD was founded in 1897 by [[Maxwell Becton|Maxwell W. Becton]] and [[Fairleigh S. Dickinson]], two American businessmen who met on a sales trip. The same year the company made its first sale, a Luer-all-glass [[syringe]] that sold for $2.50. In 1898, BD acquired its first [[patent]] for a medical product. In 1899 the company introduced its first logo which was meant to symbolize guaranteed superior quality of the products provided by BD. In 1904, BD acquired the Philadelphia Surgical Company. This very first acquisition and other early acquisitions significantly expanded the company's manufacturing ability and product offering. Two years later, BD incorporated in the state of [[New Jersey]] and built a manufacturing facility in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], the first in the U.S. created specifically for the production of [[thermometer]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and syringes. In 1924, BD manufactured its first syringe designed specifically for [[insulin]] injection. One year later, BD introduced the BD Yale Luer-Lok Syringe, designed and patented by Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Sr. It provided a simple and secure method of attaching and removing the needle to and from the syringe. Today, [[Luer taper]] connectors are the standard for syringes in the U.S. In 1947 Joseph Kleiner developed the Evacutainer—a device used to draw blood by vacuum through a needle into a test tube. This product eventually evolved to become the BD [[Vacutainer]] Blood Collection system.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/aboutbd/history/|title=BD Milestones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948–1970===
In 1948, BD faced new leadership as [[Fairleigh Dickinson, Jr.|Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.]] and Henry P. Becton, sons of the founders, took over the company. Their 24-year tenure was a time of rapid development for BD. The company grew within the U.S. as well as internationally. In 1949, it opened its first manufacturing site outside of New Jersey in [[Columbus, Nebraska]]. In 1961, it established a manufacturing facility in [[Canaan, Connecticut]]. BD also soon expanded to [[Canada]] (1951), [[Mexico]] (1952), [[France]] (1955), and [[Brazil]] (1956). The tenure of Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton was also a time of significant product innovation. In 1950, BD's first sterile disposable product, a blood collection set, was developed and sold to the American Red Cross. In 1954, BD introduced the first completely disposable syringe made of glass: BD Hypak. This innovative product was used in a large-scale field test of the [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] [[vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]]. One year later, BD entered the [[microbiology]] field through the acquisition of the Baltimore Biological Laboratory. In 1961, the company introduced its disposable BD Plastipak syringe. Under the new leadership the company also went public (1962) and appeared for the first time in the [[Fortune 500]] list (1970).&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===1973–1995===
In 1973, BD added another U.S. facility&amp;nbsp;— a research center in [[Durham, North Carolina]] in [[Research Triangle Park]]. The center was established to help the company meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) requirements, research improved manufacturing and process methods, and develop future innovative technologies. In 1975, BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a prefilled syringe injecting [[heparin]]. In 1980, BD developed its first automated system for [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] testing—the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company's development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in [[Plymouth]], [[England]] was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]] ([[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|current HQ location]].) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a [[Blood vessel|vascular]] access devices manufacturer. The last three years of the 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe, the BD Safety-Lok (1988), and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD's development. The company opened a central distribution center in [[Temse]], [[Belgium]] (1992) and entered [[India]] and [[China]] (1995). BD also introduced a device that offered needle stick protection following [[Venipuncture|blood-drawing]] procedures, the BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===1999–2006===
In 1999, as BD passed more than 100 years of presence in the medical devices industry, BD announced its new [[corporate identity]]. Numerous independent brand names were replaced by a single name: BD. In addition, the company symbol that is used today was introduced. BD also named Edward J. Ludwig as the company's [[president (corporate title)|president]]. Ludwig was also named [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] (2000) and [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board of Directors]] (2002). On February 9, 1999, BD announced the acquisition of Biometric Imaging, Inc. (BMI), a privately held company serving the transfusion medicine, infectious diseases, and oncology markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=21195&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=&amp;s=press&amp;dTitle=Press&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=| title=Becton Dickinson and Company Announces the Acquisition of Biometric Imaging}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2000, BD signed an agreement to acquire Gentest Corporation, a privately held company serving the life sciences market in the areas of drug metabolism and toxicology testing of pharmaceutical candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=21347&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=&amp;s=press&amp;dTitle=Press&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=| title=BD Signs Agreement to Acquire Gentest Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, BD also got heavily involved in global health issues announcing a five-year maternal and neonatal tetanus worldwide elimination partnership with [[UNICEF]] (1999), launching the BD Safety Compliance Initiative (2000), and pledging $1 million contribution to the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (2002.) In 2003 and 2004, BD introduced several innovative products: BD FACSAria Cell Sorter—the first entirely new instrument in the next-generation portfolio of flow cytometers (2003), BD Accuspray—a nasal drug delivery system for administering vaccines (2003), BD.id—a patient identification system designed to limit the potential for medical errors in [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] collection (2003), and the world's first "intelligent" [[insulin pump]] and [[Blood glucose monitoring|glucose monitoring]] system, a wireless system consisting of a Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm 512 Insulin Pump and Paradigm Link Blood Glucose Monitor, co-developed with BD. In the beginning of the 21st century BD also invested in growing its business by acquiring several strategically important companies. In 2001, it acquired the Gentest Corporation, a leading in drug metabolism and toxicology testing company. In 2004, BD completed the acquisition of Atto Bioscience Acquired, a company specializing in [[Optics|optical]] instrumentation, software, and [[reagent]]s for real-time analysis of interactions taking place in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. In 2005 BD entered the field of [[proteomics]] through its acquisition of FFE Weber GmbH, which specialized in the [[separation process|separation]] and [[fractionation]] of complex proteins. 2006 was also an important year to document BD's growth as the company acquired GeneOhm Sciences—a leader in the development of [[Molecule|molecular]] diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of [[bacteria]]l organisms and TriPath Imaging, a [[cancer]] diagnostics company.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===2010 Q-Syte Luer and IV Catheter partial recall===
In February 2010 BD announced a voluntary product recall of certain lots of BD Q-Syte Luer Access Devices and BD Nexiva Closed IV Catheter Systems. BD stated that the use of the affected devices may cause an air embolism or leakage of blood and/or therapy, which may result in serious injury or death. The approximately 2.8 million BD Q-Syte and 2.9 million BD Nexiva units containing 5 million BD Q-Syte devices that were recalled were distributed in the United States, Asia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. The recall was initiated on Oct. 28, 2009 after BD received complaints of problems due to air entry through a part of the device. BD stated that the cause of the problem was manufacturing deviation and claimed that it corrected the problem. BD announced that it notified customers about the recall by letter and has been working with the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] and worldwide health agencies to coordinate recall activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0815057720100208|title=Reuters: Becton Dickinson recalls intravenous devices | date=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=24486&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=BD+Worldwide&amp;s=&amp;dTitle=&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=|title=BD Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and safety issues ===

'''Bernhard Eisenstuck''' (20 September 1805, [[Annaberg-Buchholz]], [[Electorate of Saxony]] – 5 April 1871), factory co-owner and president of the Chenmitz town council, was a prominent agitator for a trade policy, when only in the sense of a protective tariff.  In 1848, he was a member of the [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt preliminary parliament]] (''Vorparlament'') and then elected from Chemnitz to the succeeding [[Frankfurt parliament]] where he sat on the left. In May he was sent as an imperial commissioner to the insurgent [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], but recalled for overstepping his authority.  He was vice president of the leftovers of the Frankfurt parliament (''Rumpfparlament'') when it emigrated to Stuttgart.  Before its forced dispersal, he resigned and went to Belgium.  After a long absence, he returned home and was a representative in Saxony's parliament where his name and decisive stance lent prestige to the thinly populated liberal ranks. He died as director of a thread-spinning factory.

*[[Carl Schurz]], ''Reminiscences'' (3 volumes), New York: The McClure Company, 1907.  Schurz mentions Eisenstuck in Volume One (pp.&amp;nbsp;182–183):  “The terrible confusion which the refusal of the king of Prussia to accept the imperial crown under the national constitution had brought upon all Germany came now to light in an almost grotesque manner. As already mentioned, the [[Frankfurt Parliament|national parliament]] had, on 4 May, summoned ‘the governments, the legislative bodies, the communes of the several German states, the whole German people, to see to it that the constitution of the German Empire be generally recognized and practically introduced.’ Inasmuch as the king of [[Bavaria]] would not recognize the national constitution, the Pfaelzers felt themselves justified in rising against the Bavarian government, for they only obeyed the national parliament, which they regarded as the highest national authority in Germany. The ‘Committee for the Defense of the Country,’ therefore, quite logically applied to the national parliament through their representatives in that body, and to the national central power, for recognition, protection, and support. The national central power, at the head of which stood the [[Archduke John of Austria|Austrian Archduke Johann]], thereupon sent an imperial commissioner, Dr. Eisenstuck, to the Palatinate with the instruction ‘to take in the name of the imperial power all measures necessary for the restoration of the laws in that country,’ and especially to see to it that some of the resolutions adopted by the ‘Committee for the Defense of the Country’ be rescinded. The imperial commissioner, after due investigation, declared those resolutions to be invalid, but he recognized the ‘Committee for the Defense of the Country’ and for the execution of the national constitution as fully competent to organize an armed power and to swear in the members thereof to obey the national constitution, and in case of necessity to defend that constitution by independent action against all attacks by force. With this, of course, Archduke Johann, who had sent him, was not pleased.”

'''Bowling Green''' is a small public park in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], at the southern end of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], next to the site of the original Dutch fort of [[New Amsterdam]]. Built in 1733, originally including an actual [[bowling green]] (a venue for [[Bowls|lawn bowling]]), it is the oldest public park in [[New York City]] and is surrounded by its original 18th-century fence. The iconic ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture is exhibited on its northern end.

'''Bowling Green Fence and Park''' is listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It is abutted by [[Battery Park]] to the west.

===Colonial era===
The park has long been a center of activity in the city going back to the days of [[New Amsterdam]], when it served as a cattle market between 1638 and 1647, and [[parade ground]]. In 1675, the [[City council|Common Council]]  designated the "plaine afore the forte" for an annual market of "graine, cattle and other produce of the country".  In 1677 the city's first public well was dug in front of [[Fort Amsterdam]] at Bowling Green.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/history.html NYC Department of Environmental Protection, "New York City's Water Supply System: History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205063041/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/history.html |date=December 5, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1733, the Common Council leased a portion of the parade grounds to three prominent neighboring landlords for a [[peppercorn]] a year, upon their promise to create a park that would be "the delight of the Inhabitants of the City" and add to its "Beauty and Ornament"; the improvements were to include a "bowling green" with "walks therein".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, ''Gotham''.&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding streets were not paved with cobblestones until 1744.

On August 21, 1770, the [[Great Britain|British]] government erected a 4,000 pound (1,800&amp;nbsp;kg) gilded lead [[equestrian statue]] of [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] in Bowling Green; the King was dressed in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] garb in the style of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]. The statue had been commissioned in 1766, along with a statue of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], from the prominent [[London]] sculptor [[Joseph Wilton]], as a celebration of victory after the [[Seven Years' War]].  With the rapid deterioration of relations with the mother country after 1770, the statue became a magnet for the Bowling Green protests;&lt;ref&gt;On 1 November  1765 the [[Sons of Liberty]] protesting the [[Stamp Act]] had marched down Broadway, carrying an effigy of the Royal Governor. They threw rocks and bricks at the adjacent [[Fort Amsterdam|Fort George]], and at Bowling Green they burned the Governor's effigy as well as his coach, which had fallen into their hands.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1773, the city passed an anti-[[graffiti]] and anti-[[desecration]] law to counter vandalism against the monument, and a protective cast-iron fence, which still stands&lt;ref name=nym&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/robert-sullivan-my-american-revolution-2012-9/|title=Permanent Revolution|publisher=''New York'' magazine|date=Sep 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the oldest fence in New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oldest Fence in New York|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-oldest-fence-in-new-york|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built along the perimeter of the park.

On July 9, 1776, after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was read to [[George Washington|Washington]]'s troops at the current site of [[City Hall (New York)|City Hall]], local [[Sons of Liberty]] rushed down Broadway to Bowling Green and instructed their African slaves to topple the statue of King George III. The fence post [[finial]]s of cast-iron crowns on the protective fence were sawn off, with the saw marks still visible today.&lt;ref name=nym/&gt; The event is one of the most enduring images in the city's history. According to folklore, the statue was chopped up and shipped to a [[Connecticut]] foundry under the direction of [[Oliver Wolcott]] to be made into 42,088 patriot bullets at 20 bullets per pound (2,104.4 pounds). The statue's head was to have been paraded about town on pike-staffs, but was recovered by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] and sent to England. Eight pieces of the lead statue are preserved in the [[New-York Historical Society]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibits/search?words=George%20III%20Statue NYHS]&lt;/ref&gt; one in the [[Museum of the City of New York]] as well as one in Connecticut &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofcthistory.org/funfacts.asp |title=10 Museum of Connecticut History Fun Facts |publisher=Museumofcthistory.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015081149/http://www.museumofcthistory.org/funfacts.asp |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (estimated total of 260/270 pounds);&lt;ref&gt;Five other pieces are reported to have survived but have been missing since 1777; 1829; 1864 {An 1867 account claims this piece was destroyed} see pp.431-432 at [https://books.google.com/books?id=-HMUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA431&amp;dq=George+III+statue+pieces&amp;lr=&amp;cd=34#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20III%20statue%20pieces&amp;f=false this NY Times article]; 1894 see [https://www.nytimes.com/1908/08/31/archives/find-new-fragment-of-lead-george-iii-bit-of-equestrian-statue-at.html this NY Times article].&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been depicted over the years in several works of art, including an 1854 painting by [[William Walcutt]], and an 1859 painting by [[Johannes Adam Simon Oertel]].

===Post-colonial era===
[[File:The Custom House, New York, 1799-1815.jpg|thumb|[[Government House (New York City)|Government House]] as the Custom House, 1799–1815, Bowling Green shown on the left]]
The marble slab of the statue's pedestal was first used for a tombstone of a Major John Smith of the [[Black Watch]] who died in 1783; when Smith's grave site was leveled in 1804, the slab became a stone step at two successive mansions; in 1880 the inscription was rediscovered and the slab was transferred to the [[New-York Historical Society]].  The monument base can be seen in the background of the portrait of [[George Washington]] painted by [[John Trumbull]] in 1790, conserved in the [[New York City Hall|City Hall]]. The William Pitt statue is in the New-York Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/equestrianstatue01wall 1920 reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Revolution, the remains of [[Fort Amsterdam|the fort]] facing Bowling Green were demolished in 1790 and part of the rubble used to extend Battery Park to the west. In its place a grand [[Government House (New York City)|Government House]] was built, suitable, it was hoped, for a President's House, with a four-columned portico facing across Bowling Green and up Broadway. [[John Jay|Governor John Jay]] later inhabited it. When the state capital was moved to Albany, the building served as a boarding house and then the [[New York Custom House|custom house]] before being demolished in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Homberger, ''Mrs. Astor's New York: Money and Social Power in a Gilded Age'' 2004:68&lt;/ref&gt; Elegant townhouses were built around the park, which remained largely the private domain of the residents, though now some of the Tory [[Elite|patricians]] of New York were replaced by Republican ones; leading New York merchants, led by [[Abraham Kennedy]], in a mansion at 1 Broadway that had a 56-foot facade under a central pediment&lt;ref&gt;It is illustrated in a lithograph of Bowling Green, Homberger 2004, pl. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and a front towards the Battery Parade, as the new piece of open ground was called. The Hon. John Watts, whose summer place was [[Rose Hill, Manhattan|Rose Hill]]; [[Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Chancellor Robert Livingston]] at no. 5, [[Stephen Whitney]] at no. 7, and [[John Stevens (New Jersey)|John Stevens]] all constructed brick residences in [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] facing Bowling Green.

The [[Alexander Macomb House (New York City)|Alexander Macomb House]], the second Presidential Mansion, stood north of the park at 39-41 Broadway. President [[George Washington]] occupied it from February 23 to August 30, 1790, before the U.S. capital moved to [[Philadelphia]]. By 1850, however, with the opening of [[Lafayette Street]], then of [[Washington Square Park]] and [[Fifth Avenue]], the general northward migration of residences in [[Manhattan]] led to the conversion of the residences into the shipping offices, resulting in full public access to the park.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Bowling Green NYC 1918.jpg|thumb|Bowling Green in 1918]]
The park suffered neglect after [[World War II]], but was restored by the city in the 1970s and is now one of the most heavily used plazas in the city. The Bowling Green Fence and Park were listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

In 1982, the Irish Institute of New York installed a plaque in Bowling Green park commemorating an important religious liberty challenge which occurred in Manhattan.  Reverend Francis Makemie, the founder of American Presbyterianism, challenged the edict of Lord Cornbury by preaching at the home of William Jackson near by the Park.  He was arrested and charged with preaching a "pernicious doctrine", but later acquitted.

In 1989, the sculpture ''[[Charging Bull]]'' by [[Arturo Di Modica]] was installed at the northern tip of the park by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] after it had been confiscated by the police following its illegal installation on [[Wall Street]]. The sculpture has become one of the beloved and recognizable landmarks of the Financial District.&lt;ref name=rdmsgw/&gt;&lt;ref name=dwdbbfs/&gt;

The pool and fountain in the park were temporarily modified when the park was used as a filming location for ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' in early June 2009. Between shoots, equipment was stored in the park and on nearby streets.

In March 2017, Bowling Green was co-named '''Evacuation Day Plaza''', which was marked by the erection of an illuminated street sign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Evacuation Day Plaza Honored with New Illuminated Street Sign | website=Downtown Alliance | date=March 20, 2017 | url=http://www.downtownny.com/press-releases/evacuation-day-plaza-honored-with-new-illuminated-street-sign | access-date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; commemorating the location of a pivotal event in the [[American Revolutionary War]] that ended a brutal 7-year occupation by British troops.   On November 25, 1783, after a U.S. soldier managed to rip down the British flag at Bowling Green and replace it with the Stars and Stripes — an apparently tough feat since the British had previously greased the flag pole. As the British boarded ships back to England, then-General [[George Washington]] triumphantly led the [[Continental Army]] through Manhattan down to Bowling Green&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Plagianos | first=Irene | title=Bowling Green To Be Co-Named 'Evacuation Day Plaza' | website=DNAinfo New York | date=February 10, 2016 | url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160210/financial-district/bowling-green-be-co-named-evacuation-day-plaza | access-date=June 27, 2017 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630180812/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160210/financial-district/bowling-green-be-co-named-evacuation-day-plaza | archivedate=June 30, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and witness the last British troops sailing away from Lower Manhattan.

==Description and surroundings==
[[File:Bowling Green fountain New York City 2014.jpeg|thumb|left|The Bowling Green fountain, shown in spring 2014]]
The park is a teardrop-shaped plaza formed by the branching of Broadway as it nears [[Whitehall Street]]. The park is a fenced-in grassy area with benches that are popular lunchtime destinations for workers in the nearby [[Financial District (Manhattan)|Financial District]]. There is a fountain in the center.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Bowling green station NY.jpg|thumb|The entrance to [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green subway station]] next to Bowling Green Park]]

The south end of the plaza is bounded by the front entrance of [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1248&amp;ResourceType=Building |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605233855/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1248&amp;ResourceType=Building |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-05 |title=United States Custom House (New York) |date=2007-09-13 |work=National Historic Landmark summary listing |publisher=National Park Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; which houses the [[George Gustav Heye Center]] for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of the American Indian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.com/museums/national.museum.of.the.american.indian.html | title=National Museum of the American Indian | publisher=ny.com | accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York]] (Manhattan Division). Previously there was a public street along the south edge of the park, also called "Bowling Green", but since this area was needed for a modern entrance to [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|the park's eponymous subway station]], the road was eliminated and paved over with cobblestones. The [[New York City Subway]] station on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], opened in 1905 and serving the {{NYCS trains|Joralemon}}, is located under the plaza. Entrances dating from both 1905 and more recent renovations are located in and near the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Station:_Bowling_Green_(IRT_East_Side_Line) |title=Station: Bowling Green (IRT East Side Line) |publisher=www.nycsubway.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234359/http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Station%3A_Bowling_Green_%28IRT_East_Side_Line%29 |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7363">[[Business rule]]s are abstractions of the policies and practices of a business organization.  In computer software development, the '''business rules approach''' is a development methodology where rules are in a form that is used by, but does not have to be embedded in, business process management systems.

The business rules approach formalizes an enterprise's critical business rules in a language that managers and technologists understand. Business rules create an unambiguous statement of what a business does with information to decide a proposition. The formal specification becomes information for process and rules engines to run.

==Advantages==

The adoption of business rules adds another tier to systems that automate business processes. Compared to traditional systems, this approach has the following major advantages,
* lowers the cost incurred in the modification of business logic
* shortens development time
* rules are externalized and easily shared among multiple applications
* changes can be made faster and with less risk

Business rules represent a natural step in the application of computer technology aimed at enhancing productivity in the workplace. Automated business processes that have business logic embedded inside often take substantial time to change, and such changes can be prone to errors. And in a world where the life cycle of business models has greatly shortened, it has become increasingly critical to be able to adapt to changes in external environments promptly. These needs are addressed by a business rules approach.

Business rules enhance [[business agility]]. And the manageability of business processes also increases as rules become more accessible.

==Technical details==
&lt;!-- Stay neutral, don't say one vendor is a good example. MM --&gt;
The programs designed specifically to run business rules are called [[rule engine]]s. More complete systems that support the writing, deployment and management of business rules are called business rules management systems ([[BRMS]]s).

Many commercial rule engines provide the [[Rete algorithm]], a proprietary [[algorithm]] that embodies many of the principles of Rete. However, there are other execution algorithms such as the sequential algorithm (ILOG and Blaze Advisor terminology), algorithms for evaluating decision tables/trees, and algorithms tuned for hierarchical [[XML]]. The Rete algorithm is a stateful pattern matching algorithm designed to minimize the evaluation of repetitive tests across many objects/attributes and many rules. Different fields of usage are best for Rete-based and non-Rete-based execution algorithms. For simple stateless applications with minimal sharing of conditions across rules, a non-Rete-based execution algorithm (such as the sequential algorithm) may be preferable. For evaluating decision tables and trees, an algorithm that exploits the hierarchical relationships between the rule conditions may perform better than a simple Rete or sequential algorithm tuned for discrete rules.

Business rules can be expressed in conventional programming languages or natural languages. In some commercial BRMSs rules can also be expressed in user-friendly rule forms such as decision tables and decision trees. Provided with a suitable interface to design or edit decision tables or trees, it is possible for business users to check or change rules directly, with minimal IT involvement.

When rules are expressed in natural language, it is necessary to first define a vocabulary that contains words and expressions corresponding to business objects and conditions and the operations involving them. To make the rules executable by a rule engine, it is also necessary to implement the operations and conditions in a [[programming language]]. With a defined and implemented vocabulary, it is relatively easy to write rules in a BRMS. Changes can also be made quickly as long as they can be expressed in the existing vocabulary. If not, the vocabulary must be expanded accordingly.

Separating the vocabulary from the logic makes it possible for business rules to be modeled, with the business user mapping their business logic and with IT integrating data and the generated code into the target application. 
Business rules are also key to the [[enterprise decision management]] approach to decision automation.

Increasingly, business rules are also viewed as a critical component of [[business process management]] solutions because of the need to ensure flexibility.

== Relation to database management ==

As argued by [[Christopher J. Date]], business rules translate into [[data integrity constraint]]s when one thinks in terms of the [[relational model of database management]].  Thus, a true [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] could be thought of in terms of a [[declarative programming|declarative]] [[business rules engine]] with added [[data management]] capability.

However, business rules need not only be regarded as constraints.  They can also be used to specify constructive business policies, such as "preferred clients get a discount of 10%".  Used in this way, business rules are like SQL queries, rather than data integrity constraints.

== Relation to business process management ==

Some analysts believe the combination of business rules technology with [[business process management]] offers an agile approach to workflow and enterprise integration.  BPM and BR software support business goals by managing and running business processes and business rules in separate yet complementary ways. A business process is often a complex map of flow controls. It might have many subprocesses, decisions and while loops. Wherever a decision or while loop appears, business rules can evaluate the data provided by the process and control the basis for change in flows.

Often there are separate reasons for updates to processes or rules. New regulations or business strategies may affect the rules without changing core business processes. New applications or procedures might change the business process. In either case, a composite approach to rules and processes can be very flexible.

As more and more BPM vendors either add business rules engines to their BPM engines or OEM business rules management systems, business rules seems to be becoming a subset of BPM.

The '''''Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle''''' was a business newspaper in the United States founded by William Buck Dana (1829–1910) in 1865.  Published weekly, the ''Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle'' was deliberately modeled to be an American take on the popular business newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'', which had been founded in England in 1843.&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;James Grant, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080330191335/http://www.financialhistory.org/EXHIBITS/fmfp/fmfp_grant.htm Free Markets, Free Press]".  Museum of American Financial History (June–December 2000).  Retrieved on September 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first national business weekly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steeples|2002|p=xxii}} {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tk-LjHhKW0C&amp;pg=PR22&amp;dq=%22William+Buck+Dana%22+%22with+the+acumen%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3hCwgN41mNmnrURDjRBouPcIgNJA|title=Advocate for American Enterprise: William Buck Dana and the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, 1865-1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle'' continued the legacy begun by ''Hunt's Merchant's Magazine and Commercial Review'', a monthly business magazine, which was founded in 1839 by Freeman Hunt but disappeared during the [[American Civil War]].  They are together in many library collections.&lt;ref name=Bull&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3110520 On the Hundredth Anniversary of the Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle]" Bulletin of the Business Historical Society, Vol 13, No. 5 (Nov., 1939) pp 67–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dana continued as editor of the ''Chronicle'' until his death in 1910.

The ''Commercial &amp; Financial Chronicle'' never had the large subscriber base or influence of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' or ''[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]''.  In 1872 its circulation was around 4,000 and reached 26,000 by 1922. Data from the publication is, however, used by many [[economic historian]]s, as it is one of the few sources available. Douglas Steeples, Dana's biographer, wrote that "one can scarcely reconstruct the business history of the United States between the Civil War and 1910 without immersing oneself in his paper.  Even the most important series of business statistics published by the U.S. government, ''Historical Statistics of the United States'' [...], depends heavily on his work and that of the correspondents worldwide who contributed to the ''Chronicle''."  The publication (little known or noticed at the time of its demise) ceased publication during the fall out of [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and the stock market troubles of 1987.&lt;ref name=Grant/&gt;

Individual issues at work are seen as being a part of broader societal problems which they seek to address. Unlike [[trade unions]], community union membership is not based on the workplace- it is based on common identities and issues.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt; Alliances forged between unions and other groups may have a primary identity based on affiliations of [[religion]], [[ethnic group]], [[gender]], [[disability]], [[environmentalism]], [[neighborhood]] residence, or [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;

Community unionism has many definitions and practices.&lt;ref name="ellembrandon"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Contested communities: Geo‐histories of unionism|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 433|doi = 10.1108/09534810810884830|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Ellem|first1 = Bradon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Coalitions and community unionism|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 415|doi = 10.1108/09534810810884821|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Tattersall|first1 = Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; It varies according to country, institutional and political contexts, internal organization, leadership, scale, organizing style, sources of funding, and communication structure.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; In all, there is no "universal" community union;&lt;ref name="suzukia"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unions in Japan: Similarities and Differences of Region-based Labour Movements between Japan and Other Industrialized Countries|last = |first = |date = |journal = Economic and Industrial Democracy|volume = 29|issue = 4|pages = 492|doi = 10.1177/0143831X08096230|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Suzuki|first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; they take on many different forms.&lt;ref name="ellembrandon"/&gt; In order to simplify the complex structures of community unions, 4 categories have been established (although in practice community unions may blur the boundaries of these classifications):&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

* '''Community organization/ no union partner:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This consists of community based efforts to organize around workplaces. It may also include new initiatives created by already established community organizations.&lt;ref name="finej"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unions and the Revival of the American Labor Movement|last = |first = |date = |journal = Politics &amp; Society|volume = 33|pages = 153|doi = 10.1177/0032329204272553|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2005|last1 = Fine|first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Labour union(s)/ no community partner:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This category is composed of new union locals or new initiatives undertaken as part of a labour union organizing strategy. These organizations seek the support of community institutions but do not form a joint effort with them.&lt;ref name="finej" /&gt;
* '''Community/labour partnership but with community organization dominant:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This organization is based on mutual self-interest. Unions and community work together to improve conditions in the labour market through economic and political action. In these partnerships, community leadership dominates the practice of the organization.&lt;ref name="finej" /&gt;
* '''Community/labour partnership but with labour union dominant:'''&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda" /&gt; This organization differs from the one previously mentioned in that union leadership dominates the practice of the organization.&lt;ref name="finej" /&gt;

A part of the discourse of why community unionism has many definitions is in the ambiguity of the word "community" itself.&lt;ref name="ellembrandon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; In "Coalitions and Community Unionism", Tattersall breaks the word "community" into three elements which may help in understanding community unions better: as '''organizations''', '''common interest and identity''', and '''place'''.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

== Goals of community unions ==

Community union initiatives aim to achieve a number of things:

* Seek to build community power.&lt;ref&gt;Cranford, Cynthis J., Ladd, Deena.(2003). Community Unionism:Organizing For Fair Employment In Canada.''Just Labour'',3,46-59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By increasing scale of organizing activity, they can deal with questions of economic justice beyond particular work places.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;
* By working with community groups, unions are able to reach workers in traditionally non-union environments.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;
* They can enable unions to help organize fragmented workforces split across large numbers of small workplaces.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;
* Establishing extensive links into the local community may help unions defend terms and conditions within their traditional workplaces.&lt;ref name="10.1093/jeg/lbn011" /&gt;

== History of community unionism ==
In ''Community Unionism A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and contexts'', McBride and Greenwood note that community unions are not a new idea: it is an old form of unionism that dates back 150 years. They point out that in the early period of [[trade union]] formation, UK unions were organized within local communities where factories and heavy industry were geographically established. They find that this community/union relationship was broken with the changing geographies of employment and industrial restructuring. With this change, stable communities were destroyed that were located around the docks, mines, mills, and other regions of heavy industry.&lt;ref name="communityunionism"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |last = |first = |date = |journal = |doi = 10.1057/9780230242180|pmid = |access-date = |title = Community Unionism|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-230-24218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this idea, Hess also agrees that community factors have always been a part of unionism in "Community as a Factor in Union Organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community as a factor in union organization|last = |first = |date = |journal = Journal of Organizational Change Management|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = 497|doi = 10.1108/09534810810884885|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2008|last1 = Hess|first1 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black establishes that the term “community unionism” was first used in the 1960s in his article “Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy”.  He states that James O’Connar used the term in 1964: he believed that in the future, communities would become central to working class organization because of the instability of workplaces. Jones envisioned that future employment would be deskilled and insecure, and because of this, the workplace would no longer be appropriate for organization. He anticipated that community unions would be established in de-industrialized towns, and urban slums. He also believed that community unions would work to improve [[housing]], [[welfare]], and [[public services]].&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

As well, Black points out that the notion of community unionism was also used by organizers within the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) labour union in the 1960s. An organizer by the name of Jack Conway envisioned a new form of unionism that would develop. Conway too, believed that “community” would take over the central role of the factory in organizing workers in trade unionism. He came to believe this by looking at the Farm Workers Union (FWU). He noticed that the issues that farmers were facing went beyond the workplace. Conway concluded that the new form of unions would focus on grievances, political education, and community organization.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

In "Community Unions in Canada and Labor’s (Re)Organization of Space", Tufts also explains how a labour leader of the UAW, [[Walter Reuther]], envisioned a new form of unionism. Reuther believed that the labour movement should be more of a “[[social movement]]” opposed to an “economic movement”.&lt;ref name="tuftssteven"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Community Unionism in Canada and Labor's (Re)Organization of Space|last = |first = |date = |journal = Antipode|volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 227|doi = 10.1111/1467-8330.00076|pmid = |access-date = |year = 1998|last1 = Tufts|first1 = Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattersall points out in her article "Coalitions and Community Unionism:Using the Term Community to Explore Effective Union-Community Collaborations", that "community unions" were also created by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) in the United States in the 1960s. These community unions were community based, worker organizations.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; Tattersall also notes that along with the UAW, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s also used the term "community unionism". Here, the term was used to describe community organizations that sought to organize the urban working poor in the United States.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

Although the notion of community unionism was being put into practice in certain areas, it was not widely accepted by majority of people, and [[business unionism]] dominated.&lt;ref name="tuftssteven"/&gt; It was not until the 1990s that the practice of community unions increased.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt;

== The rise of community unions ==
The 1970s and 1980s witnessed profound restructuring of labour markets.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt; Neoliberal policies that emerged in the 1970s were adopted by many governments around the world, and included measures such as deregulation and privatization. These policies created insecurity in employment by breaking down institutional regulatory and political support for unions. Traditional unions experienced a loss of power, influence, and members.&lt;ref name="tattersallamanda"/&gt; During this period of economic restructuring, communities were forced to form [[coalitions]] with the [[labour movement]] to fight factory closures and relocations that were the basis of many local economies.&lt;ref name="tuftssteven"/&gt; Community unionism can be understood as a response to [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]]: it was a turn back to the local level-or community- in organizing.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt; It seeks to organize some of the most vulnerable people- immigrants, women, and people of colour- who have been disproportionately affected by the growth of exploitative working conditions in the neoliberal economy.&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

== Community unions in Japan ==

Community unions were formed in Japan in the early 1980s. They emerged spontaneously from [[grassroots]] organizations&lt;ref name="roylet"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = A new form of union organizing in Japan? Community unions and the case of the Mc ''Donald'''s 'Mc ''Union'''|last = |first = |date = |journal = Work, Employment &amp; Society|volume = 26|issue = 4|pages = 606|doi = 10.1177/0950017012445093|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2012|last1 = Royle|first1 = T.|last2 = Urano|first2 = E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from labour councils (although labour councils account for a larger number of organizing activities).&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; Labour councils that supported community unions were affiliated with [[Sohyo]]: a left leaning union confederation. These labour councils were in charge of different regions and directly represented workers by forming community unions. Labour councils held relative autonomy from the larger national confederation. They were able to achieve this because they maintained their own finances and staff. Thus, community unions were dependent on labour councils for resources that supported these organizations. Because workers with part-time employment were excluded from union membership at those firms, labour councils sought to represent people with part-time employment and people who worked in small firms in a given region. Councils found these workers through “labour problem hotlines”.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; Because of their independence from the larger confederation, organizing activities varied with each labour council.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

The range of activities among these labour councils included:

* organizing regional level rallies and demonstrations.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* engaging in electoral campaigns during local and national elections.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* making policy requests to local governments.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* giving support to member unions when they were in a labour dispute.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* promoting unionization of un-unionized workers.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;
* getting involved in social movements at the regional level workers.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

In 1989, Sohyo was replaced with a formation of a new confederation: [[Rengo]]. This restructuring impacted the relationship that labour councils had with community unions:  labour councils would no longer organize workers; they were now a part of Rengo’s Regional Organizations. These Regional Organizations do not have the freedom and activities that labour councils once had and do not support community unions thus some community unions broke up during this time. Community unions that remained faced challenges dealing with finances and autonomy workers.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

Japanese community unions function differently from US, Canadian, Australian, and UK community unions: their membership turnover is high, and membership rates are low. They are substantially smaller, have a weak financial base-requiring members to donate- and have high [[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] participation.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; These community unions take the form of a specific organizational model: '''Community Organization/No Union Partner'''. This framework of community unionism resembles US and Canadian Worker Centers but in practice is quite different. In addition, Japanese community unions do not tend to reflect coalition building like US, Canada, Australia, and UK.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roylet"/&gt; This can be explained by Japan’s lack of community-based organizations able to form [[alliance]]s with community unions, and that Japanese community unions pursue individual issues opposed to broader range of issues that affect livelihoods of many people.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt; Most issues that community unions deal with are: disputes over dismissals, working hours and leave, harassment, demotion or reduction in wages, discrimination, and working conditions. Community unions try to negotiate a settlement for the workers complaint and if it falls through, then are redirected to government labour committees or courts. Once a community union wins a case for a worker, the worker usually gives a part of his/her compensation back to the community union, and then resigns.&lt;ref name="roylet"/&gt;

== Community unions in the US ==

Like other advanced industrial economies, community unionism sprang up in the US in the 1980s. Community unions were formed from community and faith-based organizing networks, Central American solidarity movements and other left wing organizations, legal services and social service agencies, immigrant [[non-governmental organizations]], churches, and [[labour unions]]. US community unions focus on issues that go beyond the workplace such as housing, health care, education, and immigration.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

[[Craft unionism]] in the US organized workers based on their trade by class or skill. The jobs these workers had were stable, paid a [[living wage]], provided pensions, and offered long-term employment. Within the last 20 years, the highly competitive and mobile nature of US firms has resulted in [[outsourcing]] and subcontracting practices. These widespread practices have negative impacts on workers: lower wages, little/no access to benefits, decreased hours, and no pension. Not only are unions being dismantled by neoliberal policies, but the precarious work that has risen out of the US economy no longer identifies with craft union practices as low wage workers are facing different challenges.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;  In addition, many jobs that are coming to characterize the US economy are non-unionized.&lt;ref name="finejanice"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = WHY LABOR NEEDS a PLAN B: Alternatives to Conventional Trade Unionism|last = |first = |date = |journal = New Labor Forum|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 35|doi = 10.1080/10957960701279181|pmid = |access-date = |year = 2007|last1 = Fine|first1 = Janice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community unionism has been a response to these issues in the US, and has provided activities at a local level that work to set up labour market protections for low wage workers. They accomplish this by organizing members and allies in bringing pressure on elected officials to support them. Thus, US community unions rely on politics and [[public policy]] in creating change for members (wages, hours, working conditions). Community union membership may be based on ethnic, racial, religious affiliations and geographic areas.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finejanice"/&gt;

US community unions vary in their organizational framework. They reflect the 4 structures of community unions.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt; For example:

'''Community organization/ no union partner:''' Worker centers fall into this category.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

'''Labour Union or unions/ no community partner:''' SEIU’s National Justice for Janitors &amp; CHOP Chicago Homecare Organizing Project.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

'''Community/ labour partnership but with community organization dominant:''' Partnership of Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employers (AFSCME) in Baltimore &amp; The Partnership of Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) in Omaha.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

'''Community/labour partnership but with labour union dominant:''' The Stamford Organizing Project of the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref name="finej"/&gt;

== Challenges in community unions ==

In “Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy”, Black highlights that community organizations can be territorial. This can lead to conflict when two separate groups try to organize the same community. Black also points out that conflict may also arise over what the focus of their organizing will be based on. Disagreement on the specific goals of the organization can take the form of short-term and long-term goals. Black also finds that there can be conflict on the internal structure of a community union (specifically, equal participation in the organization).&lt;ref name="blacksimon"/&gt;

In “Community Unions in Japan: Similarities Differences of Region Based Labour Movements between Japan and Other Industrialized Countries”, Suzuki finds that challenges arise because of the different ways of looking at community unions: community unions may not fall into a specific category and may bridge different elements of [[coalition]] building and [[social movements]]. For Suzuki, there may be difficulty in forming equal partnerships between unions and organizations, and workers and the unemployed.&lt;ref name="suzukia"/&gt;

In ''Community Unionism A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and Contexts'', McBride and Greenwood believe that traditional unions may have problems in giving up their power and control when forming [[alliance]]s with community organizations. Traditional unions are structured hierarchically and operate differently from community organizations which may cause problems. McBride and Greenwood also found that there are no accessible spaces for communities to form relationships with [[trade unions]]. They found that these alliances are formed through formal meetings. This can be a problematic for expanding links into communities as it is a very narrow way of establishing relationships.&lt;ref name="communityunionism"/&gt;

== 1908 Trophy-winning performance ==

On Saturday, 29 February 1908, three [[Cadillac Model K|Model K]]s from the 1907 Cadillac production were released from the stock of the Anglo-American Motor-car Company, the UK agent for Cadillac automobiles,{{Sfn|Holland|1908b|p=7}} at the Heddon Street showroom in London (these were engines Nos. 23391, 24111 and 24118). The three cars, all registered in London under the numbers A2EO, A3EO and A4EO, were driven 25 miles to the [[Brooklands]] race track at Weybridge.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, the cars completed ten laps of the track, or approximately 30&amp;nbsp;miles,{{Sfn|Holland|1908b|p=7}} before being locked away until Monday, 2 March 1908,{{Sfn|Holland|1908a|p=2}} when they were released and disassembled completely,{{Sfn|Holland|1908b|p=7}} using only wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and pliers.{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} Each car was reduced to a pile of 721 component parts, which were then scrambled into one heap by the RAC.{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} Eighty-nine parts{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} requiring extreme accuracy were withdrawn from the heap, locked away at the Brooklands club house{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and replaced with new parts from Anglo-American's showroom stock. The parts were then sorted into three piles, each with all the parts needed to assemble a car.{{Sfn|Rubenstein|2001|p=203}} A mechanic - Mr. E. O. Young - reassembled the cars with the help of his assistant - Mr. M. M. Gardner. Sometimes they had to work ankle-deep in water, using only wrenches and screwdrivers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The third car was re-assembled by Thursday morning, 12 March.{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}} With the painted parts on the original cars not being identical in color or style, the reassembled cars were mismatched in appearance, gaining the nickname "[[harlequin]] cars".{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}} By 2 p.m. on Friday 13 March{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} the three cars had completed the mandatory 500-mile run with singular regularity.{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}} Only one point was lost owing to a broken cotter pin in the ignition lever (promptly replaced from stock). During the event, it was reported that one of the sheds where the parts were stored became partly flooded during a heavy storm and some parts became rusted. Only oily rags could be used to remove all traces of the immersion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} On completion of the test, one of the cars was locked away until the start of the 2000-miles [[reliability trial]]s in June 1908.{{Sfn|Holland|1908c|p=11}}{{Sfn|Holland|1908d|p=9}} It came out the winner of the R.A.C.

{{Cleanup section|reason=structure and citations|date=December 2017}}

&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daimler 1896 to 1946: 50 Years of the Daimler Company |author= St. John C. Nixon|year= 1946|publisher=G.T. Foulis &amp; Co.|pages=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the introduction of the sleeve-valve principle into the Daimler engine, the Daimler Company in 1909 asked the Royal Automobile Club to frame conditions of a test that should be of unprecedented severity and would demonstrate in the most public manner possible that the new Daimler engine was in every way reliable.

The two engines selected for this test were a 38 and a 22-h.p., having a bore and stroke, respectively, of 124 by 130&amp;nbsp;mm. and 96 by 130&amp;nbsp;mm. They were bolted down to the test bench close together in one of the large engine testing shops at the Daimler Works. The section of the shop in which they were placed was railed off and under the sole charge and observation of the R.A.C. officials from the start of the test to the finish. The observers kept watch day and night just as on board a ship, and periodically tested the revolution counters and spring balances to ensure that the engines were always running under full load. Every possible precaution was taken to keep constant and close observation upon the test, and there were never less than two observers on duty.

Both engines were started up at 6 a.m. on Monday, March 22, 1909, and each completed the 132 hours' bench test on the following Saturday evening. To appreciate more clearly the severity of the test, if the larger engine had been driving a car during the whole time, with the standard Daimler gear ratios, a distance of no less than 8,252 miles (13280&amp;nbsp;km) would have been covered, at a mean speed of 43.45 m.p.h. (69.92&amp;nbsp;km/h) while the smaller engine would have covered, similarly, a distance of 8,830 miles (14210&amp;nbsp;km) at 48.4 m.p.h. (77.9&amp;nbsp;km/h). The disparity in speed and distance between these results is, of course, attributable to the higher rate of revolutions of the smaller engine.

'''-- Details of the 38-H.P. Engine Test --'''

First Bench Test-

The speed of the engine was 1200 r.p.m. giving a limit of 50.0 h.p. below which the h.p. was at no time to fall.

The duration of the test was 5 days 14 hours 15 minutes or 134.25 hours.

There were no stops incurring any penalties.

There were five stops totalling 1 hour and 56 minutes which did not incur any penalty under Rule 6 (2)

The load was eased for a total of 19 minutes for brake adjustments, but the engine was not stopped.
Average horse-power recorded, 54.3.

Petrol consumed, 614 gallons equal to .679 pints per horse-power hour.

Running Test

On completion of the first test, the engine was removed from the bench and fitted under observation to the chassis without any vital parts being disturbed. A standard type four-seater body was fitted and the car proceeded from Coventry to Weybridge - 112 miles (180.2&amp;nbsp;km). The average weight of the car and passengers on the road was 4,085&amp;nbsp;lbs = 1 ton 16 cwt 1 qr 25&amp;nbsp;lbs (1852.9&amp;nbsp;kg).

The runs on Brooklands track amounted to 1,930.5 miles (3106.8&amp;nbsp;km)at an average speed of 42.4&amp;nbsp;mph (68.2&amp;nbsp;km/h) with an average weight of car and passengers of 3,805&amp;nbsp;lb (1726&amp;nbsp;kg). A distance of 5 miles was traversed in running to and from the car-headquarters and the track, and this with the return journey to Coventry made a total mileage of 2,159.5 (3474.5&amp;nbsp;km).

The petrol consumption on the track was equal to 20.57 m.p.g. and on the road 19.48 m.p.g.
The ton-miles per gallon of fuel were 34.94 on the track and 35.97 on the road.

Final Bench Test

On arrival in Coventry, the engine was replaced on the test bench and run for 5 hours 15 minutes during which there were no stoppages of any description; the load was eased for 15 minutes for brake adjustments.

Average horse-power recorded, 57.25.

Petrol consumed, 22.5 gallons = .599 pints per horse-power hour.

The judges append the following remarks to their certificate:
"The engine was completely dismantled, and no perceptible wear was noticeable on any of the fitted surfaces.
The cylinders and pistons were found to be notably clean.
The only perceptible wear in any part was caused by two joint pins rubbing against adjacent parts.
The ports of the valves showed no burning or wear."

'''-- Details of the 22-H.P. Engine Test --'''

First Bench Test-

The speed of the engine was 1,400 r.p.m. giving a limit of 35.3 h.p. below which the h.p. was at no time to fall.

The duration of the test was 5 days 12 hours 58 minutes or 132 hours 58 minutes.
There were no stops incurring any penalty.

There were two stops of 17 minutes total duration, which did not incur any penalty under Rule 6 (2)
The load was eased for a total of 41 minutes for brake adjustments, but the engine was not stopped.
Average horse-power recorded was 38.83.

Petrol consumed, 476.5 gallons equal to .739 pints per h.p. hour.

Running Test

The conditions for the running test were the same as for the 38-h.p. car test, but with varying figures as to the results.

Average weight of the car and passengers on the road was 3,512.5&amp;nbsp;lbs (1638.6&amp;nbsp;kg); on the track, 3,332.5&amp;nbsp;lb (1511.6&amp;nbsp;kg).

Distance covered on Brooklands track, 1,914.1 miles (3080.4&amp;nbsp;km).

Average speed, 41.88&amp;nbsp;mph (67.4&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The petrol consumption on the track was equal to 22.44 m.p.g. and on the road 19.48 m.p.g.
The ton-miles per gallon of fuel were 33.37 on the track and 31.19 on the road.

The total mileage of 2,143.1 (3449&amp;nbsp;km).

Final Bench Test

Duration, 5 hours 2 minutes. No stoppages of any description; the load was eased for 1 minute.
Average horse-power recorded, 38.96.
Petrol consumed, 18.25 gallons = .749 pints per h.p. hour.
The judges append the following remarks to their certificate:
"The engine was completely dismantled, and no perceptible wear was noticeable on any of the fitted surfaces.
The cylinders and pistons were found to be notably clean.
The ports of the valves showed no burning or wear."

'''Franco Modigliani''' ({{IPA-it|ˈfraŋko modiʎˈʎani|lang}}; June 18, 1918 – September 25, 2003) was an [[Italians|Italian]]-[[United States|American]] [[economist]] and the recipient of the 1985 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. He was a professor at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|UIUC]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT]].

==Early life and education==
Modigliani was born on 18 June 1918, in [[Rome, Italy]], to the [[Jewish Italian]] family of a [[pediatrician]] father and a voluntary [[social worker]] mother.&lt;ref name=klein&gt;"Franco Modigliani" by [[Daniel B. Klein]] and Ryan Daza, in "[https://econjwatch.org/file_download/709/ProfilesSept2013.pdf?mimetype=pdf The Ideological Migration of the Economics Laureates]", ''[[Econ Journal Watch]]'', 10(3), September 2013, pp. 472-293&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered college at the age of seventeen, enrolling in the faculty of Law at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref name=parisi&gt;Parisi, Daniela (2005) "Five Italian Articles Written by the Young Franco Modigliani (1937–1938)", ''Rivista Internazional di Scienze Sociali'', 113(4), pp. 555–557 (in [[Italian language|language]])&lt;/ref&gt; A few years before, in 1936, his submission to a nation-wide contest in [[economics]], sponsored by the official [[Gioventù Italiana del Littorio|student organization]] of the state, had won first prize and Modigliani received an award from the hand of [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=klein /&gt;&lt;ref name=auto&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1985/modigliani-bio.html Franco Modigliani], autobiographical notes, Nobel Prize organization website, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Among his early works in [[fascist]] Italy was an article about the organization and management of production in a [[socialist]] economy, written in [[Italian language|Italian]] and arguing the case for socialism along lines laid out by earlier [[market socialist]]s like [[Abba Lerner]] and [[Oskar Lange]].&lt;ref name=advisor /&gt;

After the passage of [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws in Italy]], in 1938, Modigliani left Italy for [[Paris]] together with his then-girlfriend, Serena Calabi, to join her parents there. After briefly returning to [[Rome]] to discuss his [[doctoral thesis]] at the city's University, he obtained his diploma on 22 July 1939, and returned to Paris.&lt;ref name=auto/&gt;

The same year, they all emigrated to the United States  and he enrolled at the Graduate Faculty of the [[New School for Social Research]]. His [[degree thesis]], an elaboration and extension of [[John Hicks]]'s [[IS–LM]] model, was written under the supervision of [[Jacob Marschak]] and [[Abba Lerner]], in 1944,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The basis of his dissertation subsequently appeared in ''Econometrica''. See Modigliani (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered "ground breaking."&lt;ref name=advisor /&gt;

==Career==
From 1942 to 1944, Modigliani taught at [[Columbia University]] and [[Bard College]] as an instructor in [[economics]] and [[statistics]]. In 1946, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]]. In 1948, he joined the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] faculty. From 1952 to 1962, he was a member of the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] faculty.&lt;ref name=indy /&gt;

In 1962, he joined the faculty of [[MIT]], as an [[Institute Professor]].&lt;ref name=indy /&gt;

==Contributions to economic theory==
Modigliani, from the 1950s, is the originator&lt;ref&gt;Modigliani, Franco &amp; Richard H. Brumberg (1954) "Utility analysis and the Consumption Function: An Interpretation of Cross-Section Data", [[Kenneth K. Kurihara]] (editor) ''Post-Keynesian Economics'', New Brunswick: [[Rutgers University]] Press, 1954, pp. 388–436&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[life-cycle hypothesis]], which attempts to explain the level of [[saving]] in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modigliani |first=Franco |title=The Life Cycle Hypothesis of Saving, the Demand for Wealth and the Supply of Capital |journal=[[Social Research (journal)|Social Research]] |year=1966 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=160–217 |jstor=40969831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the hypothesis it is proposed that [[consumer]]s aim for a stable level of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] throughout their lifetime (for example by saving during their working years and then spending during their [[retirement]]).

The [[rational expectations]] hypothesis is considered by economists&lt;ref name=exp&gt;Wade-Hands, Douglas (1986) ''Modigliani And Grunberg : A Precursor To Rational Expectations?'', [[University of Puget Sound]]&lt;/ref&gt; to originate in the later-considered "seminal"&lt;ref&gt;Visco, Ignazio (1984) "Price expectations in rising inflation", ''Contributions to economic analysis'', Volume 152, North-Holland, 1984, {{ISBN|0444868364}}, {{ISBN|9780444868367}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper written by Modigliani and Emile Grunberg in 1954.&lt;ref name=grun&gt;Grunberg, E. &amp; Franco Modigliani (1954) "The Predictability of Social Events," ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', '''62''', pp. 465-478,December, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lives of the Laureates: Ten Nobel Economists|author1=Breit, William |author2=Spencer, Roger W.|publisher=MIT Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0262023085 |location=Massachusetts|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was a member of the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] faculty, he formulated in 1958, along with [[Merton Miller]], the [[Modigliani–Miller theorem]] for [[corporate finance]].&lt;ref name=mm1&gt;Miller, Merton H. &amp; Franco Modigliani (1958) "[https://gvpesquisa.fgv.br/sites/gvpesquisa.fgv.br/files/arquivos/terra_-_the_cost_of_capital_corporation_finance.pdf The cost of capital, corporate finance and the theory of investment]", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', Vol. XLVIII, June 1958, #3, pp. 261–297. The article was a revised version of a paper delivered at the annual meeting of the [[Econometric Society]] in December 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mm2&gt;Miller, Merton H. &amp; Franco Modigliani (1963) "Corporate Income Taxes and the Cost of Capital: A Correction", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', Vol. 53, No. 3, June 1963, pp. 433–443&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem posits that, under certain assumptions,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The theorem assumes an economic environment with an [[efficient market]] and without [[tax]]es, [[bankruptcy]] costs, [[agency cost]]s, and [[asymmetric information]].&lt;/ref&gt; the value of a firm is not affected by whether it is financed by [[Stock|equity]] (selling shares) or by [[debt]] (borrowing money), meaning that the [[debt-to-equity ratio]] is unimportant for private firms.&lt;ref name=mm1/&gt;&lt;ref name=mm2/&gt;

In the early 1960s, his response,&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Ando|Ando, Albert]] &amp; Franco Modigliani (1965) "The relative stability of monetary velocity and the investment multiplier", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', 55.4, pp.&amp;nbsp;693–728&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with [[Albert Ando]], to the 1963 paper&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]] &amp; [[David I. Meiselman]] (1963) "The Relative Stability of Monetary Velocity and the Investment Multiplier in the United States, 1897–1958", ''Stabilization Policies: A Series of Research Studies Prepared for the [[Commission on Money and Credit]]'' by E. C. Brown [[et al]], Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall: 1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;165–268&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[David I. Meiselman]], initiated the so-called "monetary/fiscal policy debate" among economists, which went on for more than sixty years.&lt;ref&gt;Bias, Peter V. (2014) "[http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/141974.pdf A chronological survey of the Friedman–Meiselman / Andersen–Jordan single equation debate]", ''Research in Business and Economics Journal'', '''10''', October 2014, Academic and Business Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Modigliani, in a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modigliani |first=Franco |first2=Lucas |last2=Papademos |year=1975 |title=Targets for Monetary Policy in the Coming Year |journal=[[Brookings Papers on Economic Activity]] |volume=1975 |issue=1 |pages=141–165 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |jstor=2534063 |doi=10.2307/2534063}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose co-author was his former student [[Lucas Papademos]],&lt;ref group= note&gt;Papademos went on to become Governor of the [[Bank of Greece]] from 1994 until 2002, and [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from November 2011 to May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of the "NIRU", the non-inflationary rate of [[unemployment]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Subsequently known as the "[[NAIRU|non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment]]" (NAIRU)&lt;/ref&gt; ostensibly an improvement over the "[[natural rate of unemployment]]" concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Coe |first=David T |title=Nominal Wages. The NAIRU and Wage Flexibility. |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/59/19/33917832.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms refer to a level of unemployment below which [[inflation]] rises.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Inflation "rises"; it does not "accelerate," as can often be misread from the acronym [[NAIRU]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Modigliani and his granddaughter, Leah Modigliani, developed what is now called the "[[Modigliani Risk-Adjusted Performance]]," a measure of the risk-adjusted returns of an [[investment portfolio]] that was derived from the [[Sharpe ratio]], adjusted for the risk of the portfolio relative to that of a benchmark, e.g. the "market."&lt;ref&gt;Modigliani, Franco &amp; Leah Modigliani (1997) "Risk-Adjusted Performance", ''[[The Journal of Portfolio Management]]'',  Winter 1997, 23 (2), pp. 45–54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointments and awards==
In October 1985, Modigliani was awarded that year's [[Nobel prize in Economics]] "for his pioneering analyses of [[saving]] and of [[financial market]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1985/press.html Press Release], Nobel Prize Organisation, 15 October 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Modigliani received MIT's James R. Killian Faculty Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions|last=Fabozzi|first=Frank J.|author2=Frank J. Jones |author3=Franco Modigliani |pages=Dedication|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=0-13-613531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, he received an ''[[honoris causa]]'' degree in [[Management Engineering]] from the [[University of Naples Federico II]] in 1997.

Late in his life, Modigliani became a trustee of the [[Economists for Peace and Security]] organization, formerly "Economists Allied for Arms Reduction"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.epsusa.org/publications/newsletter/2000/april2000/NewsNetworkApril2000.pdf The Newsletter for Economists Allied for Arms Reduction]'', Vol. 12, '''1''', April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered an "influential adviser": in the late 1960s, on a contract with the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]], he designed the "MIT-Pennsylvania-Social Science Research Council" model, a tool that "guided [[monetary policy]] in Washington for many decades."&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

A collection of Modigliani's papers is housed at [[Duke University]]'s [[David Rubenstein#Duke University|Rubenstein]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/modigliani/ |title=Franco Modigliani Papers, 1936–2005 and undated, bulk 1970s–2003 |publisher= [[David Rubenstein#Duke University|Rubenstein]] Library, [[Duke University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Modigliani's work on fiscal policy came under criticism from followers of [[Post-Keynesian economics]], who disputed the "Keynesianism" of his viewpoints, pointing out his contribution to the [[NAIRU]] concept,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Mitchell, William]] (2016) "[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=32828 The Modigliani controversy: The break with Keynesian thinking]", 21 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his general stance on [[fiscal policy|fiscal deficits]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Modigliani Andre &amp; Franco Modigliani (1987) "[https://watermark.silverchair.com/51-4-459.pdf The Growth of the Federal Deficit and the pole of public attitudes]", ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'', Volume 51, [[University of Chicago]] Press, pp. :459-480&lt;/ref&gt; The Modigliani-Miller theorem implies that, for a closed economy, state borrowing is merely deferred [[tax]]ation, since state spending can be financed only by "[[fiscal policy|printing money]]", taxation, or borrowing, and therefore monetary financing of state spending implies the subsequent imposition of a so-called "inflation tax," which ostensibly has the same effect on [[permanent income]] as explicit taxation.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See "[[crowding out effect]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blejer, Mario I.Adrienne Cheasty (1993) "How to measure the fiscal deficit : analytical and methodological issues", Washington, DC : [[International Monetary Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, they acknowledged his dissenting voice on the issue of unemployment, where Modigliani concurred early on&lt;ref&gt;Modigliani, Franco (2000) "Europe’s Economic Problems", ''Carpe Oeconomiam Papers in Economics'', 3rd Monetary and Finance Lecture, Freiburg, 6 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; with [[heterodox economist]]s that Europe-wide unemployment in the late 20th century was caused by the lack of [[demand]] induced by [[austerity]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Mitchell, William]] (2011) "[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=15250 Lies, damned lies, and statistics]", 13 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demand-driven fiscal policies, as opposed to [[supply-side economics|supply-driven]], are a cornerstone of Keynesian and Post-Keynesian economics. For a critique of European economic policies from a modern, Post-Keynesian point of view, see e.g. Mitchell, William (2016) ''Eurozone Dystopia: Groupthink and Denial on a Grand Scale'',  [[Edward Elgar]], 2015, {{ISBN|978-1784716653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1939, while they were in Paris, after having left Italy, Modigliani married  Serena Calabi. They had two children, Andre and Sergio Modigliani. Their grandchildren were Leah, Julia, David, and Amelia, and their great-grandchildren Micaela, Sophia, Serena, and Chiara.&lt;ref name=serena&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?n=serena-modigliani&amp;pid=117938563 Serena Calabi] obituary, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 24 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; When Franco Modigliani took the job at MIT, the couple bought a home on North Road overlooking [[Vineyard Sound]], near [[Chilmark, Massachusetts|Chilmark]],&lt;ref name=chil&gt;"[https://vineyardgazette.com/obituaries/2008/10/10/chilmarker-serena-modigliani-91-escaped-fascism Chilmarker Serena Modigliani, 91, Escaped Fascism]", ''[[Vineyard Gazette]]'', 9 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where they lived for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name=indy&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-franco-modigliani-37186.html Professor Franco Modigliani], obituary, ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Modigliani died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, in 2003, while still working at MIT, and teaching until the last months of his life.&lt;ref&gt;"In March 2003, only few months before his demise, I was at MIT and witnessed Franco [Modigliani] still teaching with the same enthusiasm another class at the [[Sloan School of Management]]" : from Pagano, Marco (2005) "[http://www.csef.it/WP/wp139.pdf The Modigliani-Miller Theorems: A Cornerstone of Finance]", Center for Studies in Economics and Finance, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Serena Modigliani-Calabi, active to the end in [[progressive politics]], most notably with the [[League of Women Voters]], and an outspoken believer in [[participatory democracy]],&lt;ref name=chil/&gt; died in 2008.&lt;ref name=serena/&gt;

==Background==

iModerate was founded by Carl Rossow, Joel Benenson, Scott Rossow, Jen Drolet and Adam Rossow in 2004 to provide large organizations with more insightful market research.&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt; The company was created to introduce more extensive insights into market research by utilizing one-on-one, real-time conversations with consumers.&lt;ref name ="I2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imoderate.com/company/our-story|title=Our Story|publisher=iModerate |accessdate= 3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach was considered novel at the time when most marketing research was being conducted through traditional focus groups and standard online surveys.&lt;ref name="INC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="I2" /&gt;

Prior to founding iModerate, Carl Rossow led the Denver research firm Innovative Survey Research, and was the head of internal polling operations for U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] from 1996 to 2000.&lt;ref name="BJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="INC" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="BJ2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/potm/2010-03-29/|title=People On the Move|publisher=Business Journals |accessdate= 3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==

During the conversations, iModerate moderators collect qualitative feedback  from the consumer, such as the ways the consumer uses a given product or service.&lt;ref name="INC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt; In many cases, the qualitative conversations are conducted in conjunction with online surveys for a more comprehensive hybrid research approach.&lt;ref name="IM" /&gt;

iModerate’s qualitative offering is based on a proprietary approach and analysis framework called ThoughtPath.&lt;ref name="IM" /&gt; The framework is developed from cognitive theories and empirical information derived from previous conversations.&lt;ref name="IM" /&gt;

This participation was primarily active in the early to middle 1920s.

Zuckermann spent his career in all segments of the wood industry, including the great forests of [[Białowieża Forest|Bialowieza]] (portions of which are in [[Poland]]), and in his early work the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrio-Hungarian Empire]]. He created a [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] wood products company with headquarters in Vienna during the early 20th century. This company was instrumental in introducing, on a major scale, the use of [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] rails with steam engines for the transportation of harvested logs to saw mills, a major improvement in this industry. Although there were some others who had experimented with this technique, Zuckermann and the AMH company maximized its use.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. Frederick Zuckermann-Reitler (1903-1996), economist, and son of Isidor Zuckermann, at his home in Los Angeles, California in 1979, by Joseph Cooper, Cooper Associates, Chapel Hill, North Carolina&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2572">'''Lloyd Glenn Perry''' (October 28, 1944 – October 21, 1998) was the first [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oca.htm Chief Accountant] of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|United States Securities and Exchange Commission]].  His appointment to this post by [[Ronald Reagan]] was announced on September 23, 1982 in the SEC News Digest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/digest/1982/dig092382.pdf SEC News Digest, September 23 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He led numerous actions against publicly traded companies for false financial reporting and disclosure known as "[[cooking the books]]."  Most notable of these was the action against California's Financial Corp. of America.  After an investigation by Perry and the SEC, the company was forced to re-report second-quarter profits in 1984 to show a $107.5 million loss instead of a $31.1 million profit.  This case is credited with being the first indication of the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950159,00.html Time Magazine, September 23, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a recognized expert in policing false financial disclosure and articles written by him such as "Policing Financial Disclosure Fraud: The SEC's Top Priority" are still referenced and used in college accounting text books such as "Accounting Theory" ({{ISBN|0471189081}}   LCC: HF5625) edited by Richard G. Schroeder and Myrtle W. Clark and published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isbndb.com/d/book/accounting_theory_a20.html ISBNdb.com, Accounting Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on October 28, 1944 in [[Gatesville, North Carolina]].  He graduated from [[Churchland High School]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] and was a star baseball player and track athlete.  He graduated from [[Old Dominion University|Old Dominion College]] in 1967 and was a member of the [[Alpha Kappa Psi]] business fraternity.

He was Chairman of the Ethics Committee of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].

He was a Senior Partner of the accounting firm [[KPMG]] retiring as head of the Office of Ethics and Professional Practice.  Upon being made a partner in 1976 at the age of 31, he was the youngest person to achieve that in the firm's history at that time.

'''Maiden Lane''' is an east-west street in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. Its eastern end is at [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]], near the [[South Street Seaport]], and its western end is at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] near the [[World Trade Center site]], where it becomes [[Cortlandt Street (Manhattan)|Cortlandt Street]].

==History==
===Etymology===
The street received its name in [[New Amsterdam]], as ''Maagde Paatje'', a "footpath used by lovers along a rippling brook", according to the ''WPA Guide to New York City'',&lt;ref&gt;''WPA Guide'', (1939) 1982, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; a "pebbly brook" that ran from [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] to the [[East River]], where wives and daughters washed linen according to the city historians Edwin  Burrows and Mike Wallace.&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moscow 1978, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows et al. 1999, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kadinsky, Sergey (2016) ''Hidden Waters of New York City'' Countryman Press. pp.21-22 {{ISBN|978-1-58157-355-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The street was formally laid out in 1696, the first street north of still-palisaded [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1728, a market was held at the foot of Maiden Lane, where it ended at Front Street facing the [[East River]]; by 1823, when it was demolished and disbanded,&lt;ref&gt;Hemstreet 1899, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; the Fly Market,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Keeping its Dutch name ''vly'' "valley", for the long-gone stream-bed at the foot of Maiden Lane.&lt;/ref&gt; selling meat, country produce and fish under its covered roofs, was New York's oldest.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows and Wallace 1999, pp. 125, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;  It eventually gave way to the [[Fulton Fish Market]], and later, the New Amsterdam Market.&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt; The Fly Market, and its successor the Fulton Fish Market, which moved to [[the Bronx]] in 2005, was one of New York's earliest open-air fish markets. From a New York newspaper dated 1831:  
 
{{quote|In New York, there are a number of Markets. Those called Fulton and Washington Markets are the largest. Fulton Market is at the East end of Fulton Street near the East River...The first was formerly situated in Maiden Lane on the East River side, and was called Fly Market.}}

The [[New York Slave Revolt of 1712]] happened around Maiden Lane, in which 23 black slaves revolted, killing nine white men and women and injuring six other whites.&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt;

In September 1732, a company of professional actors arrived from London and took an upstairs room near the junction of Pearl Street which was fitted up with a platform stage, and marked the origin of professional theater in New York; by the time the company was disbanded in 1734, their building was known as the Play House.&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] rented a house at 57 Maiden Lane when he moved to New York to serve as the [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt; His dinner on June 20, 1790 at that house with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] produced the [[Compromise of 1790]], whereby Hamilton won the decision for the national government to take over and pay the state debts, while Jefferson and Madison obtained the national capital (District of Columbia) for the South. The dinner was celebrated in the song "The Room Where It Happens" in the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lin-Manuel Miranda|Miranda, Lin-Manuel]] (January 20, 2015) [https://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-the-room-where-it-happens-lyrics/ "The Room Where It Happens"] ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' Accessed: October 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Maiden Lane was a street of shops by the end of the 18th century, even before the new fashion for multi-paned shop windows caught on in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows and Wallace 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827 the skylit New York Arcade, banking on the fashionable success of London's [[Burlington Arcade]] (1819), spanned the block between Maiden Lane and John Street east of Broadway with forty smart shops; however, while regarded as beautiful by many, it was also financially disastrous, and [[Charles Haynes Haswell]] recalled that "it had not the success that had been anticipated&amp;hellip;and survived but a few years".&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haswell 1896, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Maiden Lane was soon one of the first city streets to be lit with [[gas lamp]]s, which led to its being a popular shopping street.&lt;ref name="utc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows and Wallace 1999, pp. 437, 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  The slip at the foot of Main Lane was infilled in the early 19th century, accounting for the widened stretch in the last blocks before [[South Street (Manhattan)|South Street]], the present waterfront.&lt;ref&gt;Hemstreet 1899, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; The water of the erstwhile brook ran down the center of the street, until 1827, when a suggestion was made in Common Council to close it over and lead rainwater to the side gutters.&lt;ref&gt;Haswell 1896, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the handful of mid-19th century commercial structures still standing in the Financial District, is the building 90-94 Maiden Lane, built for [[Roosevelt &amp; Son]], with a cast-iron front (attributed to Charles Wright, 1870–71) by Daniel D. Badger.&lt;ref&gt;New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission 2009, p. 14, inv. no. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Badger also supplied the cast-iron for the landmarked [[E. V. Haughwout Building]] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[Louise Nevelson]] Plaza, a triangular-shaped plaza at [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Street]], opened.&lt;ref name="utc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://untappedcities.com/2012/11/21/history-of-streets-maiden-lane/ | title=History of Streets: Maiden Lane | work=Untapped Cities | date=21 November 2012 | accessdate=23 August 2014 | author=Trapnell, Kelli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry district===
From 1795 until the early 20th century, Maiden Lane was the center of the jewelry district. At Broadway, the bronze and glass clock embedded in the sidewalk by William Barthman Jewelers still keeps time.&lt;ref name="goth140929"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jen |last=Carlson |work=[[Gothamist]] |title=A Clock Has Been Embedded In This Manhattan Sidewalk Since The 1800s |url=http://gothamist.com/2014/09/29/sidewalk_clock_nyc.php |date=September 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409080541/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/29/sidewalk_clock_nyc.php |archivedate=April 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt940626"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anna |last=Kannapell |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=F.Y.I. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/nyregion/fyi-492515.html |date=June 26, 1994 |accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 developers Boehm &amp; Coon erected the ten story [[14 Maiden Lane|Diamond Exchange Building]] on Maiden Lane, which was specially designed to accommodate the heavy safes used by gem dealers.&lt;ref name="rerbg1366"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rerecord.cul.columbia.edu/document.php?vollist=1&amp;vol=ldpd_7031148_013&amp;page=ldpd_7031148_013_00000837 | title=The Diamond Exchange Building No. 14 Maiden Lane | journal=Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide | date=19 May 1894 | volume=53 | issue=1366 | pages=801}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 1924, “the bride-to-be who could show a ring from Maiden Lane was thrice happy” because of the abundance of jewelry stores.&lt;ref name="nyt080831"/&gt; In 1946 the [[New York City Police Department]] estimated that it was walked on by 51,000 people every weekday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh 2006, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jewelry industry started to move north by the 1920s, but had previously and fruitlessly tried to move uptown in the 1870s and 1900s. This was in part because the buildings on Maiden Lane had begun to age, even in the 1910s.&lt;ref name="nyt080831"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/realestate/31scap.html?_r=0 | title=An Unshowy Setting for Gems | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=29 August 2008 | accessdate=23 August 2014 | author=Gray, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the city's rapid growth after [[World War II]], this district was later moved to [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] on the [[Bowery]] and [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], and to West [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/05/lower-manhattan/ | title=Lower Manhattan | work=[[Forgotten NY]] |date=May 2010 | accessdate=23 August 2014 | author=Walsh, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maiden Lane's jewelry district was referred to in the 1936 American crime film ''[[15 Maiden Lane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thevillager.com/villager_354/memoriesofmaidenlane.html | title=Memories of Maiden Lane | work=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]] | date=10–16 February 2010 | accessdate=23 August 2014 | author=Wolfe, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maksharip Magometovich Aushev''' ({{lang-ru|Макшарип Магометович Аушев}}; 16 February 1966 – 25 October 2009) was an [[Ingush people|Ingush]] businessman and opposition leader&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/8325317.stm Leading Ingush activist shot dead.] ''[[BBC News]]'', 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Republic of Ingushetia]], a federal subject of the [[Russian Federation]]. Aushev had taken over the opposition website, [[Ingushetia.org]], after its owner, [[Magomed Yevloyev]], a vocal critic of the Ingush government, was shot and killed while in police custody.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Barry |title=Activist Killing Said to Be Tied to the Police |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/world/europe/27ingushetia.html|work= [[New York Times]] |publisher=|date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Aushev was a businessman and a member of a prominent Ingushetian family.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news |first=Ellen |last=Barry |title=Ingushetia Opposition Figure Is Shot Dead in Car |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/world/europe/26ingushetia.html?_r=1|work= [[New York Times]] |publisher=|date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Aushev's son and nephew were both kidnapped.  He blamed Ingush security forces under the control of then-[[President of Ingushetia]] [[Murat Zyazikov]] for the [[abductions]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; Aushev organized protests against the security forces and the Zyazikov government.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

In 2008, journalist [[Magomed Yevloyev]], the owner of [[Ingushetia.org]] and a critic of the Zyazikov government, was shot and killed while in police custody.  Aushev personally took over ownership of Ingushetia.org following Yevloyev's death.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

The Russian government removed Zyazikov in October 2008 and installed [[Yunus-Bek Yevkurov]] as president.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; Yevkurov offered [[dissidents]] in Ingushetia a certain amount of protection from politically motivated attacks.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; Aushev largely supported Yevkurov policies towards the opposition, and withdrew from his most vocal opposition to the government since Yevkurov's installation.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Aushev accepted a position on a human rights council set up by the ombudsman of Russia's federal government.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; However, he remained a vocal critic of former President Zyazikov and his relatives, as well as the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russian [[special forces]] in [[Ingushetia]] and [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

Aushev survived an attempted kidnapping in September 2009.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; In an interview with an [[Australia]]n television network, he revealed that he had “very strong information that I was going to be killed” during the failed abuduction.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

On October 25, 2009, Aushev was shot and killed on the spot when gunmen attacked his car on a road near [[Nalchik]] in the neighboring Republic of [[Kabardino-Balkaria]].&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt; He was buried in the Ingush village of [[Surkhakhi]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Post-death==

On 8 December 2009, Aushev was posthumously awarded the Russian Federation's [[Human rights in Russia|human rights]] ombudsman's medal “{{lang|ru|Спешите делать добро}}” (''{{lang|ru-Latn|Speshite delat dobro}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ombudsman.gov.ru/doc/vistup12/s09_12_09.shtml|script-title=ru:Сообщение пресс-службы Уполномоченного по правам человека в Российской Федерации|date=2009-12-09|work=[http://ombudsman.gov.ru/ Уполномоченный по правам человека в Российской Федерации]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 [[Russia Today|RT]] documentary, ''Blood and Honor: Chechen Vendetta Code'', Aushev's father, Magomed Aushev, states that he has spent more than $1 million trying to track down his son's killers. Magomed said he would forgive his son's killers only if they came to him first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood and Honour|url=http://rtd.rt.com/films/blood-and-honour/|publisher=[[Russia Today]]|accessdate=19 April 2015|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar thesis was originally expressed by [[Daniel Guérin]], in his 1936 book ''[[Fascism and Big Business]]'', about the [[Fascism|fascist]] government support to heavy industry. It can be defined as, "an informal and changing coalition of groups with vested psychological, moral, and material interests in the continuous development and maintenance of high levels of weaponry, in preservation of colonial markets and in military-strategic conceptions of internal affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Pursell, C. (1972). The military–industrial complex. Harper &amp; Row Publishers, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
An exhibit of the trend was made in [[Franz Leopold Neumann]]'s book ''[[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism]]'' in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state.

Such type of complex, in the First World War, had taken US to the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]].{{vague|date=August 2018}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Eisenhower farewell address.ogg|right|thumb|Eisenhower's farewell address, January 17, 1961. The term ''military–industrial complex'' is used at 8:16. Length: 15:30.]]

[[President of the United States]] (and [[five-star general]] during World War II) [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] used the term in his [[Eisenhower's farewell address|Farewell Address to the Nation]] on January 17, 1961:

{{quote|A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...

This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.
In the councils of government, '''we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex'''. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together. [emphasis added]}}

The phrase was thought to have been "war-based" industrial complex before becoming "military" in later drafts of Eisenhower's speech, a claim passed on only by oral history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-12-10-eisenhower-address_N.htm |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |title=Papers shed light on Eisenhower's farewell address |author=John Milburn |date=December 10, 2010 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Geoffrey Perret]], in his biography of Eisenhower, claims that, in one draft of the speech, the phrase was "military–industrial–congressional complex", indicating the essential role that the [[United States Congress]] plays in the propagation of the military industry, but the word "congressional" was dropped from the final version to appease the then-currently elected officials.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/guest-post-james-ledbetter-on-50-years-of-the-military-industrial-complex/|title=Guest Post: 50 Years of the "Military–Industrial Complex"|last=Ledbetter|first=James|date=25 January 2011|work=Schott's Vocab|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Ledbetter]] calls this a "stubborn misconception" not supported by any evidence; likewise a claim by [[Douglas Brinkley]] that it was originally "military–industrial–scientific complex".&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=52 |issue=6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323001947/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2001/6/2001_6_58.shtml |archivedate=23 March 2006 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2001/6/2001_6_58.shtml|title=Eisenhower; His farewell speech as President inaugurated the spirit of the 1960s|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas|date=September 2001|work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Henry Giroux]] claims that it was originally "military–industrial–academic complex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820234731/http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=168000 |archivedate=20 August 2007 |url=http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=168000 |title=''The University in Chains: Confronting the Military–Industrial–Academic Complex'' |last1=Giroux |first1=Henry |last2= |first2= |date=June 2007 |work= |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual authors of the speech were Eisenhower's speechwriters [[Ralph E. Williams]] and [[Malcolm Moos]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Charles "New Light on Eisenhower's Farewell Address," in Presidential Studies Quarterly 22 (Summer 1992): 469–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to conceptualize something similar to a modern "military–industrial complex" existed before Eisenhower's address. Ledbetter finds the precise term used in 1947 in close to its later meaning in an article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' by Winfield W. Riefler.&lt;ref name="Ledbetter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riefler|first=Winfield W.|date=October 1947|title=Our Economic Contribution to Victory|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=26|issue=1|pages=90–103|jstor=20030091}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] had claimed in his book ''[[The Power Elite]]'' that a class of military, business, and political leaders, driven by mutual interests, were the real leaders of the state, and were effectively beyond democratic control. [[Friedrich Hayek]] mentions in his 1944 book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' the danger of a support of monopolistic organization of industry from World War II political remnants:

{{quote|Another element which after this war is likely to strengthen the tendencies in this direction will be some of the men who during the war have tasted the powers of [[coercive control]] and will find it difficult to reconcile themselves with the humbler roles they will then have to play [in peaceful times]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich von Hayek|Hayek, F. A.]], (1976) "The Road to Serfdom", London: Routledge, p. 146, note 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Vietnam War]]–era activists, such as [[Seymour Melman]], referred frequently to the concept, and use continued throughout the [[Cold War]]: [[George F. Kennan]] wrote in his preface to [[Norman Cousins]]'s 1987 book ''The Pathology of Power'', "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military–industrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=George Frost |last=Kennan |title=At a Century's Ending: Reflections 1982–1995 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60D6qQGjMdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US military bases in the world 2007.svg|thumb|U.S. military presence around the world in 2007. {{as of|2018}}, the United States still had many [[List of United States military bases|bases and troops stationed globally]].]]
In the late 1990s [[James Kurth]] asserted, "By the mid-1980s&amp;nbsp;... the term had largely fallen out of public discussion." He went on to argue that "[w]hatever the power of arguments about the influence of the military–industrial complex on weapons procurement during the Cold War, they are much less relevant to the current era".{{sfn|Kurth|1999}}

Contemporary students and critics of American [[militarism]] continue to refer to and employ the term, however. For example, historian [[Chalmers Johnson]] uses words from the second, third, and fourth paragraphs quoted above from Eisenhower's address as an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to Chapter Two ("The Roots of American Militarism") of a recent volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Chalmers |title=The sorrows of empire: Militarism, secrecy, and the end of the republic |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2004 |p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; on this subject. [[P. W. Singer]]'s book concerning [[private military company|private military companies]] illustrates contemporary ways in which industry, particularly an information-based one, still interacts with the U.S. federal and the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;''Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry''. Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressions [[permanent war economy]] and war corporatism are related concepts that have also been used in association with this term. The term is also used to describe comparable collusion in other political entities such as the [[German Empire]] (prior to and through the first world war), Britain, France, and (post-Soviet) [[Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Linguist and [[anarchism|anarchist]] theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] has suggested that "military–industrial complex" is a misnomer because (as he considers it) the phenomenon in question "is not specifically military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies, Noam Chomsky interviewed by David Barsamian|work=chomsky.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts, "There is no military–industrial complex: it's just the industrial system operating under one or another pretext (defense was a pretext for a long time)."&lt;ref&gt;In ''On Power, Dissent, and Racism: a Series of Discussions with Noam Chomsky'', Baraka Productions, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentagon contractor-funded American [[think tanks]] such as the [[Lexington Institute]] and the [[Atlantic Council]] have also demanded increased spending in view of the perceived Russian threat.&lt;ref name="theintercept.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, 11 May 2016, Testimony of M.

== Eras of the Military Industrial Complex ==
The Military Industrial Complex has gone through three distinct eras in its existence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynn III|first=William|date=Winter 2017|title=The End of the Military-Industrial Complex|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/end-military-industrial-complex|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=93|pages=104-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The First Era ===
From 1797 to 1941 the government only relied on civilian industries while the country was actually at war. The government owned their own shipyards and weapons manufacturing facilities which they relied on through [[World War I]]. With [[World War II]] came a massive shift in the way that the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]] armed the [[American military|military]]. 

With the onset of World War II President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate civilian industries and shift them into wartime production. Throughout World War II arms production in the United States went from around one percent of the annual [[GDP]] to 40 percent of the GDP&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. After the end of the war the American government did not dismantle the war machine that they had built. Various American companies, such as [[Boeing]] and [[General Motors]], maintained and expanded their defense divisions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. These companies have gone on to develop various technologies that have improved civilian life as well such as [[Night-vision device|night-vision goggles]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], and the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Second Era ===
The start of the second era of the Military Industrial Complex is said to start with the coining of the term by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. This era marked the end of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1993 the Pentagon urged defense contractors to consolidate due to the collapse of communism and shrinking defense budget.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Third (Current) Era ===
The third era of the Military Industrial Complex has seen the most change as defense contractors either consolidated or shifted their focus to civilian innovation. From 1992 to 1997 there was a total of $55 Billion worth of mergers in the defense industry. Major defense companies purchased smaller defense companies and became the major companies that know today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Department of Defense no longer exports technological advancements to the civilian market, they now import many technologies. [[3D printing]], [[cloud computing]], [[Computer security|cybersecurity]], and [[nanotechnology]] are all examples of the advancements of the civilian technological industry. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Pentagon no longer has the budget to award many defense contracts and the research and development budgets of defense contractors is far smaller than private technology companies. The lack of a large budget from the Pentagon has made defense contractors anxious to invest their own profits into research and development as it is unclear whether or not the Pentagon will be able to match their contributions to create intuitive new products. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Current applications==
[[File:Biggest arms sales 2013.png|thumbnail|right|Share of arms sales by country; source provided by [[SIPRI]]&lt;ref name="sipri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/production/recent-trends-in-arms-industry|title=Arms production - SIPRI|website=www.sipri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to [[SIPRI]], total world spending on military expenses in 2009 was $1.531 trillion U.S. dollars. 46.5% of this total, roughly $712 billion U.S. dollars, was spent by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Anup Shah]] | title = World Military Spending | url = http://www.globalissues.org/article/75/world-military-spending | accessdate = October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privatization of the production and invention of military technology also leads to a complicated relationship with significant research and development of many technologies. The [[military budget of the United States]] for the 2009 fiscal year was $515.4 billion. Adding emergency discretionary spending and supplemental spending, brings the sum to $651.2 billion.&lt;ref name="gpoaccess.gov"&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/pdf/budget/defense.pdf Gpoaccess.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107010807/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy09/pdf/budget/defense.pdf |date=2012-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include many military-related items that are outside of the Defense Department budget. Overall the U.S. federal government is spending about $1 trillion annually on defense-related purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Robert Higgs]] | title = The Trillion-Dollar Defense Budget Is Already Here | url = http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1941 | accessdate = March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 story, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' reported, "Despite a decline in global arms sales in 2010 due to [[recession]]ary pressures, the United States increased its market share, accounting for a whopping 53 percent of the trade that year. Last year saw the United States on pace to deliver more than $46 billion in foreign arms sales."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/2012/01/24/america_arms_dealer_to_the_world/  America, arms-dealer to the world]," ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]],'' January 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense industry also tends to contribute heavily to incumbent members of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42733.html|title=Defense goes all-in for incumbents - Jen DiMascio|author=Jen DiMascio|work=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monsanto Company''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|æ|n|t|oʊ}}) was an American [[agrochemical]] and [[agricultural biotechnology]] corporation that existed from 1901 until 2018 when it was acquired by [[Bayer]]. It was headquartered in [[Creve Coeur, Missouri|Creve Coeur]], [[Missouri]]. Monsanto developed [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]], a [[glyphosate]]-based [[herbicide]] in the 1970s, and became a major producer of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops.

Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants (1983),&lt;ref name="pbn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vib.be/en/about-vib/plant-biotech-news/Pages/The-race-towards-the-first-genetically-modified-plant.aspx|title=The race towards the first genetically modified plant|publisher=Plant Biotech News|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the first to conduct field trials of [[genetically modified crops]], (1987). It was one of the top 10 U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on [[biotechnology]]. Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the [[History of biotechnology#Biotechnology and industry|biotechnology industry]] business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Leonard-Barton, Gary P.

Monsanto's roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products and lobbying of government agencies and roots as a chemical company resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the [[insecticide]] [[DDT]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Agent Orange]] and [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[bovine somatotropin|bovine growth hormone]]. Its seed patenting model was criticized as [[biopiracy]] and a threat to [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Parsai"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2861063.ece|title=Opposition to Monsanto patent on Indian melons|last=Parsai|first=Gargi|date=February 5, 2012|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/nov/15/genetics2?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Biopirates who seek the greatest prizes|last=Vidal|first=John|date=November 15, 2000|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, [[Bayer]] announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion. After gaining US and EU regulatory approval, the sale was completed on June 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/bayer-closes-monsanto-deal-to-cap-63-billion-transformation|title=Bayer Closes Monsanto Deal to Cap $63 Billion Transformation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1901 to WWII ====
In 1901 Monsanto was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, as a [[chemical company]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/biotech-firms-need-innovation-strategies/5563/ |title=Biotech Firms Need Innovation Strategies |last = Glick |first=J.

He funded the firm with his own money and capital from a [[soft drink]] distributor. He used his wife's maiden name for the company. The company's first products were commodity food additives, such as the [[artificial sweetener]] [[saccharin]], [[caffeine]] and [[vanillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Simani, World Resources Institute. 2001.

Monsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at [[Cefn Mawr]], Wales. The venture produced vanillin, [[aspirin]] and its raw ingredient [[salicylic acid]], and later [[rubber]] processing chemicals. In the 1920s, Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as [[sulfuric acid]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]. Queeny's son [[Edgar Monsanto Queeny]] took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in [[Illinois]] (now known as [[Sauget, Illinois|Sauget]]). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for Monsanto plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115984289083380869|title=Yes, in My Backyard: Tiny Sauget, Illinois, Likes Business Misfits|last=Spain|first=William|date=2006-10-03|work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Monsanto bought the [[Swann Chemical Company]] in [[Anniston, Alabama]], and thereby entered the business of producing [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]].&lt;ref name="CIA1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poisoned By PCBs: 'A Lack of Control'|url=http://www.chemicalindustryarchives.org/dirtysecrets/anniston/2.asp|website=Chemical Industry Archives|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Head|first1=Thomas R., III|title=PCBs—The Rise and Fall of an Industrial Miracle|journal=Natural Resources &amp; Environment|date=Spring 2005|page=18|url=http://www.americanbar.org/tools/digitalassetabstract.html/content/dam/aba/publishing/natural_resources_environment/environ_mo_premium_nr_nre_spring05_Head.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montague"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Montague|first1=Peter|title=How We Got Here -- Part 1:  The History of Chlorinated Diphenyl (PCB's)|url=http://www.hudsonwatch.net/rachels01.html|website=HudsonWatch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Monsanto acquired Thomas &amp; Hochwalt Laboratories in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to acquire the expertise of [[Charles Allen Thomas]] and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became Monsanto's Central Research Department.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;Ralph Landau, [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4548&amp;page=338 "Charles Allen Thomas," ''Memorial Tributes''], vol. 2, National Academy of Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340–341}} Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951–1960) and Board Chair (1960–1965). He retired in 1970.&lt;ref name="Bird"&gt;David Bird, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/obituaries/charles-thomas-ex-chairman-of-monsanto.html "Charles Thomas, Ex-Chairman of Monsanto" (obituary)], ''The New York Times'', March 31, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, D.C., with [[Leslie Groves]], commander of the [[Manhattan Project]], and [[James Bryant Conant|James Conant]], president of [[Harvard University]] and chairman of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC).&lt;ref name="Building"&gt;''Dayton Daily News''. September 18, 1983 [http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/building_the_bomb_in_oakw.html "Building the Bomb in Oakwood"].&lt;/ref&gt; They urged Thomas to become co-director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Robert Oppenheimer]], but Thomas was reluctant to leave Dayton and Monsanto.&lt;ref name="Building" /&gt; He joined the NDRC, and Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct related research.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey V.

==== Post-WWII====
In 1946, Monsanto developed and marketed "All" laundry detergent, which they sold to [[Lever Brothers]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published: September 15, 2003 |url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/unilever-lever-brothers/98749/ |title=Unilever (Lever Brothers Co.) &amp;#124; AdAge Encyclopedia of Advertising – Advertising Age |publisher=Adage.com |date=September 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, its [[styrene]] factory was destroyed in the [[Texas City Disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Fire on the Grandcamp| url=http://www.texascity-library.org/disaster/first.php| publisher=Moore Memorial Public Library| location=Texas City, TX|date=n.d.|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Monsanto acquired American Viscose from [[Courtaulds]]. In 1954, Monsanto partnered with German chemical giant [[Bayer]] to form [[Mobay]] and market [[polyurethane]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Cynthia Day|title=Legal control of the multinational enterprise : national regulatory techniques and the prospects for international controls|date=1982|publisher=Nijhoff|location=The Hague|isbn=9789024726684|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto began manufacturing [[DDT]] in 1944, along with some 15 other companies. This insecticide was critical to the fight against [[malaria]]-transmitting mosquitoes. Due to DDT's toxicity, it was banned in the United States in 1972. In 1977, Monsanto stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/pcbs/pubs/about.htm Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)].

====1960s and 1970s====
In the mid‑1960s, [[William Standish Knowles]] and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize [[enantiomers]] via [[asymmetric hydrogenation]]. This was the first method for the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] production of pure [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Knowles. [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/knowles-lecture.pdf ASYMMETRIC HYDROGENATIONS]. Nobel Lecture, December 8, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles' team designed the "first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound"—[[L-dopa|L‑dopa]], which is used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yun |first=O. |date=November 22, 2005 |title=Profile of William S.

In the mid-1960s, chemists at Monsanto developed the [[Monsanto process]] for making [[acetic acid]], which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, Monsanto chemists invented [[AstroTurf]] (initially ChemGrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroturf.com/1964/06/|title=June - 1964 - AstroTurf|publisher=|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, Monsanto was a producer of [[Agent Orange]] for [[United States Armed Forces]] operations in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and settled out of court in a lawsuit brought by veterans in 1984.&lt;ref name="EncNatSec"&gt;"Agent Orange" entry in Encyclopedia of United States National Security, edited by Richard J. Samuel. SAGE Publications, 2005. {{ISBN|9781452265353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), using [[gallium arsenide]] [[phosphide]]. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards. The primary markets then were [[Calculator|electronic calculators]], [[Watch|digital watches]] and digital clocks.&lt;ref name="Schubert"&gt;{{Cite book|author=E. Fred Schubert|title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|chapter=1|isbn=978-0-8194-3956-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto became a pioneer of [[optoelectronics]] in the 1970s. Between 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the [[PGA Tour]] event in Pensacola, Florida, which was renamed the [[Pensacola Open|Monsanto Open]].

In 1974, [[Harvard University]] and Monsanto signed a 10-year [[Medical research#Privately .28industry.29 funded biomedical research|research grant]] to support the cancer research of [[Judah Folkman]], which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit [[patent application]].&lt;ref name=NASbio&gt;Patricia K Donahoe.

====1980 to 1989: Becoming an agribiotech====
Monsanto scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983.&lt;ref name=pbn/&gt; Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of [[genetically modified crops]]. Increasing involvement in [[agricultural biotechnology]] dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as Monsanto's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involvement increased under the leadership of [[Robert B. Shapiro|Robert Shapiro]], appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1985, Monsanto acquired [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]], a [[life sciences]] company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for [[celecoxib|Celebrex]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/patexclnew.cfm?Appl_No=020998&amp;Product_No=003&amp;table1=OB_Rx Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations]. accessdata.fda.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5466823 |title=Patent US5466823 – Substituted pyrazolyl benzenesulfonamides – Google Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1998 became the first selective [[COX-2 inhibitor|COX‑2 inhibitor]] to be approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/98/20998.cfm |title=Drug Approval Package: Celebrex (Celecoxib) NDA# 20-998 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrex became a [[blockbuster drug]] and was often mentioned as a key reason for [[Pfizer]]'s acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Frank, Robert |author2=Hensley, Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Pfizer to Buy Pharmacia For $60 Billion in Stock|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1026684057282753560|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990 to 1999: Moving into the seed market &amp; industry consolidation====
In 1994, Monsanto introduced a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] version of [[bovine somatotropin]], brand-named Posilac.&lt;ref name = MG&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html | title = General information – Posilac| year = 2007 | publisher = Monsanto | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101123956/http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html| archivedate = January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto later sold this business to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].

In 1996, Monsanto purchased [[Agracetus]], the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which Monsanto had been licensing technology since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title = WR Grace Sells Agracetus to Monsanto for $150M|url = http://www.biotechprofiles.com/companyfiles/madisonnetwork/c81a944349224f0984a586f89719edb6.pdf|date = April 8, 1996|publisher = W. R. Grace|via = BiotechProfiles&lt;!--http://www.biotechprofiles.com/companyprofile/Monsanto.aspx--&gt;&lt;!--found in archive.org--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto first entered the [[maize]] seed business when it purchased 40% of [[DEKALB Genetics Corporation|Dekalb]] in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite press release |title = Justice Department Approves Monsanto's Acquisition of Dekalb Genetics Corporation|date = November 30, 1998|url = http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/2103.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040218013852/http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/1998/2103.htm|archivedate=February 18, 2004 |publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the company first published an annual report citing Monsanto's Law, a biotechnological take on [[Moore's law|Moore's Law]], indicating its future directions and exponential growth in the use of biotechnology. In 1998, Monsanto purchased [[Cargill]]'s international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2005, it finalized the purchase of [[Seminis Inc]], a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monsanto closes $1.4 billion buy of Seminis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/03/21/daily37.html|accessdate=2018-01-06|work=St. Louis Business Journal|date=23 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it the world's largest conventional seed company.

In 1999 Monsanto sold off NutraSweet Co.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In December of the same year, Monsanto agreed to merge with [[Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn]], in a deal valuing the transaction at $27 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deogun|first1=Nikhil|last2=Langreth|first2=Robert|last3=Burton|first3=Thomas M.|title=Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, Monsanto Boards Approve $27 Billion Merger of Equals|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB945650774971796642|accessdate=2018-01-06|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the "new" Pharmacia; Monsanto's medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barboza|first1=David|title=Monsanto and Pharmacia to Join, Creating a Pharmaceutical Giant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/20/business/monsanto-and-pharmacia-to-join-creating-a-pharmaceutical-giant.html |accessdate=2018-01-06|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000 to 2009: Birth of the "new" Monsanto====
In 2000: Pharmacia spun off its agro-biotech subsidiary into a new company,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the "new Monsanto",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Monsanto Raises $700 Million in IPO|date = October 18, 2000|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/18/business/fi-38228|work = [[Los Angel.

In 2005 Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. Monsanto's goal was to obtain "a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/monsanto_to_acquire_emergent_genetics__stoneville_and_nexgen_cotton_brands-25250.html |title=Monsanto to Acquire Emergent Genetics, Stoneville and NexGen Cotton Brands |publisher=Seed Today |date=February 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015161004/http://www.seedtoday.com/articles/monsanto_to_acquire_emergent_genetics__stoneville_and_nexgen_cotton_brands-25250.html |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Glyphosate herbicides====
{{see also|Glyphosate}}

Following its 1970 introduction, Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. Glyphosate has since been marketed by many [[agrochemical]] companies, in various solution strengths and with various [[Agricultural spray adjuvant|adjuvants]], under dozens of tradenames.&lt;ref&gt;Farm Chemicals International [http://www.farmchemicalsinternational.com/crop-protection-database/#//product/brief/203900 Glyphosate entry in Crop Protection Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fruits/gapeach/pdf/mirror.pdf |title=Mirror or Mirror on the Wall Show Me the Best Glyphosate Formulation of All |author=Mitchem W |publisher=North Carolina State University Extension |accessdate=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlISU Weed Science Online - Glyphosate - A Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeds.iastate.edu/mgmt/2001/glyphosate%20review.htm#Glyphosate%20Products |title=ISU Weed Science Online - Glyphosate - A Review |author=Hartzler B |format= |website= |publisher=Iowa State University Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weed Handbook Glyphosate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invasive.org/gist/products/handbook/14.Glyphosate.pdf |title=Glyphosate |vauthors=Tu M, Hurd C, Robison R, Randall JM |date=November 1, 2001 |format= |work=Weed Control Methods Handbook |publisher=The Nature Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14904184 |title=The debate over whether Monsanto is a corporate sinner or saint |date=November 19, 2009 |work=The Economist |accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's [[gross margin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/29/monsanto-potash-fertilizer-personal-finance-investing-ideas-agrium-mosaic.html |title= The Seeds Of A Monsanto Short Play | author= Cavallaro M |date=June 26, 2009 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crop seed====
{{see also|Hybrid seed|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}

As of 2015, Monsanto's line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.

==== Row crops ====
Many of Monsanto's agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to [[herbicide]]s, including glyphosate and [[dicamba]]. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds ''Roundup Ready''. Monsanto's introduction of this system (planting a glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together.&lt;ref name=HighPlainsJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=High Plains Journal |date=August 10, 2010 |author=Latzke, Jennifer M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.&lt;ref name=HighPlainsJ /&gt; Farmers widely adopted the technology—for example over 80% of maize ([[Mon 832]]), [[Roundup Ready soybean|soybean]] (MON-Ø4Ø32-6), cotton, [[sugar beet]] and [[canola]] planted in the United States are [[glyphosate]]-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready [[genetically modified wheat]] ([[MON 71800]]) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about the rejection of genetically modified (GM) wheat by foreign markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Person|first1=Daniel|title=Sale could change wheat industry: WestBred's owner Monsanto looks to develop 'genetically modified' varieties|url=http://missoulian.com/business/agriculture/sale-could-change-wheat-industry-westbred-s-owner-monsanto-looks/article_1db27912-ac3b-11de-8024-001cc4c002e0.html|website=Missoulian|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2011/09/when-monsantos-patents-expire.html When Monsanto's Patents Expire]&lt;/ref&gt; The second expiration meant that glyphosate resistant soybeans became "generic".&lt;ref name="HighPlainsJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/business/18seed.html "As Patent Ends, a Seed's Use Will Survive"], ''The New York Times''.

Monsanto invented and sells genetically modified seeds that make a crystalline insecticidal protein from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto's potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A0YyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4631,1776980&amp;dq=bacillus+thuringiensis+potato+1996+approved&amp;hl= Genetically Altered Potato Ok'd For Crops]
''Lawrence Journal-World'', May 6, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto subsequently developed [[Transgenic maize#Bt corn|Bt maize]] ([[MON 802]], [[MON 809]], [[MON 863]], [[MON 810]]), [[Genetically modified soybean|Bt soybean]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Crop Biotech Update |url=http://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=6565 |title=Monsanto's Bt Roundup Ready 2 Yield Soybeans Approved for Planting in Brazil – Crop Biotech Update (8/27/2010) &amp;#124; ISAAA.org/KC |publisher=Isaaa.org |date=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bt cotton]].

Monsanto produces seed that has multiple genetic modifications, also known as "stacked traits"—for instance, cotton that make one or more Bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate. One of these, created in collaboration with [[Dow Chemical Company]], is called [[SmartStax]]. In 2011 Monsanto launched the Genuity brand for its stacked-trait products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southeastfarmpress.com/agribusiness-monsanto-unveils-genuity-branding "Agribusiness: Monsanto unveils Genuity branding"]. ''SE Farm News'', March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the agricultural seed lineup included ''Roundup Ready'' alfalfa, canola and sugarbeet; Bt and/or ''Roundup Ready'' cotton; sorghum hybrids; soybeans with various oil profiles, most with the ''Roundup Ready'' trait; and a wide range of wheat products, many of which incorporate the nontransgenic "clearfield" imazamox-tolerant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agproducts.basf.us/products/clearfield-wheat.html |title=The CLEARFIELD Production System for Wheat|publisher=Agproducts.basf.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; trait from [[BASF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/monsanto-agricultural-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Agricultural Seeds |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids branded DroughtGard.&lt;ref&gt;OECD BioTrack Database. [http://www2.oecd.org/biotech/Product.aspx?id=MON-8746%C3%98-4 MON87460]&lt;/ref&gt; The MON 87460 trait is provided by the insertion of the cspB gene from the soil microbe ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''; it was approved by the USDA in 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/fedregister/BRS_20111227c.pdf Federal Register], Vol. 76, No. 248, December 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and by China in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eisenstein [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7468_supp/full/501S7a.html "Plant breeding: Discovery in a dry spell"] ''Nature'' 501, S7–S9 (26 September 2013) Published online September 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Xtend Crop System" includes seed genetically modified to be resistant to both glyphosate and [[dicamba]], and a herbicide product including those two active ingredients.&lt;ref name="XtendOfficial"&gt;[http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/roundup-ready-xtend-crop-system.aspx Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System] Accessed May 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the system was approved for use in the US.

===== India-specific issues =====
In 2009, Monsanto scientists discovered insects that had developed resistance to the [[Bt cotton|Bt Cotton]] planted in [[Gujarat]]. Monsanto communicated this to the Indian government and its customers, stating that "Resistance is natural and expected, so measures to delay resistance are important. Among the factors that may have contributed to [[pink bollworm]] resistance to the Cry1Ac protein in Bollgard I in Gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved Bt cotton seed, planted prior to GEAC approval of Bollgard I cotton, which may have had lower protein expression levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx|title=Monsanto ~ Cotton In India|date=November 3, 2008|publisher=Monsanto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of Bt cotton – Bolguard II – which had two resistance genes instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/06/stories/2010030664831400.htm|title=Bt cotton ineffective against pest in parts of Gujarat, admits Monsanto|date=March 6, 2010|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this advice was criticized: "an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it 'appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events [that is, the first-generation Bollgard I product] and promote double genes [the second generation Bollgard II] which would fetch higher price.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/12/stories/2010031263690900.htm|title=Monsanto 'admission' has business motives?|date=March 12, 2010|work=The Hindu|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto's GM cotton seed was the subject of NGO agitation because of its higher cost. Indian farmers crossed GM varieties with local varieties, using [[plant breeding]], violating their agreements with Monsanto.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab (June 17, 2003), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/science/nature/2998150.stm "India's GM seed Piracy"], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, high prices of Bt Cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of [[Jhabua]] district into debt when the crops died due to lack of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/25/stories/2009082554841400.htm|title=Jhabua on its way to becoming Vidarbha-II?|date=August 25, 2009|publisher=Hindu.com|place=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vegetables ====
In 2012 Monsanto was the world's largest supplier of non-GE vegetable seeds by value, with sales of $800M. 95% of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding. The company concentrates on improving flavor.&lt;ref name="wsj0612" /&gt; According to their website they sell "4,000 distinct seed varieties representing more than 20 species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/vegetable-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Monsanto Vegetable Seeds |publisher=Monsanto.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610041315/http://www.monsanto.com/products/Pages/vegetable-seeds.aspx |archivedate=June 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Broccoli, with the brand name ''Beneforté'', with increased amounts of [[glucoraphanin]] was introduced in 2010 following development by its [[Seminis]] subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/01/new-monsanto-vegetables/|title=Monsanto is going organic in a quest for the perfect veggie|journal=Wired|year=2015|author=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of rBST remains controversial with respect to its effects on cows and their milk.&lt;ref name=Dobs&gt;Dobson, William D. (June 1996) [http://www.aae.wisc.edu/pubs/sps/pdf/stpap397.pdf The BST Case]. University of Wisconsin-Madison Agricultural and Applied Economics Staff Paper Series No. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

In some markets, milk from cows that are not treated with rBST is sold with labels indicating that it is rBST-free: this milk has proved popular with consumers.&lt;ref name = "nytimes milk label"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09feed.html Fighting on a Battlefield the Size of a Milk Label], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to this, in early 2008 a pro-rBST advocacy group called "American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology" (AFACT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itisafact.org/ |title=AFACT: American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology |publisher=Itisafact.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of dairies and originally affiliated with Monsanto, formed and began lobbying to ban such labels. AFACT stated that "absence" labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior.&lt;ref name = "nytimes milk label" /&gt;

===Uncommericalized products===
Monsanto also developed notable technologies that were not ultimately commercialized.

===="Terminator" seeds====
{{Main article|Genetic use restriction technology}}

Genetic use restriction technology, colloquially known as "terminator technology", produces plants with sterile seeds. This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild. It also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest, requiring them to purchase seed for every planting, allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology. Farmers have been buying [[hybrid seed]]s for generations, instead of replanting their harvest, because second-generation hybrid seeds are inferior. Nevertheless, most seed companies contract only with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds.

Terminator technology has been developed by governmental labs, university researchers and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngin.tripod.com/353.htm |title=RAFI on new Terminator patent |publisher=Ngin.tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=gm-104#gm-104 |title=Context of 'July 20, 1999: USDA and Delta &amp; Pine Land Secure New Patent for Improvements in Terminator Genetic Seed Sterilization Technology' |publisher=Historycommons.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warwick Terminator"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Hugh |last=Warwick |editor-last=Wijeratna |editor-first=Alex |editor2-last=Meienberg |editor2-first=François |editor3-last= Meienberg |title = Syngenta – Switching off farmers' rights? |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date=October 2000 |url = http://www.fao.org/righttofood/KC/downloads/vl/docs/AH428.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512172032/http://www.fao.org/righttofood/KC/downloads/vl/docs/AH428.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology has not been used commercially.&lt;ref name="monsanto pledge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/terminator-seeds.aspx |title=Monsanto ~ Is Monsanto Going to Develop or Sell "Terminator" Seeds? |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banterminator.org/The-Issues/Introduction |title=Introduction / The Issues / |publisher=Ban Terminator |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors that Monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology caused protests, for example in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/465969.stm |work=BBC News |title=Farmers welcome halt of 'terminator' |date=October 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/doc/RHerring.pdf |title=CAS 38-4 24 Oct 2006.vp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531024738/http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/doc/RHerring.pdf |archivedate=May 31, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies and litigation ==
{{Main article|Monsanto legal cases}}Monsanto is internationally notable for its involvement in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It defended lawsuits mostly over its products' health and environmental effects. Monsanto used the courts to enforce its patents, particularly in agricultural [[biotechnology]], an approach similar to that of other companies in the field, such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Dupont Pioneer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/93431968/Pioneer-Hi-Bred-International-v-Does-1-5|title=Pioneer Hi Bred International v.

===Argentina===
Argentina approved ''Roundup Ready'' soy in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 soy production grew from 14 million acres to 42 million acres. The growth was driven by Argentine investors' interest in export markets.&lt;ref name="SoyRepublic"&gt;[http://www.towardfreedom.com/32-archives/environment/1600-the-soy-republic-of-argentina The Soy Republic of Argentina]. Towardfreedom.com (September 2, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation led to a decrease in production of many staples such as [[milk]], [[rice]], [[maize]], [[potato]]es and [[lentils]]. As of 2004 about 150,000 small farmers had left the countryside; including 50% as of 2009 in the Chaco region.&lt;ref name="SoyRepublic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianArgentina"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/apr/16/gm.food GM soya 'miracle' turns sour in Argentina].

[[Norte Grande Geography Journal]] Revista de geografía Norte Grande 45: 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a Monsanto representative had said, "any problems with GM soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture, not because it was GM. If you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems."&lt;ref name="GuardianArgentina" /&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, Monsanto attempted to enforce its patents on soymeal imported into Spain from Argentina by having Spanish customs officials seize the soymeal shipments. This has been an attempt made by Monsanto to put pressure on the Argentinian government for allowing them to enforce their seed patents in Argentina as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cropchoice.com/leadstrygmo013106.html Seeds of conflict take root in debate over Michigan farming bill]. Cropchoice.com, January 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 environmentalist groups objected to a Monsanto corn seed conditioning facility in [[Malvinas Argentinas, Córdoba]]. Neighbours objected to the risk of environmental impact. Court rulings supported the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/monsanto-podra-continuar-con-obra-civil-pero-no-con-operativa|title=Monsanto podrá continuar con obra civil pero no con operativa|date=April 23, 2013|publisher=La Voz|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but environmentalist groups organised demonstrations and opened an online petition for the subject to be decided in a popular [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argenpress.info/2013/12/monsanto-contamina-el-medio-ambiente-y.html|title=Monsanto contamina el medio ambiente y también la democracia|author=Marín|first=Emiliom|date=December 2, 2013|website=|publisher=Argenpress.info|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rulings stipulated that while construction could continue, the facility could not begin operating until the [[environmental impact report]] required by law had been duly presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/ratifican-que-monsanto-podra-continuar-con-la-obra-civil|title=Ratifican que Monsanto podrá continuar con la obra civil|date=October 10, 2013|publisher=La Voz|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Monsanto reached an agreement with Argentina's government on soybean seed royalty payments. Monsanto agreed to give the Argentine Seed Institute (Inase) oversight over crops grown from Monsanto's Intacta genetically modified soybean seeds. Before the agreement, Argentine farmers generally avoided royalties by using seeds from previous harvests or purchased from non-registered suppliers. Inase agreed to delegate testing to grain exchanges. About 6 million sample tests were to be conducted annually.

==== PCBs ====
In the late 1960s, the Monsanto plant in [[Sauget, Illinois]], was the nation's largest producer of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which remained in the water along Dead Creek there. An EPA official referred to Sauget as "one of the most polluted communities in the region" and "a soup of different chemicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06276/727066-28.stm |title=Tiny Sauget, Illinois, likes business misfits |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=October 3, 2006 |first=William |last=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a Monsanto-developed strain of [[glyphosate]]-resistant [[genetically modified wheat|wheat]] (a GMO) was discovered on a farm in Oregon, growing as a weed or [[volunteer (botany)|"volunteer plant"]]. The final Oregon field test had occurred in 2001. As of May 2013, the GMO seed source was unknown. Volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and was not found to be glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto faced penalties up to $1 million over potential violations of the [[Plant Protection Act]].

Monsanto has faced controversy in the United States over claims that its herbicide products might be carcinogens.

===Improper accounting for incentive rebates ===
From 2009 to 2011, Monsanto improperly accounted for incentive rebates. The actions inflated Monsanto's reported profit by $31 million over the two years. Monsanto paid $80 million in penalties pursuant to a subsequent settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|US Securities and Exchange Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/business/for-monsanto-whistle-blower-a-22-million-award-that-fell-short.html|title=Monsanto Whistle-Blower: $22 Million Richer, but Not Satisfied|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|date=2016-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings in response to losing market share of Roundup to generic producers.

===Alleged ghostwriting controversy===

A review of glyphosate's carcinogenic potential by four independent expert panels, with a comparison to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] assessment, was published in September 2016. Using emails released in August 2017 by plaintiffs' lawyers who are suing Monsanto, ''[[Bloomberg Business Week]]'' reported that "Monsanto scientists were heavily involved in organizing, reviewing, and editing drafts submitted by the outside experts." A Monsanto spokesperson responded that Monsanto had provided only non-substantive cosmetic copyediting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsanto Was Its Own Ghostwriter for Some Safety Reviews|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/monsanto-was-its-own-ghostwriter-for-some-safety-reviews|website=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US diplomats in Europe at other times worked directly for Monsanto.&lt;ref name="07Paris4723" /&gt;

Monsanto made political contributions of $186,250 to federal candidates in the 2008 election cycle through its [[political action committee]] (PAC) (42% to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], 58% to [[Republican Party (USA)|Republicans]]) and  $305,749 in the 2010 election cycle (48% Democrat, 52% Republicans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strID=C00042069 2008 PAC Summary Data], ''Open Secrets.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]]'s 2012 [[Proposition 37#Proposition 37|Proposition 37]] would have mandated the [[GMO food labelling|disclosure]] of [[genetically modified crops]] used in the production of California food products.

'In response to recent urgent requests by [Spanish rural affairs ministry] state secretary Josep Puxeu and Monsanto, post requests renewed US government support of Spain's science-based agricultural biotechnology position through high-level US government intervention.'"&lt;ref name="07Paris4723" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. targeted EU on GM foods: WikiLeaks |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/03/08/genetically-modified-food.html |date=March 9, 2011 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked documents showed that in 2009, when the Spanish government's policy approving [[MON810]] was under pressure from EU interests, Monsanto's Director for Biotechnology for Spain and Portugal requested that the US government support Spain on the matter.&lt;ref name="07Paris4723"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/03/wikileaks-us-eu-gm-crops |title=WikiLeaks: US targets EU over GM crops |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Vidal, John |date=January 3, 2011 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="09MADRID482"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09MADRID482.html |title=Spain's biotech crop under threat (Wikileaks telegram 09MADRID482) |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=May 19, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080152/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09MADRID482.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=EUobserver |title=Spain a key ally of pro-GMO America, cables reveal |url=http://euobserver.com/news/31544 |date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaks indicated that Spain and the US had worked closely together to "persuade the EU not to strengthen biotechnology laws".&lt;ref name="07Paris4723" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Spain was viewed as a key GMO supporter and a leading indicator of support across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Presses Europe to Worship Genetically Modified Foods |author=Estabrook, Barry |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/01/us-presses-europe-to-worship-genetically-modified-foods/69633/|date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Pais"&gt;{{cite web |title=EE UU: "España nos pide que presionemos a Bruselas a favor de los transgénicos" |work=El Pais |url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=es&amp;to=en&amp;a=http://elpais.com/diario/2010/12/19/espana/1292713201_850215.html |date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaks also revealed that in response to an attempt by France to ban MON810 in late 2007, then-US ambassador to France, [[Craig Roberts Stapleton]], asked Washington to "calibrate a targeted retaliation list that [would cause] some pain across the EU", targeting countries that did not support the use of GM crops.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/03/wikileaks-us-eu-gm-crops |title=WikiLeaks: US targets EU over GM crops |work=The Guardian |author=Vidal, John |date=January 3, 2011 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity transpired after the US, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico and New Zealand had brought an action against Europe via the World Trade Organization with respect to the EU's banning of GMOs; in 2006, the [[WTO]] had ruled against the EU.&lt;ref name="El Pais" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/trade/eu-gmo-ban-illegal-wto-rules/article-155197 Euractive.com EU GMO ban was illegal, WTO rules], euractiv.com (updated May 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds291sum_e.pdf EC – Approval and Marketing of Biotech Products (Disputes DS291, 292, 293)], World Trade Organisation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto was a member of [[EuropaBio]], the leading biotechnology trade group in Europe. One of EuropaBio's initiatives is "Transforming Europe's position on GM food". It found "an urgent need to reshape the terms of the debate about GM in Europe".&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2011/oct/20/transforming-europe-gm-food Transforming Europe's position on GM food – ambassadors programme executive summary] ''The Guardian'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; EuropaBio proposed the recruitment of high-profile "ambassadors" to lobby EU officials.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/europabio-gm-ambassadors-europe?intcmp=239 Biotech group bids to recruit high-profile GM 'ambassadors'] John Vidal and Hanna Gersmann, ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2011/oct/20/gm-food Draft letter from EuropaBio to potential GM ambassadors] (Draft letter from EuropaBio to potential GM ambassadors seeking their involvement in the outreach programme), ''The Guardian'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 Monsanto lobbyists were banned from the European parliament after the Monsanto refused to attend a parliamentary hearing into allegations of regulatory interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/28/monsanto-banned-from-european-parliament|title=Monsanto banned from European parliament|first=Arthur|last=Neslen|date=September 28, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti ===
After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Monsanto donated $255,000 for disaster relief&lt;ref name=SeedDaily&gt;[http://www.seeddaily.com/reports/Haitian_farmers_protest_Monsanto_seed_donations_999.html Haitian farmers protest Monsanto seed donations], Hinche, Haiti (AFP) June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and 60,000 seed sacks (475 tons) of hybrid (non-GM) corn and vegetable seeds worth $4 million.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Jonathan M. |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FMUQN80.htm |title=Monsanto gives Haiti $4 million in hybrid seeds |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Catholic Relief Services]] (CRS) rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the five most common food security crops found that the Haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds be introduced only on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308151257/http://oneresponse.info/Disasters/Haiti/Agriculture/publicdocuments/CRS.%20Rapid%20Seed%20Assessment.%20Mars-10.pdf "A Rapid Seed Assessment in the Southern Department of Haiti."] Catholic Relief Services, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuel Prophete, head of Haiti's Ministry of Agriculture's Service National Semencier (SNS), stated that SNS was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because they at least double yields. Louise Sperling, Principal Researcher at the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) told HGW that she was not opposed to hybrids, but noted that most hybrids required extra water and better soils and that most of Haiti was not appropriate for hybrids.

Activists objected that some of the seeds were coated with the [[fungicide]]s Maxim or [[thiram]]. In the United States, [[pesticide]]s containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not have adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1009J9G.PDF US EPA: Pesticides – RED Facts Thiram]. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; Activists wrote that the coated seeds were handled in a dangerous manner by the recipients.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/monsanto-haiti/1304605989 |title=Monsanto in Haiti |publisher=Truth-out.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The donated seeds were sold at a reduced price in local markets.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek /&gt; However, farmers feared that they were being given seeds that would "threaten local varieties"&lt;ref name=SeedDaily /&gt; and an estimated 8,000–12,000 farmers attended a protest of the donation on June 4, 2010, organized by a Haitian farmers' association, the Peasant Movement of Papay, where a small pile of seeds was symbolically burned.&lt;ref name=Epoch&gt;{{cite news |title=Haiti GM food aid is a 'trojan horse' |author=Skorbach, Kristina |url=http://epoch-archive.com/a1/en/ie/nnn/2010/06-June/24/ET220610005.pdf |newspaper=The Epoch Times |date=June 24 – July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public relations ==
Monsanto has engaged in various public relations campaigns to improve its image and public perception of some of its products.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Hopkinson, "[https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/monsanto-agriculture-image-problem-100442 Monsanto's makeover]", ''Politico'', 29 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Vidal, "[https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/oct/07/gm.food We forgot to listen, says Monsanto]", ''The Guardian'', 6 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These include developing a relationship with scientist [[Richard Doll]] with respect to [[Agent Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Boseley, "[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/dec/08/smoking.frontpagenews Renowned cancer scientist was paid by chemical firm for 20 years]"; ''The Guardian'', 8 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6220440.stm Industry ‘paid top cancer expert']", ''BBC'', 8 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tweedale|first=Geoffrey|date=2007-04-01|title=Hero or Villain?—Sir Richard Doll and Occupational Cancer|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=13|issue=2|pages=233–235|doi=10.1179/oeh.2007.13.2.233|issn=1077-3525|pmid=17718181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other campaigns include the joint funding with other biotech companies for the website [[GMO Answers]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lipton, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/us/food-industry-enlisted-academics-in-gmo-lobbying-war-emails-show.html Food Industry Enlisted Academics in G.M.O.

'''Order processing''' is the process or work-flow associated with the picking, packing and delivery of the packed items to a shipping carrier. Order processing is a key element of [[order fulfillment]].  Order processing operations or facilities are commonly called "[[distribution center]]s".

==Process==
[[File:Forklift AGV with Straddle, courtesy of Egemin Automation Inc..jpg|thumb|right|Automated picking]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-22350-0001, Berlin, Postamt O 17, Päckchenverteilung.jpg|thumb|right|Sorting packages according to destination]]

Order processing is a sequential process involving:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;D.F. Bozutti, M.A. Bueno-Da-Costa, R. Ruggeri, Logística: Visão Global e Picking, EdUFSCar 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[#Picking|Picking]]: consists in taking and collecting articles in a specified quantity before shipment to satisfy customers' orders. 
*[[#Sorting|Sorting]]: process that separates items according to destination. 
*Pre-consolidation or package formation  : includes weighting, [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] and [[Packaging and labeling|packing]].
*Consolidation: gathering packages into [[unit load|loading units]] for transportation, control and [[bill of lading]].

==Picking==
[[Image:Sistema de preparación de pedidos pick to light.jpg|thumb|Person to goods picking assisted by conveyor belt]]

The '''order picking''' or order preparation operation is one of a logistic warehouse's processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventoryops.com/order_picking.htm|title= Order Picking:  Methods and Equipment for Piece Pick, Case Pick, and Pallet Pick Operations|last=Piasecki|first=Dave|publisher=InventoryOps.com|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists in taking and collecting articles in a specified quantity before shipment to satisfy customers' orders.
It is a basic warehousing process and has an important influence on [[supply chain]]'s productivity. This makes order picking one of the most controlled logistic processes.

It is one of the [[warehouse management system]] functions.

===Types===
Types of order picking include:
* '''[[#Piece Picking|piece picking]] or picker to part method''': the order picker(s) move(s) to collect the products necessary for one order. This is commonly seen in distribution centres for retail chains whereby a shop will require a great many replenishment goods. A picker may pick all or part of the replenishment for one shop.
* '''zone picking method''': each order picker is assigned to one specific zone and will only realize order picking within this zone. For instance, in an electrical retail environment, both small and large items may be required and a picker on an electric vehicle such as a powered pallet truck (PPT) or an order picker vehicle may pick large and heavy items whereas a foot picker may pick small and light ones from another part of the warehouse. Eventually the two picks are collated.
* '''wave picking method''': ([[Wave picking]]) the order picker(s) move(s) to collect the products necessary for several orders
* '''sorting systems method''': no movement of the order picker(s), the products are brought to him by an automatic system ([[conveyor system]], automatic storage ...).
* '''pick to box method''':{{huh|date=November 2016}} The WMS direct the operator to pick the sku from a storage bin or a transportation box and to put it inside the shipping box or into a box assigned to the sales order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wms.com.es/picking-carritos-de-recogida.html|title=Pick to box procedures|last=|first=|date=|website=wms.com.es|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technologies===
There are various ways in which a pick may be communicated to a picker:
* a simple paper pick list,
* an [[RFID]] terminal
* a list of labels that list an item's location -one per item being picked
* [[Voice Directed Warehousing|voice picking equipment]]
* pick to light equipment
* [[Automated storage and retrieval system|automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS)]]. There are many types, but the basics are mini-load, mid-load and unit load. Each system is used to deliver totes, cases, cartons, pallets or inventory with unique physical profiles. Mini-Loads usually range up to 1000&amp;nbsp;lbs per load; Mid-Load up to 2000&amp;nbsp;lbs per load; Unit Load for pallets up to 5000&amp;nbsp;lbs per load.
* An automated dispenser, in which products are pilled up and separated from each other, and then automatically released on a conveyor belt when required (obviously not applicable to all types of merchandise)
* [[Augmented reality]]

Some of these technologies can also be used to make sure the picker picked from the proper location using [[barcode]] or [[RFID]] terminal or voice picking.

===Piece Picking===
Piece picking, also known as broken case picking or pick/pack operations, describes systems where individual items are picked. Operations using piece picking typically have a large [[stock keeping unit]], or SKU, base in the thousands or tens of thousands of items, small quantities per pick, and short cycle times. Examples of piece pick operations include mail order catalog companies and repair parts distributors. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventoryops.com/order_picking.htm | last=Piasecki | first=Dave | title=Order Picking: Methods and Equipment for Piece Pick, Case Pick, and Pallet Pick Operations | publisher= Inventory Ops Consultation | year=2012 | accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Picking===
Operations that use case picking tend to have less diversity in product characteristics than operations that use piece picking. There are typically fewer SKUs and higher picks per SKU. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Pallet Picking===
Full-pallet picking, or unit-load picking, uses much simpler systematic methods than piece picking or case picking. However, there are many choices in storage equipment, storage configurations and types of lift trucks. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sorting ==
'''Sorting machines in distribution'''
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}

==Pick and pack==
'''Pick and pack''' is a part of a complete [[supply chain management]] process that is commonly used in the retail distribution of goods. It entails processing small to large quantities of product, often truck or train loads and disassembling them, picking the relevant product for each destination and re-[[packaging]] with shipping [[label]] affixed and invoice included. Usual service includes obtaining a fair rate of shipping from common as well as expediting truck carriers.
Pick and Pack services are offered by many businesses that specialize in supply chain management solutions.
'''Case picking''' is the gathering of full cartons or boxes of product. This is often done on a [[pallet]]. In the consumer products industry, case picking large quantities of cartons is often an entry level employee's task. There is, however, significant skill required to make a good pallet load of product. Key requirements are that cartons not be damaged, they make good use of the available cube (space) and be quick to assemble.

[[Warehouse management system]] products create pick paths to minimize the travel distance of an order selector, but often neglect the need to maximize the use of cube, segregate products that should not touch or minimize damage.

==Factors==
The specific "order fulfillment process" or the operational procedures of distribution centers are determined by many factors.  Each distribution center has its own unique requirements or priorities.  There is no "one size fits all" process that universally provides the most efficient operation.  Some of the factors that determine the specific process flow of a distribution center are:
* The nature of the shipped product - shipping eggs and shipping shirts can require differing fulfillment processes
* The nature of the orders - the number of differing items and quantities of each item in orders
* The nature of the shipping packaging - cases, totes, envelopes, pallets can create process variations
* Shipping costs - consolidation of orders, shipping pre-sort can change processing operations
* Availability and cost and [[productivity]] of workforce - can create trade-off decisions in automation and manual processing operations
* [[Timeliness]] of shipment windows - when shipments need to be completed based on carriers can create processing variations
* Availability of capital expenditure dollars - influence on manual verses automated process decisions and longer term benefits
* Value of product shipped - the ratio of the value of the shipped product and the order fulfillment cost
* [[Seasonality]] variations in outbound volume - amount and duration of seasonal peaks and valleys of outbound volume
* Predictability of future volume, product and order profiles
* Predictability of distribution network - whether or not the network itself is going to change
* Presence of small volume distribution
* Minimization of shipping costs

This list is only a small sample of factors that can influence the choice of a distribution centers operational procedures.  Because each factor has varying importance in each organization the net effect is that each organization has unique processing requirements.

The effect of [[Globalization]] has immense impacts on much of the order fulfillment but its impact is felt mostly in transportation and distribution.

The '''QLine''' (stylized as '''QLINE'''), originally known as '''M-1 Rail''' by its developers and the '''Woodward Avenue Streetcar''' by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT), is a [[streetcar]] system in [[Detroit]] in the U.S. state of Michigan. Opened on May 12, 2017, it runs along [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue).&lt;ref name="freepress-2017may12"&gt;{{cite news |first1 = Eric D. |last1 = Lawrence |first2 = Robert |last2 = Allen |date = May 12, 2017 |url = http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/05/12/all-aboard-detroits-qline-open-streetcar-riders/319211001/ |title = All Aboard!

In December 2011, city and state leaders announced a plan to offer [[bus rapid transit]] service for the city and metropolitan area instead of light rail as had previously been proposed. Soon afterwards, M-1 Rail, a consortium of private and public businesses and institutions in the region, announced the plan for a {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} streetcar line along part of the same route as the cancelled light rail plan, connecting the downtown [[Detroit People Mover]] to the [[Detroit (Amtrak station)|Amtrak railway station]] in [[New Center]] and the proposed [[Ann Arbor–Detroit Regional Rail]] system. [[Quicken Loans]] bought the naming rights to the line, and announced the name in March 2016.&lt;ref name="lawrence-2016-03-24"&gt;{{cite news |first = Eric D. |last = Lawrence |url = http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/03/24/m-1-rail-name-announcement/82205026/ |title = Detroit's M-1 Rail Line Now to Be Called the QLINE |date = March 24, 2016 |work = [[Detroit Free Press]] |access-date = March 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Woodward_Ave_Detroit_1942.jpg|thumb|Woodward Avenue with streetcar lines, 1942]]}}
[[File:M-1 RAIL logo.png|thumb|Original M-1 Rail logo]]
Detroit's first [[streetcar]] service began in 1863 with [[horsecar]]s. Electrification of the streetcar system followed, starting in 1886. Detroit's streetcar lines eventually saw their operations consolidated under the privately owned [[Detroit United Railway]]. Municipal takeover and control of the streetcar network by Detroit's [[Department of Street Railways]] followed in 1922.&lt;ref name="schramm"&gt;{{cite book |first = Kenneth |last = Schramm |year = 2006 |title = Detroit's Street Railways |series = Images of Rail |publisher = Arcadia Publishing |location = Charleston, SC |pages = 7–8, 11–13 |isbn = 0-7385-4027-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detroit Mayor [[Hazen S. Pingree]] had led the charge years before to have the city take over operations. Since that gave the companies reason to believe the rail lines would be taken over, they were discouraged from maintaining the lines, which meant that Detroiters had "inherited a giant money pit" when the city eventually voted to buy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Austin |first1 = Dan |title = How Metro Detroit Transit went from Best to Worst |url = http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/02/06/michigan-detroit-public-transit/22926133/ |website = Detroit Free Press |accessdate = May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That and the Department of Street Railways' introduction of buses from 1925 ultimately led to the demise of the original streetcar system in 1956.&lt;ref name=schramm /&gt;&lt;ref name="hour"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Mark |last = Kurlyandchik |date = May 2012 |url = http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/May-2012/Back-on-Track/ |title = After 50+ Years, Streetcars Could Come Back to Woodward |journal = [[Hour Detroit]] |issn = 1098-9684 |access-date = August 20, 2012 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6A4iqClLg?url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/May-2012/Back-on-Track/ |archive-date = August 21, 2012 |dead-url = no |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning for the return of rapid transit to Detroit began in 2006 when the [[Detroit Department of Transportation]] (DDOT) commissioned a study to determine expanded mass transit options along [[Woodward Avenue]].&lt;ref name="WLR"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.woodwardlightrail.com/ProjectOverview.html |publisher = Woodward Light Rail |title = Project Overview |access-date = October 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, a private group of local business leaders decided to provide matching funds to government dollars to develop a $125&amp;nbsp;million, {{convert|3.4|mi|km|adj=on}} line through central Detroit (similar to the [[Tacoma Link]]) called the M-1 Rail Line. After much wrangling between the private investors and the DDOT, the two groups decided to work in tandem on developing DDOT's {{convert|9.3|mi|km|adj=on}} line.

The proposed line ran {{convert|9.3|mi|km}} along Woodward Avenue from the Rosa Parks Transit Center to the old State Fairgrounds along [[8&amp;nbsp;Mile Road]].&lt;ref name=TRU/&gt; The line would have had 19&amp;nbsp;stops with 10&amp;nbsp;cars running at a time in two-car trains; each train would carry 150&amp;nbsp;people. The trains would run in a dedicated right-of-way in the median from 8&amp;nbsp;Mile to Adams Street at the north end of downtown. South of Adams, the trains would run in traffic along the sides of the street.

The estimated cost for the proposed line was $500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="TRU"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.detroittransit.org/cms.php?pageid=80 |title = Woodward Light Rail Project Cancelled, M-1 Streetcar Still in the Works |publisher = Detroit Transportation Riders United |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120720152848/http://www.detroittransit.org/cms.php?pageid=80 |archive-date = July 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kresge Foundation awarded a $35&amp;nbsp;million grant to the city for the project in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.michiganfoundations.org/s_cmf/doc.asp?CID=6017&amp;DID=24282 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615211512/http://www.michiganfoundations.org/s_cmf/doc.asp?CID=6017&amp;DID=24282 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = June 15, 2011 |title = Kresge Foundation Awards Nearly $73 Million in Grants in the First Quarter of 2009 |date = March 9, 2009 |publisher = Council of Michigan Foundations }}&lt;/ref&gt; It received $25&amp;nbsp;million in funding from the [[United States Department of Transportation]] in February 2010.&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2013-08-02a/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2013-08-02b/&gt; The Detroit City Council approved the sale of $125&amp;nbsp;million in bonds on April 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = City Council Approves Detroit Light Rail Project |date = April 12, 2011 |url = http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2011/04/12/city-council-approves-detroit-light-rail-project/ |location = Southfield, MI |publisher = [[WWJ-TV]] |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the City of Detroit signed an environmental impact study on July 1, 2011.&lt;ref name=WLR/&gt; Finally, on August 31, 2011, the FTA signed a record of decision allowing the project to move forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Detroit's Woodward Ave. Light Rail Project Moves Forward, but Still Has Long Road to Completion |url = http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2011/09/detroits_woodward_ave_light_ra.html |work = [[MLive.com]] |location = Detroit |publisher = [[Booth Newspapers]] |access-date = December 15, 2011 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/63x9RbxHJ?url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2011/09/detroits_woodward_ave_light_ra.html |archive-date = December 15, 2011 |dead-url = no |date = September 6, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
On January 18, 2013, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that M-1 Rail would receive $25 million in federal grant support for the streetcar project.&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2013-08-02a/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2013-08-02b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Helms |first = Matt |title = Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood Brings $25 Million in Federal Aid for M-1 Rail Project |url = http://www.freep.com/article/20130118/NEWS01/130118021/Ray-LaHood-brings-25M-in-federal-aid-for-M-1-rail-project |access-date = January 28, 2013 |newspaper = Detroit Free Press |date = January 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously committed to the funds on the condition that a regional transit authority was created for the Detroit area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Cwiek |date = October 15, 2012 |title = LaHood: Metro Detroit, State Need to Move on Regional transit Authority |url = http://michiganradio.org/post/lahood-metro-detroit-state-need-move-regional-transit-authority#stream/0 |publisher = Michigan Radio |access-date = January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, the [[Regional Transit Authority of Southeast Michigan]] was created by state law,&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;{{cite web |title = Senate Bill No. 909 |url = http://www.semcog.org/uploadedFiles/Programs_and_Projects/Transportation/RTA%20Enrolled%20Senate%20Bill%20909.pdf |publisher = Michigan State Legislature |access-date = September 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled LaHood's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date = January 18, 2013 |title = M1 Rail: Ray LaHood, U.S. Transit Secretary, Announces $25 Million in Funding for Detroit Transit Plan |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/m1-rail-ray-lahood-detroit-25-million-woodward_n_2502335.html |work = The Huffington Post |access-date = January 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2013, the project received final environmental clearance from the federal government, with construction expected to start in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Matt |last = Helms |date = April 22, 2013 |title = M-1 Rail Project Gets Final OK from Federal Government |url = http://www.freep.com/article/20130422/NEWS/304220141/M1-Rail-streetcar-Detroit-Woodward |work = Detroit Free Press |access-date = October 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2013, M-1 Rail began underground utility relocation work along Woodward Avenue, the first step toward full-fledged construction activities of the {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} streetcar line, with construction scheduled to start in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://m-1rail.com/m-1-rail-begins-underground-utility-relocation-work-shutdown-woodward-avenue-required-utility-relocations-will-prevent-customer-access-businesses-woodward/ |title = M-1 Rail Begins Underground Utility Relocation Work, Shutdown of Woodward Avenue Is Not Required: Utility Relocations Will Not Prevent Customer Access to Businesses on Woodward |access-date = January 3, 2014 |publisher = M-1 Rail |date = December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stacy &amp; Witbeck]] were formally awarded the contract to construct the M-1 Rail streetcar line on July 31, 2013.&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2013-08-02a/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2013-08-02b/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailwayAge2013/&gt; M-1 Rail officials announced on July 3, 2014, that the Woodward Avenue overpasses for both I-75 and I-94 freeways will be demolished during construction of the rail line, and that new wider bridges will be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Marlon A. |last = Walker |date = July 3, 2014 |work = Detroit Free Press |url = http://m-1rail.com/m-1-rail-construction-close-freeways-woodward-overpasses-rebuilt/ |title = M-1 Rail Construction to Close Freeways as Woodward Overpasses Are Rebuilt |access-date = July 11, 2014 |via = M-1 Rail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2014, the Ilitch family, owner of Olympia Development of Michigan, and major investor in M-1 Rail, announced that the streetcar line would include a stop at the new Little Caesars Arena in Midtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Bill |last = Shea |date = July 20, 2014 |url = http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20140720/NEWS03/140719845/%20m-rink-city-ilitches-grand-plan-to-supersize-the |title = Detroit Rink City: Ilitches' Grand Plan to Supersize the Entertainment District |work = [[Crain's Detroit Business]] |access-date = July 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M-1 Rail officially started construction on July 28, 2014.&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2014-07-28/&gt; The streetcar line would stretch from downtown Detroit to Grand Boulevard in New Center. There would be 20 different stations serving 12 stops, with most of the stations being curbside on either side of Woodward Avenue going uptown or downtown, but changing to center road stations at the north and south ends of the system. At the time, the streetcar line was expected to be operational in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date = July 28, 2014 |title = Construction Starts on Detroit Rail |work = [[The Mining Journal]] |location = Marquette, MI |agency = [[Associated Press]] |page = 5A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the planning of the service, Detroit businessman [[Dan Gilbert]] advocated strongly for a curb-running design. One participant said, "They were not looking for speed or reliability... their number one goal was the boost in property values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2018/03/30/private-interests-steered-qline-plans-study-finds|title=Dan Gilbert, private interests steered QLine plans, study finds|first=Lee|last=DeVito|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2014, the US DOT announced that M-1 Rail would receive an additional $12.2 million in federal grant money to complete the financing of the M-1 Rail project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1 = Todd |last1 = Spangler |first2 = John |last2 = Gallagher |lastauthoramp = yes |date = September 9, 2014 |url = http://www.freep.com/article/20140909/BUSINESS06/309090135/M-1-Rail-track-Detroit |title = Feds Give M-1 Rail $12.2&amp;nbsp;Million |work = Detroit Free Press |access-date = September 11, 2014 |archive-date = September 11, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140911113846/http://www.freep.com/article/20140909/BUSINESS06/309090135/M-1-Rail-track-Detroit |dead-url = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US Transportation Secretary]] [[Anthony Foxx]] gave the keynote address at a rail signing ceremony on September 15, 2014 at [[Grand Circus Park]].&lt;ref name=TheRepublic2014-09-15/&gt;&lt;ref name=RailwayGazette2014-09-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=ProgressiveRailroading2014-09-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=MichiganChronicle2014-09-16/&gt;
Local officials were in attendance as were executives of local businesses who were sponsoring stations near their places of business.
A new official map was made public.&lt;ref name=DetroitFreePress2014-09-16/&gt;

Approximately 60 percent of the line is not equipped with overhead electrical wires, and the streetcars are powered solely from [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] on that section.&lt;ref name="detroit-news-2015jun"/&gt;

On February 15, 2015, M-1 Rail reported that the Penske Tech Center was under construction in New Center. The $6.9 million, {{convert|19,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure serves as the M-1 Rail headquarters, the operations center, and the streetcar maintenance facility. The tech center building is sited close to Woodward Avenue, and located between Bethune and Custer streets north and east of Grand Boulevard with the streetcar storage yard behind. The exterior is made of reddish brick to mimic the historical look and feel of the surrounding neighborhood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = John |last = Gallagher |date = February 15, 2015 |url = http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2015/02/15/rail-penske-streetcar/23362265/ |title = M-1 Rail's Tech Center Under Construction |work = Detroit Free Press |access-date = February 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completed in May 2016.

In August 2015, M-1 Rail officials said that the opening of the line would be delayed until around mid 2017, partially because of new federal safety standards that are coming into effect, as well as a construction slowdown during the previous winter and delays in building the rolling stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2015/08/06-detroit-m1 |title = Detroit Streetcar Project M-1 Delayed through 2017 |work = [[Trains (magazine)|Trains]] |date = August 6, 2015 |access-date = August 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; QLine was announced as the official name for the line in March 2016, after [[Quicken Loans]] bought [[naming rights]], but the non-profit organization that is overseeing the project continues to be named M-1 Rail.&lt;ref name="official name"&gt;{{cite web |title = QLINE announced as official name of Detroit’s modern streetcar |publisher = M-1 Rail |date = March 24, 2016 |url = http://m-1rail.com/qline-is-name-of-detroit-streetcar/ |access-date = December 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
===Route===
The QLine traverses Woodward Avenue in its entirely from downtown thru Midtown to New Center. The line begins at the southern terminus at Congress Street in the median before tracks swing to the curbside for most of its length. (Some parts of the line have tracks running down the middle travel lane of Woodward in downtown.) After traveling in the curbside travel lane, the line swings back into the inside travel lane (median) at Amsterdam all the way to the line's northern terminus at Grand Boulevard. Non-revenue tracks continue two blocks to the M-1 Rail Penske Tech Center, which serves as headquarters for the QLine and the garage for the streetcars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">'''Railway costing''' is the calculation of the variable and fixed costs of rail movements. Variable costs are those that increase or decrease with changes in the traffic volumes or service levels and include fuel, maintenance and train crew costs, for example. Fixed costs are normally associated with items such as head office, interest charges and other overhead.  Unit costs can then be calculated based on the expenses of the railway divided into standard categories.

==Types of cost==
In order to assist in its deliberations regarding rate and service complaints, the [[Canadian Transportation Agency]] has identified various types of costs. These costs include: 

*the maintenance and operation of way and structures, such as track and roadway, signals, communication, and fuel stations[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*the maintenance and operation of equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, intermodal equipment, and work equipment[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*railway operations, such as train and yard operations, train control, and intermodal[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*general costs, such as general administration, employee benefits, taxes, insurance, purchasing and material stores[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*cost of capital[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]
*depreciation[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925022533/http://www.cta-otc.gc.ca/rail-ferro/finance/rail_cost_e.html]

==Methodology==
The methodology used in railway costing breaks down the costs of rail traffic to their unit value and from there determines their relationship to traffic handled and service provided. Therefore, as traffic and services change, the effect of these changes can be estimated from the unit values previously determined.  The costing model methodology allows for variable costs to increase as traffic increases, whereas the fixed costs will remain constant, regardless of the overall level of traffic.

==Mathematical models==
Railway costing is typically performed using [[mathematical model]]s. Using unit costs from current operating data and current accounting and operating information, it is possible to develop costing information for the railway. This costing information may be used to estimate the operating cost of a new line and to determine whether it is economically viable. Alternatively, the model could be used to estimate the cost effects of changing speed limits along a route. The savings that can be achieved with a railway costing model are endless. For example, by knowing the costs of doing business, a railway can appropriately determine the tariffs to be charged.

In addition, railway costing models typically handle passenger and freight traffic, making them applicable in more situations, including mixed traffic situations.

some commercial variations of railway costing models have been implemented, including the OSCAR railway costing model developed by [[CPCS Transcom Limited]]. CPCS is an international infrastructure development firm and has successfully used this model in dozens of its projects worldwide.

The Cartage railway costing model was developed by Vectorail, a global supplier of railway costing solutions with more than forty years of experience in the field.

In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine listed him as the 60th-wealthiest person in the United States, and the 205th-richest in the world, with an estimated net worth of $5.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-devos Forbes magazine profile of Richard DeVos] ''Forbes''. Retrieved March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
DeVos was born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], the son of Ethel Ruth (Dekker) and Simon Cornelius DeVos, who worked in the electrical business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sekpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Simon+Cornelius+and+Ethel+Ruth+(Dekker)+De+Vos%22&amp;dq=%22Simon+Cornelius+and+Ethel+Ruth+(Dekker)+De+Vos%22|title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Current volume|author=|date=October 20, 1967|publisher=J.T.

He served in the military in [[World War II]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;The Possible Dream, by Charles Paul Conn, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Books written by him include ''Compassionate Capitalism'' and ''Hope From My Heart: Ten Lessons For Life''. The latter reflects his feelings after successfully undergoing a [[heart transplant]] operation in 1997. This was preceded by two heart-bypass operations in 1983 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fate, patience bring DeVos a new heart: Amway cofounder back after journey for life | work= Detroit Free Press|last=Levin|first=Doron|date=October 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, DeVos published a book about his success, co-authored with [[Charles Paul Conn]], titled ''Believe!''.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt; In 2014 he published his memoirs titled "Simply Rich".&lt;ref name="KR"&gt;{{cite web |title=Simply Rich |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rich-devos/simply-rich/ |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports ownership==
[[File:Richard DeVos 2010.jpg|thumb|DeVos welcoming fans before a game in October 2010]]
DeVos was the owner of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] team [[Orlando Magic]], having bought the team in 1991 for $85 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/sports/nba-orlando-team-sold.html | title = Orlando Team Sold | accessdate = July 27, 2010 | date = September 20, 1991 | work = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in the team after an unsuccessful effort to acquire a [[Major League Baseball]] expansion franchise for Orlando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/sports/nba-orlando-team-sold.html|title=N.B.A. Orlando Team Sold|author=|date=September 20, 1991|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos also formerly owned the [[Orlando Solar Bears (IHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]], [[Grand Rapids Griffins]], and the [[Kansas City Blades]], three [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]] franchises before that league folded;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magic, DeVos family plan to buy Orlando Solar Bears |url=https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2017/05/03/magic-devos-family-plan-to-buy-orlando-solar-bears |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Solar Bears and Blades were closed as a result of the league folding, while the Griffins moved to the [[American Hockey League]], and are now under the ownership of [[Dan DeVos]], one of Richard's sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DAN DEVOS |url=https://www.griffinshockey.com/team/front-office/index.html?staff_id=1 |website=griffinshockey.com |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos asked [[Orange County, Florida]], to help pay for the Orlando Magic's new arena using county funds and Dema Stobell's Corporation money. [[Amway]] pays for the naming rights to [[Amway Center]]. The use of public money was controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nothing but the best for new arena: Look what your taxes helped buy|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-03-13/news/os-magic-arena-furnishings-20100313_1_new-arena-magic-executives-amway-arena|accessdate=March 13, 2010|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He sat on the board of trustees of [[Northwood University]] and has been president of the [[Council for National Policy]]. He also served on the board of trustees of the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], which is a museum dedicated to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.constitutioncenter.org/ncc_about_Board_of_Trustees.aspx | title = National Constitution Center, Board of Trustees | accessdate = July 27, 2010 | date = July 26, 2010 | publisher = National Constitution Center | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rWT81EKj?url=http://www.constitutioncenter.org/ncc_about_Board_of_Trustees.aspx|archivedate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sat on the legacy board of [[Christian Leaders Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christian Leaders Directory|url = https://www.christianleadersinstitute.org/cli-directory|website = Free Ministry Training – Ordination|access-date = January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.christianleadersinstitute.org | title = Christian Leaders Institute | accessdate = May 7, 2012 | date = May 7, 2012 | publisher = Christian Leaders Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; the nonprofit organization founded by Henry Reyenga Jr. after he was encouraged by DeVos and Ron Parr.&lt;ref name="HCLI"&gt;{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN LEADERS INSTITUTE |url=https://www.christianleadersinstitute.org/history/ |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
He co-founded the [[Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation]], an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] foundation and grant-making body in 1970.&lt;ref name="Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation"&gt;[http://old.mediatransparency.org/funderprofile.php?funderID=17 Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000000/http://old.mediatransparency.org/funderprofile.php?funderID=17 |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgci.com/funding/fdnresultnew.asp?thisID=6312|title=Funding State by State|author=The Grantsmanship Center|website=The Grantsmanship Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DeVoses were known in their philanthropy for contributing to education, health care, arts and historic causes like [[Mount Vernon]], and free-market think tanks such as [[The Heritage Foundation]] and [[American Enterprise Institute|AEI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2016/01/how_mlive_analyzed_devos_famil.html How MLive analyzed DeVos family's $90.9 million in annual donations], mlive.com, January 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DeVoses, the core of their giving is local. "A focus of our philanthropy has always been our home area. We want to create an atmosphere for everyone to improve their circumstances while advancing our community, whether through Christian compassion, education, health care, or the arts."&lt;ref name="philanthropyroundtable.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/updates_on_past_winners_richard_and_helen_devos|title=Updates on Past Winners, 2001–2013|website=philanthropyroundtable.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DeVoses gave money to organizations ranging from local schools to the regional symphony. According to the Philanthropy Roundtable, their giving is "helping turn Grand Rapids, Michigan, into one of the livelier and healthier small cities in the U.S. When the couple won their Simon Prize in 2006, they distributed the award money to eight local organizations in western Michigan 'whose leaders all demonstrated resourcefulness in helping people help themselves'".&lt;ref name="philanthropyroundtable.org"/&gt;

With his wife, Helen June (Van Wesep),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XzsUAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Helen+June+(Van+Wesep)+DeVos%22&amp;dq=%22Helen+June+(Van+Wesep)+DeVos%22|title=Foundation Reporter|first=Kenneth|last=Estell|date=October 20, 1998|publisher=[[Taft Group]]|accessdate=October 20, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVos was a winner of the [[William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership]].

Education-related philanthropy included the Richard M. and Helen DeVos Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation at [[Grand Valley State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gvsu.edu/cei/Richard|title=M. and Helen DeVos Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Richard and Helen DeVos Fieldhouse at [[Hope College]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://hope.edu/news/2018/giving/richard-devos-philanthropic-impact-reflected-by-hope-campus.html Richard DeVos’ Philanthropic Impact Reflected by Hope Campus], hope.edu, Greg Olgers, September 6, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Arts and Worship at [[Grand Rapids Christian High School|Grand Rapids Christian Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcaw.org/|title=DeVos Center for Arts and Worship ::|website=www.dcaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation was in part responsible for funding the creation of the Sport Business Management Program at the [[University of Central Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sport/cgi-bin/site/sitew.cgi?page=/devos.htx Sport Business – About the DeVos Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706153733/http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sport/cgi-bin/site/sitew.cgi?page=%2Fdevos.htx |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==
DeVos was a major donor to the [[Republican Party (United States)|U.S. Republican Party]] and to conservative causes, including [[Focus on the Family]], the [[American Enterprise Institute]].

'''St. John's Episcopal Church''' is an antebellum-era church located at 2326 [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]] (at the corner of Woodward and the [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Fisher Freeway]] service drive) in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It is the oldest church still standing on Woodward Avenue, an area once called Piety Hill for its large number of religious buildings.&lt;ref name="nrhp"&gt;{{NRHP url|id=64000332|title=Religious Structures of Woodward Ave. TR}} from the National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt; The church was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1987.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:St Johns Episcopal Church1905.jpg|thumb|left|St. John's Episcopal Church c. 1905]]
[[Image:St Johns Episcopal Detroit 1934.jpg|thumb|left|St. John's Episcopal Church in 1934]]
The parish of St. John's was organized in Detroit in 1858, primarily due to the efforts of [[Henry Porter Baldwin]], a successful merchant who later became [[governor of Michigan]] and a [[United States senator]].&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"&gt;[http://www.stjohnsdetroit.org/history/ History page] from St. John's Episcopal Church website&lt;/ref&gt; Porter purchased and donated the property, which was then on the northern outskirts of Detroit's city limits at the corner of Woodward and High Street (now [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]]). He also donated the money to build a rectory and a 150-seat chapel, designed by Jordan &amp; Anderson.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt;

When the chapel was dedicated in 1859, it proved too small for the burgeoning congregation. A new church was commissioned from Jordan &amp; Anderson and quickly constructed; it was consecrated on December 10, 1861.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt;

Today the church congregation is unusual among those of the modern [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], as it uses the traditional 1928 edition of the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. Some weekday services use the [[Anglican Missal]], rather than the newer 1979 edition Book of Common Prayer.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt;

==Architecture==
St. John's is an example of Victorian [[Gothic Revival]] architecture, measuring 170 feet by 65 feet.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt; The belfry, the tallest section of the building, rises 105 feet.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt; The bulk of the exterior is rubble limestone, with the trim made of Kelly Island sandstone.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt; The side walls and roof are supported by buttresses and hammer beam trusses. Decorative gargoyles festoon the roof line and hood moldings above the windows and doors. The interior has galleries cantilevered on three sides; originally there were no intermediary piers to support the roof, giving the church an auditorium feel.&lt;ref name="nrhp"/&gt;

There are six memorial stained glass windows on either side of the nave. These were installed between 1880 and 1954.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt; The upper portions of the windows, above the stained glass, are still the original [[grisaille]] and colored glass. The great west window was dedicated in 1963.

The altar, installed in 1873, is constructed of white [[Caen stone]]; it serves as a memorial to the mother of then-Rector George Worthington.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt; Most of the rest of the chancel furnishings were donated as memorials during the renovations in 1892. These include the screen made from wrought iron and Caen stone, the harmonizing pulpit, and the brass lectern. Hand-carved oak clergy and choir stalls were added following the 1936 renovation.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt;

There have been two major architectural alterations to St. John's since the church was built. The first, in 1892, deepened the [[chancel]] to create space for the organ console and the choir.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt; This alteration required that the original chapel be taken down and rebuilt ten feet farther east. In 1936, due to the widening of Woodward Avenue, the entire church and chapel were moved 60 feet backwards.&lt;ref name="stjohnhist"/&gt;

The oldest part of the church, the chapel, still stands, and includes a number of stained glass windows. A State of Michigan historical marker now marks the church.&lt;ref name="sjmark"&gt;[http://www.michmarkers.com/Pages/L1421.htm St. John's Episcopal Church] from michmarkers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Textilkennzeichnungab.jpg|thumb|right|Label indicating the composition of textiles]]
The '''Textile Labelling Act (Germany)''' ({{lang-de|Textilkennzeichnungsgesetz}} [[Literal translation|Lit]]:"Law on the designation of textiles", short ''TextilKennzG'') is a [[Germany|German]] federal law which was decreed on 1 April 1969. The law was completely rewritten and the new version was announced on 14 August 1986. The law was last changed by decree on 14 November 2006.

This law is part of the German consumer protection. Textiles to be commercially sold in Germany, commercially imported into Germany or produced to be sold in Germany have to have a label indicating the type and fraction based on weight of the textile raw materials it is composed of. Also any catalogue, brochure or other type of commercial have to state the composition of the textiles to be sold. There are certain rules on how to determine the weight fractions and how to calculate them.

Textiles in the context of this law is any good, fabric, part of mattress or camping good, lining of shoes and gloves, floor-covering and many other goods which consist of at least 80% textile raw materials. Textile raw materials are filaments or hairs which can be spun, including bands and flexible tubes not wider than 5mm.

For example, if a [[T-shirt]] consists of 80% [[cotton]] and 20% [[elastane]] this has to be declared on the label of the garment. If the shirt consists of 100% cotton one can choose between "100% cotton" or "completely made of cotton" or "pure cotton". For things made of [[wool]] and [[silk]] there are special regulations. Annex One of the law regulates the denomination of the various filaments.

In Annex Three there is a list of things that do not need a label indicating their composition, such as wristbands for watches, labels, artificial flowers, etc. Annex Four lists products that don't need a label but just an indication of their composition at the site of sale. These are especially things which are traditionally sold per meter like elastic tape.

If one violates the prescription on labelling textiles he can fined up to 5,000.00 [[Euro]]s.

One does not have to declare the country of production on labels. This declaration is optional. Care instructions are printed on labels for liability- and compensation-prevention and are also optional.

This '''timeline of the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]]''' documents how events related to the Chinese dairy products contamination by melamine unfolded. Complaints about kidney problems traced back to a brand of [[infant formula]], subsequent discoveries of [[melamine]] contamination of liquid milk, and exported [[powdered milk]] of processed food products (using contaminated milk). The scandal decimated Chinese dairy exports, and re-exposed long-standing concerns about food security, corruption, lack of political checks and balances. Though the scandal came to attention in 2008, its roots can be traced back to events prior to 2008.

'''Tomislav "Tole" Karadžić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Томислав Толе Караџић}}; born 10 February 1939) is a [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegrin Serb]] businessman and football administrator. From 2008 to 2016, he served in his second stint as the president of the [[Football Association of Serbia]] (FSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tomislav Karadžić za RTS: Derbi sa publikom! |url=http://www.rts.rs/page/sport/sr/story/36/Fudbal/18162/Tomislav+Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87+za+RTS%3A+Derbi+sa+publikom!.html |publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia]] |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From 2005 until 2006 Karadžić was the president of Serbian and Montenegrin Football Association (FSSCG). Prior to that he was the president of the regional FA (Football Association of Vojvodina), the job he performed for 18 years.  On 25 September 2007, Karadžić became the president of [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] where he came following the decades-long reign of [[Nenad Bjeković]], [[Žarko Zečević]], and [[Ivan Ćurković]] at the club.

Simultaneously, Karadžić kept a position at the Serbian FA where he was a deputy to the association's president [[Zvezdan Terzić]]. In March 2008, Terzić fled the country after getting indicted for embezzlement of player transfer funds and Karadžić took over his role as FA president. During summer 2008 new elections were held for the FSS presidency. Karadžić beat out Dragan Aca Bulić.

== Controversy and criticism==
===1961 prison stay===
During his time as a student in [[Belgrade]], Karadžić was reportedly convicted in 1961 of [[aggravated assault]] and sentenced to year and a half in [[prison]]. The victim is said to have lost an eye. However, under mysterious circumstances, Karadžić was released after only 6 months in the [[ZIKS|Spuž prison]].&lt;ref name="FR" &gt;The [[Telegraf (Serbia)|Telegraf]]:[http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/809447-zbog-cega-je-karadzic-bio-u-zatvoru-u-tuci-ostavio-momka-bez-oka ZBOG ČEGA JE KARADŽIĆ BIO U ZATVORU? U tuči ostavio momka bez oka? (serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident briefly came back into public focus during August 2013 while Karadžić publicly clashed with the [[Red Star Belgrade]] club vice-president [[Nebojša Čović]] over ongoing Serbian SuperLiga administrative issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/808529-toletov-rat-i-mir-kriminalci-se-kriju-iza-dzajinog-imena|title=TOLETOV RAT I MIR: Zvezdini grobari, kockari i svodnici su uništili klub!|last=|first=|date=20 August 2013|work=Telegraf.rs|location=Belgrade|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/808952-covic-postavio-20-pitanja-toletu-karadizicu|title=ČOVIĆ PITA TOLETA: Zašto su te terali jajima i kako si zaradio desetine miliona evra?|last=|first=|date=21 August 2013|work=Telegraf.rs|location=Belgrade|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irregularities in player sales and match-fixing ===
For many years, Karadžić has been heavily criticized by public due to various reasons and decisions, which had catastrophic consequences for the Serbian football. After numerous serious irregularities in player sales (mostly for young players), serious suspicions of [[match-fixing]], and an impending boycott of the Serbian top club [[Red Star Belgrade]] combined with sharp criticism of over half of the clubs in [[Serbian SuperLiga]], Karadžić announced his resignation in late 2013.&lt;ref name="FR 2" &gt;The [[Frankfurter Rundschau]]:[http://www.fr-online.de/sport/serbischer-verbandschef-karadzic-kuendigt-ruecktritt-an,1472784,24117726.html Serbischer Verbandschef Karadzic kündigt Rücktritt an (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FNP" &gt;The Frankfurter Neue Presse:[http://www.fnp.de/sport/fussball/Serbiens-Fussball-vor-Truemmerhaufen;art148,599878 Serbiens Fußball vor Trümmerhaufen (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;

When criticism became public, he was in [[Budva]] on holiday, so therefore he didn't comment it in details, but referred to his critics as criminals. His adversary [[Zvezdan Terzic]] — a football administrator who also drew strong criticism by Serbian public for of similar reasons — called for the convening of a special meeting of the Federation Parliament and the immediate withdrawal. However, Karadžić not resigned and since then is even more under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;ekapija.de:[http://www.ekapija.com/website/de/page/602909/Tomislav-Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87-bleibt-an-der-Spitze-des-Fu%C3%9Fballverbandes-Serbien Tomislav Karadžić bleibt an der Spitze des Fußballverbandes Serbien (german)]&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations against him for administrative abuse, [[monopoly]], and [[clientelism]] have been continued.

=== Chants against Karadžić ===
For a certain time, during the league matches, fans frequently start a chant against him which says "Tole, lopove!" (Tole, you are a thief!), and these are often supporters of both teams playing, even the fans of the biggest Serbian clubs and eternal rivals, [[Delije]] and [[Grobari]]. These chants have been sung even during the matches of the [[Serbia national football team|Serbian national team]].&lt;ref&gt;alo.rs:[http://www.alo.rs/sport/fudbal/sad-i-grobari-vicu-tole-lopove/52053 (Serbian) Sad i „grobari” viču: TOLE, LOPOVE!

'''''Tucker: The Man and His Dream''''' is a 1988 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and starring [[Jeff Bridges]]. The film recounts the story of [[Preston Tucker]] and his attempt to produce and market the [[1948 Tucker Sedan]], which was met with scandal between the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]]" and accusations of stock fraud from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. [[Joan Allen]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Elias Koteas]], [[Frederic Forrest]] and [[Christian Slater]] appear in supporting roles.

In 1973, Coppola began development of a film based on the life of Tucker, originally with [[Marlon Brando]] in the lead role. Starting in 1976, Coppola planned ''Tucker'' to be both a musical and an [[experimental film]] with music and lyrics written by [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]]. The project eventually collapsed when Coppola's [[American Zoetrope]] experienced financial problems. ''Tucker'' was revived in 1986 when Coppola's friend, [[George Lucas]], joined as a producer.

The film received critical praise, but was a box office disappointment. Nonetheless, ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' produced a spike in prices of Tucker Sedans, as well as a renewed appreciation for Tucker and his automobiles.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Please review the guidelines at WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. The word count in this section should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] engineer [[Preston Tucker]] has been interested in building cars since childhood.  During [[World War II]] he designed an armored car for the military and made money building gun turrets for aircraft in a small shop next to his home in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]].  Tucker is supported by his large, extended family, including wife Vera and eldest son Preston Jr.

As the war winds down, Tucker has a dream of finally building the "car of the future."  The "Tucker Torpedo" will feature revolutionary safety designs including disc brakes, seat belts, a pop out windshield, and head lights which swivel when you turn.  Tucker hires young designer [[Alex Tremulis]] to help with the design and enlists New York financier Abe Karatz to arrange financial support. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz acquire the enormous [[Dodge Chicago Plant]] to begin manufacturing.  Abe hires Robert Bennington to run the new Tucker Corporation on a day-to-day basis.

Launching "the car of tomorrow" in a spectacular way, the Tucker Corporation is met with enthusiasm from [[shareholder]]s and the general public. However, the Tucker company [[board of directors]], unsure of his ability to overcome the technical and financial obstacles ahead, send Tucker off on a publicity campaign and attempt to take complete control of the company. While Tucker travels the country, Bennington and directors change the design of Tucker's car to a more conventional design, eliminating the safety and engineering advances Tucker was advertising.  At the same time, Tucker faces animosity from the Big Three and the authorities led by Michigan Senator [[Homer S. Ferguson]].

Tucker returns from his publicity tour and confronts Bennington, who curtly informs him that he no longer has any power in the company to make decisions, and the engine originally planned for the car is not viable.  Tucker then receives a call from [[Howard Hughes]], who sends a private plane to bring Tucker to his aircraft manufacturing site.  Hughes advises Tucker to purchase the [[Franklin Engine Company|Aircooled Motors Company]], which can supply both the steel Tucker needs, as well as a small, powerful helicopter engine that might replace Tucker's original "589" power plant.

Faced with being unable to change Bennington's design, Tucker modifies the new engine and installs it in a test Tucker in the secrecy of his backyard tool and die shop. This prototype proves successful in both durability and crash testing.  However, Tucker is confronted with allegations of stock fraud. Ferguson's investigation with the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), causes Karatz, once convicted of bank fraud, to resign, fearful that his criminal record will prejudice the hearings. [[Yellow journalism]] starts ruining Tucker's public image even though the ultimate courtroom battle is resolved when he parades his entire production run of 50 Tucker Torpedoes, proving that he has reached production status.

After giving a speech to the jurors on how [[capitalism]] in the United States is harmed by efforts of large corporations against small entrepreneurs like himself, Tucker is acquitted on all charges. Nevertheless, his company falls into [[bankruptcy]] and Preston Tucker dies of [[lung cancer]] seven years later, never able to realize his dream of producing a state-of-the-art automobile.

The film ends with all 50 Tucker Sedans being driven down the streets of downtown Chicago, admired by everyone as they pass.

==Background==
[[File:1948 Tucker Sedan at the Blackhawk Museum.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A 1948 Tucker Sedan at the [[Blackhawk Museum]]]]
From childhood, Coppola envisioned a film about the Tucker automobile&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; and while attending the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] in the early 1960s, further refined a film concept based on the life of Preston Tucker.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; In June 1973, during the filming of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), Coppola announced his intention to start development at American Zoetrope as writer, producer and director. He had already approached Marlon Brando for the lead role.&lt;ref name=dance&gt;Schumacher 1999, pp. 183, 283, 324.&lt;/ref&gt; He then purchased the [[life rights|rights]] from the Tucker Estate in 1976,&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; and, in addition to Brando, discussed the leading role with [[Jack Nicholson]]&lt;ref name=Bridge/&gt; and also considered [[Burt Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=grammy/&gt; Taking inspiration from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), [[Kabuki]] theater and the work of [[Bertolt Brecht]], Coppola initially planned to make ''Tucker'' as a "dark kind of musical."&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; He later said that the idea approximated the style of an experimental film,&lt;ref name=promo&gt;Coppola, Francis Ford. ''Tucker: The Man and the Car '' (1948) DVD [[audio commentary]] (included on the DVD for ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988), released in 2000). San Francisco: American Zoetrope / Paramount Home Video, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]'' (1985), which he produced.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt;

The musical would have featured Tucker predominantly, but storylines would have interwoven [[Thomas Edison]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Harvey Samuel Firestone]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]] as supporting characters. Leonard Bernstein agreed to write the music, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green were hired to write the lyrics. They all spent a week at Coppola's home in California,&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; planning the musical which resulted in Bernstein writing one song.&lt;ref name=promo/&gt; Coppola also approached [[Gene Kelly]] as a consultant for the dance choreography.&lt;ref name=dance/&gt; However, financing for ''Tucker'' fell through when Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope, filed for bankruptcy after the box office failures of ''[[One from the Heart]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mottram, James.

Retrieved: May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola abandoned ''Tucker'' for the time being and went to work on ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name=kit/&gt;

In 1986,&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; during the production of ''[[Captain EO]]'' (1986),&lt;ref name=child/&gt; Coppola's friend George Lucas encouraged him to revive development for ''Tucker'', believing it to be "the best film Francis had ever been involved with."&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; In addition, Lucas agreed to serve as [[executive producer]] and offered the use of his filmmaking companies, [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name=child/&gt; He also convinced Coppola to drop the musical idea in favor of doing a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the films of [[Frank Capra]], especially ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; Coppola became interested in the [[American Dream]] aspect of the storyline, as well as post-World War II capitalism and politics.&lt;ref name=promo/&gt; At one point, Coppola approached Capra to produce the film with Lucas, however, Capra thought Tucker was a failure and Coppola dropped that plan.&lt;ref name=grammy/&gt;

Coppola originally intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to his commitment to the filming of ''[[Gardens of Stone]]'' (1987), engaged [[Arnold Schulman]] who scripted Capra's ''[[A Hole in the Head]]'' (1959). Schulman was angered when screenwriter [[David Seidler]], who'd been previously attached to the project, was granted a co-writing credit by the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]], stating: "Believe me, I was pissed off about the credit grabbing on ''Tucker''. I'm still pissed off. That is one instance where every word of the script is ''mine''."&lt;ref&gt;https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft138nb0zm&amp;chunk.id=d0e15701&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola was also displeased by Seidler's credit, stating: "They gave a credit to a writer who had nothing to do with the script that I used."&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher 1999, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers devised a $24 million production budget, but [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] wanted Coppola and Lucas to lower it to $15 million. Distributors were also dubious about working with Lucas after the 1986 commercial and critical failures of both ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''&lt;ref name=grammy/&gt; and ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; Lucas decided to cover the $24 million budget himself, and [[pre-production]] proceeded.&lt;ref name=kit/&gt;

==Production==
Development and production for ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' included the involvement of Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast in the title role and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has "got it all in the mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that."&lt;ref name=Bridge&gt;[[Richard Corliss|Corliss, Richard]] and Jean McDowell.

Retrieved: May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The construct of family values played a crucial role in the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;

[[Principal photography]] started with first unit shooting on April 13, 1987 in the [[Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant]] in [[Richmond, California]], doubling for the [[Dodge Chicago Plant]]. The majority of outdoor filming took place in [[Marin County, California]] as well as various locations including [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Novato, California|Novato]], and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=Baxter&gt;Baxter 1999, pp. 367–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven of the original 51 Tucker '48s still exist,&lt;ref name="Kinney"/&gt; and many are in excellent condition.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen 1996, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-one of the cars were borrowed from members of the Tucker Automobile Club of America and were extensively used as both "set dressing" and in starring roles.&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; Three cars were used to film the crash scene, a "before" version, with a fiberglass body, the car used to do the actual rollover was a Studebaker modified to look like a Tucker (this car is currently in a privately owned museum in Tallahassee, Florida), and an "after crash" version which was another fiberglass body fitted to a Ford LTD chassis.&lt;ref name=volocars&gt;[http://www.volocars.com/attractions-hollywood.htm "TV and movie car collection."] ''volocars.com''.

==Historical accuracy==
Coppola had a certain amount of personal affinity with the short-lived legacy of Preston Tucker. His father, Carmine Coppola, had been one of the original investors in Tucker stock and purchased one of the cars off the production line.&lt;ref&gt;LaFrance, J.D. [http://www.erasingclouds.com/0811tucker.html "Cinematic Pleasures: Tucker, The Man and His Dream."] ''Erasing Clouds'', Issue 25, July/August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola included the involvement of Preston Tucker's children, grandchildren and members of the Tucker Estate during the development of ''Tucker'' in the late 1970s, as well as during filming in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Aubry, Kim, producer. ''Under the Hood: Making Tucker'' (included on the DVD for ''Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988), released in 2000). San Francisco: American Zoetrope / Paramount Home Video, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola and Lucas acknowledged that they purposely intended to portray Tucker in an entirely sympathetic way.&lt;ref name=kit/&gt; Both filmmakers each owned two Tuckers,&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; although Lucas eventually sold one of his cars in September 2005 for $385,500.&lt;ref name="Kinney"&gt;Kinney, Dave.

Retrieved: May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tucker Automobile Club made up of a legion of Tucker owners and collectors pronounced in their trade journal, ''TACA'', that the "basic theme of the movie is quite accurate..." although "the film compresses time and often takes artistic license with facts in order to more effectively present the story."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Larry.

Retrieved: June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, spoke of the historical inaccuracies. "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will find a lot of what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters."&lt;ref name=type/&gt; Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. "We knew the facts," she continued, "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain."&lt;ref name=type/&gt; [[Alex Tremulis]], who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Margalit. 

The car Tucker first showed to the public was nicknamed the "Tin Goose."  However, the Tin Goose shown in the film is a "production" Tucker, painted in the same maroon color, but there are many detail differences between the two cars.  Most noticeable are the rear doors, they opened in a conventional manner in the "Tin Goose," but virtually all other Tuckers built featured "suicide" style rear doors which were hinged at the rear.

[[File:Automatisches Kleinteilelager.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An automatic storage warehouse for small parts]]
A '''warehouse''' is a [[commercial building]] for storage of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Warehouses are used by [[manufacturer]]s, [[importer]]s, [[exporter]]s, [[wholesaler]]s, [[transport]] businesses, [[customs]], etc. They are usually large plain buildings in [[industrial park]]s on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages.

They usually have [[loading dock]]s to load and unload goods from trucks. Sometime warehouses are designed for the loading and unloading of goods directly from [[railway]]s, [[airport]]s, or [[seaport]]s. They often have [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[Forklift truck|forklift]]s for moving goods, which are usually placed on [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [[pallet]]s loaded into [[pallet racking|pallet rack]]s. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, [[spare part]]s, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing and production. In India, a warehouse may be referred to as a godown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/godown|title=godown - Definition of godown in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A warehouse can be defined functionally as a building in which to store bulk produce or goods (''wares'') for commercial purposes. The built form of warehouse structures throughout time depends on many contexts: materials, technologies, sites and cultures. 

In this sense, the warehouse postdates the need for communal or state-based mass storage of surplus food. Prehistoric civilizations relied on family- or community-owned [[Prehistoric storage pits|storage pits]], or ‘palace’ storerooms, such as at [[Knossos]], to protect surplus food. The archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] argued that gathering and storing agricultural surpluses in Bronze Age Minoan ‘palaces’ was a critical ingredient in the formation of proto-state power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Emergence of Civilisation: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC.|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|publisher=Methuen|year=1972|isbn=0-416-16480-3|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for ''ware''houses developed in societies in which trade reached a critical mass requiring storage at some point in the exchange process. This was highly evident in ancient Rome, where the horreum (pl. horrea) became a standard building form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roman Granaries and Store Buildings|last=Rickman|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=0-521-07724-9|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The most studied examples are in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port city that served Rome. The [[Horrea Galbae]], a warehouse complex on the road towards Ostia, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. Galba’s horrea complex contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m²). As a point of reference, less than half of U.S. warehouses today are larger than 100,000 square feet (9290 m²).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.action-storage.com/blog/general/history-of-the-warehouse/|title=A History of the Warehouse|last=Anon.|first=Michael|date=15 October 2018|website=Action Storage|archive-url=https://www.action-storage.com/blog/|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The need for a warehouse implies having quantities of goods too big to be stored in a domestic storeroom. But as attested by legislation concerning the levy of duties, some medieval merchants across Europe commonly kept goods in their large household storerooms, often on the ground floor or cellars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Palaces of Medieval Venice|last=Schulz|first=Jurgen|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2004|isbn=0-271-04836-0|location=University Park PA|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Merchant Venturers: Collected Studies|last=Carus-Wilson|first=E.M.|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-136-58279-0|location=Hoboken NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Fondaco dei Tedeschi]], the substantial quarters of German traders in Venice, which combined a dwelling, warehouse, market and quarters for travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade, Travel, and Exploration in the Middle Ages: An Encyclopedia|last=Friedman, John Block (1) &amp; Figg, Kristeb Mossler (2), Eds|first=|publisher=Garland|year=2000|isbn=978-1-135-59094-9|location=New York|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the middle ages on, dedicated warehouses were constructed around ports and other commercial hubs to facilitate large-scale trade. The warehouses of the trading port [[Bryggen]] in Bergen, Norway (now a World Heritage site), demonstrate characteristic European gabled timber forms dating from the late middle ages, though what remains today was largely rebuilt in the same traditional style following great fires in 1702 and 1955. 

During the industrial revolution the function of warehouses evolved and became more specialised. Always a building of function, in the past few decades warehouses have adapted to standardisation, mechanisation, technological innovation and changes in supply chain methods.&lt;!-- Holding text- to allow the introduction of a photo gallery References or radical edit appreciated--&gt;

==Warehouse Functions and Forms==
[[File:India House 5.JPG|thumb|[[India House, Manchester]].]]
A customised storage building—a warehouse—enables a business to stockpile goods, eg, to build up a full load prior to transport, or hold unloaded goods before further distribution, or store goods like wine and cheese that require maturation. As a place for storage, the warehouse has to be secure, convenient, and as spacious as possible, according to the owner’s resources, the site and contemporary building technology. &amp;nbsp;Before mechanised technology developed, warehouse functions relied on human labour, using mechanical lifting aids like pulley systems.

The mass production of goods launched by the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries fuelled the development of larger and more specialised warehouses, usually located close to transport hubs on canals, at railways and portside. Specialisation of tasks is characteristic of the [[factory system]], which developed in British textile mills and potteries in the mid-late 1700s. Factory processes speeded up work and deskilled labour, bringing new profits to capital investment. 

Warehouses also fulfill a range of commercial functions beside simple storage, exemplified by [[Manchester cotton warehouses|Manchester’s cotton warehouses]] and Australian wool stores: receiving, stockpiling and despatching goods; displaying goods for commercial buyers; packing, checking and labelling orders, and despatching them. 

The utilitarian architecture of warehouses responded fast to emerging technologies. Before and into the nineteenth century, the basic European warehouse was built of load-bearing masonry walls, or heavy-framed timber with a suitable external cladding. Inside, heavy timber posts supported timber beams and joists for the upper levels, rarely more than four to five storeys high. 

A gabled roof was conventional, with a gate in the gable facing the street, rail lines or port for a crane to hoist goods into the window-gates on each floor below. Convenient access for road transport was built-in via very large doors on the ground floor. If not in a separate building, office and display spaces were located on the ground or first floor. 

Technological innovations of the early 19th century changed the shape of warehouses and the work performed inside them: cast iron columns and later, moulded steel posts; saw-tooth roofs; and steam power. All (except steel) were adopted quickly and were in common use by the middle of the 19th century. 

1. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Strong, slender [[Cast-iron architecture|cast iron columns]] began to replace masonry piers or timber posts to carry levels above ground floor. As modern [[Steel frame|steel framing]] developed in the late 19th century, its strength and constructability enabled the first skyscrapers. Steel girders replaced timber beams, increasing the span of internal bays in the warehouse.

2. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The [[saw-tooth roof]] brought natural light to the top storey of the warehouse. It transformed the shape of the warehouse, from the traditional peaked hip or gable to an essentially flat roof form that was often hidden behind a parapet. Warehouse buildings now became strongly horizontal. Inside the top floor, the vertical glazed pane of each saw-tooth enabled natural lighting over displayed goods, improving buyer inspection.

3. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Hoists and cranes driven by [[Steam engine|steam power]] expanded the capacity of manual labour to lift and move heavy goods. 

Two more new power sources, hydraulics and electricity, re-shaped warehouse design and practice at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century. 

1. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Public [[Hydraulic power network|hydraulic power networks]] were constructed in many large industrial cities around the world in the 1870s-80s, exemplified by [[Manchester Hydraulic Power|Manchester]]. They were highly effective to power cranes and lifts, whose application in warehouses served taller buildings and enabled new labour efficiencies. 

2. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Public [[Electric power industry|electricity networks]] emerged in the 1890s. They were used at first mainly for lighting and soon to electrify lifts, making possible taller, more efficient warehouses. It took several decades for electrical power to be distributed widely throughout cities in the western world.

20th century technologies made warehousing ever more efficient. Electricity became widely available and transformed lighting, security, lifting and transport from the 1900s. The [[internal combustion engine]], developed in the late 19th century, was installed in mass-produced vehicles from the 1910s. It not only reshaped transport methods, but enabled many applications as a compact, portable power plant, wherever small engines were needed. 

The [[forklift]] truck was invented in the early 20th century, and came into wide use after World War II. Forklifts transformed the possibilities of multi-level [[pallet racking]] of goods in taller, single-level steel-framed buildings for higher storage density. The forklift, and its load fixed to a uniform [[pallet]], enabled the rise of [[Logistics|logistic]] approaches to storage in the later 20th century. 

===Types of warehouses: Display of goods for sale ===
These displayed goods for the home trade. This would be finished goods- such as the latest cotton blouses or fashion items. Their street frontage was impressive, so they took the styles of Italianate [[Palazzo style architecture|Palazzi]].

[[Richard Cobden]]'s construction in Manchester's [[Mosley Street]] was the first [[Palazzo style architecture|palazzo]] warehouse. There were already seven warehouses on Portland Street when they commenced building the elaborate [[Watts Warehouse]] of 1855,&lt;ref name="Wyke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revealinghistories.org.uk/why-was-cotton-so-important-in-north-west-england/places/manchester-warehouses.html|title=Manchester warehouses|last=Wyke|first=Terry|work=Revealing Histories: Remembering Slavery|publisher=Manchester City Galleries|accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PB81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; but four more were opened before it was finished. It was this type of warehouse that inspired the Germans in [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Munich]] to name their prestigious department stores ''Warenhäuser''.{{dubious|date=April 2013}}

=== Types of warehouses: Overseas warehouses ===
These catered for the overseas trade. They became the meeting places for overseas wholesale buyers where printed and plain could be discussed and ordered.&lt;ref name="Wyke"/&gt; Trade in cloth in Manchester was conducted by many nationalities.

Behrens Warehouse is on the corner of [[Oxford Street, Manchester|Oxford Street]] and [[Portland Street]]. It was built for Louis Behrens &amp; Son by P Nunn in 1860. It is a four-storey predominantly red brick build with 23 bays along Portland Street and 9 along Oxford Street.&lt;ref name = PB81/&gt; The Behrens family were prominent in banking and in the social life of the German Community in Manchester.&lt;ref name=PB84&gt;{{harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Coates"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Su|date= 1991–92|title=German Gentlemen: Immigrant Institutions in a Provincial City 1840–1920|journal=Manchester Region History Review|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.mcrh.mmu.ac.uk/pubs/pdf/mrhr_05ii_coates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of warehouses: Packing warehouses ===
The main purpose of packing warehouses was the picking, checking, labelling and packing of goods for export.&lt;ref name="Wyke"/&gt;  The packing warehouses: [[Asia House, Manchester|Asia House]], [[India House, Manchester|India House]] and Velvet House along [[Whitworth Street]] in Manchester were some of the tallest buildings of their time.

=== Types of warehouses: Railway warehouses ===
Warehouses were built close to the major stations in railway hubs. The first railway warehouse to be built was opposite the passenger platform at the terminus of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. There was an important group of warehouses around [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|London Road station]] (now Piccadilly station).In the 1890s  the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway Company]]’s [[Great Northern Warehouse|warehouse]] was completed on [[Deansgate]]: this was the last major railway warehouse to be built.&lt;ref name="Wyke"/&gt;

The London Warehouse Picadilly was one of four warehouses built by the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] in about 1865 to service the new London Road Station. It had its own branch to the [[Ashton Canal]]. This warehouse was built of brick with stone detailing. It had cast iron columns with wrought iron beams.&lt;ref name="M 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/victorian/Victorian3.html |title=Victorian Manchester: Textile Industries &amp; Warehouses |last=Moss |first=John |date=2011-11-15 |work=Manchester 2000 Virtual Encyclopedia |publisher=Papillon Graphics |accessdate=26 January 2012 |location=Manchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127194533/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/victorian/Victorian3.html |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of warehouses: Canal warehouses ===
{{further|Canal warehouse}}
All these warehouse types can trace their origins back to the canal warehouses which were used for trans-shipment and storage. [[Castlefield]] warehouses are of this type- and important as they were built at the terminus of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in 1761.

==Storage and shipping systems==

Some of the most common warehouse storage systems are:
*  [[Pallet racking]] including selective, drive-in, drive-thru, double-deep, pushback, and gravity flow
*  Cantilever racking uses arms, rather than pallets, to store long thin objects like timber.
*  [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]] adds a semi-permanent storey of storage within a warehouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palletrackingsystemsltd.co.uk/glossary/mezzanine-flooring/
|title=Pallet Racking Systems Ltd|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  [[AS/RS|Vertical Lift Modules]] are packed systems with vertically arranged trays stored on both sides of the unit.
*  [[AS/RS|Horizontal Carousels]] consist of a frame and a rotating carriage of bins.
*  [[AS/RS|Vertical Carousels]] consisting of a series of carriers mounted on a vertical closed-loop track, inside a metal enclosure.

A "piece pick" is a type of order selection process where a product is picked and handled in individual units and placed in an outer carton, tote or another container before shipping. Catalog companies and internet retailers are examples of predominantly piece-pick operations. Their customers rarely order in pallet or case quantities; instead, they typically order just one or two pieces of one or two items. Several elements make up the piece-pick system. They include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology used.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-2292585"&gt;{{cite web |title=PICK THIS! A Compendium of Piece-Picking Process Alternatives|isbn=9781892663467  |date=September 1, 2009 |author=OPSdesign Consulting |publisher=Warehousing Education &amp; Research Council (WERC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every movement inside a warehouse must be accompanied by a [[work order]]. Warehouse operation can fail when workers move goods without work orders, or when a storage position is left unregistered in the system.

Material direction and [[Track &amp; Trace|tracking]] in a warehouse can be coordinated by a [[Warehouse Management System]] (WMS), a [[database]] driven computer program. [[Logistics]] personnel use the WMS to improve warehouse efficiency by directing pathways and to maintain accurate [[inventory]] by recording warehouse transactions.

==Automation and optimization==
{{main|Warehouse robotics}}
Some warehouses are completely [[automation|automated]], and require only operators to work and handle all the task. Pallets and product move on a system of automated [[conveyor]]s, [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[automated storage and retrieval system]]s coordinated by [[programmable logic controller]]s and [[computer]]s running [[logistics automation]] software.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  These systems are often installed in [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] warehouses where temperatures are kept very cold to keep product from spoiling.  This is especially true in electronics warehouses that require specific temperatures to avoid damaging parts. Automation is also common where land is expensive, as automated storage systems can use vertical space efficiently. These high-bay storage areas are often more than 10 meters (33&amp;nbsp;feet) high, with some over 20 meters (65&amp;nbsp;feet) high.  Automated storage systems can be built up to 40m high.

For a warehouse to function efficiently, the facility must be properly ''slotted''. Slotting addresses which storage medium a product is picked from ([[pallet racking|pallet rack]] or [[carton flow]]), and how they are picked (pick-to-light, [[Voice Directed Warehousing|pick-to-voice]], or pick-to-paper). With a proper slotting plan, a warehouse can improve its inventory rotation requirements—such as [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO)]]—control labor costs and increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdcexec.com/news/10327109/effectively-slotting-a-warehouse-or-distribution-center ''Effectively Slotting a Warehouse or Distribution Center''] by Paul Hansen and Kelvin Gibson. [[Cygnus Business Media|Cygnus]] Supply and Demand Chain Executive. Accessed 2010-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pallet racks are commonly used to organize a warehouse.  It is important to know the dimensions of racking and the number of bays needed as well as the dimensions of the product to be stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rackexpress.com/blog/pallet-rack/installation-guide-warehouse-storage-rack-systems/|title=Installation Guide to Warehouse Storage Rack Systems - Rack Express|website=www.rackexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clearance should be accounted for if using a forklift or pallet mover to move inventory.

==Recent trends==
Modern warehouses commonly use a system of wide aisle pallet racking&lt;!-- Can this be considered a proper source? --&gt; to store goods which can be loaded and unloaded using [[forklift trucks]].

Traditional warehousing has declined since the last decades of the 20th century, with the gradual introduction of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] techniques.  The JIT system promotes product delivery directly from suppliers to consumer without the use of warehouses. However, with the gradual implementation of [[offshore outsourcing]] and [[offshoring]] in about the same time period, the distance between the manufacturer and the retailer (or the parts manufacturer and the industrial plant) grew considerably in many domains, necessitating at least one warehouse per country or per region in any typical [[supply chain]] for a given range of products.

Recent retailing trends have led to the development of [[Warehouse stores|warehouse-style retail stores]]. These high-ceiling buildings display retail goods on tall, heavy duty industrial racks rather than conventional retail shelving. Typically, items ready for sale are on the bottom of the racks, and crated or palletized inventory is in the upper rack.  Essentially, the same building serves as both warehouse and retail store.

Another trend relates to [[vendor-managed inventory]] (VMI). This gives the vendor the control to maintain the level of stock in the store. This method has its own issue that the vendor gains access to the warehouse.

Large exporters and manufacturers use warehouses as distribution points for developing retail outlets in a particular region or country. This concept reduces end cost to the consumer and enhances the production sale ratio.

Cross docking is a specialised type of distribution center (DC) in that little or no inventory is stored and product is received, processed (if needed) and shipped within a short timeframe. As in warehousing, there are different types of cross docks.

Reverse logistics is another type of warehousing that has become popular for environmental reasons. The term refers to items that are going from the end user back to the distributor or manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Cool warehouses and cold storage ==
{{main|Cool warehouse}}
Cold storage preserves agricultural products. Refrigerated storage helps in eliminating [[sprouting]], [[Decomposition|rotting]] and insect damage. Edible products are generally not stored for more than one year. Several [[perishable]] products require a storage temperature as low as −25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Cold storage helps stabilize [[market price]]s and evenly distribute goods both on demand basis and time basis. The farmers get the opportunity of producing [[cash crops]] to get remunerative prices. The consumers get the supply of perishable commodities with lower fluctuation of prices.

[[Ammonia]] and [[Freon]] compressors are commonly used in cold storage warehouses to maintain the temperature. Ammonia refrigerant is cheaper, easily available, and has a high latent [[heat of evaporation]], but it is also highly [[toxic]] and can form [[ANFO|an explosive mixture]] when mixed with fuel oil. [[Building insulation|Insulation]] is also important, to reduce loss of cold and to keep different sections of the warehouse at different temperatures.

There are two main types of refrigeration system used in cold storage warehouses: [[vapor absorption refrigeration|vapor absorption systems]] (VAS) and [[vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression systems]] (VCS). VAS, although comparatively costlier to install, is more economical in operation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The temperature necessary for [[Food preservation|preservation]] depends on the storage time required and the type of product. In general, there are three groups of products, foods that are alive (e.g. fruits and vegetables), foods that are no longer alive and have been processed in some form (e.g. meat and fish products), and commodities that benefit from storage at controlled temperature (e.g. beer, tobacco).

Location is important for the success of a cold storage facility. It should be in close proximity to a growing area as well as a market,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} be easily accessible for heavy vehicles, and have uninterrupted power supply.

==Education ==
There are few non-profit organizations which are focused on imparting knowledge, education and research in the field of warehouse management and its role in the supply chain industry. The Warehousing Education and Research Council (WERC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edumaritime.com/illinois/warehouse-education-research-council|title=Warehouse Education &amp; Research Council - Warehouse Certification and Online Programs|website=www.edumaritime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and International Warehouse Logistics Association (IWLA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edumaritime.com/illinois/warehouse-logistics-association-iwla|title=International Warehouse Logistics Association (IWLA) - Certified Logistics Professional Program|website=www.edumaritime.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Illinois, United States. They provide professional certification and continuing education programs for the industry in the country. The Australian College of Training have government funded programs to provide personal development and continuation training in warehousing certs II – V (Diploma), they operate in Western Australia online and face to face, or Australia wide for online only courses.
