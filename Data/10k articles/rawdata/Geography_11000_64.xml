The '''A153''' is a non-primary [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] that is located entirely in [[Lincolnshire]] in the [[east of England]].

The A153  starts at the [[T-junction]] with the [[A607 road|A607]] at [[Honington, Lincolnshire|Honington]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.9734|-0.6016|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A153 road (southern end)}})}} and heads east to [[Sleaford]], passing a crossroads with the B6403 - the Roman [[Ermine Street]]. Between Honington and Sleaford the road roughly follows the rail line through the River Slea valley. The road briefly ends at Sleaford which is bypassed by the [[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]] and  [[A17 road (Great Britain)|A17]] before remerging at Bone Mill Junction along the A17, heading north from there. Before the bypasses were built, the road went through Sleaford; this route is now the B1517. After leaving Sleaford the road goes through the villages of Anwick, North Kyme and Billinghay before crossing the River Witham and reaching Tattershall and Coningsby. From there the road follows the Bain Valley north towards the town of [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] where it intersects the busy A158, causing frequent traffic jams. Often in the summer months on Bank Holidays they can be miles long. The road leaves Horncastle and briefly continues to follow the Bain Valley before crossing over the breadth of the Lincolnshire Wolds and terminating at the [[A16 road (Great Britain)|A16]] [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]] bypass {{nowrap|({{coord|53.3526|-0.0217|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A153 road (northern end)}}).}}

The '''Anton Dohrn Seamount''' is a [[guyot]] in the [[Rockall Trough]] in the northeast [[Atlantic]]. It was named after the German fishery research vessel which discovered it at the end of the 1950s which, in turn, had been named after the 19th-century biologist [[Anton Dohrn]].

The feature rises from approximately 2,100 metres to 600 metres below sea level and has a sedimentary layer approximately 100 metres thick. It arose through episodic volcanic activity between 70 and 40&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Stofferes, Wijbrans, Shannon and Morrissey (2000). [http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/wijj/literature%20Wijbrans/O'Connor%20et%20al.%20Nature%20'00.pdf Evidence from episodic seamount volcanism for pulsing of the Iceland plume in the past 70 Myr]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090511/http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/wijj/literature%20Wijbrans/O%27Connor%20et%20al.%20Nature%20%2700.pdf |date=April 11, 2007 }}, ''Nature'' 408, 954–958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the base of the seamount is a slight "moat" where the sea-bottom is at a lower depth than the surrounding terrain.

Releasing their findings in August 2016, the Deep Links project team, a collaboration between Plymouth University, the University of Oxford, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and the British Geological Survey, spent six weeks at sea on board the RSS James Cook deploying robot submersibles to film, photograph and collect samples from an exceptionally diverse coral reef environment now revealed on the top of the plateau-like seamount.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9836">In 2008 [[Club de Madrid|the Club of Madrid]], the [[Bellona Foundation]] and the utility company [[Hafslund ASA]] joined forces to organize the top level climate conference in Norway called [[#CC8]] (Climate Conference 08: Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation). In 2009 the same organizers are arranging '''CC9''' (Climate Conference 09: Green Technology and Finance – Striking a Fair Climate Deal) which will take place on 4 and 5 June at Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg, Norway. It will be followed by a climate festival for children in the adjacent park on 6 June.

== Climate Conference 09 ==

The objective of CC9 is to contribute to the conclusion of a fair climate agreement by advancing the potential of [[green technology]] and adequate funding. Investing in the development and diffusion of green technologies and renewable energy is a sustainable way to stimulate the economy and create new jobs - sustainable economic growth that can reinforce efforts to [[Climate change mitigation|combat climate change]] while respecting development needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC9 | url=http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599 | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615080910/http://www.cc9.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1599# | archive-date=2009-06-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prestigious names to the conference ===

[[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|His Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Haakon of Norway]] will open the Conference. 

Among those who will be speaking at CC9 is [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bellona Web | url=http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613074513/http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2008/kennedyToAttendConferenceInNorway# | archive-date=2009-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who has made a name for himself as a clear-headed and dynamic advocate for the environment. Kennedy founded and now chairs the [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], an organization working to improve water quality in the US and elsewhere in the world. In his work as a lawyer, Kennedy handles cases for the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]]  (NRDC), one of the largest environmental organizations in the US. The NRDC is known as a solution-oriented and competent player in the environmental field. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the first member of the [[Kennedy family]] to visit Norway.

In addition to Mr. Kennedy, many other prestigious names will be participating at CC9, including Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]], Norwegian Minister of the Environment and International Development [[Erik Solheim]] and [[Stephen O. Andersen]], director of Strategic Climate Projects in the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

[[Stephen O. Andersen]] is a senior, renowned environmental expert, working for the EPA, the closest equivalent the USA has to a Ministry of the Environment. Mr. Andersen has been a key player in the work on the Montreal Protocol, an exceptionally successful international environmental treaty that negotiated the elimination of ozone-depleting gases and effectively saved the ozone layer. Andersen is the EPA's director of strategic projects, in the Climate Protection Partnerships Division.

Also from the USA comes [[Ira Magaziner]], head of the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Clinton Climate Initiative | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/what-we-do/clinton-climate-initiative/ | accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCI forms part of the William J. Clinton Foundation (founded by former US president Bill Clinton). The foundation's work includes efforts to cut the costs of climate technology (for renewable energy and energy efficiency) in large cities.

Representing the African continent are the former president of Tanzania, [[Benjamin Mkapa]], and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger [[Aïchatou Mindaoudou]]. Mindaoudou is a well-known figure in the field of international development, and she will be giving a speech at CC9 entitled "What is at stake for women and the planet - climate change and sustainable development in Africa. Business models for poverty alleviation and green growth".

A number of participants from Asia and Europe will also be present at the climate conference.

== Climate Conference 08 ==

Starting out on World Environment Day, the conference gathered 100 exclusively selected international representatives from politics, academia, the private sector and the environmental movement at the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg south of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CC8 | url=http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance | accessdate=2009-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620184329/http://www.cc8.no/index.asp?artikkelid=1416&amp;site=conferance# | archive-date=2011-06-20 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the distinguished speakers were: Ricardo Lagos, former president of Chile, UN Special Envoy on climate change and president of the Club of Madrid; Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the notable report on the economic ramifications of climate change; Göran Persson, former Prime Minister of Sweden who, together with Ricardo Lagos, co-chairs the International Socialist Commission for a Sustainable World Society  Also attending from the Club of Madrid was Jennifer Mary Shipley, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Kjell Magne Bondevik and Gro Harlem Brundtland, both former Prime Ministers of Norway. The Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA set out to organize an ambitious, pro-development, creative and solutions-oriented conference which could act in a joint effort to provide input for the international negotiation process on a new climate agreement.

Negotiations for a post-2012 global climate change agreement were formally launched at the climate summit in Bali last December and are expected to be concluded in Copenhagen in 2009. With this process underway, the Club of Madrid, the Bellona Foundation and Hafslund ASA joined forces to spur ideas for a final agreement that will be both ambitious and realistic, as well as providing predictability in efforts to combat climate change.

Thorough discussions in small working groups enabled the drafting of ambitious, creative and solutions-oriented recommendations in a final statement from the conference. In order to inform the post-2012 negotiations, the aim will be to reach out to both negotiators and policy makers and industry and the business community.

At the Bali summit, it was agreed to concentrate the negotiations on mitigation, adaptation, technology and finance. The CC8 conference «Technology and Finance in Climate Cooperation» focuses specifically on what technology and finance provisions a new agreement on climate change should include.

The co-organizers are convinced that successful outcomes in these fields will be essential to enable ambitious overall emission reduction targets (the overall objective of an agreement) and solve the contradiction between, on the one hand, rich countries’ responsibility for climate change and, on the other hand, the necessity to limit emissions also of emerging economies.

=== Climate Concert ===

Saturday 7 June the marathon "Climate Concert 08" was arranged in the park surrounding the Hafslund Manor in Sarpsborg. Well-known Norwegian bands were on stage. The environmental issues from the Climate Conference 08 coloured all parts of the arrangement; the food served, transportation and power supply.

The artists performing on Climate Conference 08, were [[Bertine Zetlitz]], [[Surferosa]], [[deLillos 85|deLillos'85]], [[Henning Kvitnes]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]], [[Madcon]], [[CC Cowboys]] and [[Ida Maria]].

== Background ==

Against the backdrop of an unprecedented global economic crisis, the next months will be decisive for reaching a politically viable and fair post-2012 climate agreement in Copenhagen 2009.

Few players inside negotiation circles expect developing countries to make significant moves before developed countries have clarified their positions on emission reductions, financing and diffusion of green technology.

Copenhagen must deliver on the human dimension of climate change. It is clear that the poorest, those least responsible, will be most vulnerable to climate change. Countries that have accumulated tremendous economic growth through their historic reliance on fossil fuels must assume a leadership role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, it will be critical to secure the development and diffusion of appropriate, clean technology and the access to necessary financial resources for developing countries to adopt them.

The global crisis constitutes a tremendous opportunity for governments to address the weaknesses of the existing, international financial system but, more importantly, to lay the foundations for the development of a green and sustainable economy. Investing in clean technologies can be key to this process, creating employment opportunities across the globe while addressing the challenge of climate change. In this sense, the adoption of sectoral approaches within the negotiations could, in fact, facilitate technology development and the adoption of best available technologies across regions, between developed and developing countries.

{{Politics of Mali}}
A '''cercle''' is the second level administrative unit in [[Mali]]. Mali is divided into eight [[Regions of Mali|''régions'']] and one capital district ([[Bamako]]); the ''régions'' are subdivided into 49 ''cercles''. These subdivisions bear the name of their principal city.

During [[France|French]] colonial rule in [[Mali]], a cercle was the smallest unit of French political administration that was headed by a [[European ethnic groups|European]] officer. A cercle consisted of several cantons, each of which in turn consisted of several villages. In 1887 the Cercle of [[Bafoulabé]] was the first cercle to be created in Mali. In most of former [[French West Africa]], the term ''cercle'' was changed to [[Prefecture]] or [[Department (country subdivision)|Department]] after independence, but this was not done in Mali.

Some cercles (and the district) were, prior to the 1999 local government reorganisation, further divided into [[Arrondissements of Mali|Arrondissements]], especially in urban areas or the vast northern regions (such as [[Kidal]]), which consisted of a collection of Communes. Since these reforms, cercles are now directly subdivided into rural and urban communes, which in turn are divided in ''Quartiers'' (Quarters, or Villages and encampments in rural areas) which have elected councils at each level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgemali.net/consulte/consulte.php La Délégation Générale aux Elections, Government of Mali:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922085113/http://www.dgemali.net/consulte/consulte.php |date=September 22, 2008 }} database of all registered electors in Mali (2007), includes a hierarchical list of every cercle, commune, and quarter in the nation.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 703 [[Communes of Mali|communes]], 36 ''urban communes'' (including 6 in Bamako District) and 667 ''rural communes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=1999| title= Loi N°99-035/ Du 10 Aout 1999 Portant Creation des Collectivites Territoriales de Cercles et de Regions |publisher=Ministère de l'Administration Territoriales et des Collectivités Locales, République du Mali | url=http://www.matcl.gov.ml/PDF/LoiCreationCercleReg.pdf | language=French }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cercles are listed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2402">The '''circle of equal altitude''' also called circle of position, CoP, is the real line of position in [[celestial navigation]]. It is defined as the locus of the Earth on which an observer sees a star, at a given time, with the same observed altitude.

[[File:Sumner - circle of equal altitude.jpg|thumb|Discovery of the circle of equal altitude - A New and Accurate Method of Finding a Ship's Position at Sea, by Projection on Mercator's Chart, Capt. Thomas H. Sumner, July 1843, Thomas Groom &amp; Company of Boston]]

== Parameters ==
[[File:CoP - Circunferencia de alturas iguales.png|thumb|Parameters of a circle of equal altitude]]
The center of the CoP, is the substellar point or geographical position of the observed body, and its radius is the great circle distance equal to the zenith distance of the body.

* Center = geographical position of the body: (''B'', ''L'') = (''Dec'', ''GHA'')
* Radius = zenith distance: ''zd'' [nm] = 60 ⋅ (90 - ''Ho'')

== Equation ==
The equation links the following variables&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/navigationalalgorithms/papersnavigation Vector equation of the Circle of Position]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The position of the observer: ''B'', ''L''.
* The coordinates of the observed star, its geographical position: ''GHA'', ''Dec''.
* The true altitude of the body: ''Ho''.

'''&lt;math&gt;\sin(Ho) = \sin(B) \cdot \sin(Dec) + \cos(B) \cdot \cos(Dec) \cdot \cos(LHA)\,&lt;/math&gt;'''

Being ''B'' the latitude (+N/S), ''L'' the longitude (+E/-W). ''LHA'' = ''GHA'' + ''L'' is the local hour angle, ''Dec'' and ''GHA'' are the declination and Greenwich hour angle of the star observed. And ''Ho'' is the true or observed altitude, that is, the altitude measured with sextant corrected for dip, refraction, parallax.

== Special cases ==
* Parallel of latitude by Polaris altitude.
* Parallel of latitude by altitude of the sun at noon, or meridian altitude.
* Meridian of longitude known the time and latitude.
* Circle of illumination or terminator

'''Cohors prima Delmatarum''' ("1st Cohort of Dalmatae") was a [[Roman auxiliary]] infantry regiment. It is named after the [[Dalmatae]], an [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]-speaking tribe that inhabited the [[Adriatic]] coastal mountain range of the eponymous [[Dalmatia]]. The ancient geographer [[Strabo]] describes these mountains as extremely rugged, and the Dalmatae as backward and warlike. He claims that they did not use money long after their neighbours adopted it and that they "made war on the Romans for a long time". He also criticises the Dalmatae, a nation of pastoralists, for turning fertile plains into sheep pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo ''Geographia'' VII.5&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the name of the tribe itself is believed to mean "shepherds", derived from the Illyrian word ''delme'' ("sheep").&lt;ref&gt;Spaul (2000) 304&lt;/ref&gt; The final time this people fought against Rome was in the [[Illyrian revolt]] of 6-9 AD. The revolt was started by Dalmatae auxiliary forces and soon spread all over [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]]. The resulting war was described by the Roman writer [[Suetonius]] as the most difficult faced by Rome since the [[Punic Wars]] two centuries earlier. But after the war, the Dalmatae became a loyal and important source of recruits for the Roman army.

According to Holder, a total of 12 ''Cohortes Delmatarum'' appear to have been raised after the suppression of the Illyrian revolt in two series, of 7 and 5 respectively. All these units were in existence by the time of emperor [[Claudius]] (r. 41-54)&lt;ref name="Holder 1980 112"&gt;Holder (1980) 112&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 9 appear to have survived into the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Spaul (2000) 302-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The regiment was probably raised by founder-emperor [[Augustus]] (r. 30BC-14AD) after 9 AD. It was certainly in existence by the time of [[Claudius]] (r. 41-54).&lt;ref name="Holder 1980 112"/&gt; Its early movements are unknown. Holder suggests that the regiment may have taken part in the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] (43) or the suppression of the revolt of [[Boudicca]] (61), but there is no evidence. It first appears in the datable epigraphic record in 122, in [[Britannia]]. It was still there in 138-61, the time of its last datable inscription.&lt;ref name="Spaul 2000 302"&gt;Spaul (2000) 302&lt;/ref&gt; It is attested in the following Roman forts in Britannia: [[High Rochester]], [[Maryport]] (138-61) and [[Chesters]] (138-61).

The names of 12 ''praefecti'' (regimental commanders) are attested. From the locations of their votive or funerary stones, it can be deduced that at least 4 were cantral/southern Italians: from [[Aquino, Italy|Aquino]], [[Benevento|Beneventum]], the city of Rome (c. 120), and [[Tusculum]]. Another was a member of the [[Santones]] Gallic tribe of western [[Gaul]], and one from [[Baláca]] ([[Pannonia]]). In addition, a ''[[centurion|centurio]]'' (infantry officer) is attested.&lt;ref name="Spaul 2000 302"/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Cullen Dunn''' (born 1968) is an American political anthropologist and geographer.  Her work focuses on responses to catastrophic social change, particularly in the post-Soviet world.

==Education==
Dunn holds a Ph.D. in anthropology from [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1998).

==Scholarship==
Broadly summarized, Dunn’s work investigates governance, the state, and the ways in which these processes strive to produce governable subjects. She investigates these topics by examining the ways they are manifest in people’s lived experiences. Though all Dunn’s work deals with these topics, thematically, it can be divided into three bodies of literature: on foreign direct investment (FDI) in [[Poland]] and the former Eastern Bloc more broadly; on global food safety regulation; and, most recently, on forced migration.

===FDI in Poland===
In her book, ''Privatizing Poland'', Dunn examines the attempts at transition from Eastern European planned economies to neoliberal economic models. In doing so, she investigates the importance of governance, discipline, and the production of subjectivities to economic models. Dunn uses the takeover of a Polish baby food canning factory by the American company Gerber as a case study for this investigation. What she finds is that, while there are similarities in the management and organizational techniques applied to industry in the West and the former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, differences in economic structure and planning mechanisms produced rhythms of work and of life generally that were very different in Poland from those in the capitalist West. These rhythms in turn influenced the attitudes and personhood of the Polish people. The result is that introduction of neoliberal capitalism came to be a project not just of privatization and market reform, but rather of cultural transformation, an attempt to shape the Polish people into neoliberal subjects, adapted to the rhythms of life and work under neoliberal capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, E. (2004) ''Privatizing Poland: Baby Food, Big Business, and the Remaking of Labor''.  Ithaca: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Food Safety Regulation===
In her work on global food safety regulation, Dunn examines how the state reacts to outbreaks or changing incidence of food-borne illness. She examines the state’s attempts to control or eliminate these diseases via regulation, while nevertheless adhering to its own foundational, politico-economic principles (e.g. socialist, planned economy; neoliberal capitalism). She identifies the ways in which processes of food production and the regulation thereof work to produce governable subjects by instilling particular values of self-governance or dependence on the state. Dunn also utilizes the presence of disease-causing organisms or outbreaks of food-borne illness as tracers to identify geographical and social spaces in which the state fails to control illness. She investigates how these spaces of chaos or “wildness” can have various causes, sometimes representing a failure of the state to fully penetrate the spaces of every-day life; while in other instances being an integral, reproduced aspect of governance.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Elizabeth. (2007)[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55f7642be4b07229ccbb16e7/t/5665d864b204d5a3248ffe31/1449515108303/Dunn-2007-Escherichia+coli_corporate+discipline_failure_sewer+state.pdf "Escherichia coli, Corporate Discipline, and the Failure of Audit."] ''Space and Polity 11'':35-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Elizabeth Cullen. (2008) [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55f7642be4b07229ccbb16e7/t/5665d84db204d5a3248ffcc8/1449515085635/Dunn-2008-Postsocialist+spores.pdf “Postsocialist Spores: Disease, Bodies and the State in the Republic of Georgia.”]  ''American Ethnologist 35''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced Migration===
Much of Dunn’s work on forced migration has looked more specifically at the plight of [[internally displaced person]]s(IDPs) in the republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In this work, Dunn builds on scholarship that has critically examined the phenomenon of humanitarian aid – its penchant for providing immediate aid rather than long-term support, the resultant inadequacy of ‘standardized’ aid packages, its responsibility to local elites and foreign donors, and the divisive question of aid in relation to politics. Examining these questions herself, and using them as a foundation, she identifies how humanitarian aid functions as a condition, keeping the ‘recipients’ of aid in a state of limbo, between the past and the future, unsure of what to expect from the future, and therefore unable to act in the present. Finally, she investigates the ways in which this condition, constantly reproduced by the very structures which claim to provide stability and relief, in fact transforms the recipients of aid into easily governable subjects, beholden to a system that insists on maintaining their physical lives, while denying them the solid footing from which to end their reliance on this same system.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, E. (in preparation). ''Unsettled: Displacement, Aid and the Problem of Existence in Postwar Georgia''.  Ithaca: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating with her PhD, Dunn accepted a fellowship at the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]] from 1999-2000. Later that year, she received a joint appointment as assistant professor in the Department of Geography and the Program in International Affairs at the [[University of Colorado]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], CO. In 2006 she accepted a fellowship to [[Yale University]]’s Center for Agrarian Studies. She remained in her position as assistant professor until 2008, when she was promoted to the position of associate professor in the same departments at University of Colorado. In 2014, Dunn moved to her current position as Associate Professor in the Departments of Geography and International Studies at Indiana University, [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. In 2015, she received a fellowship at [[Copenhagen University]]’s Department of Comparative Cultural and Regional Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elizabethcullendunn.com/page-cv/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Combés''' (1620 – 1665) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] priest who established Christian monasteries in the [[Philippines]] in the 17th century.

== Life ==
Combés was born in [[Zaragoza]] (Spain) in 1620. When he was twelve, he joined the [[Jesuit]] order as a [[novice]] at [[Tarragona]], harbor city near in Catalonia. Before finishing his priesthod, after only six years of study, he expressed the desire to become part of the expedition to the Philippine Islands. He was assigned to [[Mexico]], and from there he joined a group of Roman Catholic missionaries bound for the [[East Indies]].

In 1643, eleven years after entering the Jesuits, together with forty-six other friars he was sent to the Philippines in an expedition by [[Diego López Pacheco, 7th Duke of Escalona|Diego de Bobadilla]]. Combés finished his theological studies in the Philippines, and was ordained as a Jesuit in 1645. He was assigned to [[Archdiocese of Zamboanga|Zamboanga]] in [[Mindanao]] where he ministered for more than a decade to the religious needs of the natives. In the twelve years that he served there he grew to acquire strategic function, and prestige as a leader, becoming ambassador to the Muslim chieftains, among them Sultan Corralat, and the sultans of [[Jolo]].

He traveled to [[Manila]] in 1657, and stayed there for two years. He was assigned to [[Leyte]] where he remained for three years. He gained deep insights into the history, the customs and traditions, and the language of the island.

Combés was again recalled to Manila in 1662. Sensing the decline in the Spanish hold on the Muslim areas of Mindanao, he tried to persuade the Spanish government, and religious authorities to strengthen or hold on government fortifications in the island.

While on voyage to Madrid, and then to Rome as [[Procurator (Catholic Church)|procurator]] of the Jesuit order, Combés died on board on December 29, 1665. He was 45 years old.

Combés wrote a book, ''Historia de las Islas de Mindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes'' ... (Madrid, Herederos de Pablo de Val, 1667) that contains a three-paragraph section on the voyage of Fernão de Magalhães (''i.e.'' [[Ferdinand Magellan]]) in Philippine waters in March–April 1521. It talks of Magellan and his fleet anchoring in [[Butuan]] and planting a cross at a mountain there. From Butuan, Magellan and crew sail for Cebu making a brief stopover at an island named "Limasaua". Today, Combés story is seen differently. Instead of anchoring at Butuan, Magellan's fleet is anchored at Limasaua. A mass, which is not mentioned in Combes' story, is held at Limasaua. This phantom mass is celebrated in the Philippines every year and the island Limasaua (now universally spelled with a w in place of u, "[[Limasawa]]") is known as the site of the "''First mass in the Philippines''".

[[File:1870 Index Chart to GTS India-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A map showing the triangles and transects used in the survey, produced in 1870]]
The '''Great Trigonometrical Survey''' was a project which aimed to measure the entire [[Indian subcontinent]] with scientific precision. It was begun in 1802 by the infantry officer [[William Lambton]], under the auspices of the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;Gill, B. (2001); "THE BIG MAN. Surveying Sir George Everest", in: ''Professional Surveyor Magazine'', Vol. 21 Nr 2. Retrieved [http://www.krcmar.ca/sites/default/files/2000_Winter_The%20Big%20Man-%20Surveying%20Sir%20George_1.pdf online] 8 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of his successor, [[George Everest]], the project was made a responsibility of the [[Survey of India]]. Everest was succeeded by [[Andrew Scott Waugh]] and after 1861 the project was led by [[James Walker (Surveyor General)|James Walker]], who saw the first completion of it in 1871.

Among the many accomplishments of the Survey were the demarcation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] territories in [[India]] and the measurement of the height of the [[Himalaya]]n giants: [[Mount Everest|Everest]], [[K2]], and [[Kanchenjunga]].  The Survey had an enormous scientific impact as well, being responsible for one of the first accurate [[grade measurement|measurements]] of a section of an arc of [[longitude]], and for measurements of the [[Vertical deflection|geodesic anomaly]] which led to the development of the theories of [[isostasy]].

== History ==
[[File:GTS Peninsula Asiatic Researches.jpg|thumb|left|The first triangulations across the Peninsula]]
From its inception in 1600 to the beginning of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company gained more territory on the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; With the acquisition of new territory, it employed several explorers and cartographers to provide maps and other information on its territories, most notably [[James Rennell]], from 1767 in Bengal. As Rennell proceeded making maps, some serious flaws in them surfaced, based on a lack of precise measurements.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; In 1800, shortly after the English victory over [[Tipu Sultan]], William Lambton, an infantry soldier with experience in surveying proposed to remedy precisely that, through a series of [[triangulation]]s initially through the newly acquired territory of Mysore and eventually across the entire subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An account of the Trigonometrical Operations in crossing the peninsula of India, and connecting Fort St. George with Mangalore| author=Lambton, William| pages=290–384|url=https://archive.org/stream/asiaticresearche10asia#page/n307/mode/2up| journal=Asiatic Researches; or Transactions of the Society Instituted in Bengal for inquiring into the History and Antiquities|year=1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chain is housed under shade to reduce errors due to thermal expansion, and is aligned using a boning telescope.]]
The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India started on 10 April 1802 with the measurement of a baseline near [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Major Lambton selected the flat plains with [[St. Thomas Mount]] at the north end and Perumbauk hill at the southern end. The baseline was {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} long. Lieutenant Kater was despatched to find high vantage points on the hills of the west so that the coastal points of [[Tellicherry]] and [[Kannur|Cannanore]] could be connected. The high hills chosen were [[Ezhimala Hill|Mount Delly]] and [[Tadiandamol]]. The distance from coast to coast was {{convert|360|mi|km}} and this survey line was completed in 1806.&lt;ref name=markham&gt;{{cite book| first=Clements| last=Markham| authorlink=Clements Markham| title=A Memoir On The Indian Surveys| url=https://archive.org/details/memoirontheindia025502mbp/| year=1878| publisher=London. W H Allen And Co.| edition=2| accessdate=2009-03-01| page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East India Company thought that this project would take about 5 years but eventually it took nearly 70 years well past the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and the end of [[company rule in India]]. Because of the extent of the land to be surveyed, the surveyors did not [[Triangulation|triangulate]] the whole of India but instead created what they called a "gridiron" of triangulation chains running from North to South and East to West.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; At times the survey party numbered 700 people.&lt;ref&gt;''Bluesci: Cambridge university science magazine'', 29 January 2011,[http://www.bluesci.org/?p=2028- "History: The Great Trigonometrical Survey"], Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ramsden_zenith_sector.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Zenith sector]] was an upward facing telescope with accurate angle measurement scales. A star close to the zenith of known declination from the pole star was used to determine latitude as direct measurement of the pole star could be affected by refraction.]] 
The Trigonometrical Survey was conducted independently of other surveys, notably the topographical and revenue surveys. In 1875, the decision was taken that the Survey budget should be reduced from 240,000 to 200,000 pounds. This resulted in a reorganization under Surveyor-General Colonel J.T. Walker to amalgamate the Great Trigonometrical, Topographical and Revenue Surveys into the Survey of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=39–40|title= A memoir of the Indian Surveys, 1875-1890| author=Black, Charles E.D.| year=1891| place=London| publisher=Secretary of State for India in Council| url=https://archive.org/stream/memoironindiansu00blac#page/39/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments and methods used ==
[[File:Great trignometric Survey ridge stone.jpg|thumb|Great trigonometric Survey ridge stone present in [[Bisle]] village, Karnataka]]
Triangulation surveys were based on a few carefully measured baselines and a series of angles. The initial baseline was measured with great care, since the accuracy of the subsequent survey was critically dependent upon it. Various corrections were applied, principally temperature. An especially accurate folding chain was used, laid on horizontal tables, all shaded from the sun and with a constant tension. The early surveys made use of large and bulky theodolites made by William Carey, a [[Zenith sector]] made by [[Jesse Ramsden]] and {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} chains. Later surveys used more compact theodolites. 
[[File:Survey_towers_GTS.jpg|thumb|Survey towers used by [[George Everest]] to house the instruments.]]

Accurate instruments could not always be purchased through the standard system of government contract and Everest personally supervised the construction of instruments. He had a maker, Henry Barrow, set up an instrument company in Calcutta. For a while Barrow was succeeded by Syed Mohsin from Arcot and after his death the instruments were supplied by Cooke from York.&lt;ref name=strahan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strahan, C. |year=1903 |title=The Survey of India |url=https://archive.org/stream/professionalpape28grea#page/n211/mode/2up |journal=Professional papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers |volume=28|pages=141–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005abc_47.pdf |author=Insley, Jane |journal=Indian Journal of History of Science |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=1995 |title=Making mountains out of molehills?

=== Correcting deviations ===
To achieve the highest accuracy a number of corrections were applied to all distances calculated from simple trigonometry:

A '''green roof''' or '''living roof''' is a [[roof]] of a [[building]] that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a [[Waterproofing#Construction waterproofing|waterproofing membrane]]. It may also include additional layers such as a [[root barrier]] and [[drainage]] and [[irrigation]] systems.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Rodriguez Droguett, B. (2011). Sustainability assessment of green infrastructure practices for stormwater management: A comparative emergy analysis (M.S.).

Rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat [[greywater]].&lt;ref&gt;Özyavuz, Murat, B. Karakaya, and D. G. Ertin. "The Effects of Green Roofs on Urban Ecosystems."

=== Water management ===
Green roofs can reduce [[stormwater]] runoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roofgreening.ca/content/Improved_Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706202511/http://www.roofgreening.ca/content/Improved_Final.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; via [[water-wise gardening]] techniques. Green roofs play significant role in retrofitting the [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|Low Impact Development]] (LID) practices in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafique|first=Muhammad|last2=Kim|first2=Reeho|date=2017-06-20|title=Retrofitting the Low Impact Development Practices into Developed Urban areas Including Barriers and Potential Solution|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0020/geo-2017-0020.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=240–254|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0020|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study presented at the Green Roofs for Healthy Cities Conference in June 2004, cited by the EPA, found water runoff was reduced by over 75% during rainstorms.

Water is stored by the roof's substrate and then taken up by the plants, from which it is returned to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation.

Green roofs decrease the total amount of runoff and slow the rate of runoff from the roof.  It has been found that they can retain up to 75% of rainwater, gradually releasing it back into the atmosphere via [[condensation]] and [[transpiration]], while retaining pollutants in their soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-05/documents/reducing_urban_heat_islands_ch_3.pdf|title=Green Roofs – Heat Island Effect|author=U.S. EPA|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many green roofs are installed to comply with local regulations and government fees, often regarding [[stormwater]] runoff management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Green Roofs : Ecological Design and Construction|author=Earth Pledge|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|year=2005|location=Atglen, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In areas with [[combined sewer|combined sewer-stormwater systems]], heavy storms can [[sanitary sewer overflow|overload]] the [[water treatment|wastewater system]] and cause it to flood, dumping raw sewage into the local waterways. Often, phosphorus and nitrogen are in this category of environmentally harmful substances even though they are stimulating to the growth of plant life and agriculture.  When these substances are added to a system, it can create mass biological activity since they are considered limiting factors of plant growth and by adding more of them to a system, it allows for more plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/np/Phos&amp;Eutro2/agphoseutro2ed.pdf|title=Agricultural Phosphorus and Eutrophication|last=Sharpley|first=A.N.|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevation 314, a new development in Washington, D.C. uses green roofs to filter and store some of its storm water on site, avoiding the need for expensive underground sand filters to meet D.C.

=== Ecological benefits ===
Green roofs create natural [[habitat]] as part of an [[urban wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roofgreening.ca/content/Habitat_Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706202518/http://www.roofgreening.ca/content/Habitat_Final.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in high-rise urban settings as tall as 19 stories, it has been found that green roofs can attract beneficial insects, birds, bees and butterflies.  A recent list of the bee species recorded from green roofs (worldwide) highlights both the diversity of species, but also the (expected) bias towards small ground-nesting species (Hofmann and Renner, 2017). Rooftop greenery complements wild areas by providing stepping stones for songbirds, migratory birds and other wildlife facing [[habitat destruction|shortages of natural habitat]].

Green roofs also serve as a [[green wall]], filtering [[pollutant]]s and [[carbon dioxide]] out of the air, helping to lower rates of diseases such as asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roofgreening.ca/content/AirQuality_Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706202524/http://www.roofgreening.ca/content/AirQuality_Final.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also filter pollutants and heavy metals out of rainwater.

=== Carbon sequestration ===
An additional environmental benefit of greens roofs is the ability to sequester carbon. Carbon is the main component of plant matter and is naturally absorbed by plant tissue. The carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2100–2110"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=D. Bradley|date=2011-08-01|title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749110004859|journal=Environmental Pollution|series=Selected papers from the conference Urban Environmental Pollution: Overcoming Obstacles to Sustainability and Quality of Life (UEP2010), 20–23 June 2010, Boston, USA|volume=159|issue=8–9|pages=2100–2110|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029|pmid=21074914}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on green roofs in Michigan and Maryland found the above ground biomass and below ground substrate stored on average between 168 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and 107 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; . Variations occurred among the different species of plant used.  Substrate carbon content averaged 913 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and after the subtraction of the original carbon content the total sequestration was 378 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Getter 7564–7570"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getter|first=Kristin L.|last2=Rowe|first2=D.

In a study done in Michigan above ground sequestration ranged from 64 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; to 239 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for S. acre and S album.&lt;ref name="Getter 7564–7570" /&gt; Also, by increasing the substrate depth would allow for more area of carbon storage and diversify the types of plants with greater potential of carbon storage. The direct carbon sequestration techniques and methods can be measured and accounted for. Green roofs also indirectly reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2100–2110" /&gt; Buildings in the US account for 38% of the total carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/green-building-facts|title=Green Building Facts {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|website=www.usgbc.org|access-date=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A model supported by the U.S. Department of Energy found a 2 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 9-11% reduction in natural gas when implementing green roofs.

A properly designed and installed extensive green-roof system can cost $108–248/m2 ($10–23/ft2) while an intensive green roof costs $355–2368/m2 ($33–220/ft2) however, since most of the materials used to build the green roof can be salvaged it is estimated that the cost of replacing a green roof is generally one third of the initial installation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sproul|first1=Julian|last2=Wan|first2=Man Pun|last3=Mandel|first3=Benjamin H.|last4=Rosenfeld|first4=Arthur H.|title=Economic comparison of white, green, and black flat roofs in the United States|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=March 2014|volume=71|pages=20–27|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.11.058|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the initial cost of installing a green roof in mind, there are many financial benefits that accompany green roofing.
*Green roofing can extend the lifespan of a roof by over 200% by covering the waterproofing membrane with growing medium and vegetation, this shields the membrane from ultra-violet radiation and physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Timothy|author2=Keeler|title=Life-cycle cost–benefit analysis of extensive vegetated roof systems|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=May 2008|volume=87|issue=3|pages=350–363|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.01.024|pmid=17368704|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479707000436|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, Penn State University’s Green Roof Research Center expects the lifespan of a roof to increase by as much as three times after greening the roof.&lt;ref name="hortweb1" /&gt;
*It is estimated that the installation of a green roof could increase the real estate value of an average house by about 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bianchini|first=Fabricio|author2=Hewage|title=Probabilistic social cost-benefit analysis for green roofs: A lifecycle approach|journal=Building and Environment|date=December 2012|volume=58|pages=152–162|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.07.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013231200193X|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction in energy use is an important property of green roofing.  By improving the thermal performance of a roof, green roofing allows buildings to better retain their heat during the cooler winter months while reflecting and absorbing solar radiation during the hotter summer months, allowing buildings to remain cooler.  A study conducted by Environment Canada found a 26% reduction in summer cooling needs and a 26% reduction in winter heat losses when a green roof is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenroofs.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=40 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502015516/http://www.greenroofs.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=40 |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With respect to hotter summer weather, green roofing is able to reduce the solar heating of a building by reflecting 27% of solar radiation, absorbing 60% by the vegetation through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and absorbing the remaining 13% into the growing medium. Such mitigation of solar radiation has been found to reduce building temperatures by up to 20&amp;nbsp;°C and reduce energy needs for air-conditioning by 25% to 80%.  This reduction in energy required to cool a building in the summer is accompanied by a reduction in energy required to heat a building in the winter, thus reducing the energy requirements of the building year-round which allows the building temperature to be controlled at a lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saadatian|first=Omidreza|author2=Sopian, K. |author3=Salleh, E. |author4=Lim, C.

*Depending on the region in which a green roof is installed, incentives may be available in the form of stormwater tax reduction, grants, or rebates.  The regions where these incentives will most likely be found are areas where failing storm water management infrastructure is in place, urban heat island effect has significantly increased the local air temperature, or areas where environmental contaminants in the storm water runoff is of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Rugh, C.

==Disadvantages==
[[File:City University of Hong Kong Hu Fa Kuang Sports Centre roof collapses site on 21st May 2016.jpg|thumb|The addition of a green roof to an existing structure led to this collapse at the [[City University of Hong Kong]].]]

The main disadvantage of green roofs is that the initial cost of installing a green roof can be double that of a normal roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Getter|first=Kristin L.|author2=Rowe, D. Bradley|title=The Role of Extensive Green Roofs in Sustainable Development|journal=HortScience|year=2006|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1276–1285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on what kind of green roof it is, the maintenance costs could be higher, but some types of green roof have little or no ongoing cost. Some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the [[waterproofing]] system of the structure, both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane. Another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include [[Pest (organism)|pest]] insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows.

The additional mass of the soil substrate and retained water places a large strain on the structural support of a building.  This makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented due to a lack of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Currie|first=Beth|author2=Bass, B.|title=Estimates of air pollution mitigation with green plants and green roofs using the UFORE model|journal=Urban Ecosystems|date=December 2008|volume=11|issue=4|pages=409–422|doi=10.1007/s11252-008-0054-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world.  Some existing buildings cannot be retrofitted with certain kinds of green roof because of the weight load of the substrate and vegetation exceeds permitted [[static load]]ing.

Green roofs can be categorized as intensive, semi-intensive, or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium and the amount of maintenance they need. Extensive green roofs traditionally support 10-25 pounds of vegetation per square foot (50–120&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eot.state.ma.us/smartgrowth/07toolkit/LID/regional_planning/LID/green_roofs.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703122305/http://www.eot.state.ma.us/smartgrowth/07toolkit/LID/regional_planning/LID/green_roofs.html |date=3 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while intensive roofs support 80-150 pounds of vegetation per square foot (390–730&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raingardennetwork.com/greenroofs.htm |title=Green Roof |publisher=Raingardennetwork.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[roof garden]]s, which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns, are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive, requiring irrigation, feeding, and other maintenance.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive green roofs, by contrast, are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance, perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth.  Extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance.&lt;ref name="Seattle, 2007" /&gt;  They can be established on a very thin layer of soil (most use specially formulated composts): even a thin layer of [[Mineral wool|rockwool]] laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of ''[[Sedum]]'' species and [[moss]]es.  Some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements. To protect the roof, a waterproofing membrane is often used, which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness, ponding water, high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots, fungi and bacterial organisms.&lt;ref name="Green (Planted) Roofs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Green (Planted) roofs |author=The Vinyl Roofing Division of the Chemical Fabrics &amp; Film Association |date=22 June 2012 |url=http://vinylroofs.org/resources/green-planted-roofs/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in green roof technology have led to the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of green roof types. Comprehensive green roofs bring the most advantageous qualities of extensive and intensive green roofs together. Comprehensive green roofs support plant varieties typically seen in intensive green roofs at the depth and weight of an extensive green roof system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Green Roofs |author=Omni Ecosystems |date=9 March 2013 |url=http://www.omni-ecosystems.com/green-roof |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209012756/http://www.omni-ecosystems.com/green-roof/ |archivedate=9 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important distinction is between pitched green roofs and flat green roofs.  Pitched [[sod roof]]s, a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, tend to be of a simpler design than flat green roofs.  This is because the pitch of the roof reduces the risk of water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.

==History==
[[File:Authentic Viking recreation.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Re-creation of [[Viking]] houses in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]]]
[[File:Heidal.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sod roofs on 18th-century farm buildings in [[Heidal]], Norway.]]In ancient times green roofs consisted of cave-like structures or [[sod roof]]s covered with earth and plants commonly used for agriculture, dwelling, and ceremonial purposes. These early shelters provided protection from the elements, good insulation during the winter months, and a cool location in the summer. Unfortunately for modern conveniences, these were neither waterproof nor was there any system to keep out unwanted burrowing wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/history-of-green-roofs | title=History of Green Roof Technology, Green Walls, Living Walls}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{disputed-inline|for=trad birchbark underlayer|date=October 2018}}

[[File:MEC's green roof among others.jpg|thumb|200px|left|On the green roof of the [[Mountain Equipment Co-op]] store in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.]]
Modern green roofs, which are made of a system of manufactured layers deliberately placed over roofs to support growing medium and vegetation, are a relatively new phenomenon.  However, green roofs or [[sod roof]]s in northern [[Scandinavia]] have been around for centuries.  The modern trend started when green roofs were developed in Germany in the 1960s, and has since spread to many countries.  Today, it is estimated that about 10% of all German roofs have been “greened”.&lt;ref name="hortweb1"&gt;{{cite web

A number of European Countries have very active associations promoting green roofs, including Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, the UK, and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efb-greenroof.eu |title=European Federation of Green Roof Associations – EFB |publisher=Efb-greenroof.eu |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Germany is the first country started to develope green roof systems and marketed on a large scale.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The City of Linz in Austria has been paying developers to install green roofs since 1983, and in Switzerland it has been a federal law since the late 1990s.  In the UK, their uptake has been slow, but a number of cities have developed policies to encourage their use, notably London and Sheffield.

Green roofs are also becoming increasingly popular in North America, although they are not as common as in some parts of Europe. Numerous North American cities offer tax incentives to developers who integrate green roofs in their buildings. Toronto and San Francisco legally mandate new buildings to include green roofs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=83520621f3161410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=3a7a036318061410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD |title=City of Toronto Green Roof Bylaw |publisher=City of Toronto |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sf-planning.org/san-francisco-better-roofs |title=San Francisco Better Roofs |publisher=City of San Francisco Planning Department |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooftop [[greywater treatment|water purification]] is also being implemented in green roofs.  These forms of green roofs are actually [[Waste stabilization pond|treatment ponds]] built into the rooftops.  They are built either from a simple substrate (as being done in [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eukn.org/eukn/themes/Urban_Policy/Urban_environment/Environmental_sustainability/dongtan-eco-city_1348.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016104747/http://www.eukn.org/eukn/themes/Urban_Policy/Urban_environment/Environmental_sustainability/dongtan-eco-city_1348.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or with plant-based ponds (as being done by WaterWorks UK Grow System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwuk.co.uk/grow.htm |title=Water Works UK : Green Roof Water Recycling System (GROW) |website=Wwuk.co.uk |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Waterzuiveren.be&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterzuiveren.be/concepten/dakvijvers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913204124/http://www.waterzuiveren.be/concepten/dakvijvers |archivedate=13 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants used include [[calamus (palm)|calamus]], [[Menyanthes trifoliata]], [[Mentha aquatica]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toontoelen.be/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=684&amp;Itemid=58 |title=Dakvijvers |website=Toontoelen.be |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Several studies have been carried out in Germany since the 1970s. Berlin is one of the most important centers of green roof research in Germany. Particularly in the last 10 years, much more research has begun. About ten green roof research centers exist in the US and activities exist in about 40 countries. In a recent study on the impacts of green infrastructure, in particular green roofs in the Greater Manchester area, researchers found that adding green roofs can help keep temperatures down, particularly in urban areas: “adding green roofs to all buildings can have a dramatic effect on maximum surface temperatures, keeping temperatures below the 1961–1990 current form case for all time periods and emissions scenarios.  Roof greening makes the biggest difference…where the building proportion is high and the evaporative fraction is low.  Thus, the largest difference was made in the town centers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gill | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Handley | first2 = J.F. | last3 = Ennos | first3 = A.R. | last4 = Pauleit | first4 = S. | title = Adapting Cities for climate Change: The Role of the Green Infrastructure | url = | journal = Built Environment | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 122–123 | doi=10.2148/benv.33.1.115| year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brown roofs==
Industrial [[brownfield]] sites can be valuable ecosystems, supporting rare species of plants, animals and invertebrates.  Increasingly in demand for redevelopment, these habitats are under threat.  "Brown roofs", also known as "biodiverse roofs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brownroofs.co.uk/brown-roof-biodiversity.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017120946/http://www.brownroofs.co.uk/brown-roof-biodiversity.php |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; can partly mitigate this loss of habitat by covering the flat roofs of new developments with a layer of locally sourced material.  Construction techniques for brown roofs are typically similar to those used to create flat green roofs, the main difference being the choice of growing medium (usually locally sourced rubble, gravel, soil, etc...) to meet a specific biodiversity objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenroofs.org/grtok/materials_browse.php?id=59&amp;what=view |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319200626/http://www.greenroofs.org/grtok/materials_browse.php?id=59&amp;what=view |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, it is common to use alluvial gravels from the foundations; in London, a mix of brick rubble and some concrete has been used.  The original idea was to allow the roofs to self-colonise with plants, but they are sometimes seeded to increase their biodiversity potential in the short term. Such practices are derided by purists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brownroofs.co.uk/brown-roof-habitats.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102070717/http://www.brownroofs.co.uk/brown-roof-habitats.php |archivedate=2 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roofs are colonised by spiders and insects (many of which are becoming extremely rare in the UK as such sites are developed) and provide a feeding site for insectivorous birds.  [[Laban Dance Centre|Laban]], a centre for contemporary dance in London, has a brown roof specifically designed to encourage the nationally rare [[black redstart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livingroofs.org/livingpages/caselaban.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705085128/http://www.livingroofs.org/livingpages/caselaban.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A green roof, 160m above ground level, and claimed to be the highest in the UK and Europe "and probably in the world" to act as nature reserve, is on the Barclays Bank HQ in [[Canary Wharf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/aug/12/conservationandendangeredspecies.uknews | title = Wildlife flourishes 32 floors above the Thames | publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed combining the principles of green and brown roofs, it is already home to a range of rare invertebrates.

==Examples by country==
===Australia===
Green roofs have been increasing in popularity in Australia over the past 10 years.  Some of the early examples include the Freshwater Place residential tower in Melbourne (2002) with its Level 10 rooftop Half Acre Garden, CH2 building housing the Melbourne City Council (2006) – Australia’s first 6-star Green Star Design commercial office building as certified by the [[Green Building Council of Australia]], and Condor Tower (2005) with a 75-square-metre lawn on the 4th floor.

In 2010, the largest Australian green roof project was announced.  The Victorian Desalination Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquasure.com.au|title=Home|website=www.aquasure.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; will have a “living tapestry” of 98,000 Australian indigenous plants over a roof area spanning more than 26,000 square metres.  The roof will form part of the desalination plant’s sophisticated roof system, designed to blend the building into the landscape, and provide acoustic protection, corrosion resistance, thermal control, and reduced maintenance.  The green roof was designed by ASPECT Studios, ARM / pecvkvonhartel architecture, and will be installed by Fytogreen Australia.

Since 2008, City Councils and influential business groups in Australia have become active promoting the benefits of green roofs.  “The Blueprint to Green Roof Melbourne” is one program being run by the Committee for Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.growingup.org.au/|title=Best Remodeling Ideas To Increase Your Home's Value -|website=Best Remodeling Ideas To Increase Your Home’s Value}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 ecological artist Lloyd Godman, with Stuart Jones and Grant Harris in a ground breaking experiment installed Tillandsia plants at level 92, 91, 65 and 56 on Eureka Tower. The air plants, are extremely light, grow with no soil or watering system and have survived for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/extreme-gardening-on-the-92nd-floor-of-the-eureka-tower-20150323-1m45sm.html|title=Extreme gardening on the 92nd floor of the Eureka Tower|first=Aisha|last=Dow|date=23 March 2015|publisher=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]] installed a six-acre living roof of indigenous plants and grasses on its West building, making it the largest green roof in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenroofs.com/projects/pview.php?id=545 |title=Projects - Vancouver Convention Centre Expansion Project |website=Greenroofs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new [[Canadian War Museum]] in [[Ottawa]], opened in 2005, also features a grass-covered roof.

During the renovation of the [[Hamilton City Hall]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] that spanned from 2007 to 2010, many efforts were taken to enhance the environmentally friendly nature of the structure, which included the addition of a grass-covered roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan McGreal |url=http://raisethehammer.org/article/1092/city_hall_reno_photo_tour:_part_2 |title=City Hall Reno Photo Tour: Part 2 |publisher=Raise the Hammer |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costa Rica===
Living green roofs have been built and grown at Saint Michael's Sustainable Community since 2012. Native plants, mostly flowers chosen for the environment, maximum shade and mass provide a colorful and functional living roof. The community has the largest number of green roofs in the country.

===Egypt===
In [[Egypt]], soil-less agriculture is used to grow plants on the roofs of buildings.  No soil is placed directly on the roof itself, thus eliminating the need for an insulating layer; instead, plants are grown on wooden tables.  Vegetables and fruit are the most popular candidates, providing a fresh, healthy source of food that is free from pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/745/en2.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; May your roof be green |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=8 June 2005 |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703190639/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/745/en2.htm |archivedate=3 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more advanced method, ([[aquaponics]]), being used experimentally in Egypt, is farming fish next to plants in a closed cycle.  This allows the plants to benefit from the ammonia excreted by the fish, helping the plants to grow better and at the same time eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish, because the plants help to keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia.  The fish also get some nutrients from the roots of the plants.

===Finland===
In Finland, green roofs are still scarce. Some experimental green roofs have been built in big cities. However, the capital city of Helsinki has published guidelines for enhancing the building of green roofs in the city. There is on-going research on the topic as the conditions in the southern Europe are very different from those in the north and knowledge acquired there can't be directly applied to colder climates. The fifth dimension - [https://www.researchgate.net/project/Fifth-Dimension-Green-Roofs-and-Walls-in-Urban-Areas-research-program Green roofs and walls in urban areas -research program] aims to produce high-level scientific and broadly applicable knowledge on optimal green roof and -wall solutions in Finland.

===Germany===
Long-held green roof traditions started in the early industrialization period more than 100 years ago exist in Germany.  In the 1970s, green roof technology was elevated to the next level. Serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions, preferably with living plants. Modern green roof technology with high performance, lightweight materials were utilized to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load. In the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in Germany while it was practically unknown in any other country in the world. In Stuttgart, with one of the most innovative Department of Parks and Recreation and with the worlds oldest horticultural Universities, modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale.

With the first green roof industry boom in Germany there were quality issues recorded. The FLL formed a committee that is focused on modern green roof technology. FLL stands for Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau e.V. (FLL)or in English: The German Landscape Research, Development and Construction Society. The FLL is an independent non-profit organization. It was founded in 1975 by eight professional organizations for “the improvement of environmental conditions through the advancement and dissemination of plant research and its planned applications”. The FLL green roof working group is only one of 40 committees which have published a long list of guidelines and labor instructions. Some of these guidelines also available in English including the German FLL-Guideline for the  Planning, Execution and Upkeep of Green-Roof Sites. The results of the research and synthesis done by FLL members are constantly updated and promulgated utilizing the same principles which govern the compilation of DIN standards and are published as either guiding principles or labor instructions.

The current Green Roof Guideline was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/_literature_98993/Introduction_to_the_German_FLL_-_Guideline_for_Green_Roofs_2011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041742/http://www.greenrooftechnology.com/_literature_98993/Introduction_to_the_German_FLL_-_Guideline_for_Green_Roofs_2011 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today most elements of the German FLL are part of standards and guidelines around the world (FM Global, ASTM, NRCA, SPRI etc.).

Fachvereinigung Bauwerksbegrünung (FBB) was founded in 1990 as the second green roof association after DDV (Deutscher Dachgaertner Verband) in 1985. FBB was founded as an open forum for manufacturers and planners, merchants and operators in 1990. The organization was born from the then-visionary idea of understanding the relationship between nature and constructions not as oppositional, but as an opportunity. Both the green roofing and conventional roofing industries are equally represented.
The FBB has developed to become an innovative lobbying group with a strong market presence, internationally known through its cooperation with other European associations. Today, approximately 100 member companies use the multifaceted services offered by FBB, which offers a greater degree of market expertise and competitiveness. "Kompetenz im Markt".

Today, about 10,000,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or 100,000,000 square feet) of new green roofs are being constructed each year. According latest studies about ¾ of these are extensive; the last ¼ are roof gardens. The cities with the most green roofs in Germany are Berlin and [[Stuttgart]].  Surveys about the status of regulation are done by the FBB.  Nearly one third of all German cities have regulations to support green-roof and rain-water technology.  Green-roof research institutions are located in several cities as including [[Hannover]], Berlin, [[Geisenheim]] and [[Neubrandenburg]].

Germany is the country with the most green roofs in the world and it is the country with the most advanced knowledge in modern green roof technology. Green roofs in Germany are part of the 2 –3 years apprentice educations system of landscaping professionals. Since green roof are common knowledge and common sense it is interesting to take a look at the [[:de:Dachbegrünung|German Wikipedia page for green roofs]] – there is no need to describe projects, case studies or related research. The green roof technology was implemented before the internet age.

Studies of the thermodynamics of the roof in September 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mech.ntua.gr/gr/staff/DEP/rogdakis_gr |title=Σχολή Μηχανολόγων Μηχανικών Ε.Μ.Π. – Μέλος ΔΕΠ |publisher=Mech.ntua.gr |accessdate=25 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502231758/http://www.mech.ntua.gr/gr/staff/DEP/rogdakis_gr |archivedate=2 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In further studies, in August 2009, energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation.  The ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares.  The oikostegi covers 650&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, equalling 52% of the roof space and 8% of the total floor space.  Despite this, energy savings totalling €5,630 per annum were recorded, which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oikosteges.gr/index.php/greenroofs/research |title=Μελέτες |publisher=Oikosteges.gr |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional observation and conclusion of the study was that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months between the first and second study.  This suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further.  The study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras, a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof, such as butterflies, honey bees and ladybirds. Obviously this was not the case before installation.  Finally, the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of Constitution Square, in Athens, Greece had been improved by the oikostegi.

[[Sod roof]]s are frequently found on traditional farmhouses and farm buildings in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenroofs.com/Greenroofs101/history.htm |title=Greenroofs101: History |publisher=Greenroofs.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has one of Europe's oldest green roofs, created in 1914 at the Moos lake water-treatment plant, [[Wollishofen]], [[Zürich]].  Its filter tanks have {{convert|30000|m2|sqft|}} of flat concrete roofs.  To keep the interior cool and prevent bacterial growth in the filtration beds, a drainage layer of gravel and a 15-cm (6-in) layer of soil was spread over the roofs, which had been waterproofed with [[asphalt]].  A meadow developed from seeds already present in the soil; it is now a haven for many plant species, some of which are now otherwise extinct in the district, most notably 6,000 ''Orchis morio'' ([[green-winged orchid]]).  More recent Swiss examples can be found at Klinikum 1 and Klinikum 2, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] Hospitals of [[Basel]], and the [[Sihlpost]] platform at Zürich's main railway station.

===Sweden===
What is claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenroof.se/?pid=38&amp;sub=20 |title=Green Roof – Augustenborg's Botanical Roof Garden – History |publisher=Greenroof.se |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the world's first green roof [[botanical garden]] was set up in [[Augustenborg, Malmö|Augustenborg]], [[Malmö]] in May 1999.  The International Green Roof Institute (IGRI) opened to the public in April 2001 as a research station and educational facility.  (It has since been renamed the Scandinavian Green Roof Institute (SGRI), in view of the increasing number of similar organisations around the world.)  Green roofs are well-established in Malmö: the Augustenborg housing development near the SGRI botanical garden incorporates green roofs and extensive landscaping of streams, ponds, and soak-ways between the buildings to deal with storm water run-off.

The new [[Bo01]] urban residential development (in the [[Västra Hamnen]] (Western Harbour) close to the foot of the [[Turning Torso]] office and apartment block, designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]]) is built on the site of old shipyards and industrial areas, and incorporates many green roofs.

In 2012, the shopping mall [[Emporia (shopping mall)|Emporia]] with its 27,000 square metre roof garden, was opened. The size of the roof garden is approximately equivalent to 4 soccer fields, which makes it one of the biggest green roof parks in Europe that is accessible to the public.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Sky Garden Kanes Foods Green Roof.JPG|thumb|The Sky Garden Wildflower Roof topping the Kanes Salad Factory, Evesham.]]
In 2003 English Nature concluded that 'in the UK policy makers have largely ignored green roofs'.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, G., Engleback, L., and Nicholson, B., ''Green Roofs: their existing status and potential for conserving biodiversity in urban areas [Report No. 498]'', Publisher: English Nature Reports (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; However, British examples can be found with increasing frequency. The [[Kensington Roof Gardens]] are a notable early roof garden which was built above the former [[Derry &amp; Toms]] department store in [[Kensington]], London in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.asp?ID=KAC055 |title=London Gardens Online |publisher=London Gardens Online |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examples can be found at the [[University of Nottingham]] [[Jubilee Campus]], and in London at Sainsbury's Millennium Store in Greenwich, the [[Horniman Museum]] and at [[Canary Wharf]].  The Ethelred Estate, close to the River [[Thames]] in central London, is the British capital's largest roof-greening project to date.  [[Toxteth]] in Liverpool is also a candidate for a major roof-greening project.

In the United Kingdom, intensive green roofs are sometimes used in built-up city areas where residents and workers often do not have access to gardens or local parks.  Extensive green roofs are sometimes used to blend buildings into rural surroundings, for example by [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars]], who has one of the biggest green roofs in Europe (covering more than 32,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on their factory at Goodwood, West Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/the-company/environmental/#LivingRoof ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103075110/http://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/the-company/environmental/ |date=3 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Sheffield has created a Green Roof Centre of Excellence and conducted research, particularly in a UK context, into green roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenroofcentre.co.uk/about_us |title=About TGRC |publisher=The Green Roof Centre |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Nigel Dunnett of Sheffield University published a UK-centric book about green roofing in 2004 (updated 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Dunnett, N., Kingsbury, N., ''Planting Green Roofs and Living Walls'', Publisher: Timber Press (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Dunlop]] has the largest green roof in the UK since its redevelopment between 2004 and 2006.

The UK also boasts one of the most innovative food preparation facilities in Europe, the Kanes salad factory in [[Evesham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fstoppress.com/articles/wild-flower-roof/|title=F Stop Press - Specialists in News and PR in the Midlands|website=www.fstoppress.com|accessdate=23 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082902/http://www.fstoppress.com/articles/wild-flower-roof/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is topped with a wildflower roof featuring nearly 90 species of wildflower and natural grasses.

===United States===
[[File:Green City.jpg|thumb|200px|An intensive roof garden in [[Manhattan]]]]
[[File:CaliforniaAcademyofSciences.jpg|thumb|200px|The new [[California Academy of Sciences]] building in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]] has a green roof that provides {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} of native vegetation designed as a habitat for indigenous species, including the threatened [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]].  According to the Academy's fact sheet on the building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.calacademy.org/geninfo/newsroom/releases/2005/Green_building_facts.html|title = California Academy of Sciences – Newsroom|accessdate = 10 June 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080403122805/http://www.calacademy.org/geninfo/newsroom/releases/2005/Green_building_facts.html|archivedate = 3 April 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the building consumes 30–35% less energy than required by code.]]
One of the largest expanses of extensive green roof is to be found in the US, at [[Ford Motor Company]]'s [[River Rouge Plant]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], Michigan, where {{convert|42000|m2|sqft|}} of assembly plant roofs are covered with [[sedum]] and other plants, designed by [[William McDonough]]; the $18 million assembly avoids the need of what otherwise would be $50 million worth of mechanical treatment facilities on site. Built over Millennium Park Garage, Chicago's {{convert|24.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Millennium Park]] is considered one of the largest intensive green roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Bryn |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24056306/greenroofspoppingupinbigcities |title=Green roofs popping up in big cities - Business - Going Green |publisher=MSNBC |date=15 April 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other well-known American examples include Chicago’s City Hall and the former Gap headquarters, now the headquarters of YouTube, in San Bruno, CA. The U.S. military has two major green roofs in the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington, D.C. area]]: the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] headquarters ({{convert|550000|sqft|m2|}}) and [[the Pentagon]] ({{convert|180000|sqft|m2|}}).&lt;!--Recently, the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] retrofitted their existing headquarters building in Washington, D.C. with a green roof designed by landscape architect [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asla.org/greenroof|title=ASLA Green Roof Demonstration Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of a green roof in the United States is the Ballard Library in Seattle.  This green roof has over 18,000 plants to help with insulation and reduce runoff.  The plants used on the roof include ''[[Achillea tomentosa]]'' (woolly yarrow), ''[[Armeria maritima]]'' (sea pink, sea thrift), ''[[Carex inops]] pensylvanica'' (long-stoloned sedge), ''[[Eriophyllum lanatum]]'' (Oregon sunshine), ''[[Festuca rubra]]'' (red creeping fescue), ''[[Festuca idahoensis]]'' (Idaho fescue), ''[[Phlox subulata]]'' (creeping phlox), ''[[Saxifraga caespitosa]]'' (tufted saxifrage), ''[[Sedum oreganum]]'' (Oregon stonecrop), ''[[Sedum album]]'' (white stonecrop), ''[[Sedum spurium]]'' (two-row stonecrop), ''[[Sisyrinchium idahoense]]'' (blue-eyed grass), ''[[Thymus serpyllum]]'' (wild thyme), ''[[Triteleia hyacinthina]]'' (fool's onion).
--&gt;

An early green-roofed building (completed in 1971) is the {{convert|358000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Weyerhaeuser Corporate Headquarters building in Federal Way, Washington.  Its 5-story office roof system comprises a series of stepped terraces covered in greenery.  From the air, the building blends into the landscape.

The largest green roof in New York City was installed in midtown [[Manhattan]] atop the [[United States Postal Service]]'s Morgan Processing and Distribution Center.  Construction on the {{convert|109000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} project began in September 2008, and was finished and dedicated in July 2009.  Covered in native vegetation and having an expected lifetime of fifty years, this green roof will not only save the USPS approximately $30,000 a year in heating and cooling costs, but will also significantly reduce the amount of storm water contaminants entering the municipal water system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = USPS News Release: U.S. Postal Service Opens First Green Roof |date = 22 July 2009 |url = http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2009/pr09_063.htm |accessdate = 11 February 2011 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101231222639/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2009/pr09_063.htm |archivedate = 31 December 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/greennews/pdf/greenkit_5.pdf | format=PDF | title=Green Roof: Morgan Processing and Distribution Center (P&amp;DC) |accessdate=2014-03-03 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140801200244/http://www.capitolroofinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/greenkit-5.pdf |archivedate= 1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atop the [[Museum of Modern Art]] is a modern sculptural garden spanning over 16,750 square feet (7,500 + 9,250). This rooftop is physically inaccessible to the public but has some of the most visible rooftop space in New York. [[Ken Smith (architect)|Ken Smith]] designed MoMA rooftop as a Landscape Architect by using 185 plastic rocks, 560 artificial boxwoods, 300 pounds of clear crushed glass, 4 tons of recycled rubber mulch. His design was awarded the [[American Society of Landscape Architecture]] for design in 2009.

[[File:20080708 Chicago City Hall Green Roof.JPG|thumb|300px|Chicago City Hall Roof Garden]]
In 2001, atop [[Chicago City Hall]], the {{convert|38,800|sqft|adj=on}} roof gardens were completed, serving as a pilot project to assess the impact green roofs would have on the [[heat island]] effect in urban areas, rainwater runoff, and the effectiveness of differing types of green roofs and plant species for Chicago's climate. Although the rooftop is not normally accessible to the public, it is visually accessible from 33 taller buildings in the area. The garden consists of 20,000 plants of more than 150 species, including shrubs, vines and two trees. The green roof design team was headed by the Chicago area firm Conservation Design Forum in conjunction with noted "green" architect [[William McDonough]]. With an abundance of flowering plants on the rooftop, beekeepers harvest approximately {{convert|200|lb|kg}} of honey each year from hives installed on the rooftop. Tours of the green roof are by special arrangement only. Chicago City Hall Green Roof won merit design award of the [[American Society of Landscape Architecture]] (ASLA) competition in 2002.

The {{cvt|14,000|sqft|m2}} of outdoor space on the seventh floor of [[Zeckendorf Towers]], formerly an undistinguished rooftop filled with potted plants, make up the largest residential green roof in New York.&lt;ref name="zeckendorftowers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnainfo.com/20101116/murray-hill-gramercy/union-squares-zeckendorf-towers-unveil-citys-largest-green-roof Zeckendorf Towers Unveils City's Largest Green Roof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120014828/http://www.dnainfo.com/20101116/murray-hill-gramercy/union-squares-zeckendorf-towers-unveil-citys-largest-green-roof |date=20 January 2011 }}, DNAinfo, 16 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/realestate/26posting.html A New Roof That Works for a Living], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The roof was transformed in 2010 as part of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s NYC Green Infrastructure campaign, and supposedly serves to capture some of the rain that falls on it rather than letting it run off and contribute to flooding in the adjacent [[14th Street – Union Square (New York City Subway)|Union Square subway station]].&lt;ref name="zeckendorftowers"&gt;[http://zeckendorftowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ZT-Rooftop.pdf One Union Square East Opens City's Largest Residential Green Roof], Zeckendorf Towers press release of 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cost can also be attributed to maintenance.  Extensive green roofs have low maintenance requirements but they are generally not maintenance free.  German research has quantified the need to remove unwanted seedlings to approximately 6 seconds/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |journal=Deutscher Gartenbau

  |pages=32–34
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintenance of green roofs often includes fertilization to increase flowering and succulent plant cover.  If aesthetics are not an issue, fertilization and maintenance are generally not needed.  Extensive green roofs should only be fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers in order to avoid pollution of the storm water.  Conventional fertilizers should never be used on extensive vegetated roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Emilsson | first1 = T. | last2 = Czemiel Berndtsson | first2 = J. | last3 = Mattsson | first3 = J-E | last4 = Rolf | first4 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Effect of using conventional and controlled release fertilizer on nutrient runoff from various vegetated roof systems | url = | journal = Ecological Engineering | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 260–271 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2006.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Czemiel Berndtsson | first1 = J. | last2 = Emilsson | first2 = T. | last3 = Bengtsson | first3 = L. | year = 2006 | title = The influence of extensive vegetated roofs on runoff water quality | url = | journal = Science of the Total Environment | volume = 355 | issue = 1–3| pages = 48–63 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.02.035 | pmid = 16442432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  German studies have approximated the nutrient requirement of vegetated roofs to 5&amp;nbsp;gN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is also important to use a substrate that does not contain too many available nutrients.  The FLL guidelines specify maximum-allowable nutrient content of substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fll.de |title=FLL: Startseite |website=Fll.de |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest American green roofs in existence is atop the Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, built in 1936. This roof was primarily an aesthetic undertaking for the enjoyment of the center's workers, and remains to this day, having been refurbished in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenroofs.com/projects/pview.php?id=666 |title=Projects - Rockefeller Center Roof Gardens |website=Greenroofs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following statements sourced respectively from the conservation park’s management plan and the now-discontinued [[Register of the National Estate]] summarises its conservation significance:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Park contains some of the Guichen Bay beach ridge plain; a classic example of Holocene beach ridge development of worldwide interest which records the naturalhistory of the Bay over the last 7000 years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Because of its inaccessibility this Park is rarely visited by people. The fairly dense coastal heath provides a home for the secretive [[Rufous bristlebird|DASYORNIS BROADBENTI (rufous bristle bird)]], while along the seashore [[dotterels]] and [[oystercatchers]] are common. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite book|title= Small Coastal Parks of the South East Management Plan|date=1994|publisher=National Parks and Wildlife Service, Department of Environment and Planning, South Australia|page =19|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/b92dc434-54d2-410c-b414-9e4f00b1f557/PARKS_PDFS_SML_COAST_PKS_SE_MP.pdf|edition=|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of the National Estate (Non-statutory archive),  Guichen Bay Conservation Park, Robe, SA, Australia|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=8042|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], '''Guinee''' is the spirit world. It is where the souls of the dead live. It is controlled by the loa Baron Samedi, believed to be the symbol of life and death. 

There are seven gates through which Guinee can be entered. They are as follows:

#[[Baron La Croix]]
#[[Guédé Nibo]]
#[[Guédé Plumaj]]
#[[Baron Cimetière|Baron Cimitière]]
#[[Guédé Babaco]]
#[[Baron Kriminel]]
#[[Baron Samedi]]

The spirits of the dead have to pass through these seven gates to be reunited to the already dead ones. 

Many practitioners of this faith believe that these seven gates are physically present in different areas in New Orleans.

The '''happy hunting ground''' was the name given to the concept of the [[afterlife]] by several of the [[Great Plains]] tribes of American Indians, including the [[Oglala Lakota]]. It is an afterlife conceived of as a paradise in which hunting is plentiful and game unlimited.

==History==
[[Lakota people]] believe that after death, the spirit of the deceased person goes to the happy hunting ground. This belief corresponds with the general Sioux belief that [[animism|everything has a spirit]]; including trees, rocks, rivers and almost every natural entity. This therefore leads to the existence of an afterlife. The Indian tribes had many spiritual dances such as the [[Sun Dance]] and the [[Ghost Dance]], which directly refers to the spirits of the dead returning to life.

The name indicates the characteristics of this afterlife tradition: the happy hunting ground resembled the living world, but with much better weather and animals such as [[rabbit]], [[deer]] and [[bison]] that were both plentiful and easy to hunt.

{{quote|"I will follow the white man's trail. I will make him my friend, but I will not bend my back to his burdens. I will be cunning as a coyote. I will ask him to help me understand his ways, then I will prepare the way for my children. Maybe they will outrun the white man in his own shoes.

There are but two ways for us. One leads to hunger and death, the other leads to where the poor white man lives. Beyond is the happy hunting ground where the white man cannot go."|''[[Many Horses]] - Oglala Lakota''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Wisdom/ManyHorses.html |title=Many Horses - Oglala Sioux |publisher=Firstpeople.us |date= |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It may be found at the origin of river or place names as:

The British television sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' centres on the main characters of Andy Millman, Maggie Jacobs and Darren Lamb, in addition to several more recurring characters.

==Main characters==

===Andy Millman===
[[File:Ricky Gervais 2010.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Ricky Gervais]] (pictured in 2010) played the lead, a down-on-his-luck actor]]
Portrayed by [[Ricky Gervais]], Andrew "Andy" Millman is the lead character of ''Extras''. Andy's dream to become an actor – he left his steady day job at [[Natwest]] in [[Wokingham]] in order to pursue it - is endlessly frustrated by the fact that his agent [[#Darren Lamb|Darren Lamb]] is incompetent, circumstances seem to conspire against him, and the only work he can get is as a [[extra (drama)|film extra]].  His best friend is fellow extra [[#Maggie Jacobs|Maggie Jacobs]], but her staunch desire to help, coupled with a lack of tact and intelligence, means that she more often than not causes him just as much trouble.

At the end of Series 1, Millman successfully managed to sell a [[sitcom]] called ''When the Whistle Blows'', which proves to be a commercial but not a critical success.

In contrast to Gervais' other famed role as [[David Brent]], who, through his desire to be liked by those around him comes off as pathetic, Millman often makes little or no attempt to be liked - often being a downright curmudgeon - but frequently comes across as being a much more likeable character than Brent. This may be due to his increased sense of self-awareness and understanding; when compared to Brent, Millman is all too aware of when he has stepped over the line and become genuinely offensive (although this doesn't stop him from causing genuine offence). Also unlike Brent, who was largely in denial about the world around him, Millman is a more depressed and misanthropic character with a more realistic appraisal of the world and how it works. Whereas Brent was based on a former [[supervisor|boss]] of Gervais, Millman's personality is more autobiographical in origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickygervais.com/podcasts2.php Ricky Gervais... Obviously&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A running joke is that Millman did not lose his virginity until the age of 28 (although the first time this is mentioned, Maggie says he was 22), and to a woman who looked like [[Ronnie Corbett]] (who turns up in a later episode as himself). Andy's nemesis throughout the programme is [[#Greg Lindley-Jones|Greg Lindley-Jones]], who also started out as an extra before finding success in a number of productions and becoming a well-respected actor, much to Andy's annoyance.

===Maggie Jacobs===
[[File:Ashley Jensen.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Ashley Jensen]] (pictured in 2008) played naive Jacobs]]
Portrayed by [[Ashley Jensen]], Maggie Jacobs is characterised as a genuinely kind and supportive individual who only wants to help out. Unfortunately for her and those around her, she is also portrayed as being rather socially inept and lacking in any sort of internal censor or sense of tact, which means that she's more likely to say precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong person, and thus create more trouble for herself and those around her (especially Andy, whom she frequently embarrasses by inadvertently puncturing his pretensions towards being an [[actor]]). Although the character possesses no malicious intent, she also appears to be rather childlike and poorly educated when it comes to matters of race and [[political correctness]] - which, when coupled with her general tactlessness, frequently results in her causing genuine offence through inadvertent insults and stereotypes.  In series two her earthy ways are shown to contrast greatly with the pretensions of Andy's new friends.  Gervais has stated that he thinks the personality of Maggie resembles a female version of [[Karl Pilkington]], whose friendship with Gervais was developing during the time Extras was being written.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/rickygervais Ricky Gervais Twitter 17/11/2011&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the series Andy even explains that he and Maggie are friends because she's so stupid and it amuses him, which is precisely what Gervais has said about Pilkington.

Maggie is rather man-hungry, and throughout the series she is constantly on the lookout for 'Mr. Right.' However, owing to circumstance and her aforementioned tendency to commit social ''faux-pas,'' the relationships she starts with men throughout the series rarely last long. However, there have been instances in which the men she is interested in turn out to be very much less than desirable, through no fault of her own. In one episode she was constantly pestered and eventually kissed by [[Orlando Bloom]], even though she had told him that she did not find him particularly attractive.

===Darren Lamb===
[[File:StephenMerchantAltNov09.jpg|left|thumb|130px|[[Stephen Merchant]] (pictured in 2009) played the lead's inept agent]]
Portrayed by [[Stephen Merchant]], Darren Lamb is Andy Millman's agent. He is utterly incapable of breaking an act, and his usual negotiating tactic is to simply agree with whatever anyone else says, or suggest someone other than his client for the part. He's very good at deducting his 12.5% commission ("15% for adverts") despite frequently having done nothing to contribute to his act's success.  For example, in series two episode two, whilst in the pub, he asks for £27.50 from Barry for the £220 he was paid for fixing someone's gutter, despite having no involvement in getting him the job.  He can often be seen begging for this type of payment.  His lack of professional skills is typified by the occasion he inadvertently left his office phone unplugged for two days without noticing. He is also known to make inappropriate remarks at the least helpful of times. Lamb works part-time at the [[Carphone Warehouse]], but in Episode 4 of Series 2, he mentions he only works on Saturdays while "Narinder" is pregnant.

Despite these (and more) overwhelming examples of incompetence, Lamb is nevertheless the agent of the series' protagonist, the frustrated [[#Andy Millman|Andy Millman]], who is more than aware of his agent's utter uselessness but nevertheless feels compelled to retain him out of a slightly perverse mixture of responsibility and sympathy. Lamb is also the agent of "[[List of Extras characters#Barry off EastEnders|Barry from ''EastEnders'']]".

In episode six of the second series, an increasingly stressed Millman threatens to sack Lamb after he is caught masturbating and relaxing in his office. However, Lamb manages to arrange a meeting between Millman and his hero [[Robert De Niro]], with the indication given that he managed to keep his job as a result.

Lamb does not have a regular girlfriend and his rather crude way of chatting up women (as seen in episode two of series two) means few have any wish to fulfil his sexual desires. In the fourth episode he actually managed to invite Maggie to his house, things go well until Lamb tries to break an unflushable faeces in his toilet into pieces with a whisk, causing Maggie to leave his house in disgust.

===Barry off ''EastEnders''===
[[File:Shaun Williamson.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Shaun Williamson]] (pictured in 2008) played a failed soap-opera actor]]
[[Shaun Williamson]] plays himself as one of Darren's clients. He used to play [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] on the British soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', but left to pursue a multi-million pound contract elsewhere and failed. Darren Lamb doesn't use his real name, but instead calls him "Barry off ''EastEnders''" or just "Barry" and occasionally "Barr". This also extends to other characters as seen in episode 1.2, where fellow ''EastEnders'' actor [[Ross Kemp]] only seems to know Shaun Williamson after being told his ''EastEnders'' character name. He carries an air of accepted defeat, and helps Lamb around his office, appearing to be marginally the more competent of the two. They later team up with another ex-Eastender, [[Dean Gaffney]], at the Carphone Warehouse. Andy and Dean are the only ones who ever call him "Shaun".

===Greg Lindley-Jones===
Portrayed by [[Shaun Pye]], Greg Lindley-Jones is an arrogant and mean-spirited [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] graduate and [[#Andy Millman|Andy's]] enemy. Like Andy, he started out as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]], struggling to get more significant roles.  However, unlike Andy, he has managed to secure lines in various productions such as ''[[The Bill]]'' and consequently he possesses a rather high opinion of himself and is constantly bullying Andy. Andy rarely gets ahead in his encounters with Greg. In the first episode of series one it is revealed he is subsidised by his wealthy parents. While both Andy and Greg are suitably advantaged so that they can afford to work full-time in minor acting roles, Greg's through a privileged background and Andy's through a previous career at the bank. Greg is notably annoyed when Andy tries to celebrate his BBC series triumph with fellow extras in Season 1 Episode 6.

Greg gradually gains more recognition as a successful stage, television and eventually film actor. In the Christmas special he boasts to Andy how the fictitious film ''[[Lord Byron|Byron]]: A Life'', (in which he starred alongside [[Clive Owen]]) is number one in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] film charts and number two in [[United States of America|America]]. Andy becomes envious of the fact Greg is now a well-respected [[Hollywood]] actor whilst he is only recognised for featuring in a lowbrow [[sitcom]].

==Other recurring characters==
* Bunny ([[Gerard Kelly]]) - three episodes, a camp pantomime director whose daughter appears in the first series. He reappears in the Sir Ian McKellen episode and the Christmas Special.
* Damon Beesley ([[Martin Savage (actor)|Martin Savage]]), the very camp comedy script writer who is brought in to work alongside Andy.
* Iain Morris ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) - The head of Comedy at the BBC, Morris is one of the contributors to stealing artistic direction of 'When the Whistle Blows' from Andy. He has a strong friendship with Damon Beesley, agreeing with virtually anything the latter suggests for the sitcom no matter how ridiculous, and becomes increasingly arrogant and condescending when Andy raises his concerns about it. He is also gay and takes it very personally when any implied homophobia is used in his presence. He appears in three episodes as well as a minor role in the Christmas Special.
* "Make-up woman" ([[Sarah Preston]]) - three episodes. Asks for signed pictures but no one can remember her name.
* [[Liza Tarbuck]] - although she mainly appears in character as Rita in ''When the Whistle Blows'', she is also seen in make-up as herself.

==''When the Whistle Blows''==
{{main|Extras (TV series)#When the Whistle Blows}}
;Ray Stokes:
Ray is the manager, played by Andy Millman, in turn played by Ricky Gervais. His catchphrase is an incredulous "Are you having a laugh!? Is he/she having a laugh?". The character was based on a man Millman worked for before deciding to pursue acting full-time, and originally his catchphrase was merely something Millman wrote in because it was something that man used to say.  Millman's co-writer decided to develop it into a catchphrase.  To play the part of Ray, Millman is forced into wearing oversized glasses and a curly black wig to add the "hilarity", despite the fact that the real Ray Stokes did not look like this. Many of Ray's mannerisms, such as raising and lowering his glasses, suggest that he could be a parody of [[Reg Holdsworth]], an old character from the long-running British soap ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

;Rita:
Rita is played by [[Liza Tarbuck]], who also sings the ''When The Whistle Blows'' [[theme song]]. She is a [[single parent]] and is the central, straight character of the show. She is married in the Christmas Special.

;Gobbler:
Gobbler is a large, unintelligent character, played by Andrew Buckley. His inability to understand his co-workers' jokes often prompts his catchphrase, "I don't get it!" It is suggested that he has appalling personal hygiene. He becomes intelligent after falling off a donkey in the Christmas Special.

;Brains:
Brains, played by Jamie Chapman, is the stereotypical smart one of the group, sporting glasses, a quiffed hairstyle and a pedantic tone. His rather detailed knowledge of all subjects does not impress Ray, who will inevitably come out with the "are ya 'avin' a laugh?" line. He 'comes out' in the Christmas Special.

;Kimberley:
Kimberley, played by Sarah Moyle is the only other female character on the show. She seems to lead a rather homely lifestyle. In the Christmas Special, she received a promotion.

;Keith:
Keith is played by TV presenter [[Keith Chegwin]] in the pilot episode. His character was originally called "Alfie", but a frustrated Millman changed it because Keith Chegwin was confused at being addressed with a different name. We are told he is always late for work, but in this instance turns up late because he was at his sister's funeral. This also confused Chegwin, who confided: "the thing is, my sister's not dead".

There are relatively few other characters in the sitcom, but they include Chris Martin (playing himself), and a Japanese couple, who also spawn another catchphrase "Velly velly solly" (as seen on a T-shirt worn by a crowd member in the Christmas Special). Ray's wife [[unseen character|is mentioned, but never appears]] - which is an old cliché of British comedy, e.g., ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'' and [[Dad's Army]]. Andy appears in a dual role as Ray's twin sister.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36449">The following is a list of the east–west arterial thoroughfares in the city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Numbered avenues run east-west with street numbers increasing to the north. In 1982 a quadrant system was adopted. Quadrant Avenue (1 Avenue; only constructed west of the river), along with Windermere Boulevard and the south leg of [[Anthony Henday Drive]], dividing the north and south quadrants. Edmonton currently has three quadrants: northwest (NW), southwest (SW), and northeast (NE); the vast majority of the city falls within the northwest quadrant. Addresses on 41 Avenue and south have been encouraged to include NW to avoid confusion with addresses in the SW quadrant.

'''Ellerslie Road''' (or '''9&amp;nbsp;Avenue&amp;nbsp;SW''') is a major [[arterial road]] in south [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. The original rural area was named Ellerslie by early [[Scottish people|Scottish settlers]], and the name was applied to the local school district by 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/Neighbourhoods/EllerslieDemographicProfile.pdf |publisher=City of Edmonton |title=Ellerslie Neighbourhood Profile |date=2014 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the rural grid road Township Road 514 was later built, it soon earned the nickname Ellerslie Road.

When the Ellerslie area was [[Edmonton annexations#1982 general annexation|annexed by Edmonton]] in 1982, the City of Edmonton extended its own numbering system to existing roads. The 1982 annexation pushed Edmonton`s boundaries south of 1&amp;nbsp;Avenue, so the city adopted a [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrant system]], renaming Township Road&amp;nbsp;514 to 9&amp;nbsp;Avenue&amp;nbsp;SW &amp;ndash; though Ellerslie Road has remained the preferred name by Edmontonians.

Since 1999, Ellerslie Road has become a major arterial, serving the significant residential development in the extensive string of neighbourhoods across the [[Ellerslie, Edmonton (area)|Ellerslie area]], the  [[Heritage Valley, Edmonton|Heritage Valley area]], the [[Windermere, Edmonton (area)|Windermere area]] and the [[Southeast Edmonton|Southeast Edmonton area]] of the city. As part of the [[Windermere Estates, Edmonton|Windermere]] Neighbourhood Structure Plan, Ellerslie Road was realigned near [[Terwillegar Drive|170&amp;nbsp;Street&amp;nbsp;SW (Terwillegar Drive)]] and becomes ''Hiller Road'' west of the intersection. The bypassed rural road alignment will become a multi use trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Current Planning Branch|title=Windermere Neighbourhood Structure Plan|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/plans_in_effect/Windermere_NSP_Consolidation.pdf|website=City of Edmonton|publisher=Sustainable Development|accessdate=April 10, 2018|page=21|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KingsMills George Turner.JPG|thumb|right|''The Trent near Castle Donington'' by [[George Turner (artist)|George Turner]], 1881: [[King's Mill, Castle Donington|King's Mill near Castle Donington]] was the location for catches of [[sturgeon]] and [[eel]]s.&lt;ref name=Glover/&gt;&lt;ref name=stonesturgeon /&gt;]]

This '''list of fish in the River Trent''' is a list of fish species that have been recorded from the [[River Trent]], a major river in England that starts in [[Staffordshire]], flows through the [[Midlands, England|Midlands]], and joins the [[River Ouse (Yorkshire)|River Ouse]] to form the [[Humber Estuary]].

The impressive diversity of fish species in this river has been known (and celebrated) since 1590, with poetry containing the earliest mention that the Trent contains 30 kinds of fish. The earliest actual list of fish in the river is from 1641. Over the centuries some species have since become locally extinct, and other species have been introduced.

==Earliest literary references==
In 1590, [[Edmund Spenser]] in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' described the [[River Trent]] and its fish fauna as follows:&lt;ref name="FQ"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?action=GET&amp;textsid=32867  |title= Faerie Queene. Book IV. Canto XI. |publisher= spenserians.cath.vt.edu |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|

:The beauteous Trent which in itself enseams,
:Thirty kinds of fish and thirty different streams.}}

This couplet was closely echoed in 1612, in [[Michael Drayton|Drayton's]] ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' description of the Trent:&lt;ref name=Polyo&gt;{{cite book  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j4CkktKXQWIC&amp;pg=PA674  |last=Southey |first=Robert  |year=1831 |title=Select Works of the British Poets: From Chaucer to Jonson   |publisher=Longman |isbn= |page=674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|

:Or thirty kinds of fish that in my streams do live }}

These poems have been a source of curiosity to a number of fishing experts, who have endeavoured to guess the identity of the thirty fish alluded to in the poems.

==1641 list==
The earliest known list of fish from the River Trent was from 1641. Although the list contains thirty names, one of them is not a fish by modern standards, but an edible crustacean, the [[white-clawed crayfish|Crayfish]]. The list also includes some fish names that no longer exist in modern English, such as "Frenches" and "Lenbrood"; these species are therefore currently unidentifiable.&lt;ref name=tts-tb&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1925/itinerary1925p1.htm  | title=  An itinerary of Nottingham: Trent Bridge |work= Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 29 (1925) |publisher= nottshistory.org.uk  | accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FishingTrent Turner.jpg|thumb|right|''Fishing on the Trent near Ingleby'' by [[George Turner (artist)|George Turner]], 1850 ]]

The 1641 list of 30 species (verbatim, note antique spelling of some names):

''Barbet, Bream, Bullhead, Burbolts, Carp, Chevin, Crayfish, Dates, Eel, Flounder, Frenches, Gudgeon, Grayling, Lampern, Lamphrey, Lenbrood, Loach, Minnows, Pickeral, Pinks, Perch, Roach, Ruff, Salmon, Shad, Smelt, Sticklebats, Sturgeon, Trout, Whitling''.&lt;!-- italics to indicate that this is not modern English --&gt;

===Note on the sturgeon===
The largest of these fish was the [[European sea sturgeon|sturgeon]],  a species which at one time was fairly frequently caught in the Trent, but only in low numbers. Notable examples included a sturgeon of eight feet taken near Donington castle in 1255, and another at nearby King's Mill of seven feet in 1791.&lt;ref name=Glover/&gt; The last known catch was in 1902 near [[Holme, Nottinghamshire]]; the fish was eight and a half feet long and weighed 250 pounds.&lt;ref name=stonesturgeon&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Richard  |year=2005 |title=River Trent |publisher=Phillimore |isbn= 1860773567|pages=72, 101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1676 description==
In 1676 in Izaak Walton described the River Trent as "One of the finest rivers in the world and the most abounding with excellent salmon and all sorts of delicate fish."&lt;ref name=Izaak&gt;{{cite book  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QJKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA248  |last=Walton| first=Izaak|title=The Complete Angler ; Or, Contemplative Man's Recreation; Being a Discourse on Rivers, Ponds, Fish and Fishing. With Lives and Notes  |publisher= | year=1833 |isbn= |page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walton also speculated (incorrectly) that the name of the River Trent might be based on the number of fish species, that the Trent is "... so called from thirty kind of fishes that are found in it, or for that it receiveth thirty lesser rivers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/683/pg683.html ''The Compleat Angler'', (1653)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1751 list==
In 1751, [[Charles Deering (botanist)|Charles Deering]] provided a list of 34 kinds, under the title ''An alphabetical list of all the fish catch’d in the River Trent''. This listed read (verbatim);

''Barbel, Bream, Bulhead, Burbot, Carp, Chub, Crayfish, Dace, Eel, Flounder, Grayling, Gudgeon, Lamprey, Lampern, Loach, Minnow, Muscle, Perch, Pike, Roach, Rud, Ruff, Salmon, Salmon Trout, Salmon Pink, Sand Eel, Shad, Smelt, Strickleback, Sturgeon, Stream Pink, Tench, Trout, and Whitling''.&lt;!-- italics to indicate that this is not modern English --&gt;&lt;ref name=Deering&gt;{{cite book  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-D0uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA163 |last=Deering| first=Charles| last2=Chicken| first2=Rupert| title=Nottinghamia vetus et nova: or, An historical account of the ancient and present state of the town of Nottingham |publisher=Printed by and for, G. Ayscough, &amp; T. Willington| year=1751 |isbn= |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list also includes several unrecognizable fish. It also lists three different names for salmon, as well as "Whitling", which is a name for a young male trout, and "Muscle", which is probably a reference to [[Freshwater pearl mussel|freshwater mussel]]s, formerly used as food in some areas.

==1829==
Glover reproduced Deering's list in his ''History and Gazetteer of the County of Derby'',&lt;ref name=Glover2&gt;{{cite book  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BsoHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA29  |last=Glover |first=Stephen |editor-last=Noble |editor-first=Thomas  |year=1831 |title=The History and Gazetteer of the County of Derby  |publisher=Mozley |isbn= |pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also provided further information on many of the then known species in the companion volume, ''The History of the County of Derby (Volume 1)''.&lt;ref name=Glover&gt;{{cite book  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wQVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA166 |last=Glover |first=Stephen |editor-last=Noble |editor-first=Thomas  |year=1829 |title=The History of the County of Derby  |publisher=Mozley |isbn= |pages=166–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1985==
In 1985, a study of anglers' catches stated that the ‘Trent supports about 40 species’, but they were not listed. The fish that were caught most often, and were important to anglers, included barbel, bream, bleak, carp, chub, dace, eel, gudgeon, perch, and roach.&lt;ref name=Cowx1&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/discover/pdf/Cowx86.pdf | title=Changes in the species composition of anglers’ catches in the River Trent (England) between 1969 and 1984 |year=1986 |last=Cowx| first= I.G. |first2=N.M.| last2=Broughton  |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=28| issue=1|pages=625–636|publisher= Wiley | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1986.tb05197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 non-native species==
Non-native species that had a sustainable population in the river were listed in 2007, and included the European bitterling (''Rhodeus amarus''), carp (''Cyprinus carpio''), and zander (''Sander lucioperca'').&lt;ref name=Nunnetal&gt;{{cite journal | url= | title=Establishment of self-sustaining populations of non-native fish species in the River Trent and Warwickshire Avon, UK, indicated by the presence of 0+ fish |year=2007 |last=Nunn| first=A.D.  |first2=J.D.| last2=Bolland|last3=Harvey |first3=J.P. |last4=Cowx|first4= I.G. |journal=Aquatic Invasions  |volume=2| issue=|pages=190–196|publisher= REABIC | doi=10.3391/ai.2007.2.3.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fishpk &gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naturespot.org.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/Introductory%20Fish%20Pack.pdf
|work=Leicester and Rutland Fish  | title= Introductory Fish Pack |publisher= naturespot.org.uk | pages=17–18| accessdate= 10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master list==
This list is based on Deering's 1829 list. It includes the locally extinct species as well as the more recent additions, but it does not claim to be fully comprehensive; other species may occur in the river but are as yet undocumented.

This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Saint Kitts and Nevis'''. These are the mammal species in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 0 are endangered, 1 is vulnerable, and 1 is near-threatened. One species is classified as extinct.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

{{Political anthropology}}
'''''Maṇḍala''''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "circle". The [[mandala]] is a model for describing the patterns of diffuse political power distributed among [[Mueang]] or [[Kedatuan]] (principalities) in [[History of Southeast Asia#Ancient and classical kingdoms|early Southeast Asian history]], when local power was more important than the central leadership. The concept of a mandala counteracts modern tendencies to look for unified political power, i.e., the power of large [[monarchy|kingdom]]s and [[nation state]]s of later history — an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century [[Cartography#Technological changes|advances in map-making technologies]].{{explain|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Answering this question can help to explain both where our international political system came from and where it might be going&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The idea was originally proposed by Stanley J. Tambiah, a professor of anthropology, in a 1977 article entitled "The Galactic Polity: The structure of Political Kingdoms in Southeast Asia."
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of [[O. W. Wolters]] who further explored the idea in 1982:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The map of earlier Southeast Asia which evolved from the prehistoric networks of small settlements and reveals itself in historical records was a patchwork of often overlapping mandalas.&lt;ref&gt;O.W. Wolters, 1999, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is employed to denote traditional [[Southeast Asia]]n political formations, such as [[federation]] of  kingdoms or [[Vassal#Difference between .22vassal.22 and .22vassal state.22|vassalized polity]] under a [[Metropolis|center of domination]]. It was adopted by 20th century European historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term "[[State (polity)|state]]" in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian [[Polity|polities]] not conform to [[Chinese classics|classical Chinese]] and European views of a [[Political geography|territorially defined state]] with fixed [[border]]s and a [[Bureaucratic#History|bureaucratic apparatus]], but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In some ways similar to the [[feudal system]] of Europe, states were linked in [[suzerain]]–[[tribute|tributary]] relationships.

The term draws a comparison with the [[mandala]] of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Mount Meru|worldview]]; the comparison emphasises the radiation of power from each power center, as well as the non-physical basis of the system.

Other [[metaphors]] such as [[S. J. Tambiah]]'s original idea of a "[[Galaxy|galactic]] polity"&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Tambiah, Stanley Jeyaraja]]. ''World Conqueror and World Renouncer : A Study of Buddhism and Polity in Thailand against a Historical Background''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-521-29290-5}}.

==History==
[[Image:Mandalas1360-2.png|thumb|right|Intersecting mandalas circa 1360: from north to south: [[Lan Xang]], [[Lanna]], [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] and [[Champa]].]] 

Historically, the main suzerain or overlord states were the [[Khmer Empire]] of [[Cambodia]]; [[Srivijaya]] of [[South Sumatra]]; the successive kingdoms of [[Medang Kingdom|Medang]], [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]], [[Singhasari]] and [[Majapahit]] of [[Java]]; the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] of [[Thailand]]; [[Champa]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;O.W. Wolters, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;27–40, 126-154&lt;/ref&gt; China occupies a special place in that the others often in turn paid [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tribute to China]], although in practice the obligations imposed on the lesser kingdoms were minimal. The most notable tributary states were [[Dark ages of Cambodia|post-Angkor Cambodia]], [[Lan Xang]] (succeeded by the [[Kingdom of Vientiane]] and [[Luang Prabang]]) and [[Lanna]]. Cambodia in the 18th century was described by the Vietnamese emperor [[Gia Long]] as "an independent country that is slave of two" (Chandler p.&amp;nbsp;119). The system was eventually ended by the arrival of the Europeans in the mid-19th century. Culturally, they introduced Western geographical practices, which assumed that every area was subject to one sovereign. Practically, the colonisation of [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[History of Malaysia#Colonial era|British Malaya]] and Burma brought pressure from the colonisers for fixed boundaries to their possessions. The tributary states were then divided between the colonies and Siam, which exercised much more centralised power but over a smaller area than thitherto.

Historian [[Martin Stuart-Fox]] uses the term "mandala" extensively to describe the history of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang as a structure of loosely held together [[mueang]] that disintegrated after Lan Xang's conquest by Thailand starting in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Martin-Fox, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSS_082_0l_StuartFox_Conflict"&gt;{{cite journal

Thai historian Sunait Chutintaranond made an important contribution to study of the mandala in Southeast Asian history by demonstrating that "three assumptions responsible for the view that Ayudhya was a strong centralized state" did not hold and that "in Ayudhya the [[hegemony]] of provincial governors was never successfully eliminated."&lt;ref&gt;O.W. Wolters, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143 citing Chutintaranond, 1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSS_078_1i_Sunait_Mandala"&gt;{{cite journal

==Obligations==
[[File:National Museum KL 2008 (36).JPG|thumb|''[[Bunga mas]]'' (Flowers of Gold), tribute from northern [[Malay states]] in Malay peninsula for [[Siam]]. National Museum, [[Kuala Lumpur]].)]]
The obligations on each side of the relationship varied according to the strength of the relationship and the circumstances. In general, the tributary was obliged to pay ''[[bunga mas]]'', a regular tribute of various valuable goods and slaves, and miniature trees of [[gold]] and [[silver]] (''bunga mas dan perak''). The overlord ruler reciprocated with presents often of greater value than those supplied by the tributary. However, the tributary also had to provide men and supplies when called on, most often in time of war. The main benefit to the tributary was protection from invasion by other powers, although as South East Asia historian [[Thongchai Winichakul]] notes, this was often "mafia-like protection"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Thongchai Winichakul |title=Siam Mapped |year=1994 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the threats of the overlord himself. In some cases, the overlord also controlled the succession in the tributary, but in general interference with the tributary's domestic affairs was minimal: he would retain his own army and powers of taxation, for example. In the case of the more tenuous relationships, the "overlord" might regard it as one of tribute, while the "tributary" might consider the exchange of gifts to be purely commercial or as an expression of goodwill (Thongchai p.&amp;nbsp;87).

==Personal relationships==
:''For further information, see [[Kinship#Recognition of fluidity in kinship meanings and relations.5B8.5D|Kinship - Recognition of fluidity in kinship meanings and relations]]''
The emphasis on personal relationships was one of the defining characteristics of the mandala system. The tributary ruler was subordinate to the overlord ruler, rather than to the overlord state in the abstract. This had many important implications. A strong ruler could attract new tributaries, and would have strong relationships over his existing tributaries. A weaker ruler would find it harder to attract and maintain these relationships. This was put forward as one cause of the sudden rise of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] under [[Ram Khamhaeng the Great|Ramkhamhaeng]], for example, and for its almost equally steep decline after his death (Wyatt, 45 and 48). The tributary ruler could repudiate the relationship and seek either a different overlord or complete independence.   The system was non-territorial. The overlord was owed allegiance by the tributary ruler, or at most by the tributary's main town, but not by all the people of a particular area. The tributary owner in turn had power either over tributary states further down the scale, or directly over "his" people, wherever they lived. No ruler had authority over unpopulated areas.

The personal relationship between overlord and subordinate rulers is also defining the dynamic of relationship within mandala. The relations between [[Dharmasetu]] of Srivijaya and [[Samaratungga]] of [[Sailendra]] for instance, defining the succession of these dynastic family. Dharmasetu was the Srivijayan Maharaja overlord, while the house of Sailendra in Java is suggested to be related and was subscribed to Srivijayan mandala domination. After Samaratungga married Princess Tara, the daughter of Dharmasetu, Samaratungga become his successor and the house of Sailendra was promoted to become the dynastic lineage of later Srivijayan kings, and for a century period the center of Srivijaya was shifted from Sumatra to Java.

==Non-exclusivity==
The overlord-tributary relationship was not necessarily exclusive. A state in border areas might pay tribute to two or three stronger powers. The tributary ruler could then play the stronger powers off against each other in order to minimise interference by either one, while for the major powers the tributaries served as a [[buffer zone]] to prevent direct conflict between them. For example, the Malay kingdoms in [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Langkasuka]] and [[Tambralinga]], earlier were the subject to Srivijayan mandala, and in later period contested by either Ayutthaya mandala in north and Majapahit mandala in south, before finally gain its own gravity during [[Malacca Sultanate]].

'''Mapbox''' is a large provider of custom [[online maps]] for websites and applications such as [[Foursquare]], [[Lonely Planet]], [[Facebook]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'', [[The Weather Channel]] and [[Snapchat]].&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/wp/2013/07/22/the-new-cartographers|dead-url=yes|title=The New Cartographers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602081725/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/wp/2013/07/22/the-new-cartographers/|archive-date=2 June 2016|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, it has rapidly expanded the niche of custom maps, as a response to the limited choice offered by map providers such as [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; Mapbox is the creator of, or a significant contributor to some open source mapping libraries and applications, including the MBTiles specification, the TileMill cartography IDE, the [[Leaflet (software)|Leaflet]] JavaScript library, and the CartoCSS map styling language and parser.

==History==
The startup&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; was created as a part of Development Seed in order to offer map customization for non-profit customers, in 2010. It was [[Bootstrap funding|bootstrapped]] until a 2013 $10M [[Series A round|Series A funding]] round by Foundry Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|title=Mapbox Closes $10M Series A From Foundry Group To Build The Future Of Interactive, Mobile Maps|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/16/mapbox-closes-10m-series-a-from-foundry-group-to-build-the-future-of-interactive-mobile-maps/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Mapbox announced it had raised $52.55 million in a [[Series B round]] of funding led by [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson|DFJ Growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lunden|first1=Ingrid|title=Mapbox Raises $52.6M Led By DFJ To Be The "Map Layer" For All Apps|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/mapbox-raises-52-6m-led-by-dfj-to-build-the-map-layer-for-all-apps/#.f4enjv:w05Q|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work on [[OpenStreetMap]] tools, including the [[iD (software)|iD editor]], was funded by a $575,000 grant from the [[Knight Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franzen|first=Carl|title=Mapbox Aims For Open Source, Digital Map Revolution|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/idealab/mapbox-aims-for-open-source-digital-map-revolution|publisher=Talking Points Memo|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2016, [[MapQuest]] discontinued the open tile API&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/695337/|title=GNOME Maps and the tile problem|date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and users such as [[GNOME Maps]] were switched to a temporarily free tier of the Mapbox tileserver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mail.gnome.org/archives/maps-list/2016-July/msg00017.html|title=Tiles and Mapbox|author=Mattias Bengtsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; while considering alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=764841|title=Bug 764841 – Stop Using MapQuest Tile Server|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21231">In [[applied statistics]], '''regression-kriging (RK)''' is a spatial prediction technique that combines a [[regression analysis|regression]] of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as parameters derived from digital elevation modelling, remote sensing/imagery, and thematic maps) with [[kriging]] of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called ''[[universal kriging]]'' and ''kriging with external drift'', where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights.&lt;ref name="Pebesma2006IJGIS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pebesma|first=Edzer J|title=The Role of External Variables and GIS Databases in Geostatistical Analysis|journal=Transactions in GIS|date=1 July 2006|volume=10|issue=4|pages=615–632|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9671.2006.01015.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BLUP for spatial data ==

[[File:The universal model of spatial variation.jpg|thumb|400px|The universal model of spatial variation scheme.]]

Regression-kriging is an implementation of the [[best linear unbiased prediction|best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP)]] for spatial data, i.e. the best linear interpolator assuming the [[universal model of spatial variation]]. Matheron (1969) proposed that a value of a target variable at some location can be modeled as a sum of the deterministic and stochastic components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matheron|first=Georges|title=Le krigeage universel|year=1969|publisher=École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris|chapter=Part 1 of Cahiers du Centre de morphologie mathématique de Fontainebleau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Z(\mathbf{s}) = m(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon '(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon ''
&lt;/math&gt;

which he termed ''universal model of spatial variation''. Both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic components]] of spatial variation can be modeled separately. By combining the two approaches, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat z(\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \hat m(\mathbf{s}_0 ) + \hat e(\mathbf{s}_0 )= \sum\limits_{k = 0}^p {\hat \beta _k \cdot q_k (\mathbf{s}_0 )} + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i \cdot e(\mathbf{s}_i )
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat m(\mathbf{s}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the fitted deterministic part, &lt;math&gt;\hat e(\mathbf{s}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the interpolated residual, &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta _k&lt;/math&gt; are estimated deterministic model coefficients (&lt;math&gt;\hat \beta _0&lt;/math&gt; is the estimated intercept), &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are kriging weights determined by the spatial dependence structure of the residual and where &lt;math&gt;e(\mathbf{s}_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the residual at location &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{s}}_i&lt;/math&gt;. The regression coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta _k&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated from the sample by some fitting method, e.g. [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) or, optimally, using [[generalized least squares]] (GLS):&lt;ref name=Cressie2012Wiley&gt;{{cite book|last=Cressie|first=Noel|title=Statistics for spatio-temporal data|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9780471692744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\hat \beta }_\mathtt{GLS} = \left( \mathbf{q}^\mathbf{T} \cdot
\mathbf{C}^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot \mathbf{q} \right)^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot
\mathbf{q}^\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{C}^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot \mathbf{z}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat \beta}_\mathtt{GLS}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of estimated regression coefficients, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the covariance matrix of the residuals, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of predictors at the sampling locations and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of measured values of the target variable. The GLS estimation of regression coefficients is, in fact, a special case of the geographically weighted regression. In the case, the weights are determined objectively to account for the spatial auto-correlation between the residuals.

Once the deterministic part of variation has been estimated (regression-part), the residual can be interpolated with kriging and added to the estimated trend. The estimation of the residuals is an iterative process: first the deterministic part of variation is estimated using OLS, then the covariance function of the residuals is used to obtain the GLS coefficients. Next, these are used to re-compute the residuals, from which an updated covariance function is computed, and so on. Although this is by many geostatisticians recommended as the proper procedure, Kitanidis (1994) showed that use of the covariance function derived from the OLS residuals (i.e. a single iteration) is often satisfactory, because it is not different enough from the function derived after several iterations; i.e. it does not affect much the final predictions. Minasny and McBratney (2007) report similar results—it seems that using more higher quality data is more important then to use more sophisticated statistical methods.&lt;ref name="MinasnyMcBratney2007Geoderma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minasny|first=Budiman|author2=McBratney, Alex B. |title=Spatial prediction of soil properties using EBLUP with the Matérn covariance function|journal=Geoderma|date=31 July 2007|volume=140|issue=4|pages=324–336|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.04.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In matrix notation, regression-kriging is commonly written as:&lt;ref name="Christensen2001Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Ronald|title=Advanced linear modeling : multivariate, time series, and spatial data; nonparametric regression and response surface maximization|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=9780387952963|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat z_\mathtt{RK}(\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \mathbf{q}_\mathbf{0}^\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{\hat \beta}_\mathtt{GLS} + \mathbf{\lambda }_\mathbf{0}^\mathbf{T} \cdot (\mathbf{z}
- \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{\hat \beta }_\mathtt{GLS} )
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat z({\mathbf{s}}_0 )&lt;/math&gt; is the predicted value at location &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{s}}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{q}}_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of &lt;math&gt;p+1&lt;/math&gt; predictors and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\lambda}_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; kriging weights used to interpolate the residuals. The RK model is considered to be the ''Best Linear Predictor of spatial data''.&lt;ref name="Christensen2001Springer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldberger1962&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberger|first=A.S.|title=Best Linear Unbiased Prediction in the Generalized Linear Regression Model|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|year=1962|volume=57|issue=298|pages=369–375|jstor=2281645|doi=10.1080/01621459.1962.10480665}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a prediction variance that reflects the position of new locations (extrapolation) in both geographical and feature space:

:&lt;math&gt;

= (C_0  + C_1 ) - \mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0}^\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{C}^\mathbf{1}

- \mathbf{q}^\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{C}^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot
\mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0} \right)^\mathbf{T} \cdot \left( \mathbf{q}^\mathbf{T}
\cdot \mathbf{C}^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot \mathbf{q} \right)^\mathbf{ - 1} \cdot \left(\mathbf{q}_\mathbf{0} - \mathbf{q}^\mathbf{T} \cdot
\mathbf{C}^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot \mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_0 + C_1&lt;/math&gt; is the sill variation and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{c}}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of covariances of residuals at the unvisited location.

[[File:Decision tree for selecting a suitable spatial prediction model.jpg|thumb|400px|Decision tree for selecting a suitable spatial prediction model.]]

Many (geo)statisticians believe that there is only one Best Linear Unbiased Prediction model for spatial data (e.g. regression-kriging), all other techniques such as ordinary kriging, environmental correlation, averaging of values per polygons or inverse distance interpolation can be seen as its special cases. If the residuals show no spatial auto-correlation (pure nugget effect), the regression-kriging converges to pure multiple linear regression, because the covariance matrix (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;) becomes an identity matrix. Likewise, if the target variable shows no correlation with the auxiliary predictors, the regression-kriging model reduces to ordinary kriging model because the deterministic part equals the (global) mean value. Hence, pure kriging and pure regression should be considered as only special cases of regression-kriging (see figure).

== RK and UK/KED ==

The geostatistical literature uses many different terms for what are essentially the same or at least very similar techniques. This confuses the users and distracts them from using the right technique for their mapping projects. In fact, both universal kriging, kriging with external drift, and regression-kriging are basically the same technique.

Matheron (1969) originally termed the technique ''Le krigeage universel'', however, the technique was intended as a generalized case of kriging where the trend is modelled as a function of coordinates. Thus, many authors reserve the term ''universal kriging'' (UK) for the case when only the coordinates are used as predictors. If the deterministic part of variation (''drift'') is defined externally as a linear function of some auxiliary variables, rather than the coordinates, the term ''kriging with external drift'' (KED) is preferred (according to Hengl 2007, "About regression-kriging: From equations to case studies"). In the case of UK or KED, the predictions are made as with kriging, with the difference that the covariance matrix of residuals is extended with the auxiliary predictors. However, the drift and residuals can also be estimated separately and then summed. This procedure was suggested by Ahmed et al. (1987) and Odeh et al. (1995) later named it ''regression-kriging'', while Goovaerts (1997) uses the term ''kriging with a trend model'' to refer to a family of interpolators, and refers to RK as ''simple kriging with varying local means''. Minasny and McBratney (2007) simply call this technique Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor i.e. ''E-BLUP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Shakeel|author2=De Marsily, Ghislain|title=Comparison of geostatistical methods for estimating transmissivity using data on transmissivity and specific capacity|journal=Water Resources Research|date=1 January 1987|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1717|doi=10.1029/WR023i009p01717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odeh1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odeh|first=I.O.A.|author2=McBratney, A.B. |author3=Chittleborough, D.J. |title=Further results on prediction of soil properties from terrain attributes: heterotopic cokriging and regression-kriging|journal=Geoderma|date=31 July 1995|volume=67|issue=3-4|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/0016-7061(95)00007-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hengl2004Geoderma&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hengl|first=Tomislav|author2=Heuvelink, Gerard B.M. |author3=Stein, Alfred |title=A generic framework for spatial prediction of soil variables based on regression-kriging|journal=Geoderma|date=30 April 2004|volume=120|issue=1-2|pages=75–93|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2003.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MinasnyMcBratney2007Geoderma" /&gt;

In the case of KED, predictions at new locations are made by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{z}_\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n
w_i^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) \cdot z(\mathbf{s}_i )
&lt;/math&gt;

for

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n w_i^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) \cdot q_k (\mathbf{s}_i ) = q_k (\mathbf{s}_0 )
&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;k = 1,\ldots,p&lt;/math&gt; or in matrix notation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat z_\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \mathbf{\delta}_\mathbf{0}^\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{z}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the target variable, &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;'s are the predictor variables i.e. values at a new location &lt;math&gt;({\mathbf{s}}_0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{\delta }}_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of KED weights (&lt;math&gt;w_i^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the number of predictors and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations at primary locations. The KED weights are solved using the extended matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\lambda }_\mathbf{0}^\mathtt{KED} = \left\{ w_1^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ), \ldots ,w_n^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ),\varphi_0 (\mathbf{s}_0 ), \ldots ,\varphi _p (\mathbf{s}_0 ) \right\}^\mathbf{T} = \mathbf{C}^{\mathtt{KED} -1} \cdot \mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0}^\mathtt{KED}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{\lambda }}_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of solved weights, &lt;math&gt;\varphi _p&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrange multipliers, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{C}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; is the extended covariance matrix of residuals and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{c}}_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; is the extended vector of covariances at new location.

In the case of KED, the extended covariance matrix of residuals looks like this (Webster and Oliver, 2007; p.&amp;nbsp;183):&lt;ref name=WebsterOliver2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Richard|title=Geostatistics for environmental scientists|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470028582|edition=2nd|author2=Oliver, Margaret A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{C}^\mathtt{KED} = \left[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
C(\mathbf{s}_1 , \mathbf{s}_1) &amp; \cdots &amp; C(\mathbf{s}_1, \mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 1 &amp; q_1 (\mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots &amp; q_p (\mathbf{s}_1 ) \\
\vdots  &amp;  &amp;  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots \\
C(\mathbf{s}_n, \mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots  &amp; C(\mathbf{s}_n ,\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 1 &amp; q_1 (\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp;  \cdots  &amp; q_p (\mathbf{s}_n ) \\
1 &amp;  \cdots  &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
q_1 (\mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots  &amp; q_1 (\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots  &amp;  &amp;  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots \\
q_p (\mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots  &amp; q_p (\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots  &amp; 0 
\end{array}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0}^\mathtt{KED} = \left\{ C(\mathbf{s}_0, \mathbf{s}_1
), \ldots , C(\mathbf{s}_0, \mathbf{s}_n ), q_0 (\mathbf{s}_0 ), q_1 (\mathbf{s}_0 ), \ldots ,q_p (\mathbf{s}_0 )
\right\}^\mathbf{T};  q_0 (\mathbf{s}_0 ) = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, KED looks exactly as ordinary kriging, except the covariance matrix/vector are extended with values of auxiliary predictors.

Although the KED seems, at first glance, to be computationally more straightforward than RK, the parameters of the [[variogram]] for KED must also be estimated from regression residuals, thus requiring a separate regression modelling step. This regression should be GLS because of the likely spatial correlation between residuals. Note that many analyst use instead the OLS residuals, which may not be too different from the GLS residuals. However, they are not optimal if there is any spatial correlation, and indeed they may be quite different for clustered sample points or if the number of samples is relatively small (&lt;math&gt;\ll 200&lt;/math&gt;).

A limitation of KED is the instability of the extended matrix in the case that the covariate does not vary smoothly in space. RK has the advantage that it explicitly separates trend estimation from spatial prediction of residuals, allowing the use of arbitrarily-complex forms of regression, rather than the simple linear techniques that can be used with KED. In addition, it allows the separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. The emphasis on regression is important also because fitting of the deterministic part of variation (regression) is often more beneficial for the quality of final maps than fitting of the stochastic part (residuals).

Regression-kriging can be automated e.g. in [http://r-project.org R statistical computing] environment, by using gstat and/or geoR package. Typical inputs/outputs include:

INPUTS:
* Interpolation set (point map) — &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{s}_i)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots ,n&lt;/math&gt; at primary locations;
* Minimum and maximum expected values and measurement precision (&lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;);
* Continuous predictors (raster map) — &lt;math&gt;q(\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;; at new unvisited locations
* Discrete predictors (polygon map);
* Validation set (point map) — &lt;math&gt;z*(\mathbf{s}_j)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots ,l&lt;/math&gt; (optional);
* Lag spacing and limiting distance (required to fit the variogram);

OUTPUTS:  	
* Map of predictions and relative prediction error;
* Best subset of predictors and correlation significance (adjusted R-square);
* Variogram model parameters (e.g. &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;)
* GLS drift model coefficients;

Regression-kriging is used in various applied fields, from meteorology, climatology, soil mapping, geological mapping, species distribution modeling and similar. The only requirement for using regression-kriging versus e.g. ordinary kriging is that one or more covariate layers exist, and which are significantly correlated with the feature of interest. Some general applications of regression-kriging are:

* Geostatistical mapping: Regression-kriging allows for use of hybrid geostatistical techniques to model e.g. spatial distribution of soil properties.
* [[Downscaling]] of maps: Regression-kriging can be used a framework to downscale various existing gridded maps. In this case the covariate layers need to be available at better resolution (which corresponds to the sampling intensity) than the original point data.&lt;ref name="Hengl2008CG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hengl|first=Tomislav|author2=Bajat, Branislav |author3=Blagojević, Dragan |author4= Reuter, Hannes I. |title=Geostatistical modeling of topography using auxiliary maps|journal=Computers &amp; Geosciences|date=1 December 2008|volume=34|issue=12|pages=1886–1899|doi=10.1016/j.cageo.2008.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Error propagation]]: Simulated maps generated by using a regression-kriging model can be used for scenario testing and for estimating propagated uncertainty.

[[File:Simulations of zinc using regression-kriging model.png|thumb|none|Simulations of zinc concentrations derived using a regression-Kriging model. This model uses one continuous (distance to the river) and one categorical (flooding frequency) covariate. Code used to produce these maps is available [http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/gallery/#fig07.R here].]]

Regression-kriging-based algorithms play more and more important role in geostatistics because the number of possible covariates is increasing every day.&lt;ref name="Pebesma2006IJGIS" /&gt; For example, [[Digital Elevation Model|DEM]]s are now available from a number of sources. Detailed and accurate images of topography can now be ordered from remote sensing systems such as [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]] and [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]]; SPOT5 offers the High Resolution Stereoscopic (HRS) scanner, which can be used to produce DEMs at resolutions of up to 5 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toutin|first=Thierry|title=Generation of DSMs from SPOT-5 in-track HRS and across-track HRG stereo data using spatiotriangulation and autocalibration|journal=ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|date=30 April 2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=170–181|doi=10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2006.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finer differences in elevation can also be obtained with airborne laser-scanners. The cost of data is either free or dropping in price as technology advances. NASA recorded most of the world's topography in the [[Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rabus|first=Bernhard|author2=Eineder, Michael |author3=Roth, Achim |author4= Bamler, Richard |title=The shuttle radar topography mission—a new class of digital elevation models acquired by spaceborne radar|journal=ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|date=31 January 2003|volume=57|issue=4|pages=241–262|doi=10.1016/S0924-2716(02)00124-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From summer of 2004, these data has been available (e.g. via [https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/get_data/data_pool USGS ftp]) for almost whole globe at resolution of about 90 m (for the North American continent at resolution of about 30 m). Likewise, [[MODIS]] multispectral images are freely available for download at resolutions of 250 m. A large free repository of Landsat images is also available for download via the [http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/ Global Land Cover Facility] (GLCF).

A '''ribu''' is a [[mountain]] that reaches a [[topographic prominence]] of at least {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name="Jardine"&gt;{{cite journal|magazine = Tempo|year = 2009|pages = (1007) p.63|first = David|last = Jardine|title = The Ascents of Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ribu" is an [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word meaning "thousand".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/?rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#id/en/ribu|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], three categories of ribus are known according to the absolute height of the peak. The "Sangat Tinggi" (Indonesian for "very high") category is for peaks higher than 3000 meters, "Tinggi Sedang" (Indonesian for "medium height") for peaks between 2000 and 3000 meters, and "Kurang Tinggi" (Indonesian for "less high") for peaks with an elevation of between 1000 and 2000 meters. Currently, a total of 270 Ribus are known across the Indonesian archipelago, including those in Malaysia and East Timor.&lt;ref name="gunungbagging"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunungbagging.com/prominence/|title=List of Indonesian and Malaysian mountains by Prominence - Gunung Bagging|work=gunungbagging.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are popular hikes, such as [[Mount Rinjani]], [[Mount Semeru]], and [[Mount Kerinci]], while others are much more obscure, and some do not even have official names.

Some famous Indonesian mountains, such as [[Mount Bromo]] and [[Tangkuban Perahu]], are not ribus because they are connected to higher peaks by high passes and therefore do not achieve enough topographic prominence. However, a subsidiary category of '''spesial''' (Indonesian for "special") peaks contains those deemed of such significant touristic interest that they merit inclusion, albeit subjectively, in a secondary list. At the moment, the Gunung Bagging website counts 115 Indonesian spesials.&lt;ref name="gunungbagging"/&gt;

The list of the Indonesian ribus was compiled by Andy Dean and [[Daniel Patrick Quinn]]. As of October 2018, nobody is known to have completed the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunungbagging.com/fame/|title=Gunung Bagging Hall of Fame 2017 - Gunung Bagging|work=gunungbagging.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term "ribu" has been adopted to describe "mountains that exceed a prominence of 1000 meters" also outside Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/oetk/docs/oetk_magazin_4-2012/9|title=ISSUU - ÖTK Klubmagazin 4/2012 by ÖTK Österreichischer Touristenklub|author=ÖTK Österreichischer Touristenklub|work=Issuu|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lischanahuette.ch/NZ/ribu.htm|title=nikis webseite - projekt RIBU|work=lischanahuette.ch|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "spesial"-category remains acknowledged only there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">'''Sociomapping''' is a method developed for [[data analysis|processing]] and [[Information visualization|visualization]] of relational data (e.g. social network data). It is most commonly used for mapping the social structure within small teams (10-25 people). Sociomapping uses the landscape metaphor to display complex multi-dimensional data in a 3D [[map]], where individual objects are localized in such way that their distance on the map corresponds to their distance in the underlying data.

Thanks to its visual coding Sociomapping engages our evolved skills for [[spatial orientation]] and [[movement detection]], thus making the interpretation of complex data easy and accessible for everyone.

==History==
The sociomapping method was developed in 1993-1994 by R. Bahbouh as a tool that would facilitate understanding of data about social relations and help preventing conflicts within teams of military professionals. The first major application of sociomapping took place in 1994-1995 during the HUBES experiment (Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight) – a 135-day-long simulation of a spaceflight with three crew members organized by [[European Space Agency]]. Sociomapping was then regularly used in other spaceflight simulations (1995-1996: EKOPSY, 1999: Mars105, 2010-2012: [[Mars500]]). Since 2005, sociomapping has been extensively used in business environment to analyze relationships within senior management teams. In 2012, C. Höschl jr. developed Real Time Sociomapping®
software that enables customers to do team sociomapping on the spot and is used for commercial purposes.

==Basic principle==
The basic principle of Sociomapping is transforming original data concerning a set of objects in such a way that the distance of each pair of objects on the map corresponds to the distance between the two objects in the underlying data. Transformation of the data is a matter of 1) choosing some metric that could be reasonably interpreted as distance, and 2) translating the multi-dimensional distance matrix into 2D coordinate system so that the correlation between map-distances and data-distances is maximized. 
The algorithm for data-transformation, developed by C. Höschl jr., is thus a [[Dimensionality reduction|dimensionality-reduction]] technique, such as [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], and its goodness of fit can be measured by [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman correlation]] between the map-distances and data-distances. 
Sociomapping takes into account that, particularly in case of social relations, relational data may be asymmetrical (e.g. John like Mary more than she likes him) and preserves this information by mapping the objects in such a way that for each object the closest other object is the one closest to it according to the metric of choice in the underlying data, and so on for other objects ordered by distance.

==Application==
There are two main areas of application for Sociomapping – groups (small systems) and populations (large systems). For each area a different method of visualization and data transformation is used in order to facilitate people’s ability to understand and interpret the analyzed data.

===Groups and small systems===
Sociomapping for small systems produces Sociomaps of subjects. These subjects (in most cases people) are placed on the Sociomap reflecting their distance measured in various ways:
* [[social distance]]
* psychological distance (psychological similarity)
* communication distance
* other relation measures

Besides the distances between the group members, Sociomap shows additional variable coded in the height (or color) of the subject. Typical variables used for the height are: social status, [[Key performance indicators|performance indicators]] of the subjects, average communication frequency, etc.

Understanding the relative distances between the people helps to understand the structure of the group, find subgroups formed by groups members and discover functions of the group members. In connection to the height Sociomap enables complex and comprehensive insight into the groups and small systems.

Sociomapping of small systems produces similar results to [[social network analysis]] with additional visualization features.

===Profile analysis===
Besides the small systems analysis based on various relational data, Sociomapping can be used to visualize the profiles of unrelated subjects. This is done by transformation of profiles of the subjects, computing the distances between the profiles and visualizing them in a Sociomap.
There is a software to compute Profile analysis (see section Sociomapping software)

===Populations and large systems===
For large systems and populations, different type of Sociomaps is used. Data used for these type of maps are rectangular [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], where for each subject there is a [[preference vector]] of selected objects (such as [[political parties]], [[brands]], [[Product (business)|products]], and so on). 
In order to create a Sociomap, for each subject a position in the map is determined, and a small piece of mass representing this subject is placed on the map according to its vector of preferences to an object.  As a result, there are places on the Sociomap where more subject are placed (hills) and where there are no subject (valleys). Therefore, hills are formed on the places representing typical preference configurations and this allows for visual cluster analysis, or segmentation.
In this sense, Large systems Sociomapping is a [[data mining]] approach based on visual [[pattern recognition]]).

Typical uses for Large systems Sociomapping are:
* [[Political science|political research]] (preferences and polls)
* [[marketing research]] (attitudes and product preferences)
* [[customer segmentation]] (behavioral patterns)
* and other research concerned with preferences and/or attitudes.

==Broader scope of application==
Sociomapping has broader scope of application, including the following fields:

*Historical events analysis (e.g.  [[RMS Titanic]] survival rate)
*[[Internet community]] tools (e.g.  [[Last.fm]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219081705/http://qed-portal.com/en/last_fm/tool/] profile similarity)
*[[Literature]] analysis (e.g.  analysis of communication in [[Shakespeare plays]])
*[[Military]] units and [[human spaceflight]] crews analysis
*[[Sport]] analysis and forecast (e.g. cooperation of sport teams)
*[[Politics]] analysis and forecast
*[[Team building]]
*Team analysis (communication, cooperation, decision-making)

==Software==

So far only one software tool based on Sociomapping was released.

'''Team profile analyzer''' [http://www.teamprofileanalyzer.com/] is a tool for psychologists, consultants, managers and HR specialists. It enables integration of various sources of information about team from personality, performance or knowledge [[psychological testing|tests]] and biographical data. It can be used for team analysis and development: team coaching, [[team building]], [[recruitment]] etc.

'''South Yemen''' is the common English name for the '''People's Democratic Republic of Yemen''' ({{lang-ar|جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية}} ''{{transl|ar|Jumhūriyat al-Yaman ad-Dīmuqrāṭīyah ash-Sha'bīyah}}''), which existed from 1967 to 1990 as a state in the [[Middle East]] in the southern and eastern provinces of the present-day [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]], including the island of [[Socotra]]. It was also referred to as '''Democratic Yemen''' or '''Yemen (Aden)'''.

South Yemen's origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British [[colony of Aden]] and the [[Aden Protectorate]], which consisted of two-thirds of the present-day Yemen. However, Aden became a province within the [[British Raj]] in 1937. After the collapse of Aden Protectorate, the [[Aden Emergency|state of emergency]] was declared in 1963 when the [[National Liberation Front (South Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] (NLF) and the [[Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen]] (FLOSY) rebelled against British rule.

The [[Federation of South Arabia]] and the [[Protectorate of South Arabia]] merged to become South Yemen on 30 November 1967 and became a [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[socialist state|socialist]] [[republic]] in 1970 supported by the [[Soviet Union]]. Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region, it was involved in a [[South Yemen Civil War|brief civil war]] in 1986. With the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]], South Yemen was unified with the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] (commonly known as "[[North Yemen]]") on 22 May 1990, to form the present-day Yemen. After four years, however, South Yemen declared its secession from the north, which resulted in the north occupying south Yemen and the [[1994 civil war in Yemen|1994 civil war]]. Another [[South Yemen insurgency|attempt to restore South Yemen]] continues on since 2017.

==History==
{{main|History of Yemen}}

===British rule===
In 1838, Sultan [[Muhsin Bin Fadl]] of the state of [[Sultanate of Lahej|Lahej]] ceded 194&amp;nbsp;km² (75 sq. miles) including [[Aden Province|Aden]] to the [[British Empire|British]]. On 19 January 1839, the [[British East India Company]] landed [[Royal Marines]] at Aden to occupy the territory and stop attacks by [[pirate]]s against British shipping to [[India]]. It then became an important trading hub between [[British India]] and the [[Red Sea]], and following the opening of the [[Suez canal]] in 1869, it became a [[coal]]ing station for ships en route to [[India]]. Aden was ruled as part of [[British India]] until 1937, when the city of Aden became the [[Colony of Aden]]. The Aden [[hinterland]] and [[Hadhramaut]] to the east formed the remainder of what would become South Yemen and was not administered directly by Aden but were tied to Britain by treaties of protection with local rulers of traditional polities that, together, became known as the [[Aden Protectorate]]. [[Economic development]] was largely centered in Aden, and while the city flourished, the states of the Aden Protectorate [[Economic stagnation|stagnated]].

===Decolonization===
In 1963, Aden and much of the Protectorate were joined to form the [[Federation of South Arabia]] with the remaining states that declined to join, mainly in Hadhramaut, forming the separate [[Protectorate of South Arabia]].  Both of these polities were still tied to Britain with promises of total independence in 1968.
Two [[nationalism|nationalist]] groups, the [[Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen]] (FLOSY) and the [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), began an armed struggle known as the [[Aden Emergency]] on 14 October 1963 against British control and, with the temporary closure of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1967, the British began to withdraw. One faction, NLF, was invited to the Geneva Talks to sign the independence agreement with the British. However, Britain - who during its occupation of Aden signed several treaties of protection with the local sheikhdoms and emirates of the [[Federation of South Arabia]] - excluded them in the talks and thus the agreement stated "...the handover of the territory of South Arabia to the (Yemeni) NLF...". Southern Yemen became independent as the People's Republic of Southern Yemen on 30 November 1967, and the National Liberation Front consolidated its control in the country.

In June 1969, a radical [[Marxist]] wing of the NLF gained power and on 1 December 1970, reorganized the country into the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Subsequently, all political parties were amalgamated into the National Liberation Front, renamed the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]], which became the only legal party. The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen established close ties with the [[Soviet Union]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Cuba]],  and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian Liberation Organization]]. [[East Germany]]'s constitution of 1968 even served as a kind of blueprint for the PDRY's first constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-3225-5/a-spectre-is-haunting-arabia|title=A Spectre is haunting Arabia - How the Germans brought their Marxism to Yemen|last=Müller|first=Miriam M.|publisher=Transcript|year=2015|isbn=978-3-8376-3225-5|location=Bielefeld|pages=257ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major communist powers assisted in the building of the PDRY's [[armed forces]]. Strong support from Moscow resulted in Soviet naval forces gaining access to naval facilities in South Yemen.

[[File:Arabia 1914.png|thumbnail|The Arabian peninsula in 1914]]
Unlike the early decades of [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]], [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]], or [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]], [[North Yemen]] (YAR) and South Yemen (PDRY) remained relatively friendly, though relations were often strained. Fighting broke out in 1972, and a short-lived, small proxy border conflict was resolved with negotiations, where it was declared unification would eventually occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=North and South Yemen: In Search of Unity |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=January 19, 1990 |via={{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51196986/CIA-Study-on-Yemeni-Unification |title=CIA Study on Yemeni Unification |publisher=Scribd}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gause |first=Gregory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yUzV-g2X2QC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Saudi-Yemeni relations: domestic structures and foreign influence |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1990 |page=98|isbn=9780231070447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these plans were put on hold in 1979, as the PDRY funded Red rebels in the YAR, and war was only prevented by an [[Arab League]] intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in [[Kuwait]] in March 1979.

In 1980, PDRY president [[Abdul Fattah Ismail]] resigned and went into exile in [[Moscow]], having lost the confidence of his sponsors in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Halliday |first=Fred |title=Revolution and Foreign Policy: The Case of South Yemen, 1967–1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Ali Nasir Muhammad]], took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring [[Oman]].

===Civil war===
{{main|South Yemen Civil War}}
On January 13, 1986, a violent struggle began in Aden between Ali Nasir's supporters and supporters of the returned Ismail, who wanted power back. Fighting, known as the [[South Yemen Civil War]], lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties, Ali Nasir's [[coup d'état|ouster]], and Ismail's death. Some 60,000 people, including the deposed Ali Nasir, fled to the YAR. [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]], an ally of Ismail who had succeeded in escaping the attack on pro-Ismail members of the Politburo, then became General Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Katz |first=Mark |url=http://digilib.gmu.edu:8080/jspui/bitstream/1920/3127/1/civil%20conflict%20in%20south%20yemen.pdf |title=Civil Conflict in South Yemen |journal=Middle East Review |date=Fall 1986 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172214/http://digilib.gmu.edu:8080/jspui/bitstream/1920/3127/1/civil%20conflict%20in%20south%20yemen.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms and attempts for unification===
{{main|Yemeni unification}}

Against the background of the [[perestroika]] in the USSR, the main backer of the PDRY, political reforms were started in the late 1980s. Political prisoners were released, political parties were formed and the system of justice was reckoned to be more equitable than in the North. In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarize the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card. In 1990, the parties reached a full agreement on joint governing of Yemen, and the countries were effectively merged as [[Yemen]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Reviving South Yemen ==
{{main|Southern Movement}}
Since 2007, some Southerners have been actively protesting for independence, in a movement known as 'Al Hirak' or the [[Southern Movement]]. During the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015)|Yemen Civil War 2015]], in response to incursions by the [[Houthis]] and military forces loyal to deposed Yemeni president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], members of the Southern Movement formed 'Popular Resistance' militias. Since the [[Battle of Aden (2015)|Battle of Aden]], these armed groups have sought to defend the South against Houthi/Saleh attempts to take over the country and have taken the current state of civil war as opportunity to further their struggle for independence.

In late January 2018, separatists loyal to the [[Southern Transitional Council]] successfully seized control of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government [[headquarter]]s in Aden in an apparent [[2018 Yemeni coup d'état|coup d'etat]] against the [[Cabinet of Yemen|Hadi government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42852285|title=Separatist clashes flare in south Yemen|date=30 January 2018|publisher=|access-date=30 January 2018|via=www.BBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/monde/yemen-les-separatistes-sudistes-a-la-recherche-de-l-independance-perdue-28-01-2018-2190258_24.php|title=Yémen: les séparatistes sudistes, à la recherche de l'indépendance perdue|date=28 January 2018|work=[[Le Point]]|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social life==

South Yemen's ethnic groups are [[Arab]]s (92.8%), [[Somali people|Somali]]s (3.7%), Blacks 1.1%, Indians and Pakistanis (1%), and other (1.4%) (2000).
The only recognized political party in South Yemen was the [[Yemeni Socialist Party]], which ran the country and the economy along self-described [[Marxist]] lines, modeled on the [[Soviet Union]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The constitution prescribed [[universal suffrage]].

The [[Supreme People's Council (South Yemen)|Supreme People's Council]] was appointed by the General Command of the [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] in 1971.

In Aden, there was a structured judicial system with a [[supreme court]].

Education was paid for through general taxation.

There was no housing crisis in South Yemen. Surplus housing built by the [[United Kingdom|British]] meant that there were few homeless people in Aden, and people built their own houses out of [[adobe]] and mud in the rural areas.

South Yemen developed as a [[Marxist]], mostly [[secular]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Laessing |first=Ulf |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/22/us-yemen-women-idUSTRE60L2ZD20100122 |title=Women of southern Yemen port remember better times |agency=Reuters |date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; society ruled first by the [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]], which later morphed into the ruling [[Yemeni Socialist Party]].

===Sports===
In 1976, the [[South Yemen national football team]] participated in the [[Asia Cup]], where the team lost to Iraq 1-0 and to Iran 8-0. They entered their only World Cup qualification campaign in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and were knocked out in the first round by Bahrain. On September 2, 1965, South Yemen played their first international match against [[Egypt national football team|the United Arab Republic]], to whom they lost 14-0. On November 5, 1989, South Yemen played its last international match against [[Guinea national football team|Guinea]], to whom they lost 1-0. The team stopped playing when the North and South united in 1990 to form the modern state of Yemen.

In 1988, the South Yemen Olympic team [[South Yemen at the 1988 Summer Olympics|made its debut in Seoul]]. Sending only eight athletes, the country won no medals. This was the only time the country went to the Olympics until unification in 1990.

==Governorates==
Following independence, South Yemen was divided into six [[governorate]]s ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] sg. ''muhafazah''), with roughly natural boundaries, each given a name by [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]. From 1967 to 1978, they were named officially by numerals only; from 1979 to 1990, they were given new official names. The islands: [[Kamaran]] (until 1972, when it was seized by North Yemen), Perim (Meyun), [[Socotra]], Abd-el-Kuri, Samha (inhabited), Darsah and others uninhabited from the [[Socotra]] archipelago were districts (''mudiriyah'') of the First/Aden Governorate being under Prime-Minister of the state supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Economy==
There was little [[industry|industrial]] output, or mineral wealth exploitation, in South Yemen, until the mid-1980s, following the discovery of significant petroleum reserves in the central regions near [[Shibam]] and [[Mukalla]]. The main sources of income were [[agriculture]], mostly [[fruit]], [[cereal crop]]s, [[cattle]] and [[sheep]], [[fishing]] and later, oil exports.

The national [[budget]] was 13.43 million dinars in 1976, and the [[gross national product]] was [[US dollar|US$]]150 million. The total national [[debt]] was $52.4 million.

==Airlines==
The following airlines had operated from the PDRY:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/RestofWorld/South%20Yemen/Airlines.asp |title=Airlines - South Yemen |work=The World's Airlines |publisher=David Lyall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4213">[[Image:Tamarix aphylla.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Tamarix]] tree occurs in this ecoregion]]
The '''Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion''', in the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]], is located in the eastern [[Sahara]]. The woodlands [[ecoregion]] occupy two separate highland regions, covering portions of northern [[Chad]], southwestern [[Egypt]], southern [[Libya]], and northwestern [[Sudan]].

==Setting==
The ecoregion covers {{convert|82,200|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in the volcanic [[Tibesti Mountains]] of Chad and Libya, and 1932-m peak of [[Jebel Uweinat]] on the border of Egypt, Libya, and Sudan. The climate is [[arid]] and [[subtropical]], but can reach 0°C at the highest altitudes during the winter.  Rainfall is irregular but more regular than the surrounding desert and may of the lower wadis are watered by rain which falls higher up.&lt;ref name = WWF&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1331 | title = Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands | accessdate = 2016-11-27 | publisher = World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibesti (and to a lesser extent the Jebel Uweinat massif) foster higher, more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures than the surrounding [[Sahara]]. This supports woodlands and shrublands of [[date palm]] (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]''), [[acacia]]s, [[Saharan Myrtle]] (''Myrtus nivellei''), [[oleander]] (''Nerium oleander''), [[tamarix]], and several [[endemism|endemic]] and rare plant species, such as ''[[Ficus teloukat]]''. The northern slopes are humid enough to support wetland species such as ''[[Juncus maritimus]]'', ''[[Typha australis]]'', ''[[Scirpus holoschoenus]]'', ''[[Phragmites australis]]'' and ''[[Equisetum ramosissimum]]''.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Fauna==
The ecoregion supports, or supported, populations of several important Saharan large mammals. One, the [[scimitar-horned oryx]] ''Oryx dammah'' is now believed to be extinct in the wild, while the [[addax]] ''Addax nasomaculatus'' is critically endangered.  Other species include [[dorcas gazelle]] ''Gazella dorcas'' which is assessed as vulnerable, [[dama gazelle]] ''Nanger dama'' which is endangered, [[Barbary sheep]] ''Ammotragus lervia'' which is vulnerable and [[cheetah]] ''Acinonyx jubatus'' which is vulnerable. In 2000 Barbary sheep and dama gaxelle were recorded in the Jebel Uweinat portion of the ecoregion.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt; 

Smaller mammals are abundant, including [[rock hyrax]] ''Procavia capensis'', [[Cape hare]] ''Lepus capensis'', many mice, [[gerbil]]s and [[jird]]s'  and three species of fox, [[Rüppell's fox]] ''Vulpes rueppelli'', [[pale fox]] ''Vulpes pallida'' and [[fennec fox]] ''Fennecus zerda''. Other predators are found in the region including a relict population of [[African wild dog]] ''Lycaon pictus'' as well as [[striped hyena]] ''Hyaena hyaena'' and [[golden jackal]] ''Canis aureus'', primarily in the southern portion of the region.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Locusts==
In habitats dominated by ''[[Schouwia]]'' and ''[[Tribulus terrestris]]'' in the wadis of this region, have an important role in the life cycle of the [[desert locust]]. This is where the female locusts lay their eggs, as the soil is moist and when the locust nymphs emerge, the leaves of ''Schouwia'' and ''Tribulus'' are fed on, allowing the nymphs to get enough food and water to mature. In some years, if conditions are right they can amass into large swarms, eventually becoming a plague which can reach distant areas of Africa and Europe, and have a huge economic impact by destroying crops.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

Peacekeeping operations are overseen by the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)]] and share some common characteristics, namely the inclusion of a military or police component, often with an authorization for use of force under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]] of the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]. Peacekeeping operations are distinct from special political missions (SPMs), which are overseen by the [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department of Political Affairs (DPA)]]. SPMs are not included in the table below.

The '''''Triangolo lariano''''' is a [[Geography|geographic]] area in [[Lombardy]] ([[Italy]]) within the [[Province of Como]]. It is represented by a territorial intermediate institution named ''[[:simple:Italian mountain community|Comunità montana]] del Triangolo lariano'', with base in [[Canzo]].

== Topography ==
[[Image:Bollettone-Corni_di_Canzo.JPG|thumb|250px|Mounts [[Corni di Canzo]] ([[Canzo]]'s Horns) (in the foreground), with Pizzo dei Tre Signori in the background.]]

There are three big lakes in [[Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.gov.it/mit/mop_all.php?p_id=07307 Governative administration of the big lakes]. In Italian.&lt;/ref&gt; who reach a depth of more than 300 [[metre]]s and cover an area of hundreds of [[square kilometre]]s. They are aligned west-east, since they all are within the [[Alpine foothills|pre-alpine]] zone of [[Lombardy]] region. The most west is the [[Lake Maggiore]], and it marks the boundary with the region of [[Piedmont]]; the most east is [[Lake Garda]], marking the boundary with the region of [[Veneto]]; the central one is [[Lake Como]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italia.it/en/travel-ideas/lakes/lombardy-the-lakes-region.html Page on Lombardy and lakes on Governative national Italian portal for tourism]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinguishable from its characteristic shape of an upside-down “[[Y]]” or a [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] “[[Lambda|λ]]”. The triangle formed by the two diagonal branches of the lake is named in [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Triangolo lariano''. This phrase is composed by the noun ''triangolo'' (= triangle) and the adjective ''lariano'', meaning “related to the Larius”, the [[Latin language|Latin]] name of [[Lake Como]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/lariano/ ''Lariano'' on an authoritative Italian dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists in a [[peninsula]] – whose end is the village of [[Bellagio, Lombardy|Bellagio]] –, but it can be considered as quite an [[island]], because the third side of the triangle (not occupied by the [[Lake Como]]) is dotted with seven smaller lakes. The touristic town of [[Canzo]] lies at the center of the ''Triangolo lariano'' and is the chief town of the ''Comunità montana del Triangolo lariano'' (literally, “Mountain community of ''Triangolo lariano''”), a territorial institution who brings together the 31 [[Comune|municipalities]] of the peninsula, of about 71,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.78.2.155/cmtl/hh/index.php Official presentation of the agency]. In Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], the territory of ''Triangolo lariano'' was divided into four main institutions, three of which was part of the State of [[Milan]]; one, instead, was under the rule of the Commune of [[Como]]:
* One was the [[Pieve]] of Asso ([[Valassina]] valley) of the [[Archdiocese of Milan]] and, then, also of the [[Duchy of Milan]].
* Another one was the ''[[Curtis Casalensis]]'', a league of free communes with [[Canzo]] as chief town, within the jurisdiction of the [[Duchy of Milan]] too.
* Part of the former [[Pieve]] of ''Incino'' (= [[Erba, Lombardy|Erba]]), [[Duchy of Milan]].
* Finally, communes who were under the rule of Como ([[Bellagio, Lombardy|Bellagio]] itself, and the villages on the western coast of the [[Lake Como|Lake]]).&lt;ref&gt;Longoni, Virginio (1999).

== Lakes and mountains ==

The “Triangle” has an altitude between 320 and 1,682 m.a.s.l.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmtl.it/gis/ Map on the official site of ''Comunità montana del Triangolo lariano'']&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous mountains are: [[Corni di Canzo]] ([[Canzo]]’s Horns) (1,372 m) and Mount [[Cornizzolo]] (1,241 m), both in [[Canzo]], divided by Mount Raj (1,261 m), also in [[Canzo]], as a tourist destination because of the variety and attractiveness of the landscape;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifemgn-serviziecosistemici.eu/EN/Documents/LIFE+MGN_Brochure_EN.pdf Official presentation of the protected areas of Lombardy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monte San Primo|Mount San Primo]] (1,682 m) and Mount [[Palanzone]] (1,436 m) for their highness. Mount [[Bollettone]] (1,317 m) too, for its proximity to [[Como]], is often visited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulliver.it/itinerario/4123/] (Accessed on July 25, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven small lakes forming the southern border of the region are: Lake of [[Pusiano]], [[Lago di Annone|Lake of Annone]] (divided into ''Lake of Annone'' strictly said and Lake of [[Oggiono]]), Lake of [[Garlate]], [[Lago di Alserio|Lake of Alserio]], Lake of [[Montorfano]], and, finally, the [[Lago del Segrino|Lake Segrino]] – placed in the southern border of the land of [[Canzo]] –, a marvelous little glacial lake, celebrated by several authors and poets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ippolito Nievo]], ''La pazza del Segrino'', [[Milan]], Sanvito 1860; [[Antonio Fogazzaro]], ''[[Malombra (novel)|Malombra]]'', [[Milan]], Brigola 1881; [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]], ''La cognizione del dolore'', Letterarura 1941/Einaudi 1963.

''Triangolo lariano'' is also the name of a [[Special Protection Area]] (593 [[hectare]]s) protected by European laws, located in the [[Corni di Canzo]] (Horns of [[Canzo]]). Its protection concerns 84 precious [[bird]] [[species]] (including the [[European honey buzzard|honey buzzard]], the [[peregrine falcon]], the [[rock partridge]], the [[eagle owl]], the [[nightjar]], the [[tawny pipit]], the [[red-backed shrike]], and the [[ortolan bunting]]) and the habitats, e.g. the natural dry grasslands and [[scrubland]] facies on calcareous substrates (Festuco-Brometalia) – with significant blossoming of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] –, the [[limestone]] pavements and the petrifying springs with [[tufa]] formation (Cratoneurion), and the calcareous [[beech]] forests of Central Europe Cephalanthero-Fagion. Inside is another [[nature reserve]], the [[Site of Community Importance]] “''Sasso Malascarpa''" (328 [[hectare]]s), with 52 protected [[species]], among which are the [[greater horseshoe bat]], various kinds of [[Lanius|backed shrike]], and the rare [[Austropotamobius pallipes|white-clawed crayfish]]. A peculiar habitat of the reserve consists in the stone springs with [[travertine]] formation. The alternation of woods, meadows–pastures, and rock formations in the mountains of [[Canzo]], makes the landscape particularly popular for tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifemgn-serviziecosistemici.eu/EN/Documents/LIFE+MGN_Brochure_EN.pdf Official presentation of the protected areas of Lombardy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Valley of Mexico''' ({{lang-es|Valle de México}}; {{lang-nah|Tepētzallāntli Mēxihco}}) is a highlands [[plateau]] in central [[Mexico]] roughly coterminous with present-day [[Mexico City]] and the eastern half of the [[State of Mexico]]. Surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, the Valley of Mexico was a centre for several [[pre-Columbian]] [[civilization]]s, including [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Toltec]], and the [[Aztec]]. The ancient Aztec term ''[[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]] (Land Between the Waters) '' and the phrase '''Basin of Mexico''' are both used at times to refer to the Valley of Mexico. The Basin of Mexico became a well known site that epitomized the scene of early Classic Mesoamerican cultural development as well.

The Valley of Mexico is located in the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]].&lt;ref name="PorruaCuenca"&gt;{{cite book

The valley contains most of the [[Greater Mexico City|Mexico City Metropolitan Area]], as well as parts of the [[State of Mexico]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Puebla]]. The Valley of Mexico can be subdivided into four basins, but the largest and most-studied is the area which contains [[Mexico City]]. This section of the valley in particular is colloquially referred to as the "Valley of Mexico".&lt;ref name="lafragua"&gt;{{cite paper |last=Lafregua |first=J |author2=Gutierrez, A |author3=Aguilar E |author4=Aparicio J |author5=Mejia R |author6=Santillan O |author7=Suarez MA |author8=Preciado M |title=Balance hídrico del Valle de Mexico |publisher=Anuario IMTA |year=2003 |url=http://chac.imta.mx/instituto/historial-proyectos/th/2003/HDR1-Balance.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCrS33C1?url=http://chac.imta.mx/instituto/historial-proyectos/th/2003/HDR1-Balance.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this vulnerable watershed all the native fishes were extinct by the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in passing by Christian Lévêque, ''Biodiversity Dynamics and Conservation: The Freshwater Fish of Tropical Africa'', 1997 "Introduction" p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrologically, the valley has three features. The first feature is the lakebeds of five now-extinct lakes, which are located in the southernmost and largest of the four sub-basins. The other two features are [[Foothills|piedmont]], and the mountainsides that collect the precipitation that eventually flows to the lake area. These last two are found in all four of the sub-basins of the valley.&lt;ref name="PorruaCuenca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lafragua"/&gt; Today, the Valley drains through a series of artificial canals to the [[Tula River]], and eventually the [[Pánuco River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations that have arisen in this area include the [[Teotihuacan]] (800&amp;nbsp;BC to 800&amp;nbsp;AD) the [[Toltec Empire]] (10th to 13th century) and the [[Aztec Empire]] (1325&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1521).&lt;ref name="Kirkwood"/&gt; When the Spaniards arrived in the Valley of Mexico, it had one of the highest population concentrations in the world with about one million people.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], the Spaniards rebuilt the largest and most dominant city here, [[Tenochtitlan]], renaming it Mexico City.

Today, around 21&amp;nbsp;million people live in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area which extends throughout almost all of the valley into the states of Mexico and Hidalgo.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt;

The growth of a major urban, industrial centre in an enclosed basin has created significant air and water quality issues for the valley. Wind patterns and [[thermal inversion]]s trap contaminants in the valley. Over-extraction of ground water has caused new flooding problems for the city as it sinks below the historic lake floor. This causes stress on the valley's drainage system, requiring new tunnels and canals to be built.&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thielman"&gt;{{cite web

==History of human habitation==
{{Main|History of Mexico}}

===First human habitation===

The Valley of Mexico attracted early humans because the region was rich in biodiversity and had the capacity of growing substantial crops.&lt;ref name="Kirkwood"/&gt; Generally speaking, humans in [[Mesoamerica]], including central Mexico, began to leave a hunter-gatherer existence in favor of agriculture sometime between the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Geologic time scale|epoch]] and the beginning of the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref name="Acosta"/&gt; The oldest known human settlement in the Valley of Mexico is located in [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], located on what was the edge of Lake Chalco in the southeast corner of the valley in contemporary Mexico State. There is reliable archeological evidence to suggest that the site dates as far back as 12,000&amp;nbsp;BC. After 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC, the number of artifacts found increases significantly. There are also other early sites such as those in Tepexpan, Los Reyes Acozac, [[San Bartolo Atepehuacan]], [[Chimalhuacán]] and [[Los Reyes Acaquilpan|Los Reyes La Paz]] but they remain undated. Human remains and artifacts such as obsidian blades have been found at the Tlapacoya site that have been dated as far back as 20,000 BC, when the valley was semi-arid and contained species like [[camel]]s, [[bison]] and horses that could be hunted by man.&lt;ref name="protocolo"/&gt; However, the precise dating of these artifacts has been disputed.&lt;ref name="Acosta"/&gt;
[[File:Museo paleontologico de Tocuila-mandibula.JPG|thumb|left|A Columbian mammoth jaw excavated at [[Paleontological Museum in Tocuila|Tocuila]]]]
Giant [[Columbian mammoth]]s once populated the area, and the valley contains the most extensive mammoth kill sites in Mexico. Most of the sites are located on what were the shores of Lake Texcoco in the north of the Federal District and the adjacent municipalities of Mexico State such as in [[Santa Isabel Ixtapan]], [[Los Reyes Acozac]], [[Tepexpan]]  and [[Tlalnepantla de Baz|Tlanepantla]].&lt;ref name="Anaya"&gt;{{cite journal

They have been discovered in many parts of the Federal District itself, particularly during the construction of the city's [[Mexico City Metro|Metro lines]] and in the neighborhoods of [[Colonia del Valle|Del Valle]] in the center, [[Colonia Lindavista|Lindavista]] to the center-north and [[Coyoacán]] in the south of the city. The symbol for Line&amp;nbsp;4's Bondojito station of the Mexico City Metro is a mammoth, due to the fact that so many bones were uncovered during its construction. However, the richest site for mammoth remains in the valley is at the [[Paleontological Museum in Tocuila]], a {{convert|45|ha|sp=us|adj=on}} site located near the town of [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] in Mexico State.&lt;ref name="Anaya"/&gt; Although there is some evidence around the old lakeshores that the first populations here survived by hunting, gathering and possibly by scavenging, but evidence from this time period is scarce.&lt;ref name="Acosta"/&gt;

===Pre-Teotihuacan===

[[File:Acróbata de Tlatilco.JPG|thumb|Ceramic art recovered from [[Tlatilco]], [[circa]] 1300–800 BC]]
[[Tlatilco]] was a large [[pre-Columbian]] village and culture in the Valley of Mexico situated near the modern-day town of the same name in the [[Mexican Federal District]]. It was one of the first significant population centers to arise in the valley, flourishing on the western shore of Lake Texcoco during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Pre-Classic period]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://historyofthought.as.uky.edu/index.php/Archaeology_and_Mapping See also:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221062729/http://historyofthought.as.uky.edu/index.php/Archaeology_and_Mapping |date=December 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  between 1200&amp;nbsp;BC and 200&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Neiderberger"&gt;{{cite book

It was then classified as a major chiefdom center. The Tlatilcans were an agricultural people growing beans, [[amaranth]], squash and [[chili pepper]]s, reaching their peak from 1000 to 700&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Neiderberger"/&gt;

The next-oldest confirmed civilization is in the far south of the valley and is called [[Cuicuilco]].&lt;ref name="lopezcamacho"&gt;{{cite web

The old settlement once extended far beyond the boundaries of the current site, but it is buried under lava from one of the volcanic eruptions that led to its demise, and much of the modern city is built over this lava. The settlement was located where an old river delta used to form in the valley with waters from Mount Zacatépetl located in what is now the Tlalpan Forest. Cuicuilco was believed to have reached city status by 1200&amp;nbsp;BC and began to decline around 100 BC - AD 150. However, even though the ceremonial pyramid was abandoned, the site remained a location to leave offerings up to AD 400, although lava from the nearby [[Xitle]] volcano completely covered it.&lt;ref name="lopezcamacho"/&gt;

===Teotihuacan and the Toltecs===

Around 2,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, the Valley of Mexico became one of the world's most densely populated areas and has remained so since.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; After the decline of Cuicuilco, the population concentration shifted north, to the city of Teotihuacan and later to [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], both outside the lake's region of the valley.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt; Teotihuacan became an organized village around 800&amp;nbsp;BC but it was around 200&amp;nbsp;BC that it began to reach its height. When it did, the city had approximately 125,000&amp;nbsp;inhabitants and covered {{convert|20|km2|0|sp=us}} of territory. It was dedicated primarily to the [[obsidian]] trade and at its peak was an important religious center and [[pilgrimage]] for the valley.&lt;ref name="inah"&gt;{{cite web

}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 8th&amp;nbsp;century, with the rise of the [[Toltec]] empire, Teotihuacan ceased to be a major urban centre and the population shifted to Tollan or Tula on the northern front of Valley of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;

===Aztec Empire===
After the end of the Toltec empire in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century and the decline of the city of Tula, the population shifted once again, this time to the lakes region of the valley. With this migration came the concept of a city-state based on the Toltec model. By the end of the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, some fifty small urban units, semi-autonomous and with their own religious centers, had sprung up around the lakeshores of the valley. These remained intact with a population of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;each under Aztec rule and survived into the colonial period. All of these city-states, including the largest and most powerful, [[Tenochtitlan]], with more than 150,000&amp;nbsp;inhabitants, claimed descent from the Toltecs. None of these cities was completely autonomous or self-sufficient, resulting in a conflictive political situation, and a complex system of agriculture in the valley.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt; These city-states had similar governmental structures based on the need to control flooding and store water for irrigating crops. Many of the institutions created by these hydraulic societies, such as the building and maintenance of chinampas, aqueducts and dikes, were later co-opted by the Spanish during the colonial period.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite book

The largest and most dominant city at the time of the Spanish conquest was [[Tenochtitlan]]. It was founded by the [[Mexica]] ([[Aztecs]]) on a small island in the western part of Lake Texcoco in 1325, and was extended with the use of [[chinampa]]s, human-made extensions of agricultural land into the southern lake system, to increase productive agricultural land, covering about {{convert|9000|ha|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;  The inhabitants controlled the lake with a sophisticated system of [[Dike (construction)|dike]]s, canals and [[sluice]]s. Much of the surrounding land in the valley was [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced and farmed]] as well, with a network of [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s channeling fresh water from springs in the mountainsides into the city itself.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; Despite being the dominant power, the need to rely on resources from other parts of the valley led to the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] between Tenochtitlan, [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] and [[Tlacopan]] at the beginning of the empire. However, by the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, Tenochtitlan had become the dominant power of the three, causing grievances that the Spaniards were able to exploit.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt; However, despite Tenochtitlan's power outside the valley, it never completely controlled all of the valley itself, with the [[altepetl]] of Tlaxcala the most prominent example.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;

By 1520, the estimated population of the valley was over 1,000,000 people.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt;

===Spanish colonial rule and the Mexico City metropolitan area===
{{Main|History of Mexico City}}
After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]] in 1521, the Spanish rebuilt and renamed Tenochtitlan as Mexico City. They started with essentially the same size and layout as the Aztec city but as the centuries progressed, the city grew as the lakes shrank. Just after the conquest, disease and violence had decreased the population in the valley, especially of the native peoples, but after that, the population grew all through the colonial period and in the century after [[Mexican War of Independence|independence]].&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;

By the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the population of Mexico City alone had risen to over one million people. A population explosion began early in the 20th century, with the population of the city itself doubling approximately every 15&amp;nbsp;years since 1900, partly attributed to the fact that the federal government has favored development of the metropolitan area over other areas of the country.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; This has spurred investment in [[infrastructure]] for the city, such as [[electricity]], other power sources, [[water supply]] and [[drainage]]. These have attracted businesses which in turn have attracted more population. Since the 1950s, urbanization has spread out from beyond the bounds of the Federal District to the surrounding jurisdictions, especially to the north into the State of Mexico making for the Mexico City Metropolitan area, which fills most of the valley.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; Today, this metropolitan area accounts for 45&amp;nbsp;per cent of the country's industrial activity, 38&amp;nbsp;percent of GNP, and 25&amp;nbsp;percent of the population.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; Much of its industry is concentrated in the northern part of the Federal District and the adjoining cities in the state of Mexico.&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt; While population growth has slowed and even declined in the city proper, the outer limits of the metropolitan area keep growing. Much of this growth has occurred on the mountainsides of the valley, in the form of illegal settlements in ecologically sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; Overall urban settlement in the valley has expanded from about {{convert|90|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}} in 1940 to {{convert|1160|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}} in 1990.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; The metropolitan area has about 21&amp;nbsp;million residents and about 6&amp;nbsp;million cars.&lt;ref name="Barclay"&gt;{{cite web

===Air pollution===
Mexico City is [[Air pollution in Mexico City|vulnerable to severe air pollution problems]] due to its altitude, its being surrounded by mountains and the winds patterns of the area.&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thielman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="molina"&gt;{{cite web
|url=  http://www.pulseplanet.com/dailyprogram/dailies.php?POP=2977
|title= Air Pollution: Mexico City
|date= 2003-07-29
|accessdate=2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude, with its low oxygen levels, makes for poor combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s leading to unsafe levels of [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[hydrocarbons]], and [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt; The valley is surrounded by mountain ranges with one small opening to the north. The surrounding mountains and climate patterns here make it difficult to clear out the smog produced.&lt;ref name="thielman"/&gt; The valley has internal wind patterns which circulate around the valley without a prevailing wind to push contaminants in a single direction.&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt; The most significant climatic phenomena here is "thermal inversion," which is prevalent in the winter months when the cooler air of the valley is trapped by relatively warmer air above. Adding to this is that prevailing winds outside the valley move from north to south, in through the Valley's one opening, where incidentally most of the region's industry is located.&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt; These factors diminish in the summer and the situation is helped by the arrival of the rainy season,&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt;  but the valley's southern latitude and the abundance of sunlight allows for dangerous levels of [[ozone]] and other dangerous compounds.&lt;ref name="molina"/&gt;
[[File:Smog boven mexico city november 1985.jpg|thumb|left|A [[NASA]] satellite image of [[smog]] in the Valley of Mexico in 1985]]

While still considered one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are not as bad as they were several decades ago.&lt;ref name="molina"/&gt; One major problem that was brought under control was the [[lead]] contamination in the air with the introduction of [[Gasoline|unleaded gasoline]]. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and [[sulfur dioxide]].&lt;ref name="molina"/&gt; The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and [[fine particles]] ([[soot]]) (between 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] and 10&amp;nbsp;micrometers).&lt;ref name="Barclay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="molina"/&gt; Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of [[fine particles]] of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="Barclay"/&gt;
In the 1940s, before large-scale burning of fossil fuels in the area, the visibility of the valley was about {{convert|100|km|-1|abbr=on|sp=us}}, allowing for daily viewing of the mountain ranges that surround the valley, including the snow-capped volcanoes of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. Since that time, the average visibility has come down to about {{convert|1.5|km|ft|-3|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Mountain peaks are now rarely visible from the city itself.&lt;ref name="yip"/&gt; While reduced visibility in the valley was due to sulfur emissions in the past, it is now due to [[fine particles]] in the air.&lt;ref name="thielman"/&gt;

The effects on humans living in an enclosed, contaminated environment have been documented, especially by [[Nobel Prize]] winner Dr [[Mario J. Molina]]. He claims [[fine particles|fine particle]] pollution is the greatest concern because of lung damage.&lt;ref name="molina"/&gt; According to him, the city's residents lose about 2.5&amp;nbsp;million working days every year due to health problems associated with [[fine particles]].&lt;ref name="Barclay"/&gt;

==Hydrology==
The Valley of Mexico is a closed basin which geologically divides into three hydrologic zones, the low plain, which is essentially the bed of now-extinct lakes, the piedmont area and the surrounding mountains. The old lakebeds correspond to the lowest elevations of the valley in the south are mostly clay with a high water content and are almost entirely covered by urban development.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt; In the piedmont area, these clays become mixed with silts and sands, and in some areas close to the mountains, the piedmont is largely composed of [[basalt]] from old lava flows. The valley is enclosed completely by mountain ranges, from which flow rain and melting snow into the valley's hydraulic system. This groundwater flow produces a number of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in the foothills and [[upwelling]]s in the valley floor.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt; This underground flow is the source of the five aquifers that provide much of the drinking water to Mexico City located in Soltepec, [[Apan]], [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]], [[Chalco de Díaz Covarrubias|Chalco]]-[[Amecameca]] and underneath Mexico City itself.&lt;ref name="lafragua"/&gt;

===Old lake system===
[[File:Lake Chalco 1847.PNG|thumb|right|An 1847 map of [[Lake Xochimilco]] and [[Lake Chalco]]]]
Before the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the Mexico City portion of the valley contained a series of lakes, with saline lakes to the north near the town of Texcoco and freshwater ones to the south.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt; The five lakes, Zumpango, Xaltoca, Xochimilco, Chalco, and the largest, Texcoco used to cover about {{convert|1500|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}} of the basin floor.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; Small mountains such as the [[Sierra de Guadalupe, Mexico|Sierra de Guadalupe]] and Mount Chiconaultla partially separated the lakes from each other.&lt;ref name="PorruaTezcoco"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=Editorial Porrua

|language=Spanish |isbn=968-452-908-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the other lakes flowed toward the lower Lake Texcoco, which was saline due to evaporation.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; The lakes were fed by a number of rivers such as the San Joaquin, San Antonio Abad, Tacubaya, Becerra, Mixcoac and Magdalena Contreras, carrying runoff and snowmelt from the mountains.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt;

Long before the arrival of the Spanish, the lake system had been shrinking due to climate change.&lt;ref name="protocolo"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2008 |title=Recrean 40 mil años de vida de la Cuenca de México |journal=Revista Protocolo |volume=31 |url=http://www.protocolo.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=11&amp;id_art=3146&amp;id_ejemplar=27 |language=Spanish |accessdate=25 November 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warmer temperatures had increased evaporation and reduced rainfall in the area so that the lakes’ waters were shallow at about five meters (16&amp;nbsp;ft) deep as early as the Tlapacoya culture, around 10,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="protocolo"/&gt; During the Aztec Empire, the northern lakes were inaccessible by canoe during the dry season from October to May.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;

===History of water control in the valley===
For 2000 years, humans have been interfering with and altering the hydraulic conditions of the valley, especially in the lakes region.&lt;ref name="protocolo"/&gt; The Aztecs built [[levee|dikes]] for flood control and to separate the [[saline water]] of the northern lakes from the [[fresh water]] of the southern ones. After the destruction of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the Spaniards rebuilt the Aztec dikes but found they did not offer enough flood protection.&lt;ref name="Montoya"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montoya Rivero |first=Maria Cristina |date=May–June 1999 |title=Del desagüe del Valle de México al drenaje profundo |trans-title=From the drainage of the Valley of Mexico to the complete dessication |journal=Mexico Desconocido |volume=30 |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/3841-Del-desag%FCe-del-Valle-de-M%E9xico-al-drenaje-profundo |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130111223106/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/3841-Del-desag%FCe-del-Valle-de-M%E9xico-al-drenaje-profundo |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-11 |language=Spanish |accessdate=25 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Spanish and subsequent efforts to drain the area for flood control was a major infrastructure project, called the {{lang|es|desagüe}}, was pursued the entire colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Louisa Schell |last=Hoberman |title=Technological Change in a Traditional Society: The Case of the Desagüe in Colonial Mexico |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=21 |issue=3 |date=July 1980 |pages=386–407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Boyer |title=La gran inundación: Vida y sociedad en México, 1629–1638 |trans-title=The great flood: Life and society in Mexico 1629–1638 |location=Mexico City |publisher=Sepsetentas |date=1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Musset |title=El agua en el valle de México: Siglos XVI–XVIII |trans-title=Water in the Valley of Mexico: 16th–17th centuries |location=Mexico City |publisher=Pórtico-CEMC |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jorge |last=Gurría Lacroix |title=El desagüe del valle de México durante la época novohispana |trans-title=The drainage of the Valley of Mexico in the era of New Spain |location=Mexico City |publisher=[[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] |year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |first=Vera |last=Candiani |title=The Desagüe Reconsidered: Environmental Dimensions of Class Conflict in Colonial Mexico |journal=Hispanic American Historical Review |volume=92 |issue=1 |year=2012 |pages=5–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of opening drainage canals first came about after a flood of the colonial city in 1555. The first canal was begun in 1605 to drain the waters of Lake Zumpango north through [[Huehuetoca]] which would also divert waters from the [[Cuautitlán]] River away from the lakes and toward the [[Tula River]]. This project was undertaken by [[Enrico Martínez]] and he devoted 25&amp;nbsp;years of his life to it. He did succeed in building a canal in this area, calling it Nochistongo, leading waters to the Tula Valley, but the drainage was not sufficient to avoid the Great Flood of 1629 in the city. Another canal, which would be dubbed the "Grand Canal" was built parallel to the Nochistongo one ending in [[Tequixquiac]]. The Grand Canal consists of one main canal, which measures {{convert|6.5|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in diameter and {{convert|50|km|-1|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="PorruaValle "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Diccionario Porrúa de Historia, Biografia y Geografia de Mexico |edition= 6th. |title=Mexico, Valle de |year=1995 |publisher=Editorial Porrúa |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=968-452-907-4 |volume=3 |pages=2249–2250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drainage project was continued after independence, with three secondary canals, built between 1856 and 1867. During the presidency of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (r. 1876–1911) again became a prioirity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Priscilla |last=Connolly |title=El contratista de don Porfirio: Obras públicas, deuda, y desarrollo desigual |trans-title=The contractor of Don Porfirio: Public works, debt, and unequal development |location=Mexico City |publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Manuel |last=Perló Cohen |title=El paradigma porfiriano: Historia del desagüe del Valle de México |trans-title=The Porfirian paradigm: A history of the drainage of the Valley of Mexico |location=Mexico City |publisher=Porrúa |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claudia |last=Agostoni |title=Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876–1910 |location=Calgary |publisher=[[University of Calgary]] Press |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz completed it officially in 1894, although work continued thereafter.&lt;ref name="Montoya"/&gt; Despite the Grand Canal's drainage capacity, it did not solve the problem of flooding in the city.

From the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Mexico City began to sink rapidly and pumps needed to be installed in the Grand Canal, which before had drained the valley purely with gravity.&lt;ref name="Montoya"/&gt;  Along with the pumps, the Grand Canal was expanded with a new tunnel through the low mountains called the Xalpa to take the canal past [[Tequisquiac]].&lt;ref name="PorruaTezcoco"/&gt; Even so, the city still suffered floods in 1950 and 1951.&lt;ref name="Montoya"/&gt; Despite its age, the Grand Canal can still carry {{convert|2400000|USgal/min|m3/s|-1|lk=on|sp=us}} out of the valley, but this is significantly less than what it could carry as late as 1975 because continued sinking of the city (as much as {{convert|7|m|disp=or|abbr=off}}) weakens the system of water collectors and pumps.&lt;ref name="Montoya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ellingwood"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Ellingwood |title=Draining the basin that's Mexico City |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/28/world/fg-drain28 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, another tunnel, called the [[Emisor Oriente Tunnel|Emisor Central]], was built to carry wastewater. Although it is considered the most important pipe in the country, it has been damaged by overuse and corrosion of its {{convert|20|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter walls.&lt;ref name="ellingwood"/&gt; Because of lack of maintenance and gradual decrease in this tunnel's ability to carry water, there is concern that this tunnel will soon fail. It is continuously filled with water, making it impossible to inspect it for problems. If it fails, it would most likely be during the rainy season when it carries the most water, which would cause extensive flooding in the historic center, the airport and the boroughs on the east side.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Stevenson |title=Mexico City Faces Threat of Floods |url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Jun19/0,4675,Mexico |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=Fox News |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=25 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002558/http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Jun19/0,4675,Mexico |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this, another new drainage project is planned that will cost $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion USD. The project includes new pumping stations, a new {{convert|30|mi|-1|sp=us|adj=on}} drainage tunnel and repairs to the current {{convert|7400|mi|-2|sp=us|adj=on}} system of pipes and tunnels to clear blockages and patch leaks.&lt;ref name="ellingwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tunnel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico announces US$1.27 billion drain tunnel |url=http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=389&amp;sid=1459391 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 13, 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over-pumping of groundwater in the 20th century has hastened the disappearance of the lakes. The old lake beds are almost all paved&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; except for some canals preserved in Xochimilco, mostly for the benefit of visitors who tour them on brightly painted {{lang|es|trajineras}}, boats similar to [[gondola]]s.&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico City's 'water monster' nears extinction |url=http://english.sina.com/technology/p/2008/1102/195854.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=China Daily |location=Beijing |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drinking water and sinking lands===
[[File:Angel am ex.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Independence Angel]] statue: street level has sunk below the bottom of the statue.]]
{{See also|Water management in Greater Mexico City}}
Historically, Mexico City's potable water supply came via aqueduct from the mountain springs on the valley sides like that in Chapultepec as most of the water in Lake Texcoco was saline.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; These were originally built by the Aztecs and were rebuilt by the Spaniards. In the mid-1850s, potable groundwater was found underneath the city itself, which motivated the large-scale drilling of wells. Today, 70% of Mexico City's water still comes from five principal aquifers in the valley. These aquifers are fed by water from natural springs and runoff from precipitation.

It was only when the population reached about six million that Mexico City started to need to appropriate water from outside the valley.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt;
Today, Mexico City faces a serious water deficit. Because of increased demand from a growing population, increasing industry, and ecosystem degradation in the form of deforestation of the surrounding mountains, more water is leaving the system than is entering. It is estimated that {{convert|63|m3/s|USgal/min|sp=us}} of water is needed to support the potable and agricultural irrigation needs of Mexico City's population.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; The main aquifer is being pumped at a rate of {{convert|55.5|m3/s|USgal/min|abbr=on}}, but is only being replaced at {{convert|28|m3/s|USgal/min|abbr=on}}, or about half of the extraction rate, leaving a shortfall of {{convert|27.5|m3/s|USgal/min|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt;
This over-extraction of groundwater from the old clay lake bed has been causing the land upon which the city rests to collapse and sink. This problem began in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century as a consequence of the drainage of the valley for flood control. Since the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, some areas of Mexico City have sunk nine meters (30&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; In 1900, the bottom of the lake was three meters (10&amp;nbsp;ft) lower than the median level of the city center. By 1974, the lake bottom was two meters (7&amp;nbsp;ft) higher than the city.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt; The first signs of dropping ground water levels was the drying up of natural springs in the 1930s, which coincides with the beginning of intensive exploitation of the aquifer system through wells between {{convert|100|and|200|m|sp=us}} deep.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt; Today, Mexico City is sinking between five and forty centimeters (0.2 and 1.3&amp;nbsp;ft) per year, and its effects are visible.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; [[El Ángel de la Independencia]] ("The Angel of Independence") statue, located on [[Paseo de la Reforma]] was built in 1910, anchored by a foundation deep beneath what was the surface of the street at that time. However, because the street has sunk around it, steps have been added to allow access to the statue's base.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt;

Subsidence of the valley floor beneath has caused flooding problems as now much of the city has sunk below the natural lake floor. Currently, pumps need to work 24&amp;nbsp;hours a day all year round to keep control of runoff and wastewater.&lt;ref name="casestudy"/&gt; Despite this, flooding is still common, especially in the summer rainy season, in lower-lying neighborhoods such as [[Iztapalapa]], forcing residents to build miniature dikes in front of their houses to prevent heavily polluted rainwater from entering their homes.&lt;ref name="ellingwood"/&gt; Subsidence also causes damage to water and sewer lines, leaving the water distribution system vulnerable to contamination which carries risks to public health.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt;
Measures other than drainage have been implemented to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine storm runoff.&lt;ref name="natresearch"/&gt; Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951.&lt;ref name="Montoya"/&gt; Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted before they reach the city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal.&lt;ref name="benitez"&gt;{{cite book |title= Historia de la Ciudad de Mexico

While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open [[combined sewer]]s. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.&lt;ref name="benitez"/&gt;

The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Prince Edward Island]] first required its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s and display [[Vehicle registration plate|licence plate]]s in 1913.

==Passenger baseplates==
===1913 to 1961===
In 1956, Canada, the United States and Mexico came to an agreement with the [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]], the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]] and the [[National Safety Council]] that standardized the size for licence plates for vehicles (except those for [[motorcycle]]s) at {{convert|6|in|cm}} in height by {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width, with standardized mounting holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Garrish |first=Christopher |date=October 2016 |title=Reconsidering the Standard Plate Size |magazine=Plates |publisher=[[Automobile License Plate Collectors Association]] |volume=62 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Prince Edward Island licence plate that complied with these standards was issued six years beforehand, in 1950.

'''Western Ghats''' also known as '''Sahyadri''' (Benevolent Mountains) is a mountain range that runs parallel to the western coast of the [[India]]n peninsula, located entirely in India. It is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] and is one of the eight "hottest hot-spots" of biological diversity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6772/fig_tab/403853a0_T6.html

A total of thirty-nine properties including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests were designated as world heritage sites - twenty in [[Kerala]], ten in [[Karnataka]], five in [[Tamil Nadu]] and four in [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1342/multiple=1&amp;unique_number=1921|title=Western Ghats|work=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Clara|last=Lewis|date=3 July 2012|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-03/mumbai/32523277_1_radhanagari-wildlife-world-heritage-centre-western-ghats|title=39 sites in Western Ghats get world heritage status |newspaper=[[Times of India]]|access-date=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The Western Ghats are the mountainous [[Fault (geology)|faulted]] and [[Erosion|eroded]] edge of the [[Deccan Plateau]]. Geologic evidence indicates that they were formed during the break-up of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]] some 150 million years ago. [[geophysics|Geophysical]] evidence indicates that the west coast of India came into being somewhere around 100 to 80 [[mya (unit)|mya]] after it broke away from [[Madagascar]]. After the break-up, the western coast of India would have appeared as an abrupt cliff some {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} in [[elevation]].&lt;ref name="Barron, E.J."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barron |first1=E.J. |last2=Harrison |first2= C.G.A. |last3=Sloan |first3=J.L.

Other rock types found are [[charnockite]]s, [[granite]] gneiss, [[khondalite]]s, [[leptynite]]s, metamorphic [[gneiss]]es with detached occurrences of crystalline [[limestone]], iron ore, [[dolerite]]s and [[anorthosite]]s. Residual [[laterite]] and [[bauxite]] ores are also found in the southern hills.

==Geography==
[[File:Tamil Nadu topo deutsch mit Gebirgen.png|thumb|Topography- Western Ghats (southern part)]]
The Western Ghats extend from the [[Satpura Range]] in the north, stretching from [[Gujarat]] to [[Tamil Nadu]].{{citation required|date=July 2018}} It traverses south through the states of [[Maharashtra]], [[Goa]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. Major gaps in the range are the [[Goa Gap]], between the Maharashtra and Karnataka sections, and the [[Palghat Gap]] on the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border between the Nilgiri Hills and the [[Anaimalai Hills]]. The mountains intercept the rain-bearing westerly [[monsoon]] winds, and are consequently an area of high rainfall, particularly on their western side. The dense forests also contribute to the precipitation of the area by acting as a substrate for condensation of moist rising [[orographic]] winds from the sea, and releasing much of the moisture back into the air via [[transpiration]], allowing it to later condense and fall again as rain.

The northern portion of the narrow coastal plain between the Western Ghats and the [[Arabian Sea]] is known as the [[Konkan Coast|Konkan]], the central portion is called [[Kanara]] and the southern portion is called [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]]. The foothill region east of the Ghats in [[Maharashtra]] is known as [[Desh, Maharashtra|Desh]], while the eastern foothills of the central Karnataka state is known as [[Malenadu]].&lt;ref name="all-about-india.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-india.com/Geography-of-India.html|title=The Geography of India|publisher=all-about-india.com|access-date=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range is known as ''Sahyadri'' in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]]. The Western Ghats meets the [[Eastern Ghats]] at [[Nilgiri mountains|Nilgiris]] in northwestern [[Tamil Nadu]]. Nilgiris connects [[Biligiriranga Hills]] in southeastern Karnataka with the [[Shevaroys]] and [[Tirumala]] hills. South of the [[Palghat Gap]] are the [[Anamala Hills]], located in western Tamil Nadu and Kerala with smaller ranges further south, including the [[Cardamom Hills]], then [[Aryankavu]] pass, [[Aralvaimozhi]] pass near Kanyakumari. The range is known as ''Sahyan'' or ''Sahian'' in [[Kerala]]. In the southern part of the range is [[Anamudi]] ({{convert|2695|m|ft|0}}), the highest peak in Western Ghats.

===Peaks===
{{Main|List of peaks in the Western Ghats}}
Western Ghats has many peaks that rise above 2,000 meters with [[Anamudi]]({{convert|2,695|m|ft|abbr=on}}) being the highest peak.

===Water bodies===
[[File:Varandha ghad.jpg|thumb|View from Varandha Pass Mahad showing the numerous waterfalls]]
The Western Ghats form one of the four [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] of India, feeding the perennial rivers of India. The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats are [[Godavari river|Godavari]], [[Kaveri river|Kaveri]], [[Krishna river|Krishna]], [[Thamiraparani]] and [[Tungabhadra]]. The majority of streams draining the Western Ghats join these rivers, and carry large volume of water during the monsoon months. These rivers flow to the east due to the gradient of the land and drain out into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Major tributaries include [[Kali River (Karnataka)|Kali]], [[Bhadra river|Bhadra]], [[Bhavani river|Bhavani]], [[Bhima River|Bhima]], [[Malaprabha River|Malaprabha]], [[Ghataprabha River|Ghataprabha]], [[Hemavathi river|Hemavathi]] and [[Kabini River|Kabini]]. The [[Periyar River|Periyar]], [[Bharathappuzha]], [[Pamba River|Pamba]], [[Netravati River|Netravati]], [[Sharavathi]], [[Mandovi]] and [[Zuari River|Zuari]] rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, draining into the [[Arabian Sea]] and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.

The rivers have been dammed for [[hydroelectric]] and [[irrigation]] purposes with major reservoirs spread across the states. The reservoirs are important for their commercial and sport fisheries of [[rainbow trout]], [[mahseer]] and [[common carp]].&lt;ref name=SehgalFish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x2614e/x2614e06.htm|last=Sehgal|first=K.

During the monsoon season, numerous streams fed by incessant rain drain off the mountain sides leading to numerous waterfalls. Major waterfalls include [[Dudhsagar Falls|Dudhsagar]], [[Unchalli Falls|Unchalli]],
[[Sathodi Falls|Sathodi]], [[Magod Falls|Magod]], [[Hogenakkal Falls|Hogenakkal]], [[Jog Falls|Jog]], [[Kunchikal Falls|Kunchikal]], [[Shivanasamudra Falls|Shivanasamudra]], [[Meenmutty Falls, Wayanad|Meenmutty Falls]], [[Athirappilly Falls]]. [[Talakaveri]] is the source of the river Kaveri and the Kuduremukha range is the source of the Tungabhadra. Western Ghats have several man-made lakes and reservoirs with major lakes at [[Ooty Lake|Ooty]] ({{convert|34|ha}}) in Nilgiris, [[Kodaikanal Lake|Kodaikanal]] ({{convert|26|ha}}) and [[Berijam Lake|Berijam]] in [[Palani Hills]], [[Pookode lake]], Karlad Lake in [[Wayanad]], [[Vagamon]] lake, [[Devikulam]] ({{convert|6|ha}}) and Letchmi ({{convert|2|ha}}) in [[Idukki]], Kerala.

==Climate==
[[File:Western-Ghats-rainfall.svg|thumb|Annual rainfall along the Western Ghat region]]
Climate in the Western Ghats varies with altitudinal gradation and distance from the equator. The climate is humid and tropical in the lower reaches tempered by the proximity to the sea. Elevations of {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and above in the north and {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and above in the south have a more temperate climate. Average annual temperature is around {{convert|15|°C}}. In some parts frost is common, and temperatures touch the freezing point during the winter months. Mean temperature range from {{convert|20|°C}} in the south to {{convert|24|°C}} in the north. It has also been observed that the coldest periods in the South Western Ghats coincide with the wettest.&lt;ref name="WII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wii.gov.in/envis/rain_forest/chapter2.htm|first=R.J.|last=Ranjit Daniels|title=Biodiversity of the Western Ghats – An Overview|access-date=19 March 2007|work=Wildlife Institute of India|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070228195706/http://www.wii.gov.in/envis/rain_forest/chapter2.htm|archivedate=28 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[monsoon|monsoon season]] between June and September, the unbroken Western Ghats chain acts as a barrier to the moisture laden clouds. The heavy, eastward-moving rain-bearing clouds are forced to rise and in the process deposit most of their rain on the windward side. Rainfall in this region averages {{convert|300|cm}} to {{convert|400|cm}} with localised extremes touching {{convert|900|cm}}. The eastern region of the Western Ghats which lie in the [[rain shadow]], receive far less rainfall of about {{convert|100|cm}} resulting in an average rainfall of {{convert|250|cm}} across regions. The total amount of rain does not depend on the spread of the area with areas in northern Maharashtra receiving heavy rainfall followed by long dry spells, while regions closer to the equator receive less annual rainfall and have rain spells lasting several months in a year.&lt;ref name="WII"/&gt;

==Ecoregions==
[[File:Shola.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sholas]], part of the rain forests]]
The Western Ghats are home to four [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregions]] – the [[North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]], [[North Western Ghats montane rain forests]], [[South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]], and [[South Western Ghats montane rain forests]]. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion, with mostly deciduous forests made up predominantly of [[teak]]. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter [[North Western Ghats montane rain forests]], whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of family ''[[Lauraceae]]''.

The evergreen forests in [[Wayanad]] mark the transition zone between the northern and southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecologic regions are generally wetter and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the [[South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]], with ''[[Cullenia]]'' the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, [[dipterocarp]]s, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]], which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the [[South Western Ghats montane rain forests]], also cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowland forests, and dominated by evergreen trees, although some [[montane grassland]]s and stunted forests can be found at the highest elevations. The South Western Ghats montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecologic region in peninsular India; eighty percent of the [[flowering plant]] species of the entire Western Ghats range are found in this ecologic region.

==Biodiversity protection==
[[File:Western ghaats1, maharashtra.jpg|thumb|Dense rain forests cover Western Ghats]]
[[File:Heavenly Sahyadri.jpg|thumb|Western Ghats is a UNESCO heritage site]]
Historically the Western Ghats were well-covered in dense forests that provided wild foods and natural habitats for native [[Indigenous peoples|tribal people]]. Its inaccessibility made it difficult for people from the [[Deccan Plateau|plains]] to cultivate the land and build settlements. After the arrival of the [[British empire#Expansion|British]] in the area, large swathes of territory were cleared for agricultural plantations and timber. The forest in the Western Ghats has been severely fragmented due to human activities, especially clear felling for tea, coffee, and teak plantations during 1860 to 1950.  Species that are rare, [[Endemism|endemic]] and habitat specialists are more adversely affected and tend to be lost faster than other species. Complex and species rich habitats like the tropical rainforest are much more adversely affected than other habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.wii.gov.in/publications/researchreports/2002/frag.wii.report.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081219184202/http://www.wii.gov.in/publications/researchreports/2002/frag.wii.report.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 December 2008|format=PDF|title=Impact of rainforest fragmentation on small mammals and herpetofauna in the Western Ghats, South India|first=Ajith|last=Kumar|publisher=Salim Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is ecologically sensitive to development and was declared an ecological hotspot in 1988 through the efforts of ecologist [[Norman Myers]]. The area covers five percent of India's land with 27% of all species of higher plants in India (4,000 of 15,000 species) are found here and 1,800 of these are endemic to the region. The range is home to at least 84 amphibian species, 16 bird species, seven mammals, and 1,600 flowering plants which are not found elsewhere in the world. The [[Government of India]] established many [[protected areas of India|protected areas]] including 2 [[Biosphere reserves of India|biosphere reserves]], 13 [[national parks of India|National parks]] to restrict human access, several [[Wildlife sanctuaries of India|wildlife sanctuaries]] to protect specific endangered species and many [[Reserve Forest]]s, which are all managed by the forest departments of their respective state to preserve some of the ecoregions still undeveloped. The [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]] comprising {{convert|5500|km2}} of the evergreen forests of [[Nagarahole]] and deciduous forests of [[Bandipur National Park|Bandipur]] in Karnataka, adjoining regions of [[Wayanad]]-[[Mukurthi National Park|Mukurthi]] in Kerala and [[Mudumalai National Park]]-[[Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary|Sathyamangalam]] in Tamil Nadu forms the largest contiguous protected area in the Western Ghats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpreec.org/04_phamplets/08_nilgiri_bio_reser/nilgiri_bio_reser.html|title= The Nilgiri Bio-sphere Reserve|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928151229/http://www.cpreec.org/04_phamplets/08_nilgiri_bio_reser/nilgiri_bio_reser.html |archive-date=28 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silent Valley National Park|Silent Valley]] in Kerala is among the last tracts of virgin tropical evergreen forest in India.&lt;ref name="wg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/article52465.ece|title=No clearance for mining, hydel projects that destroy Western Ghat|last=Ramesh|date=21 November 2009|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|publisher=Kasturi &amp; Sons Ltd.|access-date=29 December 2009|location=Palakkad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/04/stories/2009080456210300.htm|title=Gundia project has not got Centre's nod|last=staff|work=The Hindu |publisher=Kasturi &amp; Sons Ltd.|access-date=29 December 2009|location=Chennai, India|date=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Of the 7,402 species of flowering plants occurring in the Western Ghats, 5,588 species are native or indigenous and 376 are exotics naturalised and 1,438 species are cultivated or planted as ornamentals. Among the indigenous species, 2,253 species are endemic to India and of them, 1,273 species are exclusively confined to the Western Ghats. Apart from 593 confirmed subspecies and varieties; 66 species, 5 subspecies and 14 varieties of doubtful occurrence are also reported and therefore amounting 8,080 taxa of flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;Nayar, T.S., Rasiya Beegam A., and M.
