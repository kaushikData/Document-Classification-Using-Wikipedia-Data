[[File:Čakovečka povelja Adama Zrinskog (1684).jpg|thumb|230px|Adam Zrinski confirmed privileges to the inhabitants of Čakovec in a charter from 1684.]]
'''Adam Zrinski'''  ({{lang-hu|Zrínyi Ádám}}) ([[Vienna]], December 24, 1662 – [[Battle of Slankamen|Slankamen]], August 19, 1691&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=67468|title=Zrinski, Adam|encyclopedia=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|language=hr|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Croat]]ian [[count]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in [[Habsburg Monarchy]] army service, a member of the [[Zrinski]] noble family.

==Life==

Adam Zrinski was the son of [[Ban of Croatia|Croatian Ban (viceroy)]] [[Nikola VII Zrinski|Nikola Zrinski]] (1620–1664) and his second wife Maria Sophia Löbl, an [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] [[baroness]].

His father was killed on November 18, 1664, in a hunting accident by a wounded [[Wild Boar|wild boar]] (however in suspicious circumstances), when Adam was only two years old. So he grew up with his mother (until her death in 1676) and sister Marija Katarina ({{lang-en|Mary Catherine}}), finishing high education at [[University of Vienna]] and in [[Belgium]].

In 1681 Adam came back to his father's [[Čakovec]] estate in the [[Međimurje County]], the northernmost part of [[Croatia]], and took part in battles against the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]]s, like many of his ancestors had done before. In 1684 he married an [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] countess Maria Katarina Lamberg (1664–1717), but they had no children.

From his father he inherited [[Bibliotheca Zriniana]], one of the largest and most valuable individual compacted libraries ever appeared in Croatia and its surroundings. Fortunately the library has been almost fully saved during the turbulent centuries and is stored now in the [[National and University Library Zagreb|Croatian National and University Library]] in [[Zagreb]].

During his career Adam Zrinski reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] [[cavalry]]. He commanded his cavalry unit during the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683-1699). He was only 28, when he was killed during the [[Battle of Slankamen]] in 1691, as one of his fellow soldiers shot him in his back. He was one of the last male members of the famous [[Croatian nobility|Croatian noble family]] [[Zrinski]].

'''Alberto Castagna''' (December 23, 1945 – March 1, 2005) was an [[Italy|Italian]] television host and journalist.

==Biography==
Alberto Castagna started working as a journalist for the newspapers ''[[Il Piccolo]]'' and ''Settimanale''. In 1982, he debuted on TV in the [[Rai 2]] news program [[TG2]], initially as a reporter and then as a correspondent. In 1988, he collaborated with [[Pippo Baudo]] for one edition of the primetime show ''Serata d'onore''&lt;ref name = RF&gt;{{Cite news|author=Renato Franco|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/marzo/02/Stranamore_della_che_conquisto_Italia_co_9_050302119.shtml|title=Lo Stranamore della tv che conquistò l'Italia|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=2 March 2005|page=41|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then hosted the morning shows ''Mattina 2'' and, in 1992, ''I fatti vostri'', both directed by Michele Guardì.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1992/febbraio/24/oggi_fatti_vostri_con_Castagna_co_0_92022413646.shtml|title=Oggi "I fatti vostri" con Castagna|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=1992-02-24|page=36|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning a [[Telegatto]] as "personaggio maschile dell'anno", in 1993 he left [[RAI]] network switching to [[Fininvest]], where he hosted the afternoon quiz ''Sarà vero?'', aired by [[Canale 5]].&lt;ref name = RF /&gt; In 1994 he started hosting the primetime show ''Stranamore'', one of the most important TV shows in the 1990s,&lt;ref name = RF /&gt; the talk show ''Complotto di famiglia''&lt;ref name = MI&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mariolina Iossa|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/luglio/14/Castagna_saro_confessore_degli_italiani_co_0_9507143775.shtml|title=Castagna: sarò il confessore degli italiani|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=1995-07-14|page=29|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the summer primetime entertainment show ''Cuori e denari'', with [[Antonella Elia]] and [[Simona Ventura]].&lt;ref name = MI /&gt;

In 1995/1996, Alberto Castagna presented the [[Canale 5]] afternoon show ''Casa Castagna'', directed by [[Gianni Boncompagni]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Valerio Cappelli|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/settembre/17/Boncompagni_comanda_Casa_Castagna_co_0_9509179615.shtml|title=Boncompagni comanda in Casa Castagna|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=1995-09-17|page=24|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 he was interrupted by "Ordine dei giornalisti" because of a violation of the rules about children on TV during an episode of ''Stranamore''. The year after has been radiated for repeating the same violation. It was reinstated in the "Ordine dei giornalisti" in 1999, after ricoursing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Valerio Cappelli|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/marzo/18/Alberto_Castagna_nuovo_giornalista_co_0_9903183340.shtml|title=Alberto Castagna di nuovo giornalista|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=1999-03-18|page=24|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Alberto had a role as actor in the [[Retequattro]]'s fiction ''La villa dei misteri''. In the same year he suffered a double [[aneurysm]]; because of this he stayed in the hospital from July 18, 1998, to March 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/marzo/14/Castagna_casa_dopo_otto_mesi_co_0_990314960.shtml|title=Castagna a casa dopo otto mesi|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=1999-03-14|page=1|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting the attention of the Italian media because of his critical state of health. Despite everything, he had to undergo [[dialysis]] and wait for a kidney transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Maria Volpe|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/aprile/28/Castagna_indignato_aspetto_trapianto_Mori_co_0_0104282165.shtml|title=Castagna indignato: aspetto un trapianto.

He came back on TV with his most important show, ''Stranamore'', in April 2001, aired by [[Canale 5]] on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/aprile/24/Castagna_uguaglia_proprio_primato_con_co_0_010424109.shtml|title=Castagna uguaglia il proprio primato con oltre 10 milioni di telespettatori|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=2001-04-23|page=37|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years he continued presenting this show, having quite success and being moved to [[Retequattro]] in 2004. In that same year, Alberto hosted another primetime show for [[Retequattro]], ''Cosa non farei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2004/ottobre/23/Castagna_realizza_sogni_cambio_prove_co_9_041023086.shtml|title=Castagna realizza i sogni.

In February 2005, Alberto Castagna started presenting a new edition of ''Stranamore'', with [[Emanuela Folliero]], but it was never completed because of his death, which occurred on 1 March 2005 due to an [[internal bleeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Renato Franco|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/marzo/03/Addio_Castagna_finisce_anche_show_co_9_050303092.shtml|title=Addio Castagna, finisce anche lo show Stranamore|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=2005-03-03|page=41|accessdate=25 January 2011|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news of his death was announced on live television from [[Paolo Bonolis]] during the 2005 edition of [[Festival di Sanremo]], the most important music festival in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Maria Volpe|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/marzo/02/morte_Castagna_sgomento_Festival_co_8_050302001.shtml|title=La morte di Castagna, sgomento al Festival|work=Corriere della Sera|location=Italy|date=2005-02-03|page=39|accessdate=2011-01-25|cid=|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Almaron Dickinson''' (1800 – March 6, 1836) was a [[Texian]] soldier and defender during the [[Battle of the Alamo]], fought during the [[Texas Revolution]]. Dickinson is best known as the [[artillery]] officer of the small garrison, and the husband of one of the only three non-Mexican survivors to live through the battle, [[Susanna Dickinson]], as well as the father to their infant daughter Angelina, whose life was also spared.

==Early life and becoming a soldier==

Dickinson was born in  [[Tennessee]], learning the trade of [[blacksmith]]ing. He later enlisted in the US Army as a field artilleryman. He and Susannah married when she was just 15, on May 24, 1829, and two years later they moved to the Mexican province of Texas, where they became settlers in the [[Dewitt Colony]]. He received a [[League (unit)|league]] of land along the [[San Marcos River]], where he started a blacksmith shop, and partnered with George C. Kimble in a hat factory. On December 14, 1834, their only child, Angelina, was born. Following a number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] raids on settlements, he joined a band led by fellow settler Bart McClure and took part in hunting down hostile Indians.

In the fall of 1835, Dickinson served as one of the defenders during the [[Battle of Gonzales]], which marked the beginning of Texas' war for independence. He was elected as First Lieutenant of Artillery in December 1835.&lt;ref&gt;p.630 Hansen, Todd ''The Alamo Reader: A Study in History'' 2003 Stackpole Books&lt;/ref&gt;  He then joined a band of volunteers going to defend [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and became an aide to General [[Edward Burleson]] during the [[Siege of Bexar]], with a rank of Lieutenant in the [[Texian Army]]. A few weeks later, his home where Susannah and Angelina had remained was looted by members of a Texas [[Militia]], prompting her to join him in San Antonio. They set up residence in the Musquiz house, on the southwest corner of Portero Street and the Main Plaza. When [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] and his troops arrived on February 23, 1836, Dickinson moved his family inside the Alamo.

==Battle of the Alamo==

By this time, Dickinson held the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]], and was in command of the Alamo's artillery of twenty-one [[cannon]]. Some accounts list him with a rank of Lieutenant at the Alamo, but it is believed he was promoted. The  commander, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[William Barrett Travis]], led a force of between 180 and 250 men. This included Dickinson and others considered to be regular troops, as well as several bands of volunteers, led by frontiersmen [[James Bowie]] and [[Davey Crockett]]. Historians have established that the Alamo was not lower or higher than those two figures, with most believing the number to have been 182. One of the dispatches sent out by Travis gave the figure of 150 and at least 32 others are known to have arrived after that. Antonio Ruiz, the Mayor of San Antonio at the time, said that after the battle Mexican soldiers had burned 182 bodies of Alamo defenders and that tends to be the accepted strength of it. Santa Anna had under his command between 5,000 and 6,000 [[Mexican people|Mexican]] troops. From the time of his arrival, a [[siege]] began.

A Mexican bombardment continued through the morning of February 25, 1836. At approximately 10am, about 200–300 Mexican soldiers, mainly cazadores from the Matamoros Battalion, crossed the [[San Antonio River]] and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately 90 yards (82 m) to 100 yards (91 m) from the Alamo walls. They were intending to use the huts as cover to erect another artillery battery, although many Texians assumed that they were actually launching an assault on the Alamo. Travis called for volunteers to burn the huts, despite the fact that it was broad daylight and they would be within range of enemy muskets. Charles Despallier, Robert Brown, James Rose  and a few others volunteered for the mission.

To provide cover, Dickinson and his men fired 8-lb cannon, filled with grapeshot and canister, at the Mexican soldiers in the huts. Crockett and his men fired rifles, while other Texians reloaded extra weapons for them. Within two hours, the battle was over. As soon as the Texians saw flames erupting from the huts they threw open the Alamo gate and the Texians re-entered  unscathed, although Rose was almost captured by a Mexican officer. The Mexicans retreated with two killed and four wounded, while several Texians had been mildly scratched by flying rock.

After learning that a relief force under [[James Fannin]] had failed to reach the Alamo and that there was unlikely to be any further reinforcement, a group of 25 men set out from Gonzales at 2pm on Saturday, February 27. The party would number 32 upon its arrival at the Alamo, and was led by Albert Martin and George Kimbell, the latter of whom had been  Dickinson's business partner. As they approached the Alamo in the early morning hours of March 1, a rider appeared in front of them and asked, in English, if they wished to go into the fort. When they assented, he turned and told them to follow him. One  became suspicious and the rider bolted away. The volunteers were afraid they had been discovered and galloped towards the Alamo. In the darkness, the Texians thought this was a party of Mexican soldiers and fired, wounding one of the volunteers. They finally managed to convince the defenders to open the gates.

At some point, either on March 3 or March 4, 1836, Travis, seeing that their position was hopeless and their fate sealed, called the troops of his garrison together. He informed them of the situation and gave them the opportunity to either stay or to go at that point. Only one man, [[Moses Rose]], chose to flee, with the rest deciding to remain and fight to the death. He would be remembered, even to the present day,  as the "Coward of the Alamo", while Dickinson and the rest of the defenders would achieve immortality as heroes.

==Climax of the battle and death==

Dickinson survived until the last day of the battle. In the early morning hours of March 6, 1836, Santa Anna sent an assault force which breached the walls of the Alamo with its third charge. Dickinson had hidden Suzanna and Angelina inside the chapel. By her own account afterward, near the end of the battle Dickinson rushed inside where she was hiding, frantically exclaiming "Great God, Sue! The Mexicans are inside our walls! All is lost! If they spare you, love our child." He then returned to his post. By that time there was intense fighting inside the Alamo, which eventually became hand to hand. By reliable Mexican accounts, Dickinson was one of the last defenders [[killed in action]].

According to the Mexican Army accounts, the last of the Texians to die were the eleven men manning the two 12-lb cannon in the chapel. The entrance had been barricaded with sandbags, over which the Texians were able to fire. A shot from the 18-lb cannon destroyed the barricades and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the soldiers at the door. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza, and [[James Bonham]], grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans was master of ordnance and had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. If he had succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the chapel, killing the women and children hiding in the sacristy.

Dickinson's body was burned along with those of the other defenders killed during the battle. Susannah, Angelina, and a freed former [[slave]] to  Travis named Joe were spared. It is generally accepted that over the course of the battle, the Mexican forces lost an estimated 400 to 500 soldiers killed, while the Texian defenders suffered a total loss of between 182 and 189. Dickinson has since, along with many of the other defenders, become a legend in Texas history for the heroic stand.

The '''Amnion''' (singular, '''Amnioni''') are a fictional alien species in [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s [[The Gap Cycle]].  They are shown to be the only alien race humanity has made contact with and play a major role in the series from ''Forbidden Knowledge'' onwards.

Amnion are fundamentally different from any Earth creature - particularly humankind - in their mental and emotional structure.  Physically they are humanoid: the Amnioni with whom first contact is made is described in ''Forbidden Knowledge'' as "a humanoid sea-anemone with too many arms."  Amnion are however severely different from each other in physical appearance, with differing numbers of limbs, eyes, and other organs, as well as varying vastly in size and shape.  This physical individuality contrasts with their mental identicality - their mentality can be likened to that of an insect hive. They are analogous to the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] in the [[Star Trek]] universe, both in their [[collective intelligence]] (or "mind union") and in their aim to conquer through assimilation (turning humans into members of their own species).

Despite their fundamental opposition and [[Cold War]]-type conflict with humanity, they are not portrayed as the main antagonists in [[The Gap Cycle]]. Rather they serve as a driving force for the conflict between the human characters.

== First Contact ==

''Forbidden Knowledge'' explains that in the universe of the Gap Cycle, there is some argument over when [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] can be said to have started.  Captain Sixten Vertigus, aboard the ''Deep Star'' was the first human to meet an actual Amnioni aboard the Amnion 'defensive' ''Solidarity'': this is where the above description of an Amnioni comes from.

Vertigus's instructions were to "establish proximity with any alien vessel or base" and then broadcast the contents of a tape prepared specially for the occasion.  They would record any reply that they were able to for as long as possible, then to "escape into the gap in a way that would confuse pursuit".  This seemingly-paranoid set of instructions was due to the unwillingness of Holt Fasner to reveal too much to any alien race "whose intentions were unguessable".  Vertigus however was willing to disobey these orders directly: something of an [[idealist]], he resolved to travel to the Amnion ship and deliver the tape in person, mostly out of a desire to lay eyes on at least one Amnioni, but also in the hope of kick-starting diplomatic relations between the two races.  The Amnion in return gave him a canister containing mutagenic material - the same sort of material that had led Vertigus there in the first place.

This is where the debate over 'first contact' started from: the Amnion's existence had already been known, and aside from matters of appearance, Captain Vertigus learnt nothing new about the race.  The Amnion had been discovered when the ship ''Far Star'' encountered a [[satellite]] of alien origin, containing mutagens, in a far extrasolar system.  The return of ''Far Star'' to Earth is touted as having "enough scientific, economic, and cultural impact to qualify as 'first contact'."

== Mutagens ==

The main threat of the Amnion is their mutagenic technology.  Mutagens have the ability to rewrite the [[DNA]] of a non-Amnioni so it becomes at least partially Amnion.  This ability was first discovered by humans during tests on the material discovered in the Amnion [[satellite]] - Donaldson remarks that "Earth science being what it was... the tests eventually included feeding a bit of the substance to a rat."  This has a drastic effect on the rat, which now resembles "a mobile clump of [[seaweed]]".  [[Dissection]] reveals a fundamental genetic change - basic [[life processes]] remain intact, but [[protein]] and [[DNA]] structure are radically different.  The new [[mutants]] can breed with each other (though not with mutated members of other species) and, most disturbingly, display a significantly increased level of [[intelligence]].  When the mutagen was tested on a human being, she only survived for a day and a half - [[autopsies]] cite the only possible cause of death as fright.  Later in the series the trauma of mutation into an Amnioni is mentioned - this is probably what killed her.  Before her death she wrote down galactic co-ordinates, which is where the ''Deep Star'' found the ''Solidarity''.  An anti-mutagen drug is developed by Intertech, but one of the many storylines in the series is the suppression of the drug and all research relating to it by the United Mining Companies Police, and why this was done.

== Actions in the series ==

The Amnion are not introduced until ''Forbidden Knowledge'', but play an important part in all four books following.

Note: This list is not intended to be a definitive plot summary, more an overview of the parts the Amnion play, and it is assumed that the article on The Gap Cycle has already been read.

=== Forbidden Knowledge ===

Morn Hyland is taken to Enablement Station to have her child force-grown by the Amnion.  This is the only possibility, as she has convinced Nick Succorso that the child is his son.  The Amnion expose Morn's deceptions, by informing Nick both that Morn's son is not Nick's son, and that Morn has a zone implant - therefore revealing that her love for him is not real.

The Amnion wish to study the effects of the zone implant on Morn's son (Davies) and demand that Nick return him to them, but Morn sabotages the escape pod that Davies is in, sending it towards the illegal shipyard of Billingate.

The Amnion also attempt to study Nick's blood, as he was injected with mutagens last time he visited Enablement, but showed [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] - this is because he has supplies of the immunity drug, given to him by the UMC Police.

The Amnion repair the gap drive of ''Captain's Fancy'', but sabotage it to test components that they, themselves, are developing that will allow their war ships to travel at near-light space-normal speeds.

=== A Dark and Hungry God Arises ===

The 'Bill' (the [[mayor]] of Billingate, and an illegal) recaptures Davies.  Morn is traded to the Amnion, but survives being injected by their mutagens as she has stolen some of Nick's immunity drug.

Milos Taverner, who has come to Billingate with Angus Thermopyle, is injected with mutagens and becomes an Amnioni.  Angus, with the help of various members of Nick's crew and Nick himself, recapture Morn - Taverner, as an Amnioni, attempts to use his priority-codes to control Angus, but new programming protects him.  Angus sabotages the fusion reactors and destroys Billingate - meanwhile, one Amnion defensive, ''Tranquil Hegemony'', is rammed and destroyed by ''Captain's Fancy'', and the second, ''Calm Horizons'', pursues the fleeing Gap-scout ''Trumpet''.

=== Chaos and Order ===

''Calm Horizons'', with the aid of the [[pirate]] ship ''Soar'', pursues ''Trumpet''.  It is revealed that ''Soar'''s captain, Sorus Chantelaine, is controlled by the Amnion through use of delayed-action mutagens.  The cabin boy aboard ''Trumpet'', Ciro Vasaczk, is captured by Sorus and [[blackmailed]] into sabotaging the drive of ''Trumpet'' using the same mutagens.  ''Calm Horizons'' attempts to destroy ''Trumpet'' to prevent the broadcasting of the anti-mutagen drug [[formula]], but is engaged by the UMCP ship ''Punisher'' and, due to the turning of ''Soar'' against ''Calm Horizons'', is unable to destroy either ''Punisher'' or ''Trumpet'', though ''Soar'' is destroyed.  The book ends with ''Calm Horizons'' speeding for [[Earth]].

=== This Day All Gods Die ===

''Calm Horizons'' arrives in Earth [[orbit]] and threatens to use its super-light [[proton]] cannon to destroy the Governing Council for Earth and Space.  Warden Dios, head of the UMCP, agrees to go aboard ''Calm Horizons'' and negotiate with Marc Vestabule.  He reluctantly agrees to their demands, hoping that the crew of ''Trumpet'', who have taken command of ''Punisher'', can save him.  Dios is injected with delayed-action mutagens but is rescued by Davies Hyland, Angus Thermopyle and Vector Shaheed, though Vector dies in the attempt.  They escape from ''Calm Horizons'', Angus having sabotaged the super-light proton cannon by filling it with hull sealant, so it explodes when the ship attempts to fire.  ''Calm Horizons'' flees, but is destroyed by Ciro Vasaczk using a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] [[grenade]], though he dies doing so.

== Notable Amnion ==

The Amnion do not appear to have individuals in the human sense of the word, or if so, they do not show it.  The only Amnion given names are those who were previously human, and have been mutated.

*Marc Vestabule - Originally sold to the Amnion by Angus Thermopyle before the latter was made into a [[cyborg]].  He undertakes the majority of the [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] negotiations with humans in the series - it is stated that due to once being human, he can understand humankind better than most Amnion, who seem to struggle with concepts such as betrayal, lying, and individual survival instinct.  It is suggested that the major instinct of the Amnion is the expansion and propagation of the Amnion race.
*Milos Taverner - Originally an agent of Com-Mine Security, and then blackmailed by the UMCP into accompanying Angus to Billingate.  He attempts to sell information to the Amnion, but is mutated by them.  He then tries to take control of Angus, later escaping the destruction of Billingate onboard ''Soar''.  Sorus Chatelaine kills him before attacking ''Calm Horizons''.

Also of note are the three Amnion ships mentioned:

*''Calm Horizons'' - one of two defensives pursuing ''Captain's Fancy''.  Commits an act of war by crossing into human space.  Attempts to destroy the GCES but is sabotaged and later destroyed.
*''Tranquil Hegemony'' - the second defensive pursuing ''Captain's Fancy''.  Attempts to blast Morn Hyland and her rescuers on the surface of Thanatos Minor, where Billingate is located.  Rammed by ''Captain's Fancy'' to prevent her doing so.
*''Solidarity'' - the ship that Captain Sixten Vertigus (arguably) makes first contact with.

'''Arthur Brooke''' (died 19 March 1563) was an English poet who wrote and created various works including ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]'' (1562), considered to be [[William Shakespeare]]'s chief source for his tragedy ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1597).

==Life==
The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' suggests that Brooke may have been a son of [[Thomaz Broke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=3498|title=Broke, Thomas|first=David|last=Grummitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]], at the request of ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'''s authors, [[Thomas Norton]] and [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]]. He may have written the [[masque]] that accompanied the play.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=3494|title=Brooke, Arthur|first=Andrew|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 1563, Brooke died in the shipwreck that also killed [[Thomas Finch (soldier)|Sir Thomas Finch]], bound for [[Le Havre#The wars of religion|Le Havre]], besieged in the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1567 [[George Turberville]] published a collection of poetry entitled, ''Epitaphs, Epigrams, Songs and Sonnets''; it included ''An Epitaph on the Death of Master Arthur Brooke Drownde in Passing to New Haven''.&lt;ref name="ShakespeareHudson1871"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Shakespeare|author2=Henry Norman Hudson|title=The Works of Shakespeare: The Text Carefully Restored According to the First Editions, with Introductions, Notes Original and Selected, and a Life of the Poet by H.

==''The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet''==
Though ostensibly a translation from the [[Italian language|Italian]] of [[Bandello]], Brooke's poem is derived from a French version by [[Pierre Boaistuau]]. The work was published by [[Richard Tottell]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

[[Bernard Garter]] published ''The Tragicall and True Historie which Happened betweene Two English Lovers'' (1565), which imitated Brooke's work in a [[ballad metre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=10412|title=Garter, Bernard|first=Matthew|last=Steggle}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prose version of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1567) was printed in ''The Palace of Pleasure'', a collection of tales edited by [[William Painter (author)|William Painter]]. Shakespeare stuck quite closely to the version by Brooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Doherty|title=The Ignorance Of Shakespeare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqX45851KrkC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=27 June 2013|date=4 January 2012|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|isbn=978-1-61204-839-0|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">'''Bossnapping''' is a form of [[Lockout (industry)#Lock-in|lock-in]] where employees detain management in the workplace, often in protest against lay-offs and redundancies, and has especially been carried out in France. The term gained wide usage in the media following a series of bossnapping incidents in the spring of 2009 in France where workers used the tactic in the context of widespread labor unrest resulting from the [[late 2000s recession]].

These incidents resulted in a public call for an end to the practice by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], despite public opinion polling which showed widespread sympathy for the protesters.

==Description==
The term 'bossnapping' began receiving widespread use in the media following a series of high-profile incidents in [[France]] in the spring of 2009 where managers were detained by their workers. In early March, 2009, workers in southwestern France held the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony France]] overnight, demanding a better [[severance package]] for workers who had been laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Amble | first = Brian | title = Bossnapping | publisher = Management Issues | date = 2009-03-26 | url = http://www.management-issues.com/2009/3/26/blog/bossnapping.asp | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228112909/http://www.management-issues.com/2009/3/26/blog/bossnapping.asp | archivedate = 2009-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They barricaded the entrance to the facility with tree trunks, and held their hostages until the CEO agreed to a renegotiation of the severance package that laid-off workers were to receive. Later that month, workers at a pharmaceutical factory owned by [[3M]] in [[Pithiviers]] held their boss in his office demanding similar concessions for laid-off workers as well as protections for remaining workers whose jobs had not been cut. The workers claimed their actions were not intended to be aggressive, but were rather their "only currency." [[French police]] did not intervene in either the Sony or 3M incidents, in the expectation that each would be resolved peacefully, as they were in the end.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Sacked French workers take to 'bossnapping' | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 2009-03-25 | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jIIM90WyRdtmDowkRXClzkxsM7Xg | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers in the 3M incident provided a dinner of mussels and French Fries to their kidnapped boss while he was being held.&lt;ref name="jacard"/&gt;

In May 2010, workers of a [[Caterpillar Inc.]] plant in Grenoble took five managers as hostages to enforce negotiations about 733 job losses.&lt;ref&gt;sueddeutsche.de 17. May 2010: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/frankreich-manager-als-geisel-ab-jetzt-ein-trend-1.406947 Ab jetzt ein Trend ]&lt;/ref&gt; They ended their doing after 10 hours when policemen began to record the names of the participating people.&lt;ref name="sz1"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/arbeitnehmeraufstand-in-frankreich-flammender-protest-1.389727 Flammender Protest]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same month, about 300 workers of a Toyota factory in [[Onnaing]] (Northern France) blocked all entrances and hindered all trucks to leave the premises.&lt;ref name="sz1" /&gt;

Further bossnappings took place in a worksite of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in France and a lock-in of managers occurred at market research firm [[Synovate]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] as a part of a labor dispute during a contract renegotiation there.&lt;ref name="jacard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Locked out call-centre staff lock managers in | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 2009-04-14 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10566554 | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave of high-profile incidents led to publication of advice for managers who might be bossnapped, although news reports made clear that the hostages had been treated well by their bossnappers. This advice included the preparation of special bossnapping kits that included a change of clothes and a cell phone pre-programmed with numbers of family members, police, and a psychologist who might assist with the psychological stress caused by being the hostage in such an incident.&lt;ref name="jacard"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jacard | first = Alain | title = Bossnapping Wave Sweeps France | publisher = Agence France-Presse | date = 2009-04-23 | url = http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/23/bossnapping_wave_sweeps_france | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents took place in the context of wider French labor unrest related to the [[Late-2000s recession|recession of the late 2000s]], in which many companies in France and across the globe laid off workers during restructuring the companies did in response to falling profits or rising losses. Other labor incidents in France during this period included one in which laid-off workers threw eggs at their manager and burned effigies of him and another in which workers at a car parts factory threatened to blow it up after the factory was closed completely.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Bon, Gerard  |author2=Michelson, Marcel  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = French workers threaten to blow up factory | publisher = Reuters | date = 2009-07-12 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSLC42677020090712 | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2009, in response to the ongoing series of bossnapping incidents, French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] pledged to end the practice, saying, "We are a nation of laws. I won't allow this sort of thing." However, [[public opinion poll]]s in France at the time showed significant support for those using the strategy, a majority who disapproved of the tactic but sympathized with those practicing it, and only a small minority who completely opposed it. Thus, observers suggested that any strong action on the part of Sarkozy government to end bossnappings, included more proactive action by police to rescue hostages and arrest bossnappers, might lead to further unrest in other forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Matlack | first = Carol | title = Sarkozy's "Bossnapping" Dilemma | newspaper = Business Week | date = 2009-04-08 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/europeinsight/archives/2009/04/sarkozys_bossna.html | accessdate = 2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fresh grave.JPG|thumb|open burial vault awaiting [[coffin]] (2006)]]
A '''burial vault''' (also known as a '''burial liner''', '''grave vault''', and '''grave liner''') is a container, formerly made of wood or brick but more often today made of concrete, that encloses a coffin to help prevent a grave from sinking.  Wooden coffins (or caskets) decompose, and often the weight of earth on top of the coffin, or the passage of heavy cemetery maintenance equipment over it, can cause the casket to collapse and the soil above it to settle.

==About burial vaults==
[[File:Grave vault.jpg|thumb|A burial vault is prepared for shipment by an employee at Clark Grave Vault, Columbus, Ohio, 1938.]]
The burial vault or burial liner is designed to prevent the weight of earth or heavy cemetery maintenance equipment from collapsing the coffin beneath. Coffin collapse will cause the ground to sink and settle, marring the appearance of the cemetery and making it harder to maintain.{{sfn|Myers|2011|pages=74–75}} Burial vaults originally emerged as a means of ensuring that grave robbers could not easily access a coffin and remove valuables, clothing, or even bodies from the coffin.{{sfn|Mariaca-Sullivan|2011|page=94}} Early vaults were made of wood (the "rough box"),{{sfn|Crissman|1994|page=202}} although by the middle of the 1800s brick,{{sfn|Mariaca-Sullivan|2011|page=94}} iron and later steel vaults were used.{{sfn|Webster|2011|pages=141–144}} By the late 1800s, the fashion of burying the deceased with jewelry lost favor.{{sfn|Webster|2011|pages=141–144}} However, the value of burial vaults in ensuring that the ground did not settle over graves was seen, and burial vaults began to be more widely used.{{sfn|Mariaca-Sullivan|2011|page=94}} By the early part of the 20th century, concrete (and, later, [[reinforced concrete]]) vaults became more common.{{sfn|Webster|2011|pages=141–144}}

Although quite commonly used in many industrialized countries, the burial vault is very much a funerary item used almost exclusively in the 20th century. In the United States, the burial vault was largely unknown until the 1880s when the L.G. Haase Manufacturing Co., which owned a cemetery in [[Illinois]], conceived the burial vault as a means of adding a product line to their funerary sales.{{sfn|Mariaca-Sullivan|2011|page=94}} As late as 1915, only 5 to 10 percent of funerals in the United States used a burial vault or liner.{{sfn|Mitford|1998|page=36}} In the 1930s, company owner Wilbert Haase, who had an interest in Egyptian mummification, began promoting the sealed (or "waterproof") vault as a means of allegedly protecting the body from water, microbes, and vermin. The Haase company later purchased several plastics companies, and began manufacturing plastic burial vaults as well. The company dominates the American burial vault market today, with about 12 percent of all vault and liner sales.{{sfn|Mariaca-Sullivan|2011|page=94}}

A burial vault encloses a casket on all four sides, the top, and the bottom. Modern burial vaults are lowered into the grave, and the casket lowered into the vault. A lid is then lowered to cover the casket and seal the vault. Modern burial vaults may be made of concrete, metal, or plastic.{{sfn|Stevens|2008|page=50}} Because the sides of the burial vault are attached to the bottom of the vault, the burial vault is generally stronger than a burial liner.{{sfn|Stevens|2008|page=50}} Some burial vaults reverse the construction, so that only a base is placed beneath the coffin. The lid consists of the four sides and the top. These types of burial vaults allow a better seal between the lid and base.{{sfn|Webster|2011|page=144}}

A burial liner is similar to a burial vault, but does not have a bottom. With a burial liner, the coffin is lowered directly onto the earth. The burial liner is then lowered over the casket. Modern burial liners may also be made of concrete, metal, or plastic.{{sfn|Stevens|2008|page=51}} Many come in a wide array of colors, even stripes.{{sfn|Mitford|1998|page=36}}

Burial vaults do not prevent the decomposition of the human remains within.{{sfn|Stevens|2008|page=51}} Vaults which are installed incorrectly and too tightly sealed may not allow gases generated by the decomposing body to escape. Pressure then builds up within the vault until the vault ruptures, causing the vault to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/11/what-you-should-know-about-exploding-caskets/|last=Slocum|first=Josh|title=What You Should Know About Exploding Caskets|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some manufacturers of burial vaults claim that their vaults are "green" ([[environmentally friendly]]) and prevent the toxic chemicals used in [[embalming]] from leaching into the surrounding soil, such claims are uniformly false since the vault cannot be hermetically sealed without causing it to rupture from the pressure of decomposing gases.{{sfn|Slocum|Carlson|2011|pages=142–143}} A truly "green" or [[natural burial]] does not use embalming fluids, and does not attempt to protect the body from the soil and rapid decomposition.{{sfn|Mariaca-Sullivan|2011|page=123}}

Modern burial vaults often come in a variety of styles, which can greatly increase the cost.{{sfn|Stevens|2008|page=51}} Modern vaults and liners sometimes are lined on the inside with bronze, copper, [[fiberglass]], or [[stainless steel]] sheeting, and some vaults and liners are inscribed on the outer surface with words, scenes, or other images.{{sfn|Webster|2011|page=144}}

Some jurisdictions require the use of a burial vault or burial liner. For example, several [[U.S. state]]s require them.{{sfn|Stevens|2008|page=51}} In some cases, cemeteries require the use of a burial vault or liner, although it is not a legal requirement.{{sfn|Myers|2011|page=75}}

==World usage==
Data on the use of burial vaults and liners outside the United States is very difficult to come by, and usage rates are not known.{{sfn|Welsh|2012|page=851}} Burial vaults and liners are almost unheard of in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. [[Cremation]] is required in China, and is used in 90 percent of burials in Japan.{{sfn|Bryant|Peck|2009|pages=308–309}} They are also uncommon in [[Italy]]. In modern Italy, burial plots (either below-ground or in wall [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]]) are re-used after a period of years, usually 10 to 25. At that time, most of the soft body parts have decomposed, and the bones are removed to an [[ossuary]].{{sfn|Worpole|2003|pages=93–97}}

In the United States, the use of burial vaults is also decreasing, caused by a sharp rise in the number of cremations.  Whereas 36 percent of all deceased were cremated in the United States in 2008, the [[National Association of Funeral Directors]] forecast this to rise to 46 percent by 2015 and 59 percent by 2025.{{sfn|Barrett|London|Kroger|Hall|Baratz|2013|page=446}}

Jewish law does not bar the use of burial vaults or liners, and their use is permitted where law or a cemetery requires them.{{sfn|Isaacs|1992|page=156}} But Morrison David Bial argues that burial vaults are antithetical to traditional Judaism, in part because they deny the reality of death (e.g., inhibit decomposition of the body) and in part because they are ostentatious and undercut the equality of all people at death.{{sfn|Bial|1971|page=97}}

Islamic law requires only that the body be washed, anointed, and wrapped in linen for burial. Funerals must be kept simple, and no ostentation is allowed.{{sfn|Braswell|2000|page=79}} Preferably, the body should be buried without coffin or burial vault, although such is permitted if required by law. Generally, Muslims prefer to have separate cemeteries due to the specific preference for burial without coffin or vault.{{sfn|Maqsood|1994|page=109}}

==Criticisms==
Burial vaults and liners do not decompose, and have been criticized as being environmentally unfriendly.{{sfn|Welsh|2012|page=851}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/life/lifestyle/2008/01/30/Eternally-green-Woodland-burials-are-a-natural-alternative-to-an-embalmed-afterlife/stories/200801300180#ixzz3CYG7Tpk8|last=Pitz|first=Marylynne|title=Eternally green: Woodland burials are a natural alternative to an embalmed afterlife|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burial vaults and liners consumed more than {{convert|14000|ST|MT}} of steel and more than {{convert|1636000|ST|MT}} of reinforced concrete in 2009.&lt;ref name=missourian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mymissourian.com/2010/11/15/green-burial-spiritual-environmental-and-financial-factors-lead-some-to-seek-more-natural-burial-options/#sthash.KUU70i3q.dpuf|last=Wise|first=Rose|title='Green burial': Spiritual, Environmental and Financial Factors Lead Some to Seek More Natural Burial Options|website=MyMissourian.com|date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A burial vault or liner is not the only solution to settling earth over the grave. Traditional burials with a casket leave a larger void and thus create more settlement when the casket decomposes or collapses. Natural or "green" burials do not use a casket, which means only minimal settling. In either case, the cemetery can remedy sunken graves by filling in the settled area.&lt;ref name=missourian /&gt;

However, apart from the carbon cycle disturbance, there were also large disturbances in the oxygen and sulfur cycles of the ocean.

The event brought about the extinction of the [[Pliosauridae]], and many [[Ichthyosauria]]. [[Coracoid]]s of [[Maastrichtian]] age were once interpreted by some authors as belonging to ichthyosaurs, but these have since been interpreted as plesiosaur elements instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Sven|last2=Grant‐Mackie|first2=Jack A.|title=An ichthyosaur fragment from the Cretaceous of Northland, New Zealand|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|date=March 2003|volume=33|issue=1|pages=307–314|doi=10.1080/03014223.2003.9517732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cause is still uncertain, the result starved the Earth's oceans of oxygen for nearly half a million years, causing the extinction of approximately 27 percent of [[marine invertebrates]], including certain planktonic and benthonic foraminifera, mollusks, bivalves, dinoflagellates and calcareaous nannofossils.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926655.300-submarine-eruption-bled-earths-oceans-of-oxygen.html |title=Submarine eruption bled Earth's oceans of oxygen|date=16 July 2008 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=2018-05-09}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global environmental disturbance that resulted in these conditions increased atmospheric and oceanic temperatures.

The Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event was first noted by D'Orbigny who named the two stages. The global [[type section]] for this boundary is located in the Bridge Creek Limestone Member of the Greenhorn formation near Pueblo Colorado, which are bedded with the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch orbital signature]]. Here, a positive carbon-isotope event is clearly shown, although none of the characteristic, organic-rich black shale is present in this type-section. It has been estimated that the isotope shift lasted approximately 850 kyrs longer than the black shale event, which may be the cause of this anomaly in the Colorado type-section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sageman|first1=Bradley B.|last2=Meyers|first2=Stephen R.|last3=Arthur|first3=Michael A.|title=Orbital time scale and new C-isotope record for Cenomanian-Turonian boundary stratotype|journal=Geology|date=2006|volume=34|issue=2|pages=125|doi=10.1130/G22074.1|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/839b/27b846b6ce09ffe9b5be6fbd32664ca79b7c.pdf|bibcode=2006Geo....34..125S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significantly expanded OAE2 interval from southern Tibet documents a complete, more detailed, and finer-scale structures of the positive carbon isotope excursion that contains multiple shorter-term carbon isotope stages amounting to a total duration of 820±25 kyrs&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Yong-Xiang|last2=Montañez|first2=Isabel P.|last3=Liu|first3=Zhonghui|last4=Ma|first4=Lifeng|date=2017-03|title=Astronomical constraints on global carbon-cycle perturbation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.01.007|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=462|pages=35–46|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2017.01.007|issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In Europe, the boundary is known as the Bonarelli event because of 1-2 meter layer of thick black shale that marks the boundary. This layer was first studied by Guido Bonarelli in 1981 and is characterized by interbedded black shale, chert and radiolarian sands and has been known to span 400,000 years. Planktonic foraminifera do not exist in this Bonarelli level, and the presence of radiolarians in this section indicates relatively high productivity and an availability of nutrients.

One possible cause for the occurrence of this event is sub-oceanic volcanism, possibly the [[Caribbean large igneous province]], with increased activity approximately 500,000 years earlier. During that period, the rate of crustal production reached its highest level for 100 million years. This was largely caused by the widespread melting of hot [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] plumes under the oceans at the base of the [[lithosphere]]. This resulted in the thickening of the oceanic crust in the [[Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s. This volcanism would have sent large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Within the oceans, the emission of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[halogen]]s would have increased the acidity of the water, causing the dissolution of carbonate, and a further release of carbon dioxide. When the volcanic activity declined, this run-away [[greenhouse effect]] would have likely been put into reverse. The increased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of the oceans could have increased organic productivity in the ocean surface waters. The consumption of this newly abundant organic life by [[aerobic bacteria]] would produce anoxia and [[mass extinction]].&lt;ref name="newscientist1" /&gt; The resulting elevated levels of carbon burial would account for the [[black shale]] deposition in the ocean basins.&lt;ref name="Kerr 1998" /&gt;

== The δ13C isotope ==
The [[δ13C]] isotope found at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary is one of the main carbon isotope events of the geologic record. It represents one of the largest disturbances in the global carbon cycle from the past 110 million years. This δ13C isotope indicates that the ocean was depleted of oxygen at the time and that there was widespread deposition of organic carbon-rich sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nagm|first1=Emad|last2=El-Qot|first2=Gamal|last3=Wilmsen|first3=Markus|title=Stable-isotope stratigraphy of the Cenomanian–Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) boundary event (CTBE) in Wadi Qena, Eastern Desert, Egypt|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|date=December 2014|volume=100|pages=524–531|doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.07.023|issn=1464-343X|bibcode=2014JAfES.100..524N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the positive carbon isotope excursion, short eccentricity scale carbon isotope variability is documented in a significantly expanded OAE2 interval from southern Tibet&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Large igneous provinces and their possible contribution ==
Several independent LIP events occurred within the time near the OAE2. Within the time period from 90-95 million years ago, two independent LIP events occurred - the Madagascar and the Caribbean-Colombian. Trace metals such as chromium, [[scandium]], copper and cobalt have been found at the C-T boundary and this suggests that an LIP could have been involved in the occurrence of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Richard E.|last2=Youbi|first2=Nasrrddine|title=How Large Igneous Provinces affect global climate, sometimes cause mass extinctions, and represent natural markers in the geological record|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=July 2017|volume=478|pages=30–52|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.03.014|bibcode=2017PPP...478...30E}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the presence of these trace metals was found corresponding to the time right in the middle of the event as opposed to the beginning, suggesting that the LIP may have occurred during the time, but may not have been the initiator for the event. However, other studies linked the lead isotopes of the OAE2 to the Caribbean-Colombian and the Madagascar LIPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuroda|first1=J|last2=Ogawa|first2=N|last3=Tanimizu|first3=M|last4=Coffin|first4=M|last5=Tokuyama|first5=H|last6=Kitazato|first6=H|last7=Ohkouchi|first7=N|title=Contemporaneous massive subaerial volcanism and late cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 2|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=15 April 2007|volume=256|issue=1-2|pages=211–223|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.01.027|issn=0012-821X|bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.256..211K}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modeling study performed in 2011 also confirmed that it is possible that a LIP may have been initiated the event, as the model revealed that the peak amount of carbon dioxide degassing from volcanic LIP degassing could have resulted in more than 90% global deep ocean anoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flögel|first1=S.|last2=Wallmann|first2=K.|last3=Poulsen|first3=C.J.|last4=Zhou|first4=J.|last5=Oschlies|first5=A.|last6=Voigt|first6=S.|last7=Kuhnt|first7=W.|title=Simulating the biogeochemical effects of volcanic CO2 degassing on the oxygen-state of the deep ocean during the Cenomanian/Turonian Anoxic Event (OAE2)|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|date=May 2011|volume=305|issue=3-4|pages=371–384|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2011.03.018|issn=0012-821X|bibcode=2011E&amp;PSL.305..371F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes in oceanic biodiversity and its implications ==
The alterations in diversity of various marine invertebrate species such as calcareous nannofossils  indicate a time when the oceans were warm and oligotrophic, in an environment with short spikes of productivity  followed by long periods of low fertility. A study performed in the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary of Wunstorf, Germany, reveal the uncharacteristic dominance of a calcareous nannofossil species, ''Watznaueria'', present during the event. Unlike the ''Biscutum'' species, which prefer mesotrophic conditions and were generally the dominant species before and after the C/T Boundary event; ''Watznaueria'' species prefer warm, oligotrophic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linnert|first1=Christian|last2=Mutterlose|first2=Jörg|last3=Erbacher|first3=Jochen|title=Calcareous nannofossils of the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary interval from the Boreal Realm (Wunstorf, northwest Germany)|journal=Marine Micropaleontology|date=February 2010|volume=74|issue=1-2|pages=38–58|doi=10.1016/j.marmicro.2009.12.002|issn=0377-8398|bibcode=2010MarMP..74...38L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, there were also peak abundances of green algal groups ''[[Botryococcus]]'' and ''prasinophytes'', coincident with pelagic sedimentation. The abundances of these algal groups are strongly related to the increase of both the oxygen deficiency in the water column and the total organic carbon content. The evidence from these algal groups suggest that there were episodes of halocline stratification of the water column during the time. A species of freshwater dinocyst - the Bosedinia was also found in the rocks dated to the time and these suggest that the oceans had reduced salinity during the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prauss|first1=Michael L.|title=The Cenomanian/Turonian Boundary event (CTBE) at Tarfaya, Morocco: Palaeoecological aspects as reflected by marine palynology|journal=Cretaceous Research|date=April 2012|volume=34|pages=233–256|doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2011.11.004|issn=0195-6671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10920">'''Computational epistemology''' is a subdiscipline of [[formal epistemology]] that studies the intrinsic complexity of inductive problems for ideal and computationally bounded agents. In short, computational epistemology is to [[inductive reasoning|induction]] what [[recursion theory]] is to [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]].

==Themes==
Some of the themes of computational epistemology include:
*the essential likeness of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] (as illustrated by systematic analogies between their respective [[complexity classes]])
*the treatment of discovery, prediction and assessment methods as [[Effective method|effective procedures]] ([[algorithms]]) as originates in [[algorithmic learning theory]].
*the characterization of inductive inference problems as consisting of:  
#a set of relevant possibilities ([[possible worlds]]), each of which specifies some potentially infinite sequence of inputs to the scientist’s method,  
#a question whose potential answers [[Partition of a set|partition]] the relevant possibilities (in the set theoretic sense),   
#a convergent success criterion and 
#a set of admissible methods  
*the notion of logical reliability for inductive problems

==Quotations==

Computational epistemology definition:
:"Computational epistemology is an interdisciplinary field that concerns itself with the relationships and constraints between reality, measure, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom" (Rugai, 2013)

On making inductive problems easier to solve:
:"Eliminating relevant possibilities, weakening the convergence criterion, coarsening the question, or augmenting the collection of potential strategies all tend to make a problem easier to solve" (Kelly, 2000a)

On the divergence of computational epistemology from [[Bayesian confirmation theory]] and the like:
:"Whenever you are inclined to explain a feature of science in terms of probability and confirmation, take a moment to see how the issue would look in terms of complexity and success"(Kelly, 2000a)

Computational epistemology in a nutshell:
::Formal learning theory is very simple in outline. An inductive problem specifies a range of epistemically possible worlds over which to succeed and determines what sort of output would be correct, where correctness may embody both content and truth (or some analogous virtue like empirical adequacy). Each possible world produces an input stream which the inductive method processes sequentially, generating its own output stream, which may terminate (ending with a mark indicating this fact) or go on forever. A notion of success specifies how the method should converge to a correct output in each possible world. A method solves the problem (in a given sense) [[if and only if|just in case]] the method succeeds (in the appropriate sense) in each of the possible worlds specified by the problem. We say that such a method is reliable since it succeeds over all the epistemically possible worlds. Of two non-solutions, one is as reliable as the other just in case it succeeds in all the worlds the other one succeeds in. That's all there is to it! (Kelly et al. 1997)

On the proper role of methodology:
:"It is for empirical science to investigate the details of the mechanisms whereby we track, and for methodologists to devise and refine even better (inferential) mechanisms and methods" (Nozick, 1981)

In [[social dynamics]], '''critical mass''' is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth. The term is borrowed from nuclear physics and in that field it refers to the amount of a substance needed to sustain a chain reaction.

Social factors influencing critical mass may involve the size, interrelatedness and level of communication in a society or one of its subcultures. Another is [[social stigma]], or the possibility of public advocacy due to such a factor.

Critical mass may be closer to majority consensus in political circles, where the most effective position is more often that held by the majority of people in society. In this sense, small changes in public consensus can bring about swift changes in political consensus, due to the majority-dependent effectiveness of certain ideas as tools of political debate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Critical mass is a concept used in a variety of contexts, including [[Critical mass|physics]], [[group dynamics]], [[politics]], [[public opinion]], and [[technology]].

==History==
The concept of critical mass was originally created by game theorist [[Thomas Schelling]] and sociologist [[Mark Granovetter]] to explain the actions and behaviors of a wide range of people and phenomenon. The concept was first established (although not explicitly named) in Schelling's essay about racial segregation in neighborhoods, published in 1971 in the Journal of Mathematical Sociology,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schelling, "Dynamic models of segregation", Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and later refined in his book, ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'', published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas C. Micromotives and Macrobehavior. New York: Norton, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He did use the term "critical density" with regard to pollution in his "On the Ecology of Micromotives".&lt;ref&gt;Schelling, Thomas C. "On the Ecology of Micromotives," The Public Interest, No. 25, Fall 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Granovetter, in his essay "Threshold models of collective behavior", published in the [[American Journal of Sociology]] in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 1978 | title = Threshold Models of Collective Behavior | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 83 | issue = 6| page = 1420 | doi=10.1086/226707}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked to solidify the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Krauth, Brian. "Notes for a History of the Critical Mass Model." SFU.ca. Web. 29 November 2011. https://www.sfu.ca/~bkrauth/papers/critmass.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Everett Rogers later cites them both in his important work ''Diffusion of Innovations'', in which critical mass plays an important role.

===Predecessors===
The concept of critical mass had existed before it entered a sociology context. It was an established concept in [[medicine]], specifically [[epidemiology]], since the 1920s, as it helped to explain the spread of illnesses.

It had also been a present, if not solidified, idea in the study of consumer habits and economics, especially in [[General Equilibrium Theory]]. In his papers, Schelling quotes the well-known [[The Market for Lemons|"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"]] paper written in 1970 by George Akerlof.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, George A. The Market for "lemons": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism. 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Granovetter cited the [[Nash Equilibrium]] game in his papers.

Finally, [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s essay, "Bandwagon and underdog effects and the possibility of election predictions", published in 1954   in [[Public Opinion Quarterly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuran | first1 = Timur | year = 1987 | title = Chameleon Voters and Public Choice | url = | journal = Public Choice | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 53–78 | doi=10.1007/bf00115654}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as a predecessor to the concept we now know as critical mass.

==Logic of collective action and common good==
Critical mass and the theories behind it help us to understand aspects of humans as they act and interact in a larger social setting. Certain theories, such as [[Mancur Olson]]'s [[Logic of Collective Action]]&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Mancur. The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1971. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Garrett Hardin]]'s [[Tragedy of the Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1968 | title = The Tragedy of the Commons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 162 | issue = 3859| pages = 1243–248 | doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 | pmid=5699198 | last1 = Hardin | first1 = G| bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1243H}}&lt;/ref&gt; work to help us understand why humans do or adopt certain things which are beneficial to them, or, more importantly, why they do not. Much of this reasoning has to do with individual interests trumping that which is best for the collective whole, which may not be obvious at the time.

Oliver, Marwell, and Teixeira tackle this subject in relation to critical theory in a 1985 article published in the [[American Journal of Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oliver | first1 = P. | last2 = Marwell | first2 = G. | last3 = Teixeira | first3 = R. | year = 1985 | title = A Theory of Critical Mass: I. Interdependence, Group Heterogeneity, and the Production of Collective Action | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 552–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their essay, they define that action in service of a public good as "[[collective action]]". "Collective Action" is beneficial to all, regardless of individual contribution. By their definition, then, "critical mass" is the small segment of a societal system that does the work or action required to achieve the common good. The "Production Function" is the correlation between resources, or what individuals give in an effort to achieve public good, and the achievement of that good. Such function can be decelerating, where there is less utility per unit of resource, and in such a case, resource can taper off. On the other hand, the function can be accelerating, where the more resources that are used the bigger the payback. "Heterogeneity" is also important to the achievement of a common good. Variations (heterogeneity) in the value individuals put on a common good or the effort and resources people give is beneficial, because if certain people stand to gain more, they are willing to give or pay more.

==Gender politics==

Critical mass theory in gender politics and collective political action is defined as the critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kanter | first = Rosabeth Moss | author-link = Rosabeth Moss Kanter | title = Some effects of proportions on group life: skewed sex ratios and responses to token women | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–990  for the [[University of Chicago Press]] | date = March 1977 | jstor = 2777808 | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1086/226425}} [http://www.nhh.no/Files/Filer/adm/personal/Likestilling/MossKanter.pdf Pdf from Norges Handelshøyskole (NHH), the Norwegian School of Economics.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128184313/http://www.nhh.no/files/filer/adm/personal/likestilling/mosskanter.pdf |date=28 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number has been placed at 30%, before women are able to make a substantial difference in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | author-link = Drude Dahlerup | title = From a small to a large minority: women in Scandinavian politics | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 275–297 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x | date = December 1988 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dahlerup | first = Drude | author-link = Drude Dahlerup | title = The story of the theory of critical mass | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 511–522 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X0624114X | date = December 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X0624114X | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research suggests lower numbers of women working together in legislature can also affect political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Childs | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Krook | first2 = Mona Lena | title = Should feminists give up on critical mass?

==Interactive media==
While critical mass can be applied to many different aspects of sociodynamics, it becomes increasingly applicable to innovations in interactive media such as the telephone, fax, or email. With other non-interactive innovations, the dependence on other users was generally sequential, meaning that the early adopters influenced the later adopters to use the innovation. However, with interactive media, the interdependence was reciprocal, meaning both users influenced each other. This is due to the fact that interactive media have high [[network effect]],&lt;ref name="Rogers, Everett M 2003"&gt;Rogers, Everett M. Diffusion of Innovations. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where in the value and utility of a good or service increases the more users it has. Thus, the increase of adopters and quickness to reach critical mass can therefore be faster and more intense with interactive media, as can the rate at which previous users discontinue their use. The more people that use it, the more beneficial it will be, thus creating a type of snowball effect, and conversely, if users begin to stop using the innovation, the innovation loses utility, thus pushing more users to discontinue their use.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title= Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media: Universal Access, Interdependence and Diffusion, 14:491 |author=M. Lynne Markus|year=1987 |publisher=Communication Research |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markus essay===
In [[M. Lynne Markus]]' essay in ''Communication Research'' entitled "Toward a 'Critical Mass' Theory of Interactive Media",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; several propositions are made that try to predict under what circumstances interactive media is most likely to achieve critical mass and reach [[universal access]], a "common good" using Oliver, ''et al''.'s terminology. One proposition states that such media's existence is all or nothing, where in if universal access is not achieved, then, eventually, use will discontinue. Another proposition suggests that a media's ease of use and inexpensiveness, as well as its utilization of an "active notification capability" will help it achieve universal access. The third proposition states that the heterogeneity, as discussed by Oliver, et al. is beneficial, especially if users are dispersed over a larger area, thus necessitating interactivity via media. Fourth, it is very helpful to have highly sought-after individuals to act as early adopters, as their use acts as incentive for later users. Finally, Markus posits that interventions, both monetarily and otherwise, by governments, businesses, or groups of individuals will help a media reach its critical mass and achieve universal access.

===Fax machine example===
[[File:Samfax.jpg|thumb|300px|A fax machine]]
An example put forth by Rogers in ''Diffusion of Innovations'' was that of the [[fax|fax machine]], which had been around for almost 150 years before it became popular and widely used. It had existed in various forms and for various uses, but with more advancements in the technology of faxes, including the use of existing phone lines to transmit information, coupled with falling prices in both machines and cost per fax, the fax machine reached a critical mass in 1987, when "Americans began to assume that 'everybody else' had a fax machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Adoption and Use of Fax in Sweden |author=Holmlov, Kramer and Karl-Eric Warneryd|year=1990 |publisher=Elmservier Science |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], the character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 1, #92 (October 1972).

== Publication history ==

Dran debuted in a three-part story that took place in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 1, #92-94 and went on to appear in ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' Vol. 1, #11-13&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author = Robert G.

== Fictional character biography ==

An unscrupulous munitions magnate, Damon Dran became paranoid regarding his own mortality and so secretly commissioned the creation of Project Four, a weapon that would imbue him with the power necessary to survive the "inevitable" [[World War III]]. After Project Four was stolen by [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and Danny French,&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Gene Colan|inker = Tom Palmer|letterer = Sam Rosen|editor = Roy Thomas|story = The Sinister Secret of Project Four!|title = Daredevil|volume = 1|issue = #90|date = August 1972|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MP"&gt; {{cite web|url = https://moviepilot.com/posts/3279809|title = Top 20 female superheroes and villains of Marvel|last = Stavrakoudi|first = Lia|publisher = [[Moviepilot]]|date = 1 July 2015|website = moviepilot.com|accessdate = 11 May 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dran spent years trying to locate it and eventually tracked both French and Black Widow down to [[San Francisco]], where he had them captured and brought to his mansion in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Dran is able to discern Project Four's whereabouts by subjecting French to a mind probe, and while the device is prepared for him he sets [[Blue Talon]] and a brainwashed Black Widow against Black Widow's partner [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].&lt;ref name = "DD"&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Gerry Conway|penciller = Gene Colan|inker = Tom Palmer|letterer = John Costanza|editor = Roy Thomas|title = Daredevil|volume = 1|issue = #92-94|date = October 1972 - December 1972|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Daredevil survives the attempts on his life and locates Dran's manor, breaking into it just as Dran uses Project Four to become the '''"Indestructible Man"'''. With his new powers, Dran sets out to massacre and subjugate humanity and easily resists Daredevil, Black Widow and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]'s attempts to prevent him from reaching San Francisco. French joins the fray and sacrifices himself to destroy Project Four, weakening Dran enough for him to be taken down by Daredevil and Black Widow.&lt;ref name = "DD"/&gt;

Dran was left disfigured and was robbed of his abilities by the battle, but his invulnerability and super strength at some point returned and he began plotting his revenge against Black Widow. Dran lures Black Widow to [[Russia]] (where he frames her for murder) and then to [[Hong Kong]] by abducting her friend Ivan Petrovich. Black Widow defeats all of the mercenaries that Dran sends to Hong Kong to capture her, but is subdued by and brought to a private island by Dran's personal assassin [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]]. There, Dran reveals that he intends to further ruin Black Widow's life by having a duplicate of her destroy the [[Helicarrier]] and kill [[Nick Fury]]. Black Widow is able to escape with Petrovich and alert Fury to the threat of her doppelganger, who Fury shoots before bombing Dran's island.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Ralph Macchio and George Perez|penciller = George Perez, Bob Layton and Luke McDonnell|inker = Brett Breeding|colorist = Petra Scotese|letterer = Tom Orzechowski|editor = Al Milgrom|story = Widow|title = Marvel Fanfare|volume = 1|issue = #10|date = September 1983|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Ralph Macchio and George Perez|penciller = George Perez|inker = Joe Sinnott and Jack Abel|colorist = Ben Sean|letterer = Tom Orzechowski|editor = Al Milgrom|story = Back iᴎ the U.S.S.Я.|title = Marvel Fanfare|volume = 1|issue = #11|date = November 1983|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Ralph Macchio and George Perez|penciller = George Perez|inker = Al Milgrom|colorist = Bob Sharen|letterer = Jim Novak|editor = Al Milgrom|story = The Web Tightens!|title = Marvel Fanfare|volume = 1|issue = #12|date = January 1984|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Ralph Macchio|penciller = George Perez|inker = John Beatty and Brett Breeding|colorist = Ben Sean|letterer = Diana Albers|editor = Allen Milgrom|story = The Widow... Alone|title = Marvel Fanfare|volume = 1|issue = #13|date = March 1984|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Setting up anew in [[Louisiana]], Dran began abducting children, selling some to buyers overseas and the rest to [[Baron Zemo|Helmut]] and Heike Zemo. When [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] and [[Moonhunter]] began investigating the death of Dran's former minion Snapdragon, the two are captured and brought to Dran's estate by his new agent, Golddigger. [[Captain America]] and [[Americop]] break into Dran's mansion, the former in search of Diamondback and Moonhunter and the latter in search of the kidnapped children, and are subdued by Dran and his lackeys, but in the confusion Diamondback escapes and contacts Black Widow, who helps her free Captain America and Moonhunter. Americop, who had escaped on his own, locates Dran, shoots down his getaway helicopter and leaves him to be arrested by Black Widow.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Mark Gruenwald|penciller = Dave Hoover|inker = Danny Bulanadi|colorist = George Roussos|letterer = Joe Rosen|editor = Mike Rockwitz and Ralph Macchio|story = Fighting Chance|title = Captain America|volume = 1|issue = #428-430|date = June 1994 - August 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MP"/&gt;

Dran escapes from custody and goes into hiding, managing to evade even S.H.I.E.L.D. At some point, Dran began to lose his invincibility, which he tried restore through cybernetic implants. After making the acquaintance of Molot Boga, a deranged and [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] monk, Dran molded the man into becoming his personal assassin, the "Hammer of God". From a sealed chamber in the heart of his fortified yacht, Dran instructs Boga to begin eliminating his enemies, starting with a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] diplomat.&lt;ref name = "ANMN"&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Nathan Edmondson|penciller = Phil Noto|inker = Phil Noto|colorist = Phil Noto|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Ellie Pyle|title = Black Widow|volume = 5|issue = #4-6|date = 12 March 2014 - 7 May 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Black Widow becomes involved due to being present at the Ukrainian embassy when it is bombed by Boga. While Black Widow fails to stop Boga from taking out his next target, a [[Croatia]]n ambassador, she does manage to prevent him from claiming his third victim, a diplomat at the [[Gatwick Airport]]. While Dran recovers the mortally wounded Boga and saves his life by giving him bionic implants similar to his own, Black Widow learns that Dran's yacht is situated near the coast of [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name = "ANMN"/&gt;

Black Widow boards Dran's ship, kills his henchmen and Molot, and delivers him to S.H.I.E.L.D. While in custody, Dran rants about an organization called Chaos and dies in his cell when it is flooded with an acidic gas released by a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who had been corrupted by Chaos.&lt;ref name = "ANMN"/&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==

The Project Four device that he funded the creation of gave Dran superhuman strength and invulnerability, allowed him to increase his size and gave him the ability to project energy beams from his hands. The full extent of Dran's indestructibility is unknown, but it allowed him to survive his island being blown up by a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and possibly removed his need for basic human necessities such as air, as he at one point breathed in knockout gas to no ill-effect. Project Four being destroyed by Danny French temporarily robbed Dran of his powers, but his strength and invincibility at some point returned; Dran eventually lost those powers as well, however, and made a crude attempt at replicating them through the use of cybernetic implants which required stabilizers in the form of [[Ultraviolet|U.V.]] lights and special pills. The implants proved to be nowhere near as effective as Dran's former abilities, as they completely failed to protect him from a corrosive gas attack.

'''David Abercromby''' was a 17th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[physician]] and writer, thought to have died in 1702.&lt;ref name = Pyle&gt;[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article pp. 2-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brought up at [[Douai]] as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, he was converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1682 and came to abjure [[popery]], and published ''Protestancy proved Safer than Popery'' (1686).

==Works==

His medical reputation was based on his ''Tuta ac efficax luis venereae saepe absque mercurio ac semper absque salivatione mercuriali curando methodus'' (1684) which was translated into [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]].  Two other works by him were ''De Pulsus Variatione'' (1685), and ''Ars explorandi medicas facultates plantarum ex solo sapore'' (1688); his ''Opuscula'' were collected in 1687. These professional writings gave him a place and memorial in [[Albrecht von Haller]], ''Bibliotheca Medicinae Practicae'' (1779). According to Haller he was alive early in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Abercromby, David|volume=1|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote some books in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], controversial in their time but little remembered today.   But the most noticeable of his productions is ''A Discourse of Wit'' (1685), which contains some of the most characteristic metaphysical opinions of the Scottish philosophy of common sense.  It was followed by ''Academia Scientiarum'' (1687), and by ''A Moral Discourse of the Power of Interest'' (1690), dedicated to [[Robert Boyle]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Abercromby's patron in the 1680s.  He later wrote ''Reasons Why A Protestant Should not Turn Papist'' (1687), which has often wrongly been attributed to Boyle.  ''A Short Account of Scots Divines'', by him, was printed at [[Edinburgh]] in 1833, edited by James Maidment.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Early life==

Carradine was born on December 8, 1936, as '''John Arthur Carradine''',&lt;ref name="CA-Birth-Index"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com|title= California Birth Index, 1905–1995, database on-line|publisher= The Generations Network|location= United States|year=2005|access-date=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood, California]], the oldest child of actor [[John Carradine]] and his wife Ardanelle Abigail (McCool).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Primarily of Irish descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/david-carradines-widow-files-wrongful-death-suit/story?id=10825994|title=Carradine's Widow Files Wrongful Death Suit|first=A.

Called "Jack" by his family, Carradine's childhood was turbulent. His parents divorced and repeatedly remarried; he was born to his mother's second marriage of three, and his father's first of four. At the time of Carradine's parents' marriage, his mother already had a son by her first husband, whom John adopted. John Carradine planned a large family, but after his wife had a series of [[miscarriage]]s, he discovered she had had numerous abortions without his knowledge. This rendered her unable to carry a baby to full term.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt; Against this backdrop of marital discord, David almost succeeded in committing suicide&lt;ref name="FOX Bio"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2009/06/04/fast-facts-david-carradine-biography/ David Carradine Biography]. FOX. Updated June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; by hanging at the age of five. He said the incident followed his discovery that he and his older half-brother, Bruce, who had been adopted by John, had different biological fathers. Carradine added, "My father saved me, and then confiscated my comic book collection and burned it&amp;nbsp;– which was scarcely the point."&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;

After three years of marriage, Ardenelle filed for divorce from John, but the couple remained married for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;"Sued for Divorce," ''Desert News'' (February 4, 1945) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce finally came in 1944, when Carradine was seven years old.

By this time, his father had remarried. For the next few years David was shuffled between boarding schools, foster homes, and reform school.&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt; He also would often accompany his father while the elder Carradine performed summer theater throughout the Northeast. Carradine spent time in Massachusetts and even one miserable winter milking cows on a farm in Vermont.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheridan&gt;Sheridan, Patricia (March 31, 2008) [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08091/869248-129.stm Patricia Sheridan's Breakfast with David Carradine], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, David Carradine returned to California, where he graduated from [[Oakland High School (Oakland, California)|Oakland High School]]. He attended [[Oakland Junior College]] (currently [[Laney College]]) for a year before transferring to [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], where he studied drama and music theory,&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt; and wrote music for the drama department's annual revues while juggling work at menial jobs, a fledgling stage acting career, and his studies. After he dropped out of college, Carradine spent some time with the "[[beatnik]]s"&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/74249/personmain.jhtml David Carradine Biography].

During this time he collected unemployment insurance and sold baby pictures. He was also prosecuted for disturbing the peace.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;

Despite an attempt to [[Draft evasion|dodge the draft]],&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt; in 1960 Carradine was inducted into the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt; where he drew pictures for training aids.

==Film and television career==

===Early successes===
[[File:Martin Milner Bob Hope Theatre War Eric Kurtz.jpg|thumb|David Carradine (left) and [[Martin Milner]] in the ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre|Chrysler Theatre]]'' presentation "The War and Eric Kurtz" (1965)]]
Upon leaving the Army, Carradine became serious about his acting pursuits. It was at that time that he was advised to change his name to avoid confusion with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of ''[[Armstrong Circle Theatre]]''. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]].'' He made his feature film debut in 1964 in ''[[Taggart (1964 film)|Taggart]]'', a western based on a novel by [[Louis L'Amour]].

His first big break, however, came with his second Broadway part in ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'', a play by [[Peter Shaffer]] about the destruction of the [[Inca civilization|Inca empire]] by [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Pizarro]]. He said of this performance, "Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was going to hire me was in that audience and had his mind blown."&lt;ref name="Onion" /&gt; For that part, Carradine won a [[Theatre World Award]] for Best Debut Performance in 1965.&lt;ref name=theatre&gt;{{cite web | title = Theatre World Awards, 1965–66| url = http://www.theatreworldawards.org/award.html| access-date = June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the closing of ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun'', and the failing of his marriage, Carradine left New York and headed back to California. He returned to TV to star in the short-lived series ''[[Shane (TV series)|Shane]]'', a 1966 western based upon [[Shane (novel)|a 1949 novel of the same name]] and [[Shane (film)|previously filmed in 1953]].

Carradine guest-starred opposite [[David McCallum]] in a 1971 episode of ''[[Night Gallery]]'' titled "The Phantom Farmhouse." Also in 1971, Carradine played a hippie reprobate opposite [[Sally Field]] in the well-received television movie ''[[Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unobtainium13.com/2015/04/21/embracing-the-melodrama-part-ii-39-maybe-ill-come-home-in-the-spring-dir-by-joseph-sargent/|website=Through the Shattered Lens|title=Embracing the Melodrama Part II #39: Maybe I’ll Come Home In The Spring (dir by Joseph Sargent)|author=Bowman, Lisa Marie|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he co-starred as "Big" Bill Shelly in one of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s earliest films, ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'', which starred [[Barbara Hershey]], his domestic partner at the time (see Personal life). This was one of several [[Roger Corman]] productions in which he was to appear.&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; It was also one of a handful of acting collaborations he did with his father, John.

===''Kung Fu''===
[[File:David Carradine as Caine from Kung Fu - c. 1972–1975.jpg|thumb|upright|Carradine as Caine.]]
For three seasons, Carradine starred as a half-Chinese, half-white [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monk, [[Kwai Chang Caine]], on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] hit TV series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' (1972–1975) and was nominated for an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]]&lt;ref name="HFPA" /&gt; for the role. The show, which took place in the [[Old West]], helped, with Bruce Lee movies, to popularize the martial arts and [[Eastern philosophy]] in the west, and immortalized the character of Kwai Chang Caine, also referred to as "Grasshopper," in popular culture.

Although the choice of a white man to play the role of Kwai Chang Caine stirred controversy, the show served as steady employment for several Asian-American actors in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Kung Fu Book of Caine: The Complete Guide to TV's First Mystical Eastern Western| last = Pilato| first = Herbie J| year = 1993| publisher = [[Tuttle Publishing|Charles A. Tuttle]]| location = [[Boston]]| isbn = 0-8048-1826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Keye Luke]] and [[Philip Ahn]], who held leading roles in the cast as Caine's Shaolin masters, [[Robert Ito]], [[James Hong]], [[Benson Fong]], [[Richard Loo]], and [[Victor Sen Yung]] frequently appeared in the series. ''Kung Fu'' ended when Carradine quit to pursue a movie career, but he reprised the role of [[Kwai Chang Caine]] in 1986 in ''[[Kung Fu: The Movie]]''. [[Brandon Lee]], son of [[Bruce Lee]], in his acting debut, portrayed his son.

In 1991, he reprised the role of Caine in a cameo appearance in the TV movie ''[[The Gambler (TV movie series)|The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw]]'', in which Caine uses his Chinese friends to help the title character in 1903 San Francisco.

Early in the 1990s, Carradine once again reprised the role of Kwai Chang Caine in ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]'' (1993–97) playing the grandson of the original character of the same name. Carradine starred in the program and served as executive producer and director. The program offered him the opportunity to recreate the character for which he was most widely recognized. The show was canceled in 1997, after four seasons and 88 episodes.

===Film career===
Immediately following the ''Kung Fu'' series, Carradine accepted the role as the race car driver ''Frankenstein'' in ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (1975), he said, to "kill the image of Caine and launch a movie career."&lt;ref&gt;Carradine, David (1997). ''Spirit of the Shaolin'', Charles Tuttle, p. 49, {{ISBN|0804817510}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roger Corman exploitation film became a cult classic. It was based on [[Ib Melchior]]'s first science fiction work, a short story called ''The Racer''.&lt;ref&gt;Kalat, David (2009). ''Death Race 2000''. TCM Underground, Accessed January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Carradine was tapped to play [[Duke Leto Atreides]] in [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s aborted ''[[Dune]]'' adaptation in the late 1970s.

[[File:Carradine.jpg|Carradine in April 2005|thumb|upright|left]]

In 1976, Carradine earned critical praise for his portrayal of folksinger [[Woody Guthrie]] in [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'' (1976) for which he won a [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1976 National Board of Review Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516092202/http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1976 |date=May 16, 2006 }}. Nbrmp.org. Retrieved on July 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award&lt;ref name="HFPA" /&gt; and [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for his role as Guthrie. Carradine worked very closely with his friend, singer-songwriter-guitarist Guthrie Thomas, on the ''Bound for Glory'' film. Thomas assisted Carradine in the guitar style of the period and the songs that had been chosen to be in the film itself.

Next came the role of the alcoholic, unemployed trapeze artist Abel Rosenberg in ''[[The Serpent's Egg (film)|The Serpent's Egg]]'' (1977). Set in post-World War I Berlin, ''The Serpent's Egg'', which also starred [[Liv Ullmann]], is together with ''[[The Touch (1971 film)|The Touch]]'' one of the two only English-language films made by legendary [[Sweden|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]].&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01E3DF1E3EE632A25754C2A9679C946990D6CF The Serpent's Egg Screen: Slouching Toward Berlin: Made in Exile](1978) The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman said of his leading man, "I don't believe in God, but Heaven must have sent him."&lt;ref name="People" /&gt; Carradine said that he and Bergman had plans for further collaboration, but the director's affection for the actor waned when the latter passionately protested a scene that included the butchering of a horse. The altercation caused Carradine to question the fate of Bergman's soul while the director declared, "Little Brother, I am an old whore. I have shot two other horses, burned one and strangled a dog."&lt;ref name="People" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;

When Bruce Lee died in 1973, he left an unreleased movie script that he had developed with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] called ''The Silent Flute''. The script became ''[[Circle of Iron]]'' (1978), and in the film, Carradine played the four roles that were originally intended for Lee. Carradine considered this to be among his best work.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, Robert (July 14, 2009) [http://www.thehdroom.com/news/Circle_of_Iron_Blu-ray_Review/5250 Circle of Iron Blu-ray Review], thehdroom.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carradine, David and Moore, Richard "Circle of Iron DVD Extra Feature Commentary"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 Carradine appeared in ''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980), with his half-brothers [[Keith Carradine|Keith]] and [[Robert Carradine]]. The ensemble cast included three other brother/actor groupings: [[Stacy Keach|Stacy]] and [[James Keach]]; [[Dennis Quaid|Dennis]] and [[Randy Quaid]],&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt; and [[Christopher Guest|Christopher]] and [[Nicholas Guest]]. The movie, which was about the [[Jesse James]] gang, gave Carradine, who played [[Cole Younger]], one of his most memorable roles.&lt;ref name= yinyang&gt;Johnson, Reed (June 5, 2009) [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/05/entertainment/et-carradine5 The Yin-Yang of David Carradine], Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, David Carradine's acting career suffered a decline. Although he continued to amass movie and television credits, few of his roles garnered much attention. Most of his work was released straight to video. However, a few of his movies, such as ''[[The Warrior and the Sorceress]]'' (1984), ''[[Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat]]'' (1990) and ''[[Sonny Boy (1989 film)|Sonny Boy]]'' (1989), developed cult followings. In 1989 he starred in the low budget direct-to-video Swedish action movie ''[[The Mad Bunch]]'' directed by [[Mats Helge Olsson]], making him one of three actors (including [[Heinz Hopf (actor)|Heinz Hopf]] and [[Tor Isedal]]) who have starred in both an Ingmar Bergman movie and an Olsson movie.&lt;ref&gt;Ekeroth, Daniel (2011) ''[[Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema]]'', Bazillion Points, {{ISBN|978-0-9796163-6-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Carradine was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The presenters played an April Fool's Day prank on him by first unveiling a star bearing the name of his brother, [[Robert Carradine|Robert]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8OkyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1QcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4380,139684&amp;dq=carradine+david&amp;hl=en Being a Carradine can be confusing].

Carradine enjoyed a revival of his fame when he was cast in Quentin Tarantino's sequential ''[[Kill Bill]]''  movies, in 2003 and 2004. Among those who thought his portrayal of Bill, the assassin extraordinaire, would earn him an Academy Award nomination was [[Scott Mantz]] of ''The Mediadrome'', who said, "Carradine practically steals every scene he's in with confident gusto, and he gives a soulful performance that should all but ensure a spot on next year's Oscar ballot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Scott Mantz|author=Mantz, Scott|title=Kill Bill Vol. 2|url=http://www.moviemantz.com/movie_reviews/404/kill_bill2.html | access-date=2010-09-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511214245/http://www.moviemantz.com/movie_reviews/404/kill_bill2.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |df=mdy|date=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper each had ''Kill Bill Vol. 2'' on their top ten list for of Academy Awards predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Mike (December 29, 2004) [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7755448_ITM Roeper agree on five for their Top Ten List], ''Knight Rider Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the films received no notice from the Academy, Carradine did receive a [[Golden Globe]] nomination&lt;ref name="HFPA" /&gt; and a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Supporting Actor&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt; for his portrayal of Bill.

Carradine also appeared as a mysterious martial artist, The Master, in the 2009 DVD premier ''[[Big Stan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;IMBD&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television appearances===
Carradine attracted notice in 1985 when he appeared in a major supporting role in ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]'', a [[miniseries]] about the [[American Civil War]], as the evil and abusive Justin LaMotte. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance.&lt;ref name="HFPA" /&gt; He also appeared in ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South, Book II]]'', telecast in May 1986.

In addition, he was featured in a Lipton Tea commercial, which first aired during the broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXVIII]]. The advertisement paid tribute to [[The Three Stooges]] while satirizing his role in ''Kung Fu''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72222790.html?dids=72222790:72222790&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+31%2C+1994&amp;author=Tom+Shales&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Not+Even+the+Commercials+Were+Super&amp;pqatl=google "Not Even the Commercials Were Super"], ''Washington Post'' (January 31, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he made an appearance as the demon Tempus in the Season 1 finale episode of ''[[Charmed]]''. In 2001, he appeared in the episode "The Serpent" of the syndicated TV series ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' as the sword-wielding bandit ''El Serpiente'' filmed at [[Texas Hollywood]] studios in Almeria, Spain, home of many [[spaghetti western]]s. David also did a guest appearance in episode 11 of ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' as himself and also starring his brother Robert who plays Lizzie’s father. David Carradine took over hosting duties from his brother [[Keith Carradine|Keith]] on ''[[Wild West Tech]]'' on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], in 2005. The same year he also played both himself and the ghost of a dead man for an episode of the NBC TV show ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]''. By 2006, he had become the spokesperson for [[Yellowbook]], a publisher of independent telephone directories in the United States. He also appeared as the ghost of time, Clockwork, in two episodes of the animated series, ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. He also starred in the 2008 TV movie, ''[[Kung Fu Killer]]'', in which he played a Chinese martial arts master very similar to his ''Kung Fu'' series "Caine" persona—his character in this movie named "White Crane", and mostly referred to or addressed as "C''r''and," frequently spoken with a sort of accent that minimized the R sound.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Posthumous releases===
The actor, who once received an award for being the hardest working member of his profession in Hollywood,&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/david-carradine-a-slice-of-the-action-568334.html Carradine: A Slice of the Action]. (2004)The Independent. Accessed on September 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; still had approximately a dozen films in "post-production" at the time of his death in 2009. Most of these roles were cameos or small parts in independent, direct to DVD productions. Among them, a horror film, ''[[Dark Fields (2009 film)|Dark Fields]]'' (2009); an action film, ''Bad Cop'' (2009); and a western, ''All Hell Broke Loose'' (2009).

Carradine also appeared in a minor role in [[Yuen Woo-ping]]'s Chinese kung fu epic ''[[True Legend]]''. Carradine and Yuen first met while filming ''Kill Bill''. Yuen eulogized Carradine on the ''True Legend'' website, describing him as a "good friend." Yuen said of Carradine: {{quote|He is among the first Hollywood actors to perform Chinese martial arts on the big screen. In real life he is also a genuine kung fu fan, and knows tai chi, qi gong and Chinese medicine. Same as I, people shall always remember his role as Caine, ''the grasshopper'', in ''Kung Fu'', in the '70s, which was a really unforgettable performance. I feel both great honour and regret that ''True Legend'' is one of David Carradine's last works.&lt;ref name= Legend&gt;"[http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20100208-197290.html Legend in Martial Arts Tale]". ''New Straits Times'' (February 8, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Carradine's last leading roles was in the period drama ''Golden Boys'', set in 1905. It had only a limited theater run, and received little critical attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justpressplay.net/movie-reviews/929-dvd-reviews/5734-the-golden-boys.html The Golden Boys]. Justpressplay.net (August 18, 2009). Retrieved on 2013-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on DVD shortly after his death.

His final released movie was the cult Indy film, ''Night of the Templar'', directed by his friend Paul Sampson, in which Carradine wielded a sword (katana) for the final time on screen. Almost like a foreshadowing, there are several peculiar and eerie references in the film that are coincidental to  Carradine's untimely passing which include cross dressing and auto erotic asphyxiation. His last scene on screen ended in the following dialog: "Well, old friend, see you in the next lifetime" / "Yeah, Old Friends, Old Soul Mates" / "Yes, we are."

Carradine co-produced a full-length documentary about [[luthier]] [[Stuart Mossman]], which has been identified as the actor's last film appearance.&lt;ref name="Santa_B_Indi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/movies/777/ |title="The Legend of Stuart Mossman" |access-date=2010-06-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812112706/http://www.independent.com/movies/777/ |archivedate=August 12, 2010 |df=mdy }}.

Mossman had appeared with Carradine in ''Cloud Dancer'' (1980), which Brown also directed, and in ''The Long Riders''.&lt;ref name="Santa_B_Indi" /&gt;

On the small screen, Carradine appeared in a guest spot on the television series ''[[Mental (TV series)|Mental]]'' that was broadcast just days after his death. On October 3, 2009, ''[[Celebrity Ghost Stories]]'' premiered on the [[Biography Channel]] with an interview of Carradine discussing his belief that his closet was haunted by his wife's deceased previous husband. The segment, which was described as "eerie," was filmed four months before his own death.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Michael (September 22, 2009) "[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/item_9RRHKaf3vqK4XClnWkjnzK A Closet Case]", ''New York Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his last of many collaborations with producer Roger Corman, Carradine appeared in the ''Syfy Channel''{{'}}s science fiction monster movie ''Dinocroc Vs. Supergator'', over a year after he died. Ken Tucker, writing for [[Entertainment Weekly]], said the film was "impeccable" and "goofy fun all the way."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken (June 27, 2010) "[http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/06/27/dinocroc-vs-supergator-review-syfy/ Dinogator Vs.

==Directing career==
Carradine made his directorial debut on three episodes of ''Kung Fu''. While still performing on ''Kung Fu'', he tried his hand at directing some independent films of his own. [[Americana (1983 film)|''Americana'']] (1983), took ten years to complete due to difficulty in financing. It featured Carradine in the starring role and several of his friends and family members in supporting roles. The film won the People's Choice Award at the [[Director's Fortnight]] at [[Cannes]], but failed to achieve critical support or adequate distribution.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honeycutt, Kurt (June 5, 2009) [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5541C320090605 Carradine's "Americana" was one from the heart], ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt; Other directorial attempts included ''You and Me'' (1975),&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt; and two unreleased productions: ''Mata Hari'', an epic that starred his daughter, Calista; and a short musical called ''A Country Mile''.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;

==Martial artist==
Carradine knew nothing of the practice of [[kung fu]] at the time he was cast in the role of Kwai Chang Caine; instead, he relied on his experience as a dancer for the part.&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt; He also had experience in sword fighting, [[boxing]], and [[street fighting]] on which to draw.&lt;ref name=Axemaker /&gt; For the first half of the original series, David Chow provided technical assistance with kung fu. He never considered himself a master of the art, but rather an "[[Evangelism|evangelist]]" of kung fu.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spirit" /&gt; By 2003 he had acquired enough expertise in martial arts to produce and star in several instructional videos on [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] and [[Qigong]]. In 2005, Carradine visited the [[Shaolin Monastery]] in [[Henan, China]] as part of the extra features for the third season of the ''Kung Fu'' DVDs. During his visit, the abbot, [[Shi Yongxin|Shi Yǒngxìn]], said that he recognized Carradine's important contribution to the promotion of the Shaolin Monastery and kung fu culture, to which Carradine replied, "I am happy to serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|aEWjJ9nrUm8|"David Carradine's Shaolin Diaries: Back to the Beginning"}}, Season 3 DVD.

==Music career==
[[File:DavidCarradineSept06.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Carradine in 2006]]

In addition to his acting career,  Carradine was a musician. He sang and played the piano, the guitar and the flute among other instruments.&lt;ref name=beatcrave&gt;Hyatt, Jeff (June 4, 2009) [http://beatcrave.com/2009-06-04/david-carradine/David Carradine Leaves Behind a Musical Legacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303204030/http://beatcrave.com/2009-06-04/david-carradine/David/ |date=March 3, 2012 }}, ''Beat Crave''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Carradine played one half of a flower power beatnik duo in the season 4 ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' episode "The Quincunx," performing the songs "I Stepped on a Flower," "Lonesome Stranger," and "Sorrow of the Singing Tree." He recorded an album titled ''Grasshopper'', which was released in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/David-Carradine-Grasshopper/master/443344 Discogs.com master entry on "Grasshopper" album]. Discogs.com. Retrieved on May 31, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; His musical talents were often integrated into his screen performances. He performed several of [[Woody Guthrie]]'s songs for the movie ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]''. For the [[Kung Fu (TV series)|''Kung Fu'']] series he made flutes out of bamboo that he had planted on the Warner Brothers lot.

==Personal life==
[[File:David Carradine with family in 1987.jpg|thumb|Carradine and his daughter Kansas with wife Gail in 1987]]
Shortly after being drafted into the Army in 1960, Carradine proposed marriage to Donna Lee Becht (born September 26, 1937),&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who in America]] – 2009 | year = 2008 | edition = 63 | access-date = June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had met while they were students at Oakland High School. They were married on Christmas Day that year. She lived with him off-base in Virginia while he was stationed at Fort Eustis. In April 1962, she gave birth to their daughter Calista. After Carradine's discharge, the family lived in New York while Carradine established his acting career, appearing on Broadway in ''The Deputy''&lt;ref name=beatcrave /&gt; and ''Royal Hunt of the Sun''. The marriage dissolved in 1968, whereupon Carradine left New York and headed back to California to continue his television and film careers.

In 1969, Carradine met actress [[Barbara Hershey]] while the two of them were working on ''[[Heaven with a Gun]]''.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt; The pair lived together until 1975.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news| title = David Carradine, Actor, Is Dead at 72| first = Bruce| last = Weber| date = June 4, 2009| access-date = June 6, 2009| work = [[The New York Times]]| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/movies/05carradine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They appeared in other films together, including Martin Scorsese's ''Boxcar Bertha''. In 1972, they appeared together in a nude ''[[Playboy Magazine|Playboy]]'' spread, recreating some sex scenes from ''Boxcar Bertha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thal, Ron |date=August 1972|title=Boxcar Bertha|journal=Playboy Magazine|volume=19|issue=8|pages=82–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Hershey gave birth to their son, Free (who at age nine changed his name to Tom, much to his father's chagrin).&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt; The couple's relationship fell apart around the time of Carradine's 1974 burglary arrest,&lt;ref name=llty74&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aqVOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4voDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7065%2C5915369 |newspaper=Lakeland Ledger |location=(Florida)|title=David Carradine feels typecast as Guthrie |last=Lewis |first=Barbara |date=November 20, 1975 |page=14C}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Carradine began an affair with [[Season Hubley]], who had guest-starred on ''Kung Fu''. Carradine was engaged to Hubley for a time, but they never married.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX Bio" /&gt;

In February 1977, Carradine married, in a civil ceremony in [[Munich, Germany]], his second wife, Linda (née Linda Anne Gilbert), immediately following the filming of ''The Serpent's Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;"David Carradine Marries in Munich," ''St. Petersburg Times'' (February 5, 1977) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert was previously married to [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[The Byrds]].&lt;ref name="People" /&gt; Their daughter, Kansas, was born in 1978.

Carradine's second marriage ended in divorce, as did the two that followed. He was married to Gail Jensen from 1986 to 1997. She died in April 2010, at the age of 60, of an alcohol-related illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/05/exclusive-david-carradines-ex-wife-dies ''David Carradine's Ex-Wife Dies'']. Radar On-line, May 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Marina Anderson from 1998 to 2001. By this time, Carradine had proclaimed himself to be a "serial monogamist."&lt;ref&gt;Hay, Carla (April 17, 2009) "David Carradine and Bruce Dern reflect on their golden years." www.examiner.com/article/david-carradine-and-bruce-dern-reflect-on-their-golden-years&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 2004, Carradine married the widowed Annie Bierman&lt;ref name=who /&gt; (née Anne Kirstie Fraser, born December 21, 1960) at the seaside [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home of his friend [[Michael Madsen]]. [[Vicki Roberts]], his attorney and a longtime friend of his wife's, performed the ceremony. With this marriage he acquired three stepdaughters, Amanda Eckelberry (born 1989), Madeleine Rose (born 1995), and Olivia Juliette (born 1998) as well as a stepson, actor Max Richard Carradine (born 1998).&lt;ref name=NYTObit /&gt;

In one of his final interviews, Carradine stated that at 71, he was still "in excellent shape," attributing it to a good diet and having a youthful circle of friends. "Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than I am. My wife Annie is 24 years younger than I am. My daughter asks why I don't hang with women my age and I say, 'Most of the women my age are a lot older than me!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/kill-bill/news/carradine-finds-eternal-youth-with-younger-women_1077639|title=Carradine Finds Eternal Youth With Younger Women|date=August 17, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests and prosecutions===
By his own account, in the late 1950s, while living in San Francisco, Carradine was arrested for assaulting a police officer. He pled guilty to a lesser charge of disturbing the peace.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt; While in the Army, he faced court-martial, on more than one occasion, for shoplifting.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennetts, Leslie (September 4, 1975) "Children of the Stars: They do the Strangest Things," ''Miami News'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; After he became an established actor and had changed his name to David, he was arrested in 1967 for possession of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;Sease, Glean (August 29, 1967). "People." ''The Pittsburgh Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of his popularity in ''Kung Fu'', in 1974 Carradine was arrested again,&lt;ref&gt;"David Carradine Arrested" (September 19, 1974), ''The Victoria Advocate'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Richard (September 19, 1974) "David Carradine Charged With Attempted Burglary in Rampage," ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; this time for attempted burglary and malicious mischief. While under the influence of [[peyote]], Carradine began wandering nude around his [[Laurel Canyon]] neighborhood. He broke into a neighbor's home, smashing a window and cutting his arm. He then bled all over the homeowner's piano.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt; At some time during this incident he accosted two young women, allegedly assaulting one while asking if she was a witch.&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woman Sues"&gt;"Woman Sues, Says T.V.

In 1980, while in South Africa filming ''[[Safari 3000]]'' (also known as ''Rally''), which co-starred [[Stockard Channing]], Carradine was arrested for possession of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;"South Africans Arrest Carradine," ''Tuscaloosa News'' (September 21, 1980) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted and given a suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;"Carradine Guilty in Pot Case," ''Sarasota Times'' (November 13, 1980) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that he was framed, in this case, by the [[apartheid]] government, as he had been seen dancing with [[Tina Turner]].&lt;ref name="Endless Highway" /&gt;

During the 1980s, Carradine was arrested at least twice for driving under the influence of alcohol, once in 1984&lt;ref&gt;"David Carradine Arrested in L.A.," ''St. Petersburg Times'' ((May 19, 1984))&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1989.

Times'' (October 3, 1989) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Of this incident, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported: "legal experts say Carradine was handed a harsher-than-average sentence, even for a second-time offender: three years' summary probation, 48 hours in jail, 100 hours of community service, 30 days' work picking up trash for the California Department of Transportation, attendance at a drunk driving awareness meeting and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program."&lt;ref&gt;Finke, Nikki (October 5, 1989) ''Celebrity Justice When Laws Are Broken Fame Isn't The Shield It Used To Be'' L.A. Times, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, while in Toronto filming ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]'', Carradine was arrested for kicking in a door at [[SkyDome]] while attending a [[Rolling Stones]] concert. When asked his reasoning, Carradine claimed he was worried about getting swarmed by people who recognized him, and so entered the building as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941207&amp;slug=1945859|title=Living - Seen, Heard, Said - Seattle Times Newspaper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrongful death suit===
On the first anniversary of his death, Carradine's widow, Annie, announced that she had filed a lawsuit for wrongful death against the company that produced the film Carradine was working on at the time of his death. The lawsuit claimed that the company failed to provide assistance to the actor that had been agreed upon in his contract. "The suit alleges, the assistant left him behind for dinner on the night before the actor was found dead. The assistant and other film staffers apparently could not reach Carradine and decided to leave without him. Carradine called the assistant an hour later but was told the group was across town, and he would have to make his own arrangements that evening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-carradine-lawsuit,0,3371390.story |title="David Carradine's Widow Files Wrongful Death Suit" |access-date=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401165237/http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-carradine-lawsuit%2C0%2C3371390.story |archivedate=April 1, 2012 |df=mdy }}.

==Death==

Callahan was killed in a vehicle crash, along with the driver, Michael Hager, after the [[Vanagon]] in which they were riding crashed into a pair of trees on [[U.S. Route 58]] West around 1:30 PM on June 26, 1995.&lt;ref name=jason&gt;{{cite web|title=Jason ‘Grateful’ Doe|url=http://jasonbrumley.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/32/|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nameless&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=David|title=Grateful Dead Fan Remains Nameless, 18 Years After Fatal Crash|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/25/grateful-doe_n_5208512.html|accessdate=5 September 2014|agency=[[Huffington Post]]|date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncmec&gt;{{cite web|title=John Doe 1995|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1104361/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ginny&gt;{{cite web|title=Grateful Doe, Caledonia Jane: Ask the Question|url=http://gonemissinginny.com/2012/12/31/grateful-doe-caledonia-jane-ask-the-question/|website=gonemissinginny.com|accessdate=25 September 2014|date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither man was wearing a seat belt, which likely contributed to each of their deaths.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=listverse&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warder|first1=Robin|title=10 Mysterious Cases Involving Unidentified People|url=http://listverse.com/2013/06/14/10-mysterious-cases-involving-unidentified-people/|website=listverse.com|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found with Callahan's body were two [[Grateful Dead]] tickets from [[Washington, D.C.]], which had been [[ticket scalping|scalped]], a dollar in quarters, and a yellow [[BIC lighter]].

The young man, estimated to be between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one years old, had brown eyes with long curly brown or dark blond hair that had been dyed a reddish color.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Grateful Dead Fan – Jason Doe|url=http://uidmysteries.blogspot.com/2013/02/grateful-dead-fan-jason-doe.html|accessdate=5 September 2014|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[tattoo]] of a star on his upper-left arm and another possible tattoo, which was faded, on his right arm, both of which appeared to have been amateurishly executed. He was wearing a beaded necklace and his left ear had been [[ear piercing|pierced]] but he did not wear an earring.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 127UMVA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/127umva.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a scar found on his back.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; He was a Caucasian, had no apparent dental work as his third molars were visible. However, his teeth were fairly well cared for.&lt;ref name=jason/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;  At the time of the accident he was wearing a red, [[tie-dye]]d Grateful Dead T-shirt, [[Levi (company)|Levi's]] jeans, white [[socks]] and black [[Fila (company)|Fila]] [[running shoes]].&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=jason/&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Grateful Doe note.jpg|thumb|150px|Note written by "Caroline O." and "Caroline T."]]

The vehicle's driver was identified as Michael E. Hager, 21, who may have picked the John Doe up as a hitchhiker, and who authorities hypothesize may have fallen asleep at the wheel, as neither of the decedents had [[drugs]] or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettys|first1=Travis|title=South Carolina woman reports son missing 20 years after he left home to follow Grateful Dead|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/01/south-carolina-woman-reports-son-missing-20-years-after-he-left-home-to-follow-grateful-dead/|accessdate=17 January 2015|work=RawStory|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that Hager may have agreed to transport the John Doe because of their similar styles of dress, as they both appeared to be fans of The Grateful Dead.&lt;ref name=nameless/&gt; Authorities attempted to identify the John Doe through fingerprint analysis with the aid of national databases, but were unsuccessful.

When interviewed, Hager's family could not identify the unknown passenger, who had been reported to have been riding in Hager's [[Volkswagen Vanagon]] when he stopped to give his father a letter in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=listverse/&gt;&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; However, a detective from the area stated that this claim was not accurate, and that Hager was alone when he stopped to visit his father.&lt;ref name=nameless/&gt; It is speculated that the unidentified young man had actually been picked up between [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax]] and [[Gloucester, Virginia]].

Due to the severity of the lacerations on John Doe's face, mortuary photographs could not be released to the public, although a facial reconstruction was later released.&lt;ref name=nameless/&gt; In 2012, another facial reconstruction was created by the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]. The man who had originally bought the tickets found in John Doe's pocket did not remember the person he had sold them to.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; At least 221 missing people were ruled out as possible identities of the victim.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;

==2015 developments==

In 2015, photographs surfaced of a young man wearing similar clothing to that worn by the John Doe and who bore a strong resemblance to the reconstruction images. The person in these photographs was named Jason and was described to have been a fan of Grateful Dead. He had not been heard from since 1995 and was known to have lived in both Illinois and South Carolina. It had not yet been verified whether this was indeed the John Doe as his former roommates and other friends did not recall Jason's last name.&lt;ref name=griffin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Griffin|first1=Courtney|title='Grateful Doe' may have ties to Myrtle Beach|url=http://www.carolinalive.com/news/story.aspx?id=1147316#.VLCQgCvF_Tp|accessdate=10 January 2015|work=Carolina Live|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPDATE: Imgur, you may have helped identify 'The Grateful Doe'.|url=http://imgur.com/gallery/vfXjr|publisher=Imgur|accessdate=3 January 2015|date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[New York Post]]'' and [[BuzzFeed]] were some of the newspapers that covered the story.&lt;ref name=li/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interwebs Now May Be Close To Solving A 20-Year-Old Cold Case Need Public’s Help|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lrutley/interwebs-now-closer-to-solving-a-20-year-old-cold-x024|website=buzzfeed.com|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, law enforcement conducted a DNA test to see if the John Doe was the same man as Jason Patrick Callahan, the son of a 63-year-old woman who had not seen or heard from him since June 1995, when he left home to "follow the Grateful Dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Reports Deadhead Son Missing Since '95|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/grateful-doe-case-768391|accessdate=17 January 2015|date=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callahan, who was identified as the young man in the photographs, is described as having been a white male with wavy blonde hair and brown eyes, standing between {{convert|5|ft|10|in|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and {{convert|6|ft|m|2|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall, and weighing about {{convert|160|lb|kg|abbr=off|-1}}.

Lt. Joey Crosby, spokesman for Myrtle Beach police, stated that Callahan's mother failed to file a report with police due to the nomadic nature of Grateful Dead fans. "She attempted to report it when he went missing but didn’t know which jurisdiction to report it to," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhorrynews.com/news/crime/article_31d4be00-9c0e-11e4-8f85-fb52546762a0.html|title=Myrtle Beach police investigate possible link between missing man, "Grateful Doe"|work=MyHorryNews.com|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callahan's family also stated that they presumed he had gone to "live on his own, elsewhere."&lt;ref name=identified2/&gt;

'''Starr Faithfull''' (born '''Marian Starr Wyman''', January 27, 1906 — c. June 6, 1931) was an American socialite notable for her mysterious drowning death at age 25 in 1931. After her death, a scandal resulted when newspapers published allegations that she had been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] as a child by [[Andrew James Peters]], a wealthy, prominent politician and former [[Mayor of Boston]], and that he was suspected of murdering her. Investigators unsuccessfully attempted to determine whether her death was a homicide or a suicide. Her death remains unsolved.&lt;ref name=nehs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-starr-faithfull-reveals-a-boston-mayors-sordid-secret/ |title=The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull Reveals a Boston Mayor's Sordid Secret |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=newenglandhistoricalsociety.com |publisher=New England Historical Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611014059/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-starr-faithfull-reveals-a-boston-mayors-sordid-secret |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faithfull was found dead on the beach at [[Long Beach, New York]] on the morning of June 8, 1931.&lt;ref name=harrisburgtel460716&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Murder Mystery Investigator Dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43572435/ |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=Harrisburg Telegraph |location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania |page=13 |date=July 16, 1946 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy found that she died by drowning, but she also had many bruises apparently caused by beating or rough handling, and a large dose of a [[sedative]] in her system. Investigators initially thought her death was a [[homicide]], and that she had either been pushed into deep water or forcibly held under shallow water.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; Her stepfather accused Peters of having her killed to prevent her from revealing the sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; However, the homicide theory was called into question by letters that Faithfull had written shortly before her death, expressing her intentions to commit [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; A [[grand jury]] convened to hear evidence returned an [[open verdict]], and the case was closed with no definitive conclusion as to whether her death was homicide, suicide, or an accident.&lt;ref name=harrisburgtel460716 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilner&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilner |first=Paul |title=Sandra Scoppettone Relates How She Came to Write Her Book About the Rise and Tragic Fall of a Flapper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=BK75 |date=October 2, 1977 &lt;!--|accessdate=February 22, 2016--&gt; |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faithfull's death made national and international news due to its many sensational aspects, including her youth, beauty, [[promiscuity]], and [[flapper]] lifestyle, as well as the allegations about Peters. The evidence included her diary containing explicit descriptions of her sexual liaisons with 19 different men, including one she called "AJP" who was thought to be Peters.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the story a "sexy death mystery" with a "perfect front-page name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 29, 1931 |title=The Press: Five Starr Faithfull |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741914,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |subscription=yes |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her story has inspired several fictional works, the best known of which is [[John O'Hara]]'s 1935 novel ''BUtterfield 8''.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilner /&gt;&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=John |authorlink=John O'Hara |date=1935 |title=BUtterfield 8 |location=New York City |publisher= Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. |isbn=978-0091651701}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has also been discussed in a number of non-fiction books, including British crime historian Jonathan Goodman's 1990 [[true crime]] book ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'',&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Jonathan |date=1990 |edition=1996 reprint |title=The Passing of Starr Faithfull |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=London/ Kent, Ohio |publisher=Judy Piatkus Publishers/ [[Kent State University Press]] |page= |isbn=978-0873385411}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won a [[CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction|Gold Dagger award]].

==Background==
Starr Faithfull was descended from an impoverished branch of an [[old money]] [[Massachusetts]] family. Her wealthy relatives, including former Mayor of Boston Andrew J. Peters, provided financial assistance and frequent social invitations to her mother, her sister and herself. At age 20, Faithfull told her mother that Peters had been sexually abusing her for years, starting when she was only 11 years old. Her mother and stepfather, who had very little money, used the situation to force Peters to pay them large sums of money, part of which was used to send Faithfull on repeated cruises to [[Great Britain]] and other destinations. In her twenties, she adopted a party lifestyle including [[substance abuse]] and ill-fated affairs with men, who were often ship's officers she met during her cruise travels or at shipboard parties.

===Family===
Starr Faithfull was born Marian Starr Wyman (nicknamed "Bamby") on January 27, 1906 in [[Evanston, Illinois]] to Frank Wyman II, an investment banker, and his wife Helen MacGregor Pierce of [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. In 1907, the Wymans moved to [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. A second child, Elizabeth Tucker "Sylvia" Wyman, was born in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 18-21].&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen Wyman came from a wealthy, socially established family, although her father lost his fortune before she was married, leaving her relatively poor.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 18].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Rick |date=June 23, 2010 |title=Column: Remembering the Tragic Life of Starr Faithfull: Tales of Old Derry |url=http://www.derrynews.com/opinion/column-remembering-the-tragic-life-of-starr-faithfull/article_872cb81b-1a9c-5f49-b0a6-e02d16476d8d.html |newspaper=Derry News |location=Derry, New Hampshire |accessdate=February 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fcRXYZqf?url=http://www.derrynews.com/opinion/column-remembering-the-tragic-life-of-starr-faithfull/article_872cb81b-1a9c-5f49-b0a6-e02d16476d8d.html |archivedate=February 27, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen's cousin Martha had married Andrew J.

Roosevelt]], who was governor of New York at the time of Starr Faithfull's 1931 death and later became president.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen Wyman and her daughters frequently visited Helen's wealthy Massachusetts relatives, including Martha and Andrew Peters. The Peterses were among the relatives who helped support the Wymans by giving Helen gifts of money and paying for her daughters' private school educations.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 21-23].&lt;/ref&gt; Starr Wyman spent summers with the Peterses and their children at their family home. Andrew Peters often took the young girl on trips alone with him, during which the two stayed in hotels.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt;

Frank and Helen Wyman divorced in 1924, and the following year Helen married Stanley Faithfull, with her daughters also taking his name. Stanley Faithfull, a widower who was previously married to the [[governess]] of [[Leverett Saltonstall]],&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; was a self-employed inventor and entrepreneur who failed at numerous business ventures and earned little or no money.&lt;ref name=goodman2335&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 23-35].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wynn19941211&gt;{{cite news |last=Wynn |first=Judith |date=December 11, 1994 |title=Starr Gazing With Gloria Vanderbilt |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-12-11/entertainment/9412110026_1_andrew-j-peters-starr-faithfull-boston-mayor|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a history of bringing lawsuits for money. The Faithfulls initially settled in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], but lost their heavily mortgaged house to [[foreclosure]] and moved to an apartment at 12 St. Luke's Place, [[Greenwich Village]], where they were still living at the time of Starr Faithfull's death in 1931.

===Alleged abuse by Peters===

[[File:Andrew James Peters 42nd Mayor of Boston.png|thumb|Andrew J. Peters at the time he was Mayor of Boston in 1918.]]

During Starr Faithfull's teenage years, she began to show signs of emotional disturbance. She eventually received psychiatric treatment, including a short voluntary stay in the Channing Sanitarium, a mental hospital in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=In Sanitarium 9 Days. |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/105096438/ |newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |date=June 13, 1931 |page=2 |accessdate=February 23, 2016 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1926, she told her mother that Peters had been sexually abusing her for years, beginning when she was 11. She said that Peters read her sex instructions written by [[Havelock Ellis]] and drugged her with [[ether]] before sexually abusing her.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt;

===Lifestyle===

Investigators learned after Starr Faithfull's death that her mother and stepfather, acting on doctors' advice, had paid artist Edwin Megargee to be her "sex tutor" and teach her how to have normal sexual relations after her traumatic experiences with Peters.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. 128-129, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 146].&lt;/ref&gt; Money received from Peters was also used to send her away on cruises to the Mediterranean, the [[West Indies]] and five or six times to Great Britain, where she stayed for extended periods in London.&lt;ref name=wilkins&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilkins |first=H.

On May 29, 1931, a few days before her death, she attended a party on the [[Cunard]] liner ''[[RMS Franconia (1922)|Franconia]]'' to see the ship's doctor, Dr. George Jameson-Carr. She had been infatuated with Carr for some time and considered him the love of her life, although he did not return her affections.&lt;ref name=fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt; After Carr made her leave his sitting room because the ship was departing, she remained on deck when the ship left the dock, despite having no ticket (which at that point she could not afford).

==Death==
In the days leading up to Starr Faithfull's disappearance and death, she kept a busy social schedule and was seen by numerous witnesses, including her friends and family as well as [[taxicab]] drivers and other strangers. Her family last saw her on the morning of Friday, June 5, 1931, leaving the house in the same dress she was wearing when found. Investigators discovered that after she left the house that day, she made multiple trips to ocean liners docked in Manhattan, where she visited ship's officers. After spending the evening with one of them, she got into a taxicab late on Friday night and seemingly vanished, only to be found dead on a [[Long Island]] beach the following Monday morning, June 8, 1931. 
 
===Events before discovery of body===

====Thursday, June 4, 1931====
After Starr Faithfull's death, a taxicab driver and other witnesses reported that on the afternoon of Thursday, June 4, 1931, an intoxicated woman that they later recognized as Faithfull was helped into a cab in front of the [[Chanin Building]] on 42nd Street in Manhattan. The taxi driver testified that she stopped to buy additional liquor during her ride and that he drove her to [[Flushing, Queens]] in search of a certain house, but she could not locate it, and exited his cab at a drugstore located at 33rd Avenue and 163rd Street.&lt;ref name=ms19310613 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Beauty's Murder Trails Baffle Police: Jurors Question Family, Artists, Prominent Men |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/105096433 |newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |pages=1, 2 |date=June 13, 1931 |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evening of June 4, she told her mother and sister that she attended a party given by publisher [[Bennett Cerf]] for actress [[Miriam Hopkins]] (whom she confused with actress [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]])&lt;ref name=cj19310618&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title='Bruce' Tells of Last Meeting With Starr |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/107888250/ |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |location=Louisville, Kentucky |date=June 18, 1931 |pages=1–2|agency=[[United Press International|United Press]] |accessdate=February 24, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cerf's office at 20 E. 57th Street in Manhattan. According to her mother, she mentioned seeing two friends of hers, actors named "Bruce Winston" and "Jack Greenaway" at the party, and said she would be meeting up with them the next night as well.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310616 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chitrib19310617&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Last Party of Starr's Career Coming to Light: Two Actors Sought as Participants |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1931/06/17/page/15/article/last-party-of-starrs-career-coming-to-light |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=15 |date=June 17, 1931 |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another friend of Starr Faithfull, Dr. Charles Young Roberts, later said that she had actually spent the evening of June 4 with him at [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|The Roosevelt Hotel]], visiting a speakeasy and going for a taxi ride.&lt;ref name=goodman241248&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 241-248].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Friday, June 5, 1931====
Starr Faithfull's family reported seeing her for the last time leaving the family apartment on St. Luke's Place at 9:30 am on the morning of Friday, June 5, 1931, wearing an expensive silk dress, hat, gloves, shoes and stockings, and carrying a purse and coat. She had three dollars and was planning to have her hair [[marcelling|waved]]. According to her family, she never came home.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 16-17], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 161-162].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chelsea Piers, NYC, 1921 or earlier (Postcard).jpg|thumb|left| The Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, circa 1921. The Cunard ocean liners and other passenger liners docked at these terminals.]]

A [[newsagent's shop|newsstand]] vendor located near the 9th Street subway station in Greenwich Village, of whom Faithfull was a regular customer, said that he sold her a newspaper at 11:30 am.&lt;ref name=pettey /&gt; At 1 pm, taxicab driver Murray Edelman said that Faithfull, whom he recognized from the ''Franconia'' incident several days earlier, had gotten into his cab near the [[Chelsea Piers]] (from which the Cunard ships and other passenger liners departed) with a man in a Cunard uniform, whom she called "Brucie". She told the man she would see him on the wharf at 4 pm, but the man told her not to come back. Edelman said he drove her to her home at 12 St. Luke's Place, although he did not see her enter the house (and her family said she had not returned home), and then took the man back to the piers. Around 2 pm, Faithfull, having apparently returned to the Chelsea Piers and now appearing intoxicated, again was put into Edelman's waiting cab by the same man, who told Edelman to take her back to St. Luke's Place and not let her return to the piers again. However, she got out after a few blocks because she had only 10 cents, which was not sufficient for the fare. She had then walked back in the direction of the piers.&lt;ref name=nyt19310618 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 163-165].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[beauty salon|beauty shop]] employee in [[Grand Central Terminal]] said that a "Miss Faithfull" had visited the shop on June 5 between 2:30 and 3 pm and spoken to her about an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 162-163].&lt;/ref&gt; A female acquaintance of Faithfull also reported seeing her at Grand Central around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Friend Saw Starr Faithfull Same Day She Disappeared |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/98036170/ |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=June 19, 1931 |page=2 |accessdate=March 7, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she was seen on board the Cunard liner ''[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|Mauretania]]'', but was also seen leaving the ship before its 5 pm departure for [[the Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=nash80&gt;Nash, p.

Carr and Roberts later said that, after visiting the ''Mauretania'', she had visited another Cunard liner in port, the ''[[RMS Carmania (1905)|Carmania]]'', to which Roberts was then assigned. Roberts confirmed that on June 5 he entertained Starr Faithfull aboard the ''Carmania'' from about 5:30 pm until after 10 pm, including having a light meal at 8:30 pm. She had said she wanted to travel to [[Calcutta]] and Paris, where she said she had a woman friend who had [[will and testament|willed her some money]]. Roberts said that shortly after 10 pm, he gave her a dollar for cab fare and put her into a cab near Pier 56, supposedly to drive her to another ocean liner, the ''[[SS Île de France|Île de France]]'', on which she planned to attend a party.&lt;ref name=goodman241248 /&gt; A police officer who recognized Faithfull from the ''Franconia'' incident saw her getting into the cab.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 251].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saturday, June 6 and Sunday, June 7, 1931====

Police informants later told investigators that on Saturday, June 6, a woman fitting Starr Faithfull's description had been seen with a male companion at Tappe's Hotel in [[Island Park, New York|Island Park]] near Long Beach, and may have had an argument with her companion or have left with a group of other men. The hotel was a favorite rendezvous for New York City mobsters and [[rum-running|bootleggers]] including [[Bill Dwyer (mobster)|Bill Dwyer]], [[Vannie Higgins]], and [[Dutch Schultz]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 230-239].&lt;/ref&gt;

After Starr Faithfull's family had failed to locate her by the evening of Saturday, June 6, her stepfather reported her missing to the [[NYPD]] Missing Persons Bureau. Stanley and Helen Faithfull also sent a letter to Peters on June 7 informing him that Starr Faithfull was missing and seeking money.

===Discovery of body on Monday, June 8, 1931===

On the morning of Monday, June 8, 1931, around 6:30 am, Starr Faithfull's dead body was found by a [[beachcombing|beachcomber]] at [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], [[Nassau County, New York]], on the beach near Minnesota Avenue.&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilkins /&gt; When found, she was wearing only her dress, silk stockings, and a suspender [[girdle]] that held up the stockings, with no other underwear, and the rest of her outer clothing and accessories missing. Neither her dress nor her manicured nails were damaged, although her body showed a large number of bruises that the medical examiner said had been inflicted before death, apparently by another person.&lt;ref name=fulton /&gt; Her body was identified by her stepfather, Stanley Faithfull, on the evening of June 8.

An autopsy determined that she had died of drowning and that her body had been in the water for at least 48 hours, thus suggesting that she died on the night of Friday, June 5 or the early morning of Saturday, June 6.&lt;ref name=wilkins /&gt; The time spent in the water and her estimated time of death would later be questioned by another expert who had been handling drowning cases in the Long Beach area for many years and believed that Faithfull had been in the water for less than 10 hours, meaning that she had died late on Sunday, June 7 or in the early morning of June 8, and probably drowned close to the beach where she was found.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA262#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 262-264].&lt;/ref&gt; Her lungs contained a large quantity of sand,&lt;ref name=wilkins /&gt; which was later interpreted as indicating that she drowned in shallow water near shore, rather than further out to sea. The autopsy further found that she had eaten a large meal of meat, potatoes, mushrooms and fruit three to four hours before her death, but had not drunk alcohol for 36 hours before her death. Her liver contained a high level of a drug initially identified as the [[barbiturate]] [[barbital|Veronal]]&lt;ref name=cj19310618 /&gt; — a sedative that she frequently purchased and used — indicating that before her death she had taken a dose large enough to cause [[stupor]] or semi-stupor, but not large enough to kill her.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310616 /&gt; A later letter from the toxicologist and other evidence suggested that she might have actually taken a similar but stronger drug such as [[phenobarbital|Luminal]] or [[aprobarbital|Allonal]], which would have increased her stupor. The medical report initially said that she had been raped; a second report ruled out rape, but said she had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.

==Investigation==
Starr Faithfull's death was initially investigated as a homicide, until new evidence came to light suggesting that her death was a suicide or accident caused by her jumping or falling overboard from a ship. The Faithfulls insisted her death was a homicide and accused Peters of having her murdered, finally going so far as to publicly identify him by name to the media. In so doing, the Faithfulls came under suspicion themselves for not cooperating fully with investigators and for having a monetary motive to accuse Peters, whose money they had been living on for years. The case was finally closed with no conclusion being reached as to whether Starr Faithfull's death was a homicide, suicide or accident. Several true crime writers have offered their own alternative theories about her death. 

===Homicide investigation===

The investigation into Starr Faithfull's death was led by [[Nassau County Police Department|Nassau County Police]] Inspector Harold King, Nassau County [[District Attorney]] (DA) Elvin Edwards, and Assistant DA Martin Littleton Jr. After identifying his stepdaughter's body, Stanley Faithfull told King and Littleton that he believed Andrew J. Peters had ordered her murder in order to prevent her from revealing her past sexual abuse by Peters. Faithfull also told the press that he believed his stepdaughter had been murdered, but initially did not give them Peters' name, although he did eventually tell them she had been "corrupted" as a child by an unnamed older, wealthy male friend of the family who had later paid a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Harrowing Experience of Beautiful Starr Faithfull in Girlhood is Revealed |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/12802649 |newspaper=[[Corsicana Daily Sun]] |location=Corsicana, Texas |date=June 16, 1931 |pages=1, 11 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; London artist Rudolph Haybrook, a close friend of Starr Faithfull, also was quoted in the press as saying she was murdered to prevent her from testifying in an upcoming $25,000 lawsuit.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310612 /&gt;

Although Inspector King thought the death was probably a suicide even after hearing Stanley Faithfull's story, DA Edwards was convinced that it was murder.&lt;ref name=nigol&gt;{{cite book |last=Nigol |first=Paul |editor-last=Knafla |editor-first=Louis A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bzFiu859lAC&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Crime, Gender, and Sexuality in Criminal Prosecutions |series=Criminal Justice History |volume=17 |date=2002 |pages=197–198 |chapter=Book Review: Jonathan Goodman, ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' |isbn=978-0313310133}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Edwards' direction, the investigators began to examine the death as a homicide, with Edwards traveling to Boston and announcing that he expected to indict two unnamed men in her death, one of whom he said "played an important role in New York political circles". At that time, Peters was helping to organize the first [[United States presidential election, 1932|Presidential election campaign]] for his friend, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. Starr Faithfull's body was due to be cremated on June 11, but Edwards dramatically ordered the cremation stopped at the last minute so he could convene a grand jury to look into her death.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310612 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;&lt;ref name=pettey /&gt;

A police search of the Faithfulls' apartment found Starr Faithfull's diary,&lt;ref name=telegraph19310612 /&gt; despite Stanley Faithfull's claims that no diary existed and/or that it had been destroyed. Her diary, which she called her "Memory Book"&lt;ref name=nyt19310618 /&gt; or "Mem Book",&lt;ref name=wynn19941211 /&gt; contained explicit details of her affairs with 19 men identified by initials.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; Although much of the diary was considered too risque to print,&lt;ref name=rasmussen&gt;{{cite news |last=Rasmussen |first=Frederick N. |date=June 29, 2002 |title=Young Woman's Death Sparked Controversy: Way Back When |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-06-29/features/0206290029_1_faithfull-body-nassau |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |accessdate=February 27, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227054241/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-06-29/features/0206290029_1_faithfull-body-nassau |deadurl=no |archivedate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of its material was featured in newspapers.&lt;ref name=nyt19310618 /&gt; The initials "AJP" in some diary entries were thought to refer to Peters.&lt;ref name=nehs /&gt; When newspapers began to connect Peters to the case, he issued a statement via his lawyer denying that he had ever had "improper relations" with Starr Faithfull, and further stating that he had no evidence relating to her death and had not seen any member of the Faithfull family for five years.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310616 /&gt; He was later formally questioned by investigators in the fall of 1931, but continued to deny any involvement.&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;

[[File:1931 advertisement for reward from Nassau County (New York) Police Department.jpg|thumb|right|Nassau County Police reward poster seeking information about Starr Faithfull's whereabouts after she left the ''Carmania'' on the night of June 5, 1931.]]

Initially, investigators thought Starr Faithfull had either been pushed from the ''Mauretania'' or abducted from that ship into a boat, from which she was then pushed into the water. Later, the large amount of sand found in her lungs coupled with the bruises to her upper body caused them to believe that she had been drowned in the sandy water close to shore by being forcibly held under water,&lt;ref name=telegraph19310612 /&gt; perhaps near the spot where she was found, rather than having been pushed from a ship several miles offshore and having her body wash up on shore.&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt; They gathered information from the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] about the tides and currents near Long Beach in an effort to determine how Faithfull's body might have arrived on the beach, but results of this query were never published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=William Glynne |date=February 24, 1961 |title=The World's Strangest Stories: Mysterious Death of Miss Starr Faithfull |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19610224&amp;id=S5sUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4agDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7006,3933657&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |accessdate=March 11, 2016 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The man named "Brucie" mentioned by the cab driver was first thought to be the actor "Bruce Winston" that Starr Faithfull had said she met at Cerf's party. Attempts to locate the "Bruce Winston" and "Jack Greenaway" supposedly mentioned by Faithfull proved fruitless; an elderly British actor named Bruce Winston was found, but he had not been in the United States since February and had spent the past several weeks appearing in a play in London.&lt;ref name=nyt19310618 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chitrib19310617 /&gt; Investigators then sought a Chicago gangster named Ernest Blue, alias Richard Bruce.&lt;ref name=ms19310617 /&gt; An acquaintance of Starr Faithfull named David "Bruce" Blue was finally located in London, who said he had been with her on the ''Mauretania'' on June 5.&lt;ref name=cj19310618 /&gt;

Efforts were made to locate the taxicab driver who picked up Starr Faithfull near Pier 56 after 10 pm on June 5. Despite substantial reward money being offered for information about Faithfull's route and destination that night, no cab driver ever came forward, causing speculation about whether Faithfull was actually abducted by a cab driver, or by someone else posing as a cab driver, possibly under the control of mobsters.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 286-287].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Edwards and Littleton continued to investigate the death as a possible homicide until December 1931, including questioning Peters, they were unable to gather sufficient evidence to obtain indictments or otherwise prove the homicide theory.

===Suicide and accident investigation===

While investigators were pursuing the homicide theory, Dr. Carr, having arrived in London on the ''Franconia'', received three letters that Starr Faithfull had written him on May 30, June 2, and June 4, 1931. Carr personally hand-carried the letters back to the United States and provided them to the investigators around June 23, also being interviewed by police at that time.&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;&lt;ref name=nash /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the full text of the letters on June 22 and June 24.&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt19310622 /&gt;

In the first letter, dated May 30, Faithfull wrote, {{Quote|text=I am going (definitely now — I've been thinking of it for a long time) to end my worthless, disorderly bore of an existence — before I ruin any one else's life as well. I certainly have made a sordid, futureless mess of it all...I hate everything so — life is horrible. ...I am mad and insane over you. ...I have, strangely enough, more of a feeling of peace or whatever you call it now that I know it will soon be over. The half hour before I die will, I imagine, be quite blissful.}}&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt; However, the letter ended by asking if Carr would come and see her when he was next in New York,&lt;ref name=nyt19310622 /&gt; causing some to question Faithfull's true intentions.&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 269].&lt;/ref&gt; The second letter apologized for the May 29 incident aboard the ''Franconia'' in New York.&lt;ref name=nyt19310622 /&gt;

In the third letter, written the day before she disappeared, Faithfull expressed in detail her intent and plans to commit suicide because she could not cope with her unrequited love for Carr. The letter began, {{Quote|text=It's all up with me now. This is something I am going to put through. The only thing that bothers me about it—the only thing I dread—is being outwitted and prevented from doing this, which is the only possible thing for me to do. If one wants to get away with murder one has to jolly well keep one's wits about one. It's the same way with suicide. If I don’t watch out I will wake up in a psychopathic ward, but I intend to watch out and accomplish my end this time.}}&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt; The letter went on to talk about how she would carry out her suicide, with "[n]o ether, no allonal, or window jumping", and how she would spend her last hours, including having "one delicious meal", hearing some "good music", drinking "slowly, keeping aware every second", enjoying a "last cigarette", and "encourag[ing]" men who flirted with her on the street — "I don't care who they are".&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt; She wrote, "It's a great life when one has twenty-four hours to live."&lt;ref name=fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some later sources looking back on the case, such as William Fulton's article of May 8, 1938 in the ''Chicago Tribune'' (cited above), have attributed statements that ''The New York Times'' originally printed as being in the first letter to the third letter, or vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt; (An earlier [[Associated Press]] story that ran before Carr delivered the letters said that one letter contained the statement, "When you receive this I will be dead";&lt;ref name=nyt19310618 /&gt; according to a later ''[[New York Daily News]]'' account, the statement was, "When you receive this letter, I will have committed suicide by drowning."&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt; However, this statement is not contained in any of the letters published in ''The New York Times'' in June 1931.&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt19310622 /&gt;)

The letters raised the possibility that Faithfull had committed suicide by stowing away aboard one of the ships in port in New York on June 5 until the ship was underway, and then, after taking a large dose of sedative, jumping overboard as the ship passed south of Long Beach late on June 5 or early on June 6, with her body eventually washing up on shore. Alternatively, it was thought that she might have stowed away and then accidentally fallen overboard while under the influence of the sedative.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 253]-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Following disclosure of the letters, many people, including Police Inspector King (who had taken the position early in the investigation that the death was likely suicide or an accident) thought that Starr Faithfull had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 58], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 221], 268.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' printed that the letters "seemed to remove all doubt that the girl...ended her own life."&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;

Stanley Faithfull continued to insist that his stepdaughter had been murdered, contending that the letters were forgeries and presenting his own handwriting expert to the grand jury in an attempt to disprove the Nassau County expert's findings that the letters were genuine.&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hen19310624&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 24, 1931 |title=Expert States Starr Faithfull Letters Forged |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/58026054/ |newspaper=[[The Patriot-News|The Evening News]] |location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania |pages=1, 11 |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |agency=[[International News Service]] |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stlpd19310626&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 26, 1931 |title=Starr Faithfull Notes Genuine, Experts Say |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/139390306/|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |page=3 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards and Littleton also still believed that Starr Faithfull had been murdered, and continued their investigation for several more months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 20, 1931 |title=Starr Faithfull Death Probe Taken Up Again |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/105159652/ |newspaper=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |page=11 |accessdate=February 26, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes |quote='The case has never been closed,' Edwards said today, 'and I still believe Starr Faithfull was murdered.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards thought that she would not have been capable of suicide while under the influence of so much Veronal.&lt;ref name=fulton /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt19310624 /&gt;

[[File:RMS Carmania.jpg|thumb|left|RMS ''Carmania'', the Cunard liner on which Starr Faithfull spent the evening of June 5, 1931, with Dr. Charles Young Roberts.]]

Littleton eventually came to believe the suicide theory after interviewing Dr. Roberts in December 1931, near the end of the investigation. Based on Roberts' information about spending the evening with Starr Faithfull on the ''Carmania'' and then putting her into a cab to go to a party on the ''Île de France'', Littleton concluded that she probably stowed away on the ''Île de France'' and then jumped overboard after it sailed.&lt;ref name=goodman241248 /&gt; Littleton did issue a denial in ''The New York Times'' of an [[International News Service]] story claiming that he had located a witness who actually saw Starr Faithfull jump from a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 10, 1931 |title=Starr Faithfull Mystery Solved; Ended Own Life |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/49789795/ |newspaper=The Kane Republican |location=Kane, Pennsylvania |page=1 |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |agency=[[International News Service]]|via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Faithfull Death Solution Denied |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=19 |date=December 11, 1931 &lt;!--|accessdate=February 22, 2016--&gt; |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the suicide explanation has been questioned by later crime analysts. American true crime author [[Jay Robert Nash]] stated in his 1983 book ''Open Files: A Narrative Encyclopedia of the World's Greatest Unsolved Crimes'' that there was no evidence of Starr Faithfull ever having been aboard the ''Île de France'', and little evidence that she had actually committed suicide, compared to more evidence that her death had been homicide.&lt;ref name=nash80 /&gt; Goodman in his 1990 book ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' stated that she could not have gone aboard the ''Île de France'' because it actually sailed at 10 pm while she was still visiting Dr. Roberts, and that it was docked close to the ''Carmania'' so she would not have taken a cab. Goodman also concluded that she did not go overboard from any of the other ships leaving on June 5 or June 6 because, among other things, she would not have had time or inclination to consume her last large meal of meat, vegetables and fruit so soon after eating a light meal of different food with Roberts; her conversation with Roberts indicated that she did not have any barbiturates or any money to obtain them on June 5; she had been seen intoxicated on both June 4 and June 5, contrary to the autopsy which found she had consumed no alcohol for 36 hours before death, suggesting that she did not die until June 7 or early on June 8; and her silk dress and silk stockings were not damaged as would be expected from spending 48 hours in the water, during a time when a storm was affecting the area.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 251-270].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Faithfulls' reaction to the investigation===
During the course of the investigation, Edwards and Littleton became suspicious of Stanley, Helen and Tucker Faithfull, and thought they were withholding information, being less than cooperative, and may even have been involved in Starr Faithfull's murder.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310612 /&gt; Newspapers also reported on the family's apparent need for money and lack of visible means of support.&lt;ref name=pettey /&gt;

After the evidence of Starr Faithfull's possible suicide came to light in late June 1931, the grand jury proceedings were closed, with no indictments issued, and the case began to fade from the headlines. Stanley Faithfull, anxious to keep the press interested in the story, continued to state that his stepdaughter was murdered by hired killers acting on behalf of a high-profile person.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 221-224].&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1931, he alleged "shameful official negligence" on the part of the Nassau County investigators and further alleged that DA Edwards had been intimidated by persons "too big and influential for him to tackle".&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt; Edwards strongly denied that he had been intimidated, and said that he believed Starr Faithfull had been murdered, but did not have the evidence to prove it. He further said, "Neither Peters nor anybody else is so highly placed that I won't proceed against them."&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;
[[File:12 St. Luke's Place, Greenwich Village, NYC, USA, March 2016.jpg|upright| thumb|12 St. Luke's Place in Greenwich Village, New York City, in 2016. The Faithfulls lived in an apartment here at the time of Starr Faithfull's death.]]

On July 25, Stanley Faithfull for the first time publicly named Andrew J. Peters as the man alleged to have had an improper relationship with the 11-year-old Starr Faithfull, and also disclosed the original 1927 settlement agreement between the Faithfulls and Peters releasing Peters from liability for Starr's abuse, and Peters' settlement check for $20,000. As a result of being publicly connected with the case, Peters suffered several [[mental breakdown|nervous breakdowns]].&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 225].&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July and early August, the grand jury probe was reopened to consider evidence provided by Stanley Faithfull that the suicide letters to Carr were forgeries not written by Starr Faithfull.&lt;ref name=hen19310624 /&gt;&lt;ref name=stlpd19310626 /&gt; In early August, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt also reviewed the case to determine whether the death had been properly investigated by the Nassau County authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Roosevelt to Scan the Faithfull Case |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=30 |date=August 1, 1931 &lt;!--|accessdate=February 22, 2016--&gt; |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', which had been conducting its own investigation, then confirmed that the Faithfulls were in debt and in dire need of money, and that Stanley Faithfull had traveled to Boston shortly before Starr Faithfull's disappearance to seek additional payoffs from Peters. Stanley Faithfull responded by suing the ''Daily News'' publisher, the reporter who wrote the stories, and several other papers for [[libel]], but his claims were ultimately dismissed.&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;

===Conclusion of the investigation===

By October 1931, the Starr Faithfull case was reported to be "virtually closed", although Roberts' statements about being with her on the ''Carmania'' were not obtained until the planned last days of the investigation in early December. Later in December, a final inquest was held into her death. It lasted only 15 minutes, and reached no conclusion. Nassau County [[Coroner]] Edward Neu was quoted as saying, "Whatever I decide, it will only be a matter of opinion."&lt;ref name=kennedy /&gt;

===Alternative theories===

Goodman theorized that Faithfull was killed by [[Long Island]] mobster [[Vannie Higgins]] and his associates. According to Goodman's research, Higgins had learned that the Faithfulls were extorting money from Peters due to his past improper sexual relationship with Starr Faithfull. Based on this information, Goodman suggested that Higgins, wishing to [[blackmail]] Peters or extort more money from him, had Faithfull kidnapped and driven to Island Park, where he provided her with a meal and barbiturates and questioned her in an effort to get more information that he could use against Peters. Unsatisfied with her answers, he beat her, causing the many bruises on her body. When she appeared to have died from the beating, he ordered her body dumped into the ocean near Long Beach. However, she was still alive when she entered the water, and died by drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 283-290].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash and reporter Morris Markey, who covered the case in 1931 for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, both theorized that based on the evidence and Faithfull's past behavior, including the hotel incident that resulted in her being taken to Bellevue Hospital, she had likely been killed on the beach at Long Beach by an unknown man after a sexual encounter had gone wrong. According to this theory, Faithfull went to the beach with a man she had picked up, ostensibly to have sexual relations. Once there, she removed most of her clothing, but then teased or refused sex until the man became enraged, beat her, and drowned her in the shallow water and sand near the shoreline, possibly after sexually assaulting her.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;&lt;ref name=markey&gt;{{cite book |last=Markey |first=Morris |editor-last=Leighton |editor-first=Isabel |title=The Aspirin Age: 1919–1941|url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=LXP66YAL&amp;tocp=41 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227052132/http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=LXP66YAL&amp;tocp=41 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-02-27 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York City |date=1949 |chapter=1931: The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull |isbn=9780848816612 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodman also wrote that this theory was supported by some facts.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 270-271].&lt;/ref&gt;

Peters was never prosecuted for any crime in connection with Starr Faithfull's death.&lt;ref name=russellp227&gt;Russell, ''A City in Terror'', p.

Starr Faithfull's 19-year-old sister Tucker (aka Sylvia) Faithfull was quoted after Starr's death as saying, "I'm not sorry Starr's dead. She's happier. Everyone is happier."&lt;ref name=telegraph19310616 /&gt; According to Tucker Faithfull, her sister had dominated the family, even to the point of deciding where they would live, and physically slapped and pinched other family members if she did not get her own way.&lt;ref name=telegraph19310616 /&gt; Tucker Faithfull later changed her name back to Wyman before marrying.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, pp. 292-[https://books.google.com/books?id=zq6N6gbd6EEC&amp;pg=PA293#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 293].&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] reported Stanley Faithfull's death in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilgallen |first=Dorothy |authorlink=Dorothy Kilgallen |date=October 24, 1949 |title=Voice of Broadway: Gossip in Gotham |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/53741011/ |newspaper=The News-Herald |location=Franklin, Pennsylvania |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |quote=The death of Starr Faithfull's father passed unnoticed by the press last week.

A 1946 Associated Press story on the death of former District Attorney Edwards discussed the Starr Faithfull case as one of two high-profile unsolved cases handled by Edwards.&lt;ref name=harrisburgtel460716 /&gt; Edwards' records on the case were later said to have vanished.&lt;ref name=rasmussen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wick |first=Steve |date=April 28, 1998 |title=Long Island: Our Story: A Body of Evidence on Long Island |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/doc/279097536.html |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |page=A17 |subscription=yes |accessdate=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police file survived and was reviewed by Jonathan Goodman in writing his 1990 book about the case.&lt;ref name=nigol /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Starr Faithfull's life and death inspired several fictional novels, most notably [[John O'Hara]]'s ''BUtterfield 8''. She has also been discussed in a number of non-fiction books and anthologies, as well as some other works.

Several novels have been based on Starr Faithfull's story. The first and best known is John O'Hara's second novel, ''BUtterfield 8'' (Harcourt, Brace, 1935).&lt;ref name=ohara /&gt; O'Hara's fictional protagonist Gloria Wandrous was based on Faithfull, whose diary O'Hara had read and whom he had seen in New York City speakeasies when she was alive, although he did not know her well.&lt;ref name=sutherland&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutherland |first=John |date=2011 |edition=2012 (United States) |title=Lives of the Novelists: A History of Fiction in 294 Lives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV9ot7kGdi4C&amp;pg=PA430#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University Press |page=430 |isbn=978-0300179477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary readers recognized that the book was based on the Starr Faithfull case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=E.C.K. |title=The Book Nook |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/134066518/ |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post-Times]]|page=24 |date=December 22, 1935 |accessdate=February 26, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruccoli, p.

In the novel, Gloria is molested as a child by a prominent older man, becomes a heavy-drinking [[call girl]], and dies by being swept under the [[paddle steamer|paddlewheel of a boat]].&lt;ref name=ohara /&gt; O'Hara later wrote that "[t]he story of Gloria Wandrous had appeared as fact in the newspapers, along with her excerpted diary that could not all be printed either in a newspaper or a novel.

===Non-fiction===
A non-fiction essay, "The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull", was written by Morris Markey, who covered the story and interviewed the Faithfull family in 1931 as the original "reporter at large" for ''The New Yorker'' magazine.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author= |title=Milestones |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812861,00.html |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 24, 1950 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fbOOmQHa?url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C812861%2C00.html |archivedate=February 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 27, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was included in the collection ''The Aspirin Age'' (ed. Isabel Leighton, Simon and Schuster, 1949), a selection of pieces about the essential events of American life in the years between World War I and World War II.&lt;ref name=markey /&gt;

Two non-fiction [[true crime]] books have been written about the Starr Faithfull case. The first, ''The Girl on the Lonely Beach'' by Fred J. Cook (Red Seal Books, 1956) discusses her family background, based on newspaper reports, court transcripts and Cook's own interviews.&lt;ref name=palmer111&gt;Palmer, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ba4oEjRJqPIC&amp;pg=PT111 111] (afterword).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' by Jonathan Goodman (Piatkus, 1990),&lt;ref name=goodman /&gt; also included material from the original police files and the remaining fragments of Faithfull's diary.&lt;ref name=palmer111 /&gt; Reviewer Paul Nigol of the [[University of Calgary]] called ''The Passing of Starr Faithfull'' "the most complete account" of the case because Goodman was the only author to have been granted full access to the police dossier.&lt;ref name=nigol /&gt; Goodman won the 1990 [[Crime Writers' Association]] [[CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction|Gold Dagger Award for Non-Fiction]] for his book.

'''''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''''' is a 1984 book by the American philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], in which Dennett discusses the [[philosophy|philosophical]] issues of [[free will]] and [[determinism]].

In 1983, Dennett delivered the [[John Locke lectures|John Locke Lectures]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on the topic of [[free will]]. In 1984, these ideas were published in the book ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''. In this book Daniel Dennett explored what it means for people to have free will. The title, ''Elbow Room'', is a reference to the question: are we deterministic machines with no real freedom of action or do we in fact have some elbow room, some real [[rational choice theory|choice]] in our behavior?

==Synopsis==

===Determinism doesn't make humans equivalent to animals===
A major task taken on by Dennett in ''Elbow Room'' is to clearly describe just what people are as [[biology|biological]] entities and why they find the issue of free will to be of significance. In discussing what people are and why free will matters to us, Dennett makes use of an [[evolution]]ary perspective. Dennett describes the mechanical behavior of the digger [[wasp]] ''[[Sphex]]''. This insect follows a series of [[Genetics|genetically]] programmed steps in preparing for egg laying. If an experimenter interrupts one of these steps the wasp will repeat that step again. For an animal like a wasp, this process of repeating the same behavior can go on indefinitely, the wasp never seeming to notice what is going on. This is the type of mindless, pre-determined behavior that humans can avoid. Given the chance to repeat some futile behavior endlessly, people can notice the futility of it, and by an act of free will do something else. We can take this as an [[operational definition]] of what people mean by free will. Dennett points out the fact that as long as people see themselves as able to avoid futility, most people have seen enough of the free will issue. Dennett then invites all who are satisfied with this level of analysis to get on with living while he proceeds into the deeper hair-splitting aspects of the free will issue.

From a biological perspective, what is the difference between the wasp and a person? The person can, through interaction with his/her environment, construct an internal mental model of the situation and figure out a successful behavioral strategy. The wasp, with a much smaller brain and different genetic program, does not learn from its environment and instead is trapped in an endless and futile behavioral loop that is strictly determined by its genetic program. It is in this sense of people as animals with complex brains that can model reality and appear to choose among several possible behaviors that Dennett says we have free will.

===Both determinism and indeterminism seem to rule out free will===
The deeper philosophical issue of free will can be framed as a [[paradox]]. On one hand, we all feel like we have free will, a multitude of behavioral choices to select among. On the other hand, modern biology generally investigates humans as though the processes at work in them follow the same biological principles as those in wasps. How do we reconcile our feeling of free will with the idea that we might be [[mechanics|mechanical]] components of a mechanical [[universe]]?

What about [[determinism]]? When we say that a person chooses among several possible behaviors is there really a choice or does it just seem like there is a choice? Do people just (through the action of their more complex brains) simply have better behaviors than wasps, while still being totally mechanical in executing those behaviors? Dennett gives his definition of determinism on page one: ''All physical events are caused or determined by the sum total of all previous events''. This definition dodges a question that many people feel should not be dodged: if we repeatedly replayed the universe from the same point in time would it always reach the same future? Since we have no way of performing this experiment, this question is a long-term classic in philosophy and physicists have tried to interpret the results of other experiments in various ways in order to figure out the answer to this question. Modern day physics-oriented philosophers have sometimes tried to answer the question of free will using the [[many-worlds interpretation]], according to which every time there is [[quantum indeterminacy]] each possibility occurs and new universes branch off. Since the 1920s, physicists have been trying to convince themselves that quantum indeterminacy can in some way explain free will. Dennett suggests that this idea is silly. How, he asks, can random resolutions of quantum-level events provide people with any control over their behavior?

===Indeterminism is not a solution to the free will problem===
Since Dennett wrote ''Elbow Room'' (1984) there has been an ongoing attempt by some scientists to answer this question by suggesting that the brain is a device for controlling quantum indeterminacy so as to construct behavioral choice. Dennett argues that such efforts to salvage free will by finding a way out of the prison of determinism are wasted. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Control is the kind of freedom "worth wanting"===
Dennett discusses many types of free will (1984). Many philosophers have claimed that determinism and free will are [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatible]]. What the physicists seem to be trying to construct is a type of free will that involves a way for brains to make use of quantum indeterminacy so as to make choices that alter the universe in our favor, or if there are multiple universes, to choose among the possible universes. Dennett suggests that we can have another kind of free will, a type of free will which we can be perfectly happy with even if it does not give us the power to act in more than one way at any given time. Dennett is able to accept determinism and free will at the same time. How so?

===We have free will===
The type of free will that Dennett thinks we have is finally stated clearly in the last chapter of the book: the power to be active agents, biological devices that respond to our environment with [[rationalism|rational]], desirable courses of action. Dennett has slowly, through the course of the book, stripped the idea of behavioral choice from his idea of free will. How can we have free will if we do not have indeterministic choice? Dennett emphasizes control over [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian choice]]. If our hypothetically mechanical brains are in control of our behavior and our brains produce good behaviors for us, then do we really need such choice? Is an [[illusion]] of behavioral choices just as good as actual choices? Is our sensation of having the freedom to execute more than one behavior at a given time really just an illusion?  Dennett argues that choice exists in a general sense: that because we base our decisions on context, we limit our options as the situation becomes more specific.  In the most specific circumstance (actual events), he suggests there is only one option left to us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

:"It is this contrast between the stable and the chaotic that grounds our division of the world into the enduring and salient features of the world, and those features that we must treat statistically or probabilistically. And this division of the world is not just our division; it is, for instance, mother nature's division as well. Since for all mother nature knows (or could know) it is possible that these insects will cross paths (sometime, somewhere) with insectivorous birds, they had better be designed with some avoidance machinery. This endows them with a certain power that will serve well (in general)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|title=Elbow room : the varieties of free will worth wanting|year=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-04077-8|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determinism does not rule out moral responsibility===
If people are determined to act as they do, then what about personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]? How can we hold people responsible and punish them for their behaviors if they have no choice in how they behave? Dennett gives a two-part answer to this question:

First, we hold people responsible for their actions because we know from historical experience that this is an effective means to make people behave in a socially acceptable way. Second, holding people responsible only works when combined with the fact that people can be informed of the fact that they are being held responsible and respond to this state of affairs by controlling their behavior so as to avoid punishment. People who break the rules set by society and get punished may be behaving in the only way they can, but if we did not hold them accountable for their actions, people would behave even worse than they do with the threat of punishment. This is a totally [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the issue of responsibility. Expressing [[morality|moral]] indignation when people break the rules of proper behaviour is only useful to the extent that it contributes to dissuading such behaviour. Again, an argument from utility. Is it, then, moral to punish people who are unable to do other than break a rule? Yes, people have the right to come together and improve their condition by creating rules and enforcing them. We would be worse off if we did not do so. Again, an argument from utility.

===Fatalism is destructive===
One final issue: if people do not have real behavioral choices, why not collapse into [[fatalism]]? Again, Dennett's argument is that we may not have behavioral choice, but we do have control of our behavior. Dennett asks us to look around at the universe and ask, can I even conceive of beings whose will is freer than our own? For Dennett, the answer to this question is, no, not really. In ''Elbow Room'', he tries to explain why all the attempts that people have tried to make to prove that people have [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian choice]] have failed and are, in the final analysis, not really important anyhow. As humans, we are as much in control of our behavior as anything in the universe. As humans, we have the best chance to produce good behavior. We should be satisfied with what we have and not fret over our lack of libertarian free will.

Some complaints about ''Elbow Room'' relate to our intuitions about free will. Some say{{Who|date=January 2015}} that Dennett's theory does not satisfactorily deal with the issue of why we feel so strongly that we do have behavioral choice. One answer to this question is the result of selection on individuals to live harmoniously in society. But one doesn't have to be free to achieve that goal. Another answer is that it tells us (our brains) whether we're doing something or someone else is doing something to us (e.g. shaking arm). But, again one does not have to be free to make such a distinction. A final answer to this question is that our sensation of having behavioral choice has been carefully selected by evolution. The well-developed human sensation of having free will and being able to select among possible behaviors has strong survival value. People who lose the feeling that they can plan alternative behaviors and execute their choice of possible behaviors tend to become fatalistic and stop struggling for survival. According to Dennett, belief in free will is a necessary condition for having free will. When we are planning for the future and thinking about possible actions to take in the future, we are utilizing considerable amounts of biologically expensive resources (brain power). Evolution has designed us to feel strongly that all of our effort of planning pays off, that we control what we do. If this connection between our brains' efforts to model reality and predict the future and so make possible good outcomes is disconnected from our sense of self and our will, then fatalism and self-destructive behaviors are close at hand. However, the same effect is attainted if, despite not believing in the control free will gives, we believe that does not prevent us to live as fully as our bodies allow us to and to try harder to achieve things if we think we have agency.

'''George Wright''' (October 22, 1803 – July 30, 1865) was an American soldier who served in the [[Mexican–American War]] and the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life and career==
Wright was born in [[Norwich, Vermont]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Norwich-Vermont.html|title=Norwich, Vermont|publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate= July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from [[West Point]] in 1822. He served in the [[3rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment]] on the frontier in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Maine]]. In 1838 he transferred to the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and served on the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].

In 1844, he fought in Florida against the [[Seminole]]s where he was appointed [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major (United States)|major]] for meritorious service.

During the [[Mexican–American War]], he served with the 8th Infantry at [[Battle of Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] and at the [[Battle of Molino del Rey]], where he was wounded. For this service he was appointed a brevet [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

In 1848 he was promoted to major, and then [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in 1855, when he transferred to the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Infantry Regiment]] and served on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Later in 1855 he was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and sent to [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia to recruit the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]], which, when at strength, was sent to the [[Washington Territory]].

In 1858 Wright oversaw the reconstruction of [[Fort Dalles]] in [[Oregon Territory]] from a wood outpost to a more substantial base while in command.&lt;ref name="Horner"&gt;Horner, John B. (1921). ''Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature''. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; He fought in the [[Yakima War]] in 1855–56. In 1858, in retaliation for the Steptoe Battle, he soundly defeated the combined tribes in the [[Battle of Four Lakes]] and the Battle of Spokane Plains near [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]. On September 23, 1858, after signing agreements with the [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alenes]], Wright was in camp near [[Latah Creek|Latah (Hangman's) Creek]], near present-day Spokane, Washington.  He had in custody Chief Owhi, regarded as a perpetrator of the attacks on white settlers which led to the Yakima War.  Wright sent for Owhi's son, [[Qualchan]], also considered a perpetrator, threatening to hang Owhi unless Qualchan came to the camp. When Qualchan rode in the next day, he was taken into custody and hung within 15 minutes.  Wright issued the orders to hang him, telling Captain [[James Allen Hardie]] to carry out the duty.&lt;ref name=accessgenealogy.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/yakima-chiefs-owhi-and-qualchien.htm.|title=Yakima Chiefs Owhi and Qualchien – Access Genealogy|date=6 February 2013|website=accessgenealogy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
At the beginning of the Civil War, Wright was the commanding officer of the [[Department of Oregon]]. Then, for a few months in 1861, he was the commanding officer of the [[District of Southern California]]. In October 1861, he was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of Volunteers and placed in command of the [[Department of the Pacific]], replacing [[Edwin Vose Sumner]], on Sumner's recommendation.

Although Wright would have preferred to have been sent East during the Civil War, he remained in California where he commanded the largest force ever in the Far West—6,000 troops in 1862. His duties included protecting the frontier, keeping watch on [[secession]]ists, safeguarding the coast, and moving troops eastward.

The climate of San Francisco was not agreeable to Wright, because of his [[asthma]], and he wanted to move the headquarters to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The headquarters did not move, although Wright did spend time in Sacramento.

==Postbellum==
When the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] reorganized in 1865 and created the Military Division of the Pacific, Wright commanded the [[District of California]] for a few months until he was given command of the newly created [[Department of the Columbia]]. He may have been removed from command of the Department of the Pacific in order for the Army to have a position for [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]].

Wright and his wife died at sea ''en route'' to his new command when the steamer [[Brother Jonathan (steamer)|''Brother Jonathan'']] was wrecked off the California coast. His body was recovered six weeks later.&lt;ref name="sacbee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Some heroes of Sacramento cemetery tour wore petticoats |work=The Sacramento Bee |date=July 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/07/03/3744361/some-heroes-of-sacramento-cemetery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is interred in the [[Sacramento Historic City Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="tour"&gt;{{cite web |title=Self Guided Tour |publisher=Historic City Cemetery, Inc. |date=January 2006 |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |url=http://www.oldcitycemetery.com/images/PDF/SelfTour.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his service as commander of the Department of the Pacific, he was appointed a brevet brigadier general in the regular army.

==Namesake==
[[Fort George Wright]], located near Spokane, was named in his honor.

==Family==
In 1827, Wright married Margaret Wallace Foster (or Forster).  They were the parents of three sons and one daughter—[[Thomas F. Wright|Thomas Foster]] (or Forster), James Heron, Roswell, and Elizabeth H., the wife of Army Captain P. A. Owen.

'''Giorgio William Vizzardelli''' (August 23, 1922 – August 11, 1973) was an Italian serial killer.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;[http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&amp;file=/archivio/uni_1973_08/19730812_0005.pdf&amp;query=giorgio%20william%20vizzardelli ''Si uccide il protagonista del giallo degli anni '30''], [[L'Unità]], August 12, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Francavilla al Mare]] on August 23, 1922, the son of the director of [[Sarzana]] register,&lt;ref name="vizz"&gt;[http://issuu.com/kidstudio/docs/lanazione_sarzana150anni La Nazione 150 anni Sarzana]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pret"&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/genova/uccide_due_preti_e_fa_altre_tre_vittime_quindicenne_che_amava_al_capone/21-10-2005/articolo-id=37359-page=0-comments=1 ''Uccide due preti e fa altre tre vittime il quindicenne che amava Al Capone''], [[Il Giornale]]&lt;/ref&gt; he did his first murders at age 14, killing the rector with a gun and, in his escape, the guard of the school he attended.&lt;ref name="vizz" /&gt; He returned home and behaved normally, as if nothing had happened. The investigations led to the arrest of a young man, who was acquitted after eighteen months of detention and compensated by [[Benito Mussolini]] himself.&lt;ref name="vizz" /&gt;

The discovery of another two bodies, which occurred on August 20, 1938, re-opened the investigation on the murderer, who was identified after he committed his fifth murder, which took place on December 29 against the custodian of the registry office Giuseppe Bernardini.

Embedded thanks to some clues (including a denouncement report presented by his father and a key to a blood-soaked safe), Vizzardelli was arrested and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on September 23, 1940, avoiding the death penalty because he was a minor.

In 1944 the newspapers reported the news of his daring escape and enlistment in the [[Black Brigades]], with a lot of capturing and killing at the hands of partisans on [[Monte Antola]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/genova/mostro-sarzana-80-anni-906542.html Il mostro di Sarzana 80 anni dopo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In prison he studied several languages to translate several literary works, until July 29, 1968, when he was granted parole for five years. Settled in his sister's house in [[Carrara]], a few days after he finished serving his sentence, he killed himself by slitting his throat with a kitchen knife.  He died on August 11, 1973.

'''Henry Bendix''', also known as '''Weatherman''', is a fictional character in the [[Wildstorm]] [[Wildstorm universe|universe]]. He first appeared in the ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'' series.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Henry Bendix's past remains fairly muddled, partly because of the existence of an alternate Bendix who has been known to pose as the original. He grew up in Maladyville, Mississippi, raised by his [[child abuse|abusive]], [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] father. It appears that his father more than once killed a girlfriend during a drunken rage.&lt;ref&gt;"Monarchy" #5&lt;/ref&gt; Even as a child, Henry was extremely intelligent, designing the bodily enhancements that eventually led to the creation of the superheroes [[Midnighter]] and [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]] while still a child. Henry's diary from this time would mention that he had been contacted by the alien Weavers, who showed him the future. Young Henry was shocked to find out that he would become a villain, but the Weavers told him that till then he could be a hero. Henry killed his father with a self-built energy weapon in order to save his father's girlfriend, Delia. (See notes, as this origin was told in the [[Monarchy (comic book)|Monarchy]] series.)

During the 1960s, he worked for the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]], developing a mobile weapon that was operated through a combination of manual controls and cybernetic uplink. It was dubbed "Think Tank". He was recruited into [[Team One]], a secret task force designed to deal with the emerging [[Daemonite]] threat. Team One was dissolved following its first mission. The actual tank was destroyed by Daemonites, causing energy to surge into Bendix's brain.&lt;ref&gt;"Authority Prime" #1&lt;/ref&gt; The experience gave Bendix a lifelong interest in Earth's secret history. This fascination put him in contact with the villains known as the [[Four (comics)|Four]], and led him to discover the interdimensional realm known as the [[Bleed (Wildstorm)|Bleed]], among other things. Although he continued to work for the US government, he kept most of his funding for himself.

===Weatherman One===
In 1978, he was appointed to the post of Weatherman One, head of [[Stormwatch (comics)|StormWatch]], the United Nations Special Crisis Intervention Team. During that time, he was outfitted with cybernetic implants that granted him direct cybernetic link to Skywatch's operating systems. He retained this post until 1994, when he was temporarily replaced by [[Synergy (comics)|Christine Trelane]]. He regained his post a year later following the Second Despot Incident. All the while, he continued to explore the world and advance his own, secret agenda.

The [[Fire From Heaven (comics)|Fire From Heaven]] incident inspired him to take a more proactive approach to peacekeeping. He reorganizes StormWatch, firing most of the junior members, recruiting [[Jenny Sparks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How To Read Superhero Comics And Why|last=Klock|first=Geoff|year= 2002|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-1418-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rose Tattoo (Wildstorm)|Rose Tattoo]] and [[Jack Hawksmoor (comics)|Jack Hawksmoor]] and placing all members of the original team into inactive duties. He split the remaining memberships into three teams: StormWatch Prime, StormWatch Red and StormWatch Black. Bendix believed that this structure would allow for a more flexible response to post-human threats.

Weatherman and his team attended a superhero 'conference' only to learn the earth was splitting up into separate realities. Most just the same, but with far less superheroes. Despite visible evidence of friends forgetting others had existed a moment ago, Bendix expressed pleasure at the idea of having less super-powered competition.&lt;ref&gt;"Shattered Image" #2 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after StormWatch's reorganization, Bendix was approached by an alternate universe version of him. He offered Bendix a chance to explore the Bleed. In exchange, he asked Bendix to allow him to replace him. This alternate Bendix attempted to shape an orderly world and was killed by Jenny Sparks after he slaughtered members of a superhero team that was attempting to create a crime-free utopia. At the time members of Stormwatch believed this to be the real Bendix gone insane. The new Weatherman [[Battalion (WildStorm)|Jackson King]] even believed Bendix' madness was a result of the cybernetic implants (which were part of the Weatherman's job), and refused to have them himself.

After exploring the Bleed and gathering allies, Bendix returned to his world in 2004. Discovering that [[The Authority (comics)|the Authority]] was now in charge of America, he devised a plan to remove them from power whilst, at the same time, breaking up the team. His plan was successful. Following that, he assumed control of the shattered Secret Monarchy, the loose coalition of secret groups that run the world behind the scenes. He implemented an active post-human advancement agenda, facilitating integration of [[Kherubim]] and other otherworldly technology into American (and to a lesser extent, global) society. In 2008, he faced off against the reorganized Authority. After a prolonged struggle, he was killed by [[Midnighter]].

===Bendix's son&lt;!--'Stormwatch (comics)' redirects here--&gt;===
In ''[[Stormwatch PHD]]'' #8, it is revealed that Bendix has a son named William.&lt;ref&gt;"Stormwatch Post Human Division" #8&lt;/ref&gt;  The spitting image of his father, the younger Bendix is the child of a call girl that Henry paid off to raise on her own in secret.  William was recruited by Jackson King to be the new Weatherman (no longer a leadership role) for the reconstituted Stormwatch Prime.  This is due to most of the cybernetic integration systems having been designed for Henry's physiology, so William is a wise choice. William is deeply concerned that he will turn into his father despite King's faith that he is his own man.

William's main goal has been to crack his father's "memory tower," containing his most secret files.  He manages to do this in ''[[The Authority: Prime]]'' miniseries, uncovering a secret bunker in the Nevada desert and leading to a battle between The Authority and Stormwatch Prime for custody of its contents.  During the battle, an AI copy of Henry Bendix activates in response and proceeds to release zombie-like clones of his secret Stormwatch team (including copies of Apollo and Midnighter), seduce Rose Tattoo to his side yet again and install itself in a younger cloned body which has been engineered with the powers and abilities of every superhuman present.  William arrives at the scene and convinces Rose to kill the clone of his father but not before he is seriously wounded by the reborn Henry Bendix.  Although his body is not found by either of the teams after the resulting destruction of the bunker; the horrifically scarred William emerges from the wreckage, his father having psychically grafted his own consciousness onto William's mind.  In control of his son's body, Bendix muses that the body is young and strong enough.

He's seen trying to kill [[Midnighter]] and [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]], hiring the Lords of the Gun and giving them the Ace of Winchester.&lt;ref&gt;Midnighter and Apollo #1 (October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is found by Midnighter and is killed.

=== The Wild Storm ===
First appearing in The Wild Storm #2 after chastising [[Synergy (comics)|Christine Trelane]], the director of the Division(Skywatch's earth agents) before being fully introduced in issue four, Bendix is mainly unchanged from his original counterpart, still being the Weatherman of Skywatch. However, it is revealed that he is a more laid back version of his character behind the scenes, drinking and doing drugs. He is also revealed to be a racist and homophobic person, being especially crude toward the director of Internal Operations, Miles Craven, and his boyfriend Julian. It is even alluded to that during a summit, he left via teleport after staring at Julian "like he wanted to watch [him] hang from a tree that was also on fire."&lt;ref&gt;"The Wild Storm" #4&lt;/ref&gt; Bendix also bears a deep hatred for Earth, preferring to be on the Skywatch station, even wanting an excuse to take over the planet so he wouldn't have to go there.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wild Storm" #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate Bendix==

The alternate Bendix who replaced the original has had a substantial impact on the team as well, though in a much more negative way. Whilst the first Bendix had an undoubtedly ruthless and cold-hearted side, the new one was an entirely self-centred, psychotic individual pursuing an [[ultra-conservative]] agenda. He had a bizarre romantic affair with [[Rose Tattoo (Wildstorm)|Rose Tattoo]], the Spirit of Murder, apparently being attracted to her lust for death and destruction (when a later, evolved Tattoo asked the original why her poisoned kiss did not affect him, he replied "Because I embrace it."). It was alternate Bendix who was defeated after attacking a group of superhumans attempting to establish a utopia in South America. He was killed by Jenny Sparks.

==Other appearances==
In the ''[[Monarchy (comic book)|Monarchy]]'' series, Henry Bendix appears, claiming to have planned his death by Jenny Sparks so that he could become an ''imaginary being'', capable of assisting the Weavers and the Monarchy in their battle against Chimaera. [[Battalion (WildStorm)|Jackson King]] visits Bendix' home and finds his childhood diary there. In it Bendix relates the events of his first contact with the Weavers. The ''Authority: Revolution'' series seems to have [[retcon]]ned these events away. Therefore it is also unclear whether his youth in Maladyville, Mississippi is still part of continuity.

'''James Kim''' (August 9, 1971{{spaced ndash}}December 4, 2006) was an American television personality and technology analyst for the former [[TechTV]] international [[cable television]] network, reviewing products for shows including ''[[The Screen Savers]]'', ''[[Call for Help]]'', and ''[[Fresh Gear]]''. At the time of his death he was working as a senior editor of [[MP3]] and [[Digital Audio]] for [[CNET]], where he wrote more than 400 product reviews. He also co-hosted a weekly video podcast for CNET's gadget blog, [http://crave.cnet.com Crave], and a weekly audio podcast, [http://mp3insider.cnet.com The MP3 Insider] (both podcasts were co-hosted with [[Veronica Belmont]]).

His disappearance and death, and his family's ordeal, made them the subject of a brief but intense period of news coverage in December 2006.

==Career==
Kim was most widely known as a television personality on the international cable network [[TechTV]], where he was a senior technology analyst for TechTV Labs. He made frequent appearances testing new products for shows including ''[[The Screen Savers]]'', ''[[Call for Help]]'', ''[[Fresh Gear]]'', and ''[[AudioFile (Tech TV)|AudioFile]]''. He was best known for his "Lab Rats" segments, in which he reviewed the latest electronic gadgets. After leaving TechTV, he became a senior editor for [[CNET]], a technology trade journal, which he had joined in 2004. He wrote product reviews and co-hosted a weekly podcast for CNET's gadget blog, Crave. Prior to working for TechTV, Kim had been a legal assistant at law firms in New York and France; a media relations assistant for baseball's American League; and a script reader for Miramax Films.

==Snowbound==
After spending the 2006 Thanksgiving holiday in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the Kims (James, Kati, and their two daughters, 4-year old Penelope and 7-month old Sabine) set out for their home in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. On Saturday, November 25, 2006, having left [[Portland, Oregon]], on their way to Tu Tu Tun Lodge, a resort located near [[Gold Beach, Oregon]], the Kims apparently missed a turnoff from [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] to [[Oregon Route 42]], a main route to the [[Oregon Coast]]. Instead of returning to the exit, they consulted a highway map and picked a secondary route that skirted the [[Wild Rogue Wilderness]], a remote area of southwestern Oregon. It is also possible that they may have planned to take this route.

After encountering heavy snow at high elevation on [[Bear Camp Road]], they backtracked and ventured onto BLM Road 34-8-36 ({{coord|42.5744|N|123.7504|W|format=dms|name=Location of road departure}}), one of hundreds of unpaved logging roads supervised by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) thinking that could be an option. A road gate intended to prevent such mistakes was open despite BLM rules requiring that it be closed. Media outlets reported that vandals had cut a lock on the gate, but a subsequent investigation showed that BLM employees had left it open to avoid trapping local hunters and others who might have ventured past it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After 23 miles of slow travel along Road BLM 34-8-36, the family stopped at about 1.00 a.m. on November 26 because of fatigue and bad weather ({{coord|42.6885|N|123.7773|W|format=dms|name=Location of Kim's family}}). As more snow fell around their immobilized [[Saab 9-2X]] station wagon, the Kims kept warm by running its engine. When the vehicle ran out of fuel, they made a campfire of dried wood and magazines. Later, they burned their car's tires to signal rescuers. Search efforts began shortly after November 30, when coworkers of Kim filed a missing persons report with the San Francisco Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After investigators learned that the Kims used their credit card at a local restaurant, [[search and rescue]] teams, including local and state police, more than 80 civilian volunteers, the Oregon Army National Guard and several helicopters hired by Mr. Kim's father, Spencer Kim, spent several days looking for the family along area highways and roads, to no avail.

On December 2, James Kim left his family to look for help, wearing tennis shoes, a jacket, and light clothing. He believed the nearest town ([[Galice, Oregon|Galice]]) was located four miles away after studying a map with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim backtracked about 11 miles down BLM Road 34-8-36 before leaving the roadway and electing to follow a ravine northeast down the mountain.

===Search===
Although the Kims had a [[Mobile phone|cellular phone]] with them, their remote location in the mountains was out of range of the [[cellular network]], rendering the phone unusable for voice calls.  Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would play a key role in their rescue.  Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because [[text messaging]] is a [[store-and-forward]] service.  Two [[Edge Wireless]] engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the [[Data logging|data logs]] of [[cell site]]s, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near [[Glendale, Oregon]], and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as [[tropospheric ducting]], can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on [[Bear Camp Road]].&lt;ref name="tragic_end"&gt;{{cite news

On the afternoon of December 4, John Rachor, a local helicopter pilot unaffiliated with any formal search effort, spotted Mrs. Kim and her two daughters walking on a remote road. After he radioed the family's position to authorities, the three were airlifted out of the area and transferred to a nearby hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-6140674.html |title=Video: Rescuers find Kim family members; search continues for editor |accessdate=2006-12-04 |publisher=CNet Networks |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720152452/http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-6140674.html |archivedate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement officials said that the discovery of the cellphone connection, and the subsequent analysis of the log data, was the critical breakthrough that ultimately resulted in the rescue of Kim's wife and daughters by helicopter.&lt;ref name="tragic_end"/&gt;

The Kim family's ordeal became a lead story on most major U.S. news networks, even amidst [[breaking news]] of the [[Iraq Study Group]]'s recommendations on America's war in Iraq.

Newspapers in the region, led by ''[[The Oregonian]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', devoted heavy coverage to the events and their aftermath.

On January 6, 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an op-ed article written by Spencer Kim, James Kim's father, criticizing various government entities that had, in his estimation, played roles in his son's death. The elder Kim blamed the BLM for not locking the gate to the logging road; privacy laws that he claimed had delayed the start of search and rescue efforts; local authorities for "confusion, communication breakdowns and failures of leadership" during the search; and the Federal Aviation Administration for not keeping media aircraft out of the search area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{nihongo|'''''Jewelpet'''''|ジュエルペット|Juerupetto|lead=yes}} is a [[Japan]]ese media franchise and toy line created in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/english/characters/detail/jewelpet/index.html|title=Jewelpet|publisher=Sanrio|accessdate=2009-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603002515/http://www.sanrio.co.jp/english/characters/detail/jewelpet/index.html#|archive-date=2009-06-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a joint venture between [[Sanrio]] and [[Sega Toys]], produced by the third character designer of [[Hello Kitty]], [[Yuko Yamaguchi]] and illustrated by the character designer of [[Cinnamoroll]], [[Miyuki Okumura]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/business/global/15kitty.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise was originally launched on January 15, 2008, focusing on animals named after jewels, birthstones and minerals, who can use magic using their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/detail/82 |title=（株）セガトイズ （株）サンリオが共同開発 新キャラクター 『ジュエルペット』誕生 〜かわいい動物をモチーフにした33種類の"魔法使いのペットたち"〜 |publisher=Sanrio |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220152828/http://sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/detail/82 |archivedate=2012-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its success, Sanrio and Sega Toys expanded the Jewelpet franchise overseas. The franchise is currently being licensed by Italian company [[Giochi Preziosi (company)|Giochi Preziosi]] for its European release.

The official slogan, albeit poorly translated, is ''"Eyes of Jewel that Shine, glittering with Luck and Good Fortune"''.

==Story==
{{See also|Jewelpet Universe}}
In an antique shop, there was a magical Jewel Box which sat there for centuries and shined in very bright colors. A girl accidentally encountered the box and opened it, causing a strange light to shine and the girl was sucked inside. She was now in a strange new world that shined like jewels. A sign read 'Jewel Land'. The girl was amazed, as everything shined in bright colors and was decorated in all kinds of jewels. At the center of the town, there was a strange tower, also decorated with magical jewels. She went to the tower and went inside.

The girl was greeted by a princess and was happy to see her as she offered her a jewel apple. The girl accepted the gift and the jewel in the girl's hand glowed, magically transforming into a cute animal. The princess said the creature was called a Jewelpet, and each of them live in Jewel Land. However, she also told her the crisis that Jewel Land was facing as the magic was starting to vanish. She told the girl that she must raise that Jewelpet she had into a full-fledged magician.

Each Jewelpet differs from their magical Jewel Eyes and depends on the human partner who awakens them and use magic whenever they need to. They all study magic along with their partners in a special school in Jewel Land for them to become master magicians. The pets and their partners must endure a lot of hardships and even trouble. With each care the human partners give to their Jewelpets, the pets love them back.

For a Jewelpet to become a magician, it must go through rigorous training and studying with their human partners to prevent the crisis in Jewel Land. If the Jewelpet becomes a magician, they'll be rewarded with a magical Jewel Cloak, as a symbol of mastery over its magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewelpet.info/story/index.html |title=The official Story of the Jewelpet Franchise (Japanese) |publisher=Sanrio |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925191555/http://jewelpet.info/story/index.html |archivedate=2012-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Jewelpet franchise debuted on January 15, 2008 as the first collaborative project between Sanrio and [[Sega Toys]].&lt;ref name="sanriosegatoys"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2008-01-15|url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/2008/0115.html|title=（株）セガトイズ （株）サンリオが共同開発 新キャラクター 『ジュエルペット』誕生 〜かわいい動物をモチーフにした33種類の“魔法使いのペットたち”〜|work=|author=|publisher=[[サンリオ]]|accessdate=2013-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610051051/http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/2008/0115.html|archivedate=2009-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise originally started off with 33 characters, each of them being best sellers during the summer of that year with each toy having internet connectivity capabilities using special passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2010-03-19|url=http://journal.mycom.co.jp/news/2010/03/19/091/index.html|title=TVアニメ『ジュエルペット』、2010年4月より新シリーズが放送開始|newspaper=[[マイナビニュース|マイコミジャーナル]]|author=|publisher=[[マイナビ]]|accessdate=2013-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825170139/http://journal.mycom.co.jp/news/2010/03/19/091/index.html|archivedate=2010-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Jewelpet'' entered its first year in 2009, the first season of the anime series of the same name premiered.

In February 2010, 600 items of merchandise were all made with over 25 licensed companies for its overseas and domestic expansion.&lt;ref name=NMJ100212&gt;「サンリオ『ジュエルペット』品目倍増、セガトイズと開発のキャラ、ライセンス拡大」『[[日経MJ]]』2010年2月12日、9頁。&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2010, the 34th Jewelpet, Labra, officially debuted. The characters made their official debut as meet able characters in [[Sanrio Puroland]] with their first two shows: {{nihongo|'''Throbbing Jewelpet! Magical☆March'''|ジュエルペットのどきどき!マジカル☆マーチ|Juerupetto no dokidoki! Majikaru ☆ māchi}} and {{nihongo|'''Jewelpet and Cinnamon's Future Revolution!'''|ジュエルペットとシナモンのみらいレボリューション!|Juerupetto to shinamon nomi rai reboryūshon!}}. In addition, after the characters debuted in Puroland, visitors increased by 17% during the fourth quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.plala.or.jp/kkato/gm_log/2011u/gm_sanrio.html] BLACK OUT ゲーム株1行情報{{出典無効|date=2015-01-25 |title=個人サイトは検証可能性の確保された出典と認められません。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, three new Jewelpets officially debuted: Angela, Charotte and Jasper. Charotte and Jasper were both winners of a Jewelpet Design Contest that was held during the airing of Jewelpet Twinkle. In 2011, the Webgurumi website was closed down and was replaced by a new website: Jewel Land Online. In December of that same year, the character Sakuran made its official debut alongside 11 new characters in a new subline called Sweetspets. Sakuran herself is also a winner of the new character design contest that was held during the airing of Jewelpet Sunshine.

On March 31, 2012, two new male Jewelpets debuted: Coal and Granite. Jewel Land Online ended its service that date as well. In June 2012, the Puroland show {{nihongo|'''Jewelpet Kira☆Deco! Musical'''|ジュエルペット きら☆デコッ!ミュージカル|Juerupetto kira ☆ deko! Myūjikaru}} opened in conjunction with the ''Jewelpet Kira☆Deco!'' TV series. In August 2012, its first official theatrical film was released in Japanese cinemas with the introduction of the 13th Sweetspet, Gumimin. However, the film proved to be a failure at the box office.

In the January 2013 Issue of Pucchigumi magazine, the 40th Jewelpet, Rossa was officially revealed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pucchigumi]]'' Magazine, January 2013 issue, [[Shogakukan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the 41st Jewelpet, Luea, was also revealed and in the November 2014 issue of ''Youchien'', marked the debut of the 42nd character Larimar.&lt;ref&gt;''Youchien'' Magazine, November 2014 issue, [[Shogakukan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the musicals based on Jewelpet ended its run.

As of July 2017, the characters were  removed in Sanrio Puroland's catalog of meet of greet characters due to rising popularity of the ''[[Rilu Rilu Fairilu]]'' Anime series. Japanese netizens expressed their concerns over the issue as the indoor park's representatives stated that the popularity of the new series has caused for the characters to be removed from the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.j-cast.com/2017/07/04302413.html?p=all&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

===Toys===
Sega Toys collaborated with Sanrio to release a line of plush toys on January 15, 2008. Each plush Jewelpet contains a password to access the Web-Gurumi website, a special site in which the customer "adopts" this pet in the virtual world. If the user doesn't have the password, the user may not get access to the website. Accounts expire within one year, unless another Jewelpet toy is bought, and that animal is added to the user account. With the expansion of the series, toy replicas of the Jewel Stick, Jewel Charms, Jewel Pocketbook and Jewel Pods from the anime series were made as well.

===Merchandise===
As with other Sanrio character franchises such as [[Hello Kitty]], [[List of Sanrio characters#My Melody|My Melody]], [[Sugarbunnies]] and [[Cinnamoroll]], Jewelpet merchandise mostly consists of stationery, school supplies, bags, raincoats, umbrellas, bento boxes and even toy replicas of the Jewel Stick and Jewel Pocketbook from the anime series. Merchandise was released by Sanrio, Sega and [[Bandai]], among other companies. The popularity of the series then expanded overseas in [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Europe]].

A [[Trading Card Game]] spinoff was also released by [[Bushiroad]], the creators of the [[Weiß Schwarz]], ''Alice X Cross'' and [[Cardfight!! Vanguard]] Trading Card Games. Both the starter set and booster packs were released on July 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bushiroad.com/products/jp0001.html|title=Bushiroad's Official Jewelpet TCG Site|publisher=[[Bushiroad]]|accessdate=2012-10-03|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903200325/http://bushiroad.com/products/jp0001.html#|archive-date=2011-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later discontinued in 2010.

'''Joanna of Austria''' (German ''Johanna von Österreich'', Italian ''Giovanna d'Austria'') (24 January 1547 – 11 April 1578) was born an [[Archduke|Archduchess of Austria]] as the youngest daughter of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]]. By marriage, she was the Grand Princess of Tuscany and later the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]]. One of her daughters was [[Marie de Medici]], second wife of King [[Henry IV of France]].

==Family==
[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldi 005.jpg|left|thumb|Joanna of Austria; 1562]]
Joanna was born in [[Prague]] as the youngest of 15 children. She never knew her mother and eldest sister as her mother died 2 days after Joanna's birth and her sister [[Elisabeth of Austria (1526–1545)|Elisabeth of Austria]], Queen of Poland, died two years before Joanna was born.

Her paternal grandparents were [[Philip I of Castile]] and [[Joanna of Castile]]. Her maternal grandparents were King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]], and [[Anna of Foix-Candale]]. Through her father, Joanna was also a descendant of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Mary of Burgundy]].

==Marriage==

Her marriage to [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], took place on 18 December 1565 in [[Florence]], after she solemnly arrived in the city by the [[Porta al Prato]]. [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Vincenzo Borghini]], with the help of [[Giovanni Caccini]] made big festivities for these event. The party was also taken to the Medici Villa in [[Poggio a Caiano]].

Nevertheless, Joanna was homesick and unhappy. Ignored by her husband, and despised by the Florentines for her Austrian hauteur, she never felt at home in [[Florence]].

Her father-in-law, [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], was reasonably kind to Joanna. He had the courtyard of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] specially decorated for her; the lunettes were painted with murals of Austrian towns by pupils of Vasari, and [[Verrocchio]]'s ''Putto with Dolphin'' fountain was brought down from the [[Villa Medici at Careggi|Careggi villa]] where it had been set up in the garden by [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].

The position of Joanna in the Florentine court was a difficult one: between 1566 and 1575, she gave birth to six daughters, of whom only three survived infancy. The absence of a male heir to continue the dynasty was the cause of constant conflict with her husband, who preferred the company of his mistress [[Bianca Cappello]], who gave birth to a son, Antonio, in 1576.

Finally, in 1577 Joanna gave birth to the long-awaited heir, baptised [[Philip de' Medici|Filippo]] in honour of King [[Philip II of Spain]], Joanna's first cousin. The birth was celebrated with great joy by the court, as now the succession of the Grand Duchy was secured and any ambitions of Bianca Cappello to have her son Antonio as heir of Tuscany were eliminated. However Filippo was to die young, and Joanna's brother-in-law, [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando]], succeeded Francesco as Grand Duke.

==Death==

On 10 April 1578, Joanna – heavily pregnant with her eighth child – fell from the stairs in the Grand Ducal Palace in [[Florence]]. Some hours later, she prematurely gave birth to a son, who died immediately. She died the next day on 11 April. Francesco subsequently married his mistress, [[Bianca Cappello]], making her [[grand Duchess of Tuscany|grand duchess]].

The mysterious circumstances around this accident caused rumours accusing her husband and his mistress of murdering her, so that they could be married. However, modern medical investigation of her remains confirm the official reports of her death as caused by the birth (the child presented arm first, and Joanna suffered a ruptured uterus). Joanna suffered from [[scoliosis]]: her spine and pelvis were severely deformed. It is clear from the condition of her pelvis that her previous births had been difficult, and it seems remarkable that she had survived them.&lt;ref name="The Medici Project: First Anthropological and Paleopathological Results"&gt;Gino Fornaciari, Angelica Vitiello, Sara Giusiani,
Valentina Giuffra, Antonio Fornaciari, Natale Villari, [http://www.paleopatologia.it/articoli/aticolo.php?recordID=18 ''The Medici Project: First Anthropological and Paleopathological Results''] (retrieved 23 January 2011); includes photographs of her bones.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue==
The eight children of Francesco and Joanna were:

# [[Eleanor de' Medici|Eleonora de' Medici]] (28 February 1567 – 9 September 1611) married [[Vincenzo I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] and had issue.
# Romola de' Medici (20 November 1568 – 2 December 1568) died in infancy.
# [[Anna de' Medici]] (31 December 1569 – 19 February 1584) died unmarried.
# Isabella de' Medici (30 September 1571 – 8 August 1572) died in infancy.
# Lucrezia de' Medici (7 November 1572 – 14 August 1574) died in infancy.
# [[Marie de' Medici|Maria de' Medici]] (26 April 1575 – 3 July 1642) married [[Henri IV of France]] and had issue.
# [[Philip de' Medici|Filippo de' Medici]] (20 May 1577 – 29 March 1582) died in infancy.
# Stillborn son (10 April 1578 – 10 April 1578).

Out of a total of eight children, only two daughters, Eleanora and Maria (Marie) lived to adulthood, the rest of the children died young.

'''John Abercromby''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1561) was, according to [[Thomas Dempster]]'s ''Historia ecclesiastica'' (1829),&lt;ref&gt;''Thomae Dempsteri Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum, sive, De scriptoribus Scotis'', ed. [[David Irving (librarian)|David Irving]], rev. edn., 2 vols., Bannatyne Club, 21 (1829 (cited in ODNB)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Benedictine]] monk who was executed for his [[Roman Catholicism]]. However, his identity is doubtful: "Abercromby has not come to light in recent scholarly work, nor is he found in the published records... The only possible conclusion is that John Abercromby is a figment, a ‘ghost’ fabricated by Thomas Dempster."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dilworth, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/42 ‘Abercromby, John (supp. fl. 1561)’], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 26 Sept 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the 1885 ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', he was the author of ''Veritatis Defensio'' and ''Hæreseos Confusio.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Abercromby, John (d.1561?)|first=Thompson|last= Cooper|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Broussard '''(1702–1765), also known as '''Beausoleil''' ({{lang-en|Beautiful Sun}}), was a leader of the [[Acadians|Acadian]] people in [[Acadia]]; later [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[New Brunswick]]. Broussard organized a [[Military history of the Mi’kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] and [[Military history of the Acadians|Acadian militia]]s against the British through [[King George's War]], [[Father Le Loutre's War]] and during the [[French and Indian War]].  After the loss of Acadia to the British, he eventually led the first group of Acadians to southern Louisiana in present-day [[United States]]. His name is sometimes presented as Joseph Gaurhept Broussard; this is likely the result of a transcription error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://bayoutechedispatches.blogspot.com/2012/04/middle-name-or-clerical-error-joseph.html| title = Middle Name or Clerical Error?: Joseph Broussard dit Beausoleil and 'Gaurhept', Shane K. Bernard| accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broussard is widely regarded as a hero and an important historical figure by both Acadians and Cajuns.

==Life==
Broussard was born in [[Port-Royal_(Acadia)|Port-Royal, Nova Scotia]] in 1702 to Jean-François Broussard and Catherine Richard. His father came from [[Poitiers]] and his mother was born in Port Royal. He lived much of his life at Le Cran (present-day [[Stoney Creek, New Brunswick|Stoney Creek]], [[Albert County, New Brunswick]]), along the [[Petitcodiac River]] with his wife Agnes and their eleven children.

During [[Father Rale's War]], Broussard participated in a raid on [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia]] (1724).&lt;ref&gt;James Laxer, ''The Acadians: In Search of a Homeland,'' Anchor Canada Press, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

===King George's War===
During [[King George's War]], under the leadership of French priest [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], Broussard began actively resisting the British occupation of Acadia. Broussard's forces often included [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] allies in their resistance against the British. In 1747 he participated in and was later charged for his involvement with the [[Battle of Grand Pré]]. (see [[History of the Acadians]])&lt;ref name="www2.umoncton.ca"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www2.umoncton.ca/cfdocs/etudacad/1755/index.cfm?id=010505000&amp;lang=en&amp;style=G&amp;admin=false&amp;linking=| title =History:1755-Joseph Broussard dit Beausoleil (c. 1702-1765)| accessdate =2009-03-14| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090520171929/http://www2.umoncton.ca/cfdocs/etudacad/1755/index.cfm?id=010505000&amp;lang=en&amp;style=G&amp;admin=false&amp;linking=| archivedate =2009-05-20| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/documentsrelativ10brod#page/155/mode/1up p. 155]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father Le Loutre's War===
During [[Father Le Loutre's War]], after the construction of [[Fort Beausejour]] in 1751, Broussard joined [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]] at Beausejour. In an effort to stop the British movement into Acadia, in 1749 Broussard was involved in one of the first raids on [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] which resulted in the deaths of five British settlers.&lt;ref&gt;John Grenier (2008). The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. p.150&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Broussard was in the [[Battle at Chignecto]] and then shortly afterward he led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the [[Raid on Dartmouth (1751)|"Dartmouth Massacre"]] (1751). Broussard and the others killed twenty British civilians and took more prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;John Grenier (2008). The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. p.160&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwallis temporarily abandoned plans to settle Dartmouth.&lt;ref&gt;John Grenier (2008). The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown.  They arrived in mid-May and in the night opened fired on the village.  Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Marshall. Heroes of the Acadian Resistance. Formac. 2011. p. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaptureOfAlcideAndLys.jpg|thumb|right| [[Action of 8 June 1755|Capture of French ships Alcide and Lys]] off Newfoundland. The ships were carrying war supplies for Acadians and Mi'kmaq]]
In the [[Action of 8 June 1755]], a naval battle off [[Cape Race]], Newfoundland, on board the French ships Alcide and Lys were found 10,000 scalping knives for Acadians and Indians serving under Chief [[Jean-Baptiste Cope]] and Acadian Beausoleil as they continue to fight Father Le Loutre's War.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Raddall. Halifax: Warden of the North. Nimbus. 1993. (originally 1948)p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Broussard was also active in the fight against Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Monckton]] in the [[Battle of Beausejour]].&lt;ref&gt;John Grenier (2008). The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

===French and Indian War===
With Le Loutre imprisoned after the [[Battle of Beausejour]], Broussard became the leader of an armed resistance during the [[expulsion of the Acadians]] (1755&amp;ndash;1764), leading assaults against the British on several occasions between 1755 and 1758 as part of the forces of [[Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot]].&lt;ref name="www2.umoncton.ca"/&gt;
After arming a ship in 1758, Broussard traveled through the upper [[Bay of Fundy]] region, where he attacked the British. His ship was seized in November 1758. He was then forced to flee, travelling first to the [[Miramichi Valley|Miramichi]] and later imprisoned at [[Fort Edward (Nova Scotia)|Fort Edward]] in 1762. Finally, he was transferred and imprisoned with other Acadians in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

===Arrival at Louisiana===
Released in 1764, the year after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Broussard left Nova Scotia, along with his family and hundreds of other Acadians, to [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day Haiti).&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard. "Cajuns and their Acadian ancestors: a young reader's history", 2008, University Press of Mississippi, p. 31, {{ISBN|978-1-934110-78-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to adapt to the climate and diseases that was killing Acadians, he led the group to settle in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Pincombe and E. W. Larracy, ''Resurgo: The History of Moncton, Volume 1'', 1990, Moncton, p. 30 {{fv|date=July 2015}} {{ISBN|0969463405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was among the first 200 [[Acadians]] to arrive in Louisiana on February 27, 1765, aboard the ''Santo Domingo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm "Broussard named for early settler Valsin Broussard"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521212233/http://www.carencrohighschool.org/LA_Studies/ParishSeries/LafayetteParish/Broussard.htm |date=2009-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 1765, he was appointed militia captain and commander of the "Acadians of the [[Atakapa]]s" the area around present-day St. Martinville, La.&lt;ref name="www2.umoncton.ca"/&gt; Not long after his arrival, Joseph Broussard died near what is now [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]] at the presumed age of 63. The exact date of his death is unknown, but it is assumed to have been on or about October 20, 1765. Many of his descendants live in southern Louisiana and Nova Scotia.

==Descendancy==
Broussard's 21st-century descendants include [[Tina Knowles|Célestine "Tina" Knowles]] ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Beyincé), her two daughters [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] and [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], and also her four grandchildren Jules, Blue, Sir, and Rumi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/a-peek-into-blue-ivy-cart_b_1200346.html |title=A Peek into Blue Ivy Carter's Past |first= |last= |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern cultural references==
The [[Cajun music]] group [[BeauSoleil]] is named after him.

A New Brunswick group "Beausoleil Broussard" was very popular in the 1970s.

He is a character in the novel ''Banished from Our Home: The Acadian Diary of Angelique Richard, Grand-Pre, Acadia, 1755'' (2004) by Sharon Stewart. 

A dramatized, historically inaccurate version of Beausoleil is featured in the Acadian novel ''Pélagie-la-Charette,'' by Antonine Maillet.

Part of his militant Acadian hero story is told in the documentary feature "Zachary Richard, Cajun Heart" by Acadian director Phil Comeau.

'''Larry Clinton Brewer''' (November 22, 1948 &amp;ndash; May 23, 2003) was the offensive end for the [[Louisiana Tech University]] Bulldogs during the 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969 [[American football|football]] seasons.

==Football career==

In 1968 and 1969, he served as one of two main receivers for [[Terry Bradshaw]], the [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] native who subsequently embarked on a highly successful career with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Brewer caught the first college touchdown pass thrown by Bradshaw. Brewer was initially given a two-year contract with the [[Atlanta Falcons]], but he left the team after sustaining an injury at the [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]] in [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], [[Tennessee]].
 
In 1969, Brewer was among five members of the Louisiana Tech football team selected for All-Gulf State Conference honors by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. The others were Bradshaw, [[split end]] [[Tommy Spinks|Thomas Allen "Tommy" Spinks]] of Shreveport and later [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Texas]], [[offensive tackle]] Wayne Williams, Jr., later the [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]] school superintendent, and [[defensive back]] Mark Graham.  Brewer and Spinks were recorded among the top pass receivers in Louisiana Tech history. Seven other Tech players were cited for "honorable mention" by the same sports writers, who also selected Tech [[coach (sport)|coach]] [[Maxie Lambright]] as the GSC "Coach of the Year".

Brewer played in four post-season classics, including two [[Grantland Rice Bowl]]s, the [[North-South Shrine Game]], and the [[Senior Bowl]] in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]. He was voted Minden's "Outstanding Advertiser" a month before "Larry Brewer Day" was observed in his hometown on May 14, 1970.&lt;ref name&gt;''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', April 16, 1970, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Brewer was born in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] to the former Helen Lockhart (1924-2018), a former civil servant originally from [[Ringgold, Louisiana|Ringgold]] in [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville Parish]],&lt;ref name=helenbrewer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-herald.com/helen-lockhart-brewer/|title=Helen Lockhart Brewer|publisher=''The Minden Press-Herald''|date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry Clinton "Clint" Brewer (1920–2008), a graduate of Doyline High School in [[Doyline, Louisiana|Doyline]] in south Webster Parish. The senior Brewer attended [[United Methodist]]-affiliated [[Centenary College of Louisiana|Centenary College]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], compiled a distinguished military record in [[World War II]], was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Louisiana National Guard]], and served as the Webster Parish registrar of voters until his retirement in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwlanews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9798&amp;Itemid=33&lt;/ref&gt;

He procured his bachelor's degree from Tech, located in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]], and then coached football at several private schools including Trinity Heights Academy in Shreveport and [[Sam Barthe School for Boys]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish]]. Brewer also taught junior high school science at Barthe. His first wife, Nancy, taught mathematics at the same school. Brewer subsequently left coaching and received a [[Master of Science]] degree from the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] in [[Ouachita Parish]] and thereafter passed the [[Certified Public Accountant]] examination. He was a hospital administrator in Ruston, Shreveport, and later for the Hillcrest Health Group in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]].

'''Life''' is a characteristic that distinguishes [[physical body|physical entities]] that have [[biological process]]es, such as [[Cell signaling|signaling]] and [[self-sustainability|self-sustaining]] processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have [[Death|died]]), or because they never had such functions and are classified as [[wikt:inanimate|inanimate]]. Various forms of life exist, such as [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, or potential [[Synthetic biology#Synthetic life|synthetic life]] as "living". [[Biology]] is the science concerned with the study of life.

The definition of life is controversial. The current definition is that [[organism]]s are [[Open system (thermodynamics)|open systems]] that maintain [[homeostasis]], are composed of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], have a [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], undergo [[metabolism]], can [[cell growth|grow]], [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment, respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduction|reproduce]] and [[Evolution|evolve]]. However, several other biological definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of life, such as viruses or viroids. In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by "life" through obsolete concepts such as [[odic force]], [[hylomorphism]], [[spontaneous generation]] and [[vitalism]], that have now been disproved by [[Biological research|biological discoveries]]. [[Abiogenesis]] describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple [[organic compounds]]. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core [[chemical element]]s to sustain [[biochemical]] functions.

Life on Earth [[Earliest known life forms|first appeared]] as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20170301" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4.3b oldest" /&gt; Earth's current life may have descended from an [[RNA world]], although [[RNA]]-based life may not have been the first. The mechanism by which [[abiogenesis|life began on Earth]] is unknown, though many hypotheses have been formulated and are often based on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]]. The [[earliest known life forms]] are microfossils of bacteria. 3.45 billion year old [[Australia]]n rocks are reported to have contained [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="WU-20171218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Kelly April |title=Oldest fossils ever found show life on Earth began before 3.5 billion years ago |url=https://news.wisc.edu/oldest-fossils-ever-found-show-life-on-earth-began-before-3-5-billion-years-ago/ |date=18 December 2017 |website=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |accessdate=18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schopf |first1=J.

Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a [[geologic time scale]]. To survive in most [[ecosystem]]s, life must often adapt to a wide range of conditions. Some microorganisms, called [[extremophile]]s, thrive in physically or geochemically [[extreme environment]]s that are detrimental to most other life on Earth. [[Aristotle]] was the first person to [[taxonomy (biology)|classify]] organisms. Later, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced [[Linnean taxonomy|his system]] of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of [[species]]. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14425949/Cell-The-Fundamental-Unit-of-Life Chapter-5, The Fundamental Unit of Life]. Monika Mehan. Scribd.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two kinds of cells, [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], both of which consist of [[cytoplasm]] enclosed within a [[membrane]] and contain many [[biomolecules]] such as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acid]]s. Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]], in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.

Though currently only known on [[Earth]], life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. [[Artificial life]] is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all [[Biological process|biological functions]] which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. [[Extinction]] is the process by which an entire group or [[taxon]], normally a [[species]], dies out. [[Fossil]]s are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms.

[[File:Characteristics of life.svg|thumb|The characteristics of life]]
Since there is no unequivocal definition of life, most current definitions in biology are descriptive. Life is considered a characteristic of something that preserves, furthers or reinforces its existence in the given environment.

# '''[[Homeostasis]]''': regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature
# '''[[Biological organization|Organization]]''': being structurally composed of one or more [[cell (biology)|cells]]&amp;nbsp;– the basic units of life
# '''[[Metabolism]]''': transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components ([[anabolism]]) and decomposing organic matter ([[catabolism]]). Living things require [[bioenergetics|energy]] to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life.
# '''[[Cell growth|Growth]]''': maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.
# '''[[Adaptation]]''': the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of [[evolution]] and is determined by the organism's [[heredity]], diet, and external factors.
# '''Response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]''': a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a [[unicellular organism]] to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of [[multicellular organisms]]. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun ([[phototropism]]), and [[chemotaxis]].
# '''[[Reproduction]]''': the ability to produce new individual organisms, either [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from a single parent organism or [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] from two parent organisms.

These complex processes, called [[Physiology|physiological functions]], have underlying physical and chemical bases, as well as [[Signalling (biology)|signaling and control mechanisms]] that are essential to maintaining life.

Whether or not viruses should be considered as alive is controversial. They are most often considered as just [[DNA replication|replicators]] rather than forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Are viruses alive?

However, viruses do not metabolize and they require a host cell to make new products.

===Biophysics===
To reflect the minimum phenomena required, other biological definitions of life have been proposed,&lt;ref name="Popa-2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popa |first=Radu |title=Between Necessity and Probability: Searching for the Definition and Origin of Life (Advances in Astrobiology and Biogeophysics) |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |date=March 2004 |isbn=978-3-540-20490-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many of these being based upon chemical [[system]]s. [[Biophysics|Biophysicists]] have commented that living things function on [[negentropy|negative entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0-521-42708-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-520-22021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, living processes can be viewed as a delay of the spontaneous [[diffusion]] or [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] of the internal energy of biological [[molecules]] towards more potential [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]].&lt;ref name="Definitions 2009"/&gt; In more detail, according to physicists such as [[John Desmond Bernal|John Bernal]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Eugene Wigner]], and [[John Scales Avery|John Avery]], life is a member of the class of phenomena that are [[Open system (systems theory)|open]] or continuous systems able to decrease their internal [[entropy and life|entropy]] at the expense of substances or [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] taken in from the environment and subsequently rejected in a degraded form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia&amp;nbsp;– a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-286218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-238-399-0 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living systems theories===
Living systems are open [[self-organization|self-organizing]] living things that interact with their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]], and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |authorlink= |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=8 October 2007 |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=}}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and [[Biology|biological sciences]] and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gaia hypothesis====
{{main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist [[James Hutton]]. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be [[physiology]]. Hutton is considered the father of geology, but his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense [[reductionism]] of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= |isbn=978-0-19-286030-9 |location= |page= |pages= |quote=|author-link=James Lovelock |via= |first1=James |last1=Lovelock}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|10}} The Gaia hypothesis, proposed in the 1960s by scientist [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lovelock |first1=J.

====Nonfractionability====
The first attempt at a general [[living systems]] theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist [[James Grier Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |author2=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82421-7 |date=8 October 2007}} Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory."...&amp;nbsp;"Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] (1991) built on this by defining a system component as "a unit of organization; a part with a function, i.e., a definite relation between part and whole." From this and other starting concepts, he developed a "relational theory of systems" that attempts to explain the special properties of life. Specifically, he identified the "nonfractionability of components in an organism" as the fundamental difference between living systems and "biological machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life |first1=Rosen |last1=Robert |date=November 1991 |isbn=978-0-231-07565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life as a property of ecosystems====
A systems view of life treats environmental [[flux]]es and biological fluxes together as a "reciprocity of influence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm |title=The Ecosystemic Life Hypothesis |last=Fiscus |first=Daniel A. |date=April 2002 |website= |publisher=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806015449/http://www.calresco.org/fiscus/esl.htm|archive-date=6 August 2009|dead-url=yes |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reciprocal relation with environment is arguably as important for understanding life as it is for understanding ecosystems. As [[Harold J. Morowitz]] (1992) explains it, life is a property of an [[ecosystem|ecological system]] rather than a single organism or species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morowitz |first1=Harold J. |date=1992 |title=Beginnings of cellular life: metabolism recapitulates biogenesis |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-05483-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905030901/https://books.google.com/books?id=CmQDSHN_UrIC |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that an ecosystemic definition of life is preferable to a strictly [[biochemical]] or physical one. [[Robert Ulanowicz]] (2009) highlights mutualism as the key to understand the systemic, order-generating behavior of life and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert W. |last1=Ulanowicz |first2=Robert E. |last2=Ulanowicz |title=A third window: natural life beyond Newton and Darwin |publisher=Templeton Foundation Press |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-59947-154-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903180028/https://books.google.com/books?id=gAQKAQAAMAAJ |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex systems biology====
{{main|Complex systems biology}}{{See also|Mathematical biology}}
Complex systems biology (CSB) is a field of science that studies the emergence of complexity in functional organisms from the viewpoint of [[dynamic systems]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baianu |first1=I. C. |date=2006 |title=Robert Rosen's Work and Complex Systems Biology |url= |journal=Axiomathes |volume=16 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–34 |doi=10.1007/s10516-005-4204-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is also often called [[systems biology]] and aims to understand the most fundamental aspects of life. A closely related approach to CSB and systems biology called relational biology is concerned mainly with understanding life processes in terms of the most important relations, and categories of such relations among the essential functional components of organisms; for multicellular organisms, this has been defined as "categorical biology", or a model representation of organisms as a [[category theory]] of biological relations, as well as an [[algebraic topology]] of the [[functional organization]] of living organisms in terms of their dynamic, complex [[Biological network|networks]] of metabolic, genetic, and [[epigenetic]] processes and [[signaling pathway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958a |title=A Relational Theory of Biological Systems |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=245–60 |doi=10.1007/bf02478302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=R. |date=1958b |title=The Representation of Biological Systems from the Standpoint of the Theory of Categories |url= |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=317–41 |doi=10.1007/bf02477890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative but closely related approaches focus on the interdependance of constraints, where constraints can be either molecular, such as enzymes, or macroscopic, such as the geometry of a bone or of the vascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël |last2=Mossio |first2=Matteo |date=2015-05-07 |year= |title=Biological organisation as closure of constraints |url=https://www.academia.edu/11705712 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=372 |pages=179–91 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.02.029 |pmid=25752259 |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117143806/http://www.academia.edu/11705712/Biological_organisation_as_closure_of_constraints |archivedate=17 November 2017 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.701.3373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Darwinian dynamic====
It has also been argued that the evolution of order in living systems and certain physical systems obeys a common fundamental principle termed the Darwinian dynamic.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Darwinian Dynamic |volume=58 |issue=2 |author1=Harris Bernstein |author2=Henry C.

The underlying order-generating process was concluded to be basically similar for both types of systems.&lt;ref name="Harris Bernstein, Henry C. Byerly, Frederick A. Hopf, Richard A. Michod and G. Krishna Vemulapalli 185"/&gt;

====Operator theory====
Another systemic definition called the operator theory proposes that "life is a general term for the presence of the typical closures found in organisms; the typical closures are a membrane and an autocatalytic set in the cell"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Pursuit of Complexity: The Utility of Biodiversity from an Evolutionary Perspective |last=Jagers |first=Gerard |publisher=KNNV Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-90-5011-443-1 |location= |pages= |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an organism is any system with an organisation that complies with an operator type that is at least as complex as the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a Hierarchical Definition of Life, the Organism, and Death |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Explaining the Origin of Life is not Enough for a Definition of Life |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The role of logic and insight in the search for a definition of life |journal=J.

Some of the earliest theories of life were materialist, holding that all that exists is matter, and that life is merely a complex form or arrangement of matter. [[Empedocles]] (430 BC) argued that everything in the universe is made up of a combination of [[Classical element|four eternal "elements"]] or "roots of all": earth, water, air, and fire. All change is explained by the arrangement and rearrangement of these four elements. The various forms of life are caused by an appropriate mixture of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=4 March 2005 |title=Empedocles |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empedocles/ |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Democritus]] (460 BC) thought that the essential characteristic of life is having a [[soul]] (''psyche''). Like other ancient writers, he was attempting to explain what makes something a ''living'' thing. His explanation was that fiery atoms make a soul in exactly the same way atoms and void account for any other thing. He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.&lt;ref name=democritus&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Parry |date=25 August 2010 |title=Democritus |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#4 |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] materialism that originated in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher [[René Descartes]], who held that animals and humans were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in [[cell theory]] in biological science encouraged this view. The [[evolution]]ary theory of [[Charles Darwin]] (1859) is a mechanistic explanation for the origin of species by means of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul |last1=Thagard |title=The Cognitive Science of Science: Explanation, Discovery, and Conceptual Change |publisher=MIT Press |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-262-01728-2 |pages=204–05 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903184310/https://books.google.com/books?id=HrJIV19_nZYC&amp;pg=PA204 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hylomorphism===
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Soul#Aristotle|structure of the souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, according to [[Aristotle]]]]
Hylomorphism is a theory first expressed by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (322 BC). The application of hylomorphism to biology was important to Aristotle, and [[Aristotle's biology|biology is extensively covered in his extant writings]]. In this view, everything in the material universe has both matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''psyche'', Latin ''anima''). There are three kinds of souls: the ''vegetative soul'' of plants, which causes them to grow and decay and nourish themselves, but does not cause motion and sensation; the ''animal soul'', which causes animals to move and feel; and the ''rational soul'', which is the source of consciousness and reasoning, which (Aristotle believed) is found only in man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=On the Soul |last=Aristotle |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=Book II |nopp=y |chapter= |quote= |via=|title-link=On the Soul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each higher soul has all of the attributes of the lower ones. Aristotle believed that while matter can exist without form, form cannot exist without matter, and that therefore the soul cannot exist without the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Don |last1=Marietta |page=104 |title=Introduction to ancient philosophy |publisher=M.

This account is consistent with [[teleological]] explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence in terms of a prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past [[evolutionary history]] of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.&lt;ref name=stewert_williams2010&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Steve |last1=Stewart-Williams |date=2010 |title=Darwin, God and the meaning of life: how evolutionary theory undermines everything you thought you knew of life |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-76278-6 |pages=193–94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903134432/https://books.google.com/books?id=KBp69los_-oC&amp;pg=PA193 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spontaneous generation ===
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Spontaneous generation was the belief that living organisms can form without descent from similar organisms.

===Vitalism===
{{Main|Vitalism}}
Vitalism is the belief that the life-principle is non-material. This originated with [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] (17th century), and remained popular until the middle of the 19th century. It appealed to philosophers such as [[Henri Bergson]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sanford |last1=Schwartz |title=C. S.

This was disproved in 1828, when [[Friedrich Wöhler]] prepared [[urea]] from inorganic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ueber künstliche Bildung des Harnstoffs |author=[[Friedrich Wöhler]] |journal=[[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=253–56 |date=1828 |doi=10.1002/andp.18280880206 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15097k/f261.chemindefer |bibcode=1828AnP....88..253W |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110094705/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15097k/f261.chemindefer |archivedate=10 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Wöhler synthesis]] is considered the starting point of modern [[organic chemistry]]. It is of historical significance because for the first time an [[organic compound]] was produced in [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;

During the 1850s, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], anticipated by [[Julius Robert von Mayer]], demonstrated that no energy is lost in muscle movement, suggesting that there were no "vital forces" necessary to move a muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Anson |last1=Rabinbach |title=The Human Motor: Energy, Fatigue, and the Origins of Modernity |publisher=University of California Press |date=1992 |isbn=978-0-520-07827-7 |pages=124–25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5ZBNv-zTlQC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904175414/https://books.google.com/books?id=e5ZBNv-zTlQC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124 |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results led to the abandonment of scientific interest in vitalistic theories, although the belief lingered on in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] theories such as [[homeopathy]], which interprets diseases and sickness as caused by disturbances in a hypothetical vital force or life force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/homeop.html |title=NCAHF Position Paper on Homeopathy |last= |first= |date=February 1994 |website= |publisher=National Council Against Health Fraud |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, reflecting their [[common descent]]; based on these observations, hypotheses on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a [[universal common ancestor]], from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to [[protocell]]s and metabolism. Models have been divided into "genes-first" and "metabolism-first" categories, but a recent trend is the emergence of hybrid models that combine both categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coveney |first1=Peter V. |first2=Philip W. |last2=Fowler |title=Modelling biological complexity: a physical scientist's perspective |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=2005 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=267–80 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0045|pmc=1578273 |pmid=16849185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no current [[scientific consensus]] as to how life originated. However, most accepted scientific models build on the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and the work of [[Sidney W. Fox|Sidney Fox]], which show that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesize [[amino acid]]s and other organic compounds from inorganic precursors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |title=Habitability and Biology: What are the Properties of Life? |accessdate=6 June 2013 |website=Phoenix Mars Mission |publisher=The University of Arizona |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417155949/http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/mars145.php |archivedate=17 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phospholipid]]s spontaneously form [[lipid bilayer]]s, the basic structure of a [[cell membrane]].

Living organisms synthesize [[proteins]], which are [[polymer]]s of amino acids using instructions encoded by [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA). [[Protein synthesis]] entails intermediary [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Senapathy |first1=Periannan |authorlink=Periannan Senapathy |title=Independent birth of organisms |location=Madison, Wisconsin |publisher=Genome Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-9641304-0-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905095531/https://books.google.com/books?id=3hJFAQAAIAAJ |archivedate=5 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative being that proteins came first and then genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |first2=Ruthild |last2=Winkler |title=Steps towards life: a perspective on evolution (German edition, 1987) |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1992 |page=31 |isbn=978-0-19-854751-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Steps_towards_life.html?id=R7QTAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because genes and proteins are both required to produce the other, the problem of considering which came first is like that of the [[chicken or the egg]]. Most scientists have adopted the hypothesis that because of this, it is unlikely that genes and proteins arose independently.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/05/13/how-rna-got-started-scientists-examine-the-origins-of-life |title=How RNA Got Started: Scientists Look for the Origins of Life |last=Barazesh |first=Solmaz |date=13 May 2009 |work=U.

Therefore, a possibility, first suggested by [[Francis Crick]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James D. |title=Prologue: early speculations and facts about RNA templates |pages=xv–xxiii |work=The RNA World | editor1-first=R.

This is called the [[RNA world hypothesis]], and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that [[Evolution|evolve]] the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Acetyl-CoA]], [[NADH]], etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them. The catalytic properties of RNA had not yet been demonstrated when the hypothesis was first proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Walter |last1=Gilbert |title=Origin of life: The RNA world |journal=Nature |volume=319 |issue=618 |date=20 February 1986 |doi=10.1038/319618a0 |bibcode=1986Natur.319..618G |page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were confirmed by [[Thomas Cech]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=Thomas R. |title=A model for the RNA-catalyzed replication of RNA |pages=4360–63 |volume=83 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA |date=1986 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/83/12/4360.abstract |accessdate=25 May 2012 |issue=12 |bibcode=1986PNAS...83.4360C |doi=10.1073/pnas.83.12.4360 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904000612/http://www.pnas.org/content/83/12/4360.abstract |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |pmc=323732 |pmid=2424025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue with the RNA world hypothesis is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One reason for this is that RNA precursors are very stable and react with each other very slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA.&lt;ref name=Cech&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=T.R. |date=2011 |title=The RNA Worlds in Context |url= |journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol |volume=4 |issue=7 |page= |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006742 |pmid=21441585 |pages=a006742 |pmc=3385955}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under the conditions that existed prior to life on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in a specified order with the precursor [[phosphate]] present throughout the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powner |first1=Matthew W. |first2=Béatrice |last2=Gerland |first3=John D. |last3=Sutherland |title=Synthesis of activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides in prebiotically plausible conditions |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=239–42 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/nature08013 |pmid=19444213 |bibcode=2009Natur.459..239P |issue=7244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study makes the RNA world hypothesis more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=Jack W. |title=Origins of life: Systems chemistry on early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=459 |pages=171–72 |date=14 May 2009 |doi=10.1038/459171a |bibcode=2009Natur.459..171S |issue=7244 |pmid=19444196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter is a component of the amino acids [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]]. The most biologically abundant of these elements is carbon, which has the desirable attribute of forming multiple, stable [[covalent bond]]s.

====DNA====
{{Main|DNA}}
Deoxyribonucleic acid is a [[molecule]] that carries most of the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and [[reproduction]] of all known living [[organism]]s and many viruses. DNA and [[RNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; alongside [[protein]]s and [[Polysaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], they are one of the three major types of [[macromolecules|macromolecule]] that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two [[biopolymer]] strands coiled around each other to form a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]]. The two DNA strands are known as [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of [[monomer|simpler units]] called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna |title=DNA |date=5 February 2016 |website=Basic Biology |publisher= |access-date=15 November 2016 |last1=Purcell |first1=Adam |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/ |archivedate=5 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of a [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]—either [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), [[adenine]] (A), or [[thymine]] (T)—as well as a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]] and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. According to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T, and C with G), [[hydrogen bond]]s bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA [[base pair]]s on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718153742/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |archivedate=18 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;

DNA stores biological information. The DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage, and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. Biological information is replicated as the two strands are separated. A significant portion of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. Under the [[genetic code]], [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins. These RNA strands are initially created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] (animals, plants, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Peter |title=iGenetics |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8053-4553-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s (bacteria and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dahm R |title=Discovering DNA: Friedrich Miescher and the early years of nucleic acid research |journal=Hum.

==Classification==
{{Main|Biological classification}}
{{Biological classification}}
Life is usually classified by eight levels of taxa—domains, kingdoms, phyla, class, order, family, genus, and species. In May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion [[species]] are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.&lt;ref name="NSF-2016002" /&gt;

The first known attempt to classify organisms was conducted by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who classified all living organisms known at that time as either a plant or an animal, based mainly on their ability to move. He also distinguished animals with blood from animals without blood (or at least without red blood), which can be compared with the concepts of [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s respectively, and divided the blooded animals into five groups: viviparous quadrupeds ([[mammal]]s), oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and [[amphibian]]s), birds, fishes and [[Cetacea|whales]]. The bloodless animals were also divided into five groups: [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects (which included the spiders, [[scorpion]]s, and [[centipede]]s, in addition to what we define as insects today), shelled animals (such as most [[mollusc]]s and [[echinoderm]]s), and "[[zoophyte]]s" (animals that resemble plants). Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|title=Aristotle|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|via=|accessdate=15 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120124920/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploration of the Americas revealed large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced and was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. In the late 1740s, [[Carl Linnaeus]] introduced his system of [[binomial nomenclature]] for the classification of species. Linnaeus attempted to improve the composition and reduce the length of the previously used many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetoric, introducing new descriptive terms and precisely defining their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Knapp S, Lamas G, Lughadha EN, Novarino G |title=Stability or stasis in the names of organisms: the evolving codes of nomenclature |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B]] |volume=359 |issue=1444 |pages=611–22 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15253348 |pmc=1693349 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1445 |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=0962-8436&amp;volume=359&amp;issue=1444&amp;spage=611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fungi were originally treated as plants. For a short period Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon [[Vermes]] in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. [[Herbert Copeland|Copeland]] classified the Fungi in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Kingdoms of Organisms |journal=Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=13|issue=4 |doi=10.1086/394568 |year=1938 |page=383 | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Herbert F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was eventually solved by [[Robert Whittaker|Whittaker]], when he gave them their own [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] in his [[five-kingdom system]]. [[Evolutionary history of life|Evolutionary history]] shows that the fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Whittaker |first1=R.

As new discoveries enabled detailed study of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and microorganisms, new groups of life were revealed, and the fields of [[cell biology]] and [[microbiology]] were created. These new organisms were originally described separately in [[protozoa]] as animals and [[thallophyte|protophyta/thallophyta]] as plants, but were united by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]] in the kingdom [[Protista]]; later, the [[prokaryote]]s were split off in the kingdom [[Monera]], which would eventually be divided into two separate groups, the Bacteria and the [[Archaea]]. This led to the [[six-kingdom system]] and eventually to the current [[three-domain system]], which is based on evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="Woese1990"/&gt; However, the classification of eukaryotes, especially of protists, is still controversial.&lt;ref name="Adl 05"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Adl SM, Simpson AG, Farmer MA, etal |title=The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists |journal=J.

As microbiology, [[molecular biology]] and [[virology]] developed, non-cellular reproducing agents were discovered, such as viruses and [[viroid]]s. Whether these are considered alive has been a matter of debate; viruses lack characteristics of life such as cell membranes, metabolism and the ability to grow or respond to their environments. Viruses can still be classed into "species" based on their biology and [[genetics]], but many aspects of such a classification remain controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Van Regenmortel MH |title=Virus species and virus identification: past and current controversies |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=133–44 |date=January 2007 |pmid=16713373 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2006.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s a trend called [[cladistics]] emerged, arranging [[taxa]] based on [[clade]]s in an [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary or phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Taxonomy.

There are two primary types of cells. [[Prokaryote]]s lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s, although they have circular DNA and [[ribosome]]s. Bacteria and [[Archaea]] are two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the [[eukaryote]]s, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and [[vacuoles]]. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material.

The molecular mechanisms of [[cell biology]] are based on [[protein]]s.

Cells reproduce through a process of [[cell division]] in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs through a process of [[Fission (biology)|fission]] in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In [[eukaryote]]s, a more complex process of [[mitosis]] is followed. However, the end result is the same; the resulting cell copies are identical to each other and to the original cell (except for [[mutations]]), and both are capable of further division following an [[interphase]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joseph |last1=Panno |title=The Cell |series=Facts on File science library |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-8160-6736-7 |pages=60–70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904151747/https://books.google.com/books?id=sYgKY6zz20YC&amp;pg=PA60 |archivedate=4 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multicellular organism]]s may have first evolved through the formation of [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] of identical cells. These cells can form group organisms through [[cell adhesion]]. The individual members of a colony are capable of surviving on their own, whereas the members of a true multi-cellular organism have developed specializations, making them dependent on the remainder of the organism for survival. Such organisms are formed [[Clone (cell biology)|clonally]] or from a single [[germ cell]] that is capable of forming the various specialized cells that form the adult organism. This specialization allows multicellular organisms to exploit resources more efficiently than single cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Dennis |last2=Bray |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=James D. |last6=Watson |chapter=From Single Cells to Multicellular Organisms |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-8153-1620-6 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306165115/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, scientists reported that, [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|about 800 million years ago]], a [[Evolutionary developmental biology|minor genetic change]] in a single [[molecule]], called GK-PID, may have allowed [[organism]]s to go from a [[Unicellular organism|single cell organism]] to [[Multicellular organism|one of many cells]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20160107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Genetic Flip Helped Organisms Go From One Cell to Many |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |date=7 January 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=7 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107204432/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/science/genetic-flip-helped-organisms-go-from-one-cell-to-many.html |archivedate=7 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells have evolved methods to perceive and respond to their microenvironment, thereby enhancing their adaptability. [[Cell signaling]] coordinates cellular activities, and hence governs the basic functions of multicellular organisms. Signaling between cells can occur through direct cell contact using [[juxtacrine signalling]], or indirectly through the exchange of agents as in the [[endocrine system]]. In more complex organisms, coordination of activities can occur through a dedicated [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name=alberts2002&gt;{{cite book |display-authors=1 |first1=Bruce |last1=Alberts |first2=Alexander |last2=Johnson |first3=Julian |last3=Lewis |first4=Martin |last4=Raff |first5=Keith |last5=Roberts |first6=Peter |last6=Walter |chapter=General Principles of Cell Communication |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |date=2002 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |accessdate=12 June 2012 |isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904000612/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26813/ |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Solar System, the region around another [[main sequence|main-sequence star]] that could support Earth-like life on an Earth-like planet is known as the [[habitable zone]]. The inner and outer radii of this zone vary with the luminosity of the star, as does the time interval during which the zone survives. Stars more massive than the Sun have a larger habitable zone, but remain on the Sun-like "main sequence" of [[stellar evolution]] for a shorter time interval. Small [[red dwarf]]s have the opposite problem, with a smaller habitable zone that is subject to higher levels of magnetic activity and the effects of [[tidal locking]] from close orbits. Hence, stars in the intermediate mass range such as the Sun may have a greater likelihood for Earth-like life to develop.&lt;ref name=selis2006&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Frank |last1=Selis |date=2006 |chapter=Habitability: the point of view of an astronomer |title=Lectures in Astrobiology |volume=2 |editor1-first=Muriel |editor1-last=Gargaud |editor2-first=Hervé |editor2-last=Martin |editor3-first=Philippe |editor3-last=Claeys |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-33692-1 |pages=210–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903233938/https://books.google.com/books?id=3uYmP0K5PXEC&amp;pg=PA210 |archivedate=3 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the star within a galaxy may also affect the likelihood of life forming. Stars in regions with a greater abundance of heavier elements that can form planets, in combination with a low rate of potentially [[habitat]]-damaging [[supernova]] events, are predicted to have a higher probability of hosting planets with complex life.&lt;ref name=science303_5654_59&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lineweaver |first1=Charles H. |last2=Fenner |first2=Yeshe |last3=Gibson |first3=Brad K. |date=January 2004 |title=The Galactic Habitable Zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5654 |pages=59–62 |doi=10.1126/science.1092322 |bibcode=2004Sci...303...59L |pmid=14704421 |arxiv=astro-ph/0401024|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/704101 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variables of the [[Drake equation]] are used to discuss the conditions in planetary systems where civilization is most likely to exist.&lt;ref name=vakoch_harrison2011&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Douglas A. |last1=Vakoch |first2=Albert A. |last2=Harrison |title=Civilizations beyond Earth: extraterrestrial life and society |series=Berghahn Series |pages=37–41 |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BVJzsvqWip0C&amp;pg=PA37 |isbn=978-0-85745-211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the equation to predict the amount of extraterrestrial life, however, is difficult; because many of the variables are unknown, the equation functions as more of a mirror to what its user already thinks. As a result, the number of civilizations in the galaxy can be estimated as low as 9.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; or as high as 156 million; for the calculations, see [[Drake equation#Range of results|Drake equation]].

==Artificial==
{{main|Artificial life |Synthetic biology}}
Artificial life is the [[simulation]] of any aspect of life, as through computers, [[robotics]], or [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial--life|title=Artificial life|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=|access-date=15 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116021041/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial--life|archivedate=16 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of artificial life imitates traditional biology by recreating some aspects of biological phenomena. Scientists study the logic of living systems by creating artificial environments—seeking to understand the complex information processing that defines such systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While life is, by definition, alive, artificial life is generally referred to as data confined to a [[Digital data|digital]] environment and existence.

[[Synthetic biology]] is a new area of [[biotechnology]] that combines science and [[biological engineering]]. The common goal is the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Synthetic biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of [[biotechnology]], with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=6 |last=Chopra |first=Paras |author2=Akhil Kamma |title=Engineering life through Synthetic Biology |journal=In Silico Biology |accessdate=9 June 2008 |url=http://www.bioinfo.de/isb/2006/06/0038/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805175817/http://www.bioinfo.de/isb/2006/06/0038/ |archivedate=5 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{Main|Death}}
[[File:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004.JPG|right|thumb|Animal corpses, like this [[African buffalo]], are recycled by the [[ecosystem]], providing energy and nutrients for living creatures]]
Death is the permanent termination of all vital functions or life processes in an organism or cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Definition of death |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861602899/death.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwsdvU8f?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861602899/death.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=define_death&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of death |website=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |url=http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html |accessdate=25 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203141750/http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Definitions-of-Death.html |archivedate=3 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur as a result of an accident, [[medical condition]]s, [[biological interaction]], [[malnutrition]], [[poison]]ing, [[senescence]], or suicide. After death, the remains of an organism re-enter the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Organisms may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]] and leftover [[organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms that recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]].

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins.&lt;ref name=define_death/&gt; However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071129/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |archivedate=1 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines between life and death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of [[afterlife]] or [[reincarnation]] for the [[soul]], or [[resurrection]] of the body at a later date.

===Extinction===
{{Main|Extinction}}
Extinction is the process by which a group of [[taxa]] or [[species]] dies out, reducing biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Extinction&amp;nbsp;– definition |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwseRB80?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861609974/extinction.html |archivedate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment of extinction is generally considered the death of the last individual of that species. Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively after a period of apparent absence. Species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing [[habitat]] or against superior competition. In [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], over 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Triassic/extinction.htm |title=What is an extinction? |website=Late Triassic |publisher=Bristol University |accessdate=27 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901011807/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/palaeofiles/triassic/extinction.htm |archivedate=1 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Kunin, W.E. |editor2=Gaston, Kevin |title=The Biology of Rarity: Causes and consequences of rare—common differences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=31 December 1996 |isbn=978-0-412-63380-5 |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905164104/https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

===Fossils===
{{Main|Fossils}}
Fossils are the preserved remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. The totality of fossils, both discovered and undiscovered, and their placement in fossil-containing [[rock (geology)|rock]] formations and [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] layers ([[stratum|strata]]) is known as the ''fossil record''. A preserved specimen is called a fossil if it is older than the arbitrary date of 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|accessdate=25 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510101706/http://sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/resources/frequent/|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, fossils range in age from the youngest at the start of the [[Holocene]] Epoch to the oldest from the [[Archean|Archaean]] Eon, up to 3.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brian |last1=Vastag |title=Oldest 'microfossils' raise hopes for life on Mars |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019000458/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-microfossils-hail-from-34-billion-years-ago-raise-hopes-for-life-on-mars/2011/08/19/gIQAHK8UUJ_story.html?hpid=z3 |archivedate=19 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Geological Team Lays Claim to Oldest Known Fossils |date=21 August 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501085118/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/science/earth/22fossil.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Food energy|Food consumption]] refers to the amount of [[food]] available for [[consumption (economics)|human consumption]] as estimated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] [[Food Balance Sheet]]s. However the actual food consumption may be lower than the quantity shown as food availability depending on the magnitude of [[food waste|wastage]] and losses of food in the [[household]], e.g. during [[:wikt:storage|storage]], in [[Food preparation|preparation]] and [[cooking]], as plate-waste or quantities fed to [[domestic animal]]s and [[pet]]s, thrown or given away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/food-security-statistics/food-security-statistics-metadata/en/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728161332/http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/food-security-statistics/food-security-statistics-metadata/en/# |archive-date=2010-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]], the average minimum daily energy requirement is about {{convert|1800|kcal}} per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/#jfmulticontent_c130584-2 |title=Hunger Portal |publisher=FAO |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle deaths]] in Japan by year'''

This is a list of [[motor vehicle]] deaths in [[Japan]] by year. Deaths are currently defined by those who die within 30 days of the date of the accident, but 1980 and before are one day accident deaths.  Fatalities reached a record high in 1970. The Index base year is 1989. (Index=100)

Per population, fatalities are 1/4 in 2008 of that of 1970, and per kilometer are one sixth in 2007 of the 1970 rate.  The total for 2012 was 4,411 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20130105b2.html |title=Fewest traffic deaths seen since '51 |publisher=The Japan Times |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2017 has dropped to 3,694 deaths, of this 2,020 involved a driver over aged 65 or 54.7% of the total, with sharply rising rates of deadly accident with each decade of driver age after 65.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/1174172/japans-annual-road-toll-lowest-since-1949&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 36% of deaths were pedestrians, 13% were bicyclists, alcohol related deaths were 1/3 at 213 less than a decade earlier, among a wealth of other [https://www.npa.go.jp/publications/statistics/koutsuu/H29siboumatome.pdf statistics].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34399">The [[Presidential Range]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]] consist of a series of mountains whose maximum elevation (the summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]]) reaches {{convert|6288|ft}}. This range represents some of the highest mountains in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]]. Fatalities in this area are dominated by those that occur on Mount Washington, the highest peak in the range. It is notorious for its unpredictable and inclement weather, making it one of the deadliest mountains in the [[continental United States]]. Due to its unique location relative to other geographic features, it holds the world record for highest recorded surface [[wind speed]] not within a tropical cyclone. The [[New Hampshire Fish and Game Department]] conducts an average of 180 rescues a year for hikers in need of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/safe/|title=Buy Your Voluntary Hike Safe Card {{!}} New Hampshire Fish and Game Department|last=Department|first=NH Fish and Game|website=www.wildlife.state.nh.us|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fatalities ==
The following table lists all known fatalities and missing persons within the Presidential Range. Many fatalities occur during spring, autumn and winter, particularly when the weather in the surrounding lower elevations is slightly above average for the season.

'''Manphibian''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It has some resemblance to the "[[Gill-man|Gill Man]]" seen in ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.

==Publication history==
{{unsourced section|date=October 2016}}
{{expand section|date=October 2016}}
Manphibian first appeared in ''Legion of Monsters'' #1 and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Tony Isabella]], [[Dave Cockrum]], and [[Sam Grainger]].

==Fictional character biography==
Manphibian's alien species did not suffer the delusional concept of fate. They did not reinvent such calamities in their own minds as a call to a righteous and vital missions like a hunt for revenge. They realized the true motive for such actions was to share their own pain with the world.&lt;ref name="Punisher #16"&gt;''Punisher'' Vol. 8 #16&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian's kind believed in a "Prime Mover" where they have not raised a hand against another of their kind for eons. This was until Manphibian's mate was murdered by someone from Manphibian's species. After being denied by his elders to deal with the murderer, Manphibian ended up pursuing the murderer into space. Manphibian's search took him across different planets until landing on Earth thousands of years ago. Many years later, oil drillers woke up the murderous member of Manphibian's race. When Manphibian arrived, he stopped the creature from attacking Beth Fox. Their fight lasted until a missile strike destroyed Shaft #27. Due to Beth Fox being traumatized, her husband Aaron Fox vowed revenge and started hunting both creatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Monsters'' #1/2&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian and his mate had multiple offsprings that were simultaneously trapped on Earth. Due to the death of his mate, Manphibian had to raise them on his own.&lt;ref name="Punisher #12"&gt;''Punisher'' Vol. 8 #12&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, Manphibian was recruited by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in order to be part of [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Manphibian was seen in Area 13's commissary alongside [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and Golem.&lt;ref&gt;''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Manphibian was with the Howling Commandos when they launched an assault on the forces of [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Deacon and [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] considered Manphibian as a possible candidate to fight [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 6 #33&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robert Hellsgard's Hunter of Monster Special Force began hunting down and slaughtering any being they deemed a monster, Manphibian joined up with the [[Legion of Monsters]] to defend those from being attacked by the Hunter of Monster Special Force. The Legion of Monsters led the survivors to the abandoned Morlock tunnels beneath Manhattan which had been a haven for monsters centuries earlier. The Legion of Monsters converted the haven into Monster Metropolis where it is feared to be the last stand against the Hunter of Monster Special Force.&lt;ref name="Punisher #11"&gt;''Punisher'' Vol. 8 #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian's children couldn't join Manphibian in Monster Metropolis as their bodies need clean water and the catacombs near Monster Metropolis have a short supply of clean water.&lt;ref name="Punisher #12"/&gt; After [[Punisher]] was slain by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s son [[Daken]], Manphibian was present when the Moloids brought Punisher's remains to [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]] who revived Punisher as a [[Frankenstein's monster]]-like creature called FrankenCastle. Manphibian stated that Punisher had been reborn wild as he cautions his fellow Legion of Monsters. It took the Legion of Monsters to subdue Punisher so that they can finish fixing his brain.&lt;ref name="Punisher #11"/&gt; Manphibian left Monster Metropolis to check up on his children and was captured by the Hunter of Monster Special Force. Manphibian was transported to the Hunter of Monster Special Force's base in the Alps where they tortured him to give up the location of Monster Metropolis. Robert Hellsgard tortured Manphibian, trying to get him to provide the location to the monster refuge; however, he resisted the torture.  Hellsgard finally showed him the corpses of Manphibian's children, stating that they had given up the location during their own torture session- his torture of Manphibian had been for his own perverse pleasure.&lt;ref name="Punisher #12"/&gt; Following the attack on Monster Metropolis, FrankenCastle raided the Hunter of Monster Special Force's base to rescue Manphibian and the other captive monsters. Robert Hellsgard engaged the Legion of Monsters where he used a buzzsaw on Manphibian's chest and blasted FrankenCastle in the face.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher'' Vol. 8 #15&lt;/ref&gt; Manphibian managed to get to his feet and rejoins the battle. When the group ends up transported to Limbo, Manphibian manages to haul Robert Hellsgard out of his body armor after he was knocked down. FrankenCastle stopped Manphibian from killing Hellsgard as revenge for the murder of his children. Manphibian stated that he is nothing like Robert Hellsgard and is above killing for petty vengeance. When the portal to Earth opened, FrankenCastle, Manphibian, and Morbius returned to Earth while leaving Robert Hellsgard in Limbo.  Hellsgard thanked FrankenCastle for his mercy, to which Castle sardonically replied, "Yeah, right... Mercy".&lt;ref name="Punisher #16"/&gt;

Back at Monster Metropolis, Manphibian was badly injured from the battle and was bandaged up. After FrankenCastle was healed, Manphibian led FrankenCastle to Monster Metropolis' cells where the captive members of the Hunter of Monster Special Force soldiers are being held and did not know what to do with them. As no court would prosecute them, Manphibian asked FrankenCastle what should be done with them. As FrankenCastle handed Manphibian a gun and walked away, Manphibian had no intent to use it on them. Following FrankenCastle's rampage in Tokyo, Manphibian was with the Legion of Monsters when it comes to helping [[Elsa Bloodstone]] lure FrankenCastle to Monster Island.&lt;ref&gt;''FrankenCastle'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian and Morbius heklped [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]] and [[Werewolf by Night]] capture the Dimensional Man. Elsa Bloodstone teleported into Monster Metropolis with a dead monster that was taken into custody. It was soon revealed that the dead monster was corrupted by a powerful force.&lt;ref&gt;''Legion of Monsters'' Vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] journeyed to Monster Metropolis, Manphibian helped Red Hulk and Werewolf by Night overcome panicked monsters in order to stop the ghost of [[Doc Samson]]'s bad side. Manphibian and the Legion of Monsters helped Red Hulk and [[Doctor Strange]] defeat the ghost of Doc Samson's bad side.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #52&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian joined the Legion of Monsters into evacuating Brownville so that Morbius can confront [[Rose (Marvel Comics)|Rose]] who is wielding a makeshift [[Ultimate Nullifier]]. Manphibian was the one who kept Morbius' friend Becky Barnes safe.&lt;ref&gt;''Morbius, the Living Vampire'' Vol. 2 #8&lt;/ref&gt; Following Morbius' wish that Becky Barnes would be kept safe, Manphibian carried Becky Barnes away from the wreckage to keep her safe.&lt;ref&gt;''Morbius, the Living Vampire'' Vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian was one of several beings (along with the [[Uncanny Avengers]]) captured by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] to appear in one of Mojo's films. He was paired up with [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, and [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]] as the Avengers of the Supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers Annual'' #1 (June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Manphibian appears as a member of [[S.T.A.K.E.]]'s [[Howling Commandos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Manphibian was with the Howling Commandos at the time when they help [[Old Man Logan]] rescue [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] from Dracula.&lt;ref&gt;''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==

'''Maria Elizabeth Ridulph''' (March 12, 1950 – c. December 1957) was an [[United States|American]] girl who disappeared on December 3, 1957 from a street corner in her neighborhood in [[Sycamore, Illinois]] when she was seven years old.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; She was last seen by a childhood friend in the company of an unknown man who appeared to be in his early twenties and called himself "Johnny". Nearly five months later, her remains were found in a wooded area near [[Woodbine, Illinois]], approximately 100 miles from her home.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=truerep&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Cause of Death Uncertain: Find Maria's Body on Wooded Hill |url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=STR19580429.2.6# |newspaper=[[True Republican]] |location=[[Sycamore, Illinois]] |date=April 29, 1958 |page=1 |via=Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections, [[University of Illinois]] Library |access-date=February 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case, well known in the [[Chicago area]], was widely reported as the oldest [[cold case]] murder in the United States to be solved when Jack McCullough, who under his former name John Tessier had been a neighbor of the Ridulph family, was wrongly convicted for her murder in September 2012.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=48hours&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Greg Fisher, Judy Rybak, and Peter Henderson (producers) |date=May 24, 2014 |year= |title=48 Hours Presents: Cold as Ice |trans-title= |medium=documentary |language=English |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-childhood-memory-help-solve-1957-murder-of-maria-ridulph/ |access-date=April 19, 2016 |format= |time= |location= |publisher=[[CBS News]] |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=Oldest cold case to go to trial in U.S. tests memories, forces family to expose deep, dark secrets in search of justice for murdered girl  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=illappctop /&gt;  However, in March 2016, the [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]] State's Attorney announced that a post-conviction review of available evidence showed McCullough could not have been present at the place and time of Maria Ridulph's likely abduction.&lt;ref name=oneill04222016&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Charges Dropped in 1957 Cold Case Murder |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/us/jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph-1957-cold-case/ |work=CNN |access-date=April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinkel&gt;{{cite news| last=Hinkel|first=Dan |date=March 25, 2016|title=Prosecutor Says Conviction in Cold Case Slaying of Girl, 7, Should Be Overturned|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-mcculough-conviction-overturn-20160325-story.html|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCullough was released from prison on April 15, 2016 and the charges against him were dismissed on April 22, 2016.&lt;ref name=oneill04152016&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 15, 2016 |title=Judge Overturns 1957 Cold Case Murder Conviction; Jack McCullough Goes Free |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/us/1957-cold-case-jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph/index.html|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ward04222016&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward |first=Clifford |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Charges Dismissed Against Jack McCullough in '57 slaying of Sycamore Girl|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-jack-mccullough-1957-sycamore-murder-hearing-20160422-story.html|accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCullough was declared innocent of the crime by the DeKalb County Circuit Court on April 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/04/12/mccullough041217-signed.pdf 2017 Circuit Court ruling]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/us/ridulph-mccullough-innocence-ruling/ CNN: Man wrongfully convicted in 1957 cold case murder declared innocent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Maria Ridulph was born on March 12, 1950, to Michael and Frances Ivy Ridulph in [[Sycamore, Illinois]]. She was the youngest of four children, and had two sisters and a brother. Although many residents lived or worked on farms in the area, her father Michael worked at one of Sycamore's few factories; her mother Frances was a homemaker. At the time she was abducted, Maria was 7 years old, 44 inches tall, and weighed 53 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes.&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt; She was an honor student, then in second grade. She also received awards for perfect [[Sunday school]] attendance at [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. John]].

According to her mother, Maria was high-strung. "My daughter was a nervous girl and if she got in any trouble would become hysterical," Frances said in a 1957 interview shortly after Maria disappeared. "Someone would probably have to kill her to keep her quiet. I am the only one who could calm her down." Maria was also described as a "screamer" and afraid of the dark. Her best friend was 8-year-old Kathy Sigman, who lived on the same street as the Ridulphs.&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;

==Crime==
On the evening of December 3, 1957, Maria begged to be allowed to go outside as it had started to snow. After finishing dinner, Maria and Kathy Sigman went outside in the dark (as the sun had set) near Maria's house and played a game they called "duck the cars", running back and forth trying to avoid the headlights of oncoming cars in the street. According to Kathy, they were approached by a man, whom Kathy later described to police as in his early 20s and tall with a slender chin, light hair, a gap in his teeth, and wearing a colorful sweater. The man, who said his name was "Johnny", told the girls that he was 24 and not married. He asked if they liked dolls and if they liked [[piggyback (transportation)|piggyback rides]]. He gave Maria a piggyback ride, after which she went back to her house and got a doll to show him. After Maria returned, Kathy ran back to her house to get her mittens, leaving Maria alone with the man. When Kathy returned, Maria and the man were gone.&lt;ref name=takench1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/us/oldest-cold-case/index.html|title=Taken: Chapter 1: A Child Vanishes|last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=August 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_1957_KILLING_WAOL-?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-04-15-13-54-17|title=Man Wrongly Convicted in 1957 Illinois Murder is Released|last=Tarm|first=Michael|date=April 15, 2016|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathy went to the Ridulph house to tell them she couldn't find Maria. The family initially thought Maria was hiding, and sent Maria's 11-year-old brother to look for her. After he was unable to find her, the Ridulphs called the police, and within an hour, police and armed civilians began a search of the town, but failed to locate Maria or "Johnny", the man with whom she was last seen. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), presuming that Maria might have been abducted across state lines (a [[Federal Kidnapping Act|federal crime]]), arrived in Sycamore within two days to help the local and state police in the search. The FBI and police interviewed numerous witnesses who had seen the two girls playing without any other person present between 6 pm and 6:30 pm, and also spoke to family members who had seen or spoken with Maria and Kathy in the course of Maria getting her doll, Kathy getting her mittens, and Kathy reporting Maria's disappearance to the Ridulphs. Based on these interviews, "Johnny" was thought to have approached the girls after 6:30 pm, and the FBI concluded that Maria was abducted between 6:45 and 7 pm.&lt;ref name=schmack032416 /&gt;

[[File:John_Tessier_(Jack_McCullough),_circa_1955,_yearbook_photo.jpg|thumb|left|John Tessier in high school c. 1955, at the time he lived with his family near the Ridulph home.]]
Kathy Sigman was the only witness who had seen "Johnny" and was placed in [[protective custody]], as the police and FBI feared that the kidnapper would come back and harm her. The authorities had her look at photos of convicted felons or suspects who bore a resemblance to "Johnny". John Tessier, who was convicted of the crime over 50 years later, lived in the girls' neighborhood and was on the original list of suspects based on a tip, but the police failed to have Kathy identify him after he provided an alibi for the night of the crime (see [[#Suspect|Suspect]]). In late December 1957, Kathy was taken to the [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] Sheriff's Office in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to see a lineup of possible suspects. She positively identified Thomas Joseph Rivard, described in FBI documents as a 35-year-old man approximately 5 foot 4 inches tall and 156 lbs., with dark blond wavy (bushy) hair. However, Rivard had an alibi, as he was in jail at the time of the kidnapping; police suspected someone else in the lineup as the real culprit and Rivard was merely used to fill out the lineup. Rivard also did not physically resemble Tessier, who was six inches taller and 17 years younger than Rivard.&lt;ref&gt;The "People's Answer to Defendant's Pro Se Petition" filed in ''People v. McCullough'' on March 24, 2016 states that Tessier was 12 years younger than Rivard, which appears to be an error as sources support Tessier being age 18 at the time of the lineup.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked years later about the 1957 lineup, Kathy said she did not remember picking Rivard out of the lineup.&lt;ref name=schmack032416 /&gt;

Maria's disappearance received national news coverage, and both President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] took an interest in the case.&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Furness |first1=Jane Denison |last2=Yehling |first2=Victor |date=September 17, 2012 |title=Convicted Killer Faces Decision About Appeal |url=http://northernpublicradio.org/post/convicted-killer-faces-decision-about-appeal |work=[[Northern Public Radio]] |location=[[Northern Illinois University]] |access-date=April 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement continued to investigate various suspects in the area, including transients, known sex offenders,&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt; and a local man who had given children piggyback rides,&lt;ref name=schmack032416rep&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/305929737/State-s-Attorney-Court-Filing Rule 3.8(g) and 3.8(h) Report of the State's Attorney of DeKalb County and Disclosure to the Court and Defendant], ''People v.

On April 26, 1958, near [[Woodbine, Illinois]] (23 miles east of [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]] and approximately 100 miles from Sycamore), two tourists searching for mushrooms in a wooded area along [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|US Route 20]] discovered the skeletal remains of a small child, wearing only a shirt, undershirt, and socks, under a partially fallen tree. The decomposed condition of the body indicated it had been there for several months. The body was identified as Maria Ridulph based on dental records, a lock of hair, and the shirts and socks she had been wearing when she disappeared. The rest of Maria's clothing, including her coat, slacks, shoes and an undergarment, was not found.&lt;ref name=truerep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=April 27, 1958 |title=Missing Girl's Body Found in Illinois: Child Vanished With Stranger Last Dec. 3 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19580427&amp;id=Fw0fAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7248,3139354 |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |location= | page=2, Section 1 | access-date=April 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=April 27, 1958 |title=Body of Little Girl Found |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&amp;dat=19580425&amp;id=EOUcAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7074,3763351 |newspaper=[[The Daily News (Kentucky)|Park City Daily News]] |location=[[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] | page=3 | access-date=April 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No photographs were taken of the crime scene (although photos were taken of the general location without showing the body) because the coroner, James Furlong, did not want photos of the child's body leaked to newspapers.&lt;ref name=truerep /&gt;&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt; Because the crime had occurred within Illinois rather than crossing state lines, the FBI withdrew from the case, leaving it to state and local police.&lt;ref name=oneill04152016 /&gt;

The initial autopsy did not determine a cause of death due to the state of decomposition. During an autopsy done 50 years later, a forensic anthropologist determined Maria had likely been stabbed several times in the throat&lt;ref name=takench5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/us/oldest-cold-case/ch5.html|title=Taken: Chapter 5: The Whole Truth?|last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=August 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[#Reopening of case|Reopening of case]]).

==Suspects==
===John Tessier (Jack McCullough)===
John Tessier was born John Cherry on November 27, 1939 in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], to British [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|sergeant]] Samuel Cherry and his wife Eileen McCullough Cherry. Samuel Cherry was killed early in [[World War II]]. During the war, Eileen Cherry served as one of the first female [[aircraft spotting|airplane spotters]] with the UK's Royal Air Force and met Ralph Tessier, who was serving with the United States 8th Army-Air Force at [[RAF Bovingdon]], England. She married Ralph Tessier in November 1944, and after the war, she and her son John, then aged 7, followed Ralph to Sycamore, Illinois, where Ralph and Eileen had six more children together over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pollak|first=Sorcha |date=April 18, 2016 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/belfast-born-man-convicted-of-1957-murder-released-from-us-jail-1.2614598|title=Belfast-born Man Convicted of 1957 Murder Released From US Jail|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | location= | accessdate=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bracksick|first=Bill |date=September 13, 2011|url=http://www.daily-chronicle.com/mobile/article.xml/articles/2011/07/07/99996529/index.xml|title=Piecing Together John Tessier Puzzle|newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] | location=DeKalb County, Illinois | accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ralphtessierobit&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=November 2006|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/daily-chronicle/obituary.aspx?pid=19938003 |title=Ralph E.

The Tessier family home in Sycamore was located around the corner from the Ridulph home, less than two blocks away. Ralph Tessier, a sign painter,&lt;ref name=ralphtessierobit /&gt; painted insignia on the doors of Sycamore police cars&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt; and was friendly with the police chief. John Tessier was expelled from school in the tenth grade for pushing a teacher and calling her a name.&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt; At the time of Maria Ridulph's disappearance, he was 18 years old and living at home with his parents and siblings while making plans to join the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].&lt;ref name=takench2 /&gt;

On December 4, investigators visited the Tessier home as part of their neighborhood search for Maria. According to Tessier's half-sisters Katherine Tessier (Caulfield) and Jeanne Tessier, their mother told the investigators that John Tessier had been home on the night of December 3, something that they later testified was not true.&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=yehling2day&gt;{{cite news |last=Yehling |first=Victor |date=September 11, 2012 |title=Half-Sisters Testify For Prosecution in Trial's Second Day |url=http://northernpublicradio.org/post/half-sisters-testify-prosecution-trials-second-day |work=[[Northern Public Radio]] |location=[[Northern Illinois University]] |access-date=April 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, before Maria's body was found, the FBI investigated Tessier as a possible suspect. Sources differ on whether the investigation was triggered by a tip from a local resident&lt;ref name=takench2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lachman&gt;{{cite book |last=Lachman |first=Charles |date=2014 |title=Footsteps in the Snow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnSBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23#v=onepage |location= |publisher=Berkeley Books |page=PT23 |isbn=978-0425272886}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by John Tessier's own parents seeking to clear their son, who they realized had the same name and general description as "Johnny".&lt;ref name=schmack032416rep /&gt;

Tessier and his parents told FBI investigators that on December 3, 1957, Tessier was in [[Rockford, Illinois]], approximately 40 miles northwest of Sycamore, to enlist in the Air Force. (This story differed from his mother's previous statement, as reported by her daughters, that Tessier had been home all night.)&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt; He said he had been in [[Chicago]] on December 2 and 3 undergoing physical examinations required for his enlistment. On the morning of December 3 he had visited the Chicago recruiting station (which was corroborated by records) and then spent the day sightseeing in Chicago before returning to Rockford by train that evening, arriving there at 6:45 pm. Upon his arrival in Rockford, he had called his parents to ask for a ride home to Sycamore, since he had taken the train to and from Chicago and left his own car at home. Telephone records were later found showing that a [[collect call]] was placed from the Rockford post office to the Tessier home at 6:57 pm that evening by someone who gave his name as "John Tassier" as written down by the operator.&lt;ref name=schmack032416rep /&gt; After making the call, Tessier then met with officers from the Rockford [[military recruitment|recruiting station]] to drop off paperwork relating to his enlistment. The officers confirmed that they spoke with Tessier around 7:15 pm that evening, although one officer also expressed some concerns about Tessier's credibility and conduct.&lt;ref name=takench2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lachman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wnSBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false PT26].&lt;/ref&gt; Tessier was brought to the police station to take a lie detector test, which he passed. In view of his alibi and the lie detector test result, Tessier was taken off the suspect list, and the FBI closed out his report on December 10, 1957, noting: "No further investigation is being conducted regarding the above suspect." Kathy Sigman was never shown a photograph of him or asked to identify him. Tessier left Sycamore the next day to report for basic training at [[Lackland Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name=takench2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/us/oldest-cold-case/ch2.html|title=Taken: Chapter 2: A Trail of Women Wronged |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=August 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Callahan |first=Maureen |date=November 16, 2014 |title=The Murder That Became the Oldest Solved Cold Case in America |url=https://nypost.com/2014/11/16/the-murder-that-became-the-oldest-solved-cold-case-in-america/ |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |location= |access-date=April 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessier served in the U.S. military for thirteen years and rose to the rank of captain. After leaving the service, he moved to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where he subsequently graduated from the [[King County, Washington|King County]] Law Enforcement Academy in June 1974 and became a police officer in the small town of [[Lacey, Washington|Lacey]] near [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]].&lt;ref name=takench2 /&gt; He later joined the police department in [[Milton, Washington]] where he clashed with the chief of police, who attempted to fire him and documented a long list of complaints about his work and conduct. In 1982, in [[Tacoma, Washington]], Tessier took in a 15-year-old runaway, Michelle Weinman, and her friend, who knew Tessier as a Milton police officer. Weinman later testified that shortly after she began living with Tessier, he fondled her and then performed oral sex on her. Tessier was charged with [[statutory rape]], a [[felony]]. After plea negotiations, he eventually pleaded guilty to communication with a minor for immoral purposes, a [[misdemeanor]]. He was sentenced to one year of formal probation and was terminated from the Milton Police Department on March 10, 1982.&lt;ref name=takench2 /&gt;

On April 27, 1994, John Tessier legally changed his name to Jack Daniel McCullough, saying that he wanted to honor his late mother. By 2011, McCullough, now in his early 70s, was living at a [[retirement community]] in northwest Seattle where he worked as a security guard.&lt;ref name=takench4 /&gt;

===William Henry Redmond===
In 1997, Sycamore Police Lieutenant Patrick Solar closed the then-40-year-old Ridulph case, naming William Henry Redmond, a former truck driver and carnival worker from [[Nebraska]] who had died in 1992, as the man who had likely abducted and killed Maria Ridulph.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Grant |date=November 19, 1997 |title=Case Closed, but Not Solved: Key Questions Remain About Man Accused in Ridulph Murder |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/128886225 |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=DeKalb County, Illinois |pages=1–2 |access-date=April 23, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edboard1997&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial Board |date=November 21, 1997 |title=The Man Who Would Be Chief |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/128886585/ |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=DeKalb County, Illinois |page=4 |access-date=April 21, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redmond had been charged in 1988 with the 1951 murder of an 8-year-old [[Pennsylvania]] girl,&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt; although that case was dismissed when a police officer refused to reveal the name of a confidential informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Florio |first=Gwen |date=January 9, 1992 |title=Suspect In 1951 Slaying Dies In Neb.: William Redmond Was Accused Of Killing An 8-year-old At A Carnival.

Solar's report was criticized due to lack of supporting evidence and alleged political motivations.&lt;ref name=edboard1997 /&gt; Solar himself acknowledged that the evidence against Redmond was circumstantial and that if Redmond had lived, it would have been difficult to convict him in the Ridulph case unless he confessed.

The case was reopened in 2008 based on new information from McCullough's half-sister Janet Tessier.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moe|first=Doug|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/doug_moe/doug-moe-tragedy-leads-to-answers-for-family/article_da32dd3e-0381-11e2-8655-001a4bcf887a.html | title=Tragedy Leads to Answers For Family | newspaper=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|date=September 21, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Janet, their mother Eileen Tessier on her deathbed in January 1994 had said, "Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone."&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt; Janet took the statement as meaning that her half-brother, John Tessier (soon to rename himself Jack McCullough) had kidnapped and murdered Maria Ridulph; she had also heard from her older sisters (Katherine Tessier (Caulfield) and Jeanne Tessier) that Eileen had lied to investigators that he was home on the night of the crime.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt; Another of McCullough's half-sisters, Mary Pat Tessier (Hunt), was also present when Eileen spoke to Janet, but later testified that she had only heard her mother say, "He did it."&lt;ref name=takench5 /&gt; Nevertheless, Mary Pat testified that she had the same understanding as Janet and that her older sisters had suspected John Tessier of the murder for years.&lt;ref name=schmack032416rep /&gt; At the time, Eileen, a cancer patient, was on [[morphine]] and according to her doctor was "disoriented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keyser |first=Jason |date= |title=Review: 1957 Cold Case Conviction Riddled With Missteps |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/missteps-opening-1957-illinois-murder-case-numerous-38353036 |work=[[ABC News]] |location= |access-date=April 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McCullough, who allegedly had once threatened to kill Janet with a gun and [[child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] his half-sister Jeanne when she was a minor, was estranged from the Tessier family by the time of Eileen's death. He was told not to attend her funeral.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;

Janet Tessier said that she made several fruitless attempts over the next fourteen years to get law enforcement, including the Sycamore police and the FBI (who referred her back to the Sycamore police), to look into her mother's statement. Patrick Solar, who during part of this time was a lieutenant with the Sycamore police and had identified William Henry Redmond as the most likely suspect in the Ridulph murder, told [[CNN]] that Janet had never spoken to him, but that he would not have suspected John Tessier (Jack McCullough) because he knew the Tessier family, Ralph Tessier had painted the Sycamore police cars, and John Tessier had been cleared by the FBI in 1957. In 2008, Janet e-mailed an [[Illinois State Police]] tip line, resulting in the state police cold case unit undertaking a lengthy investigation into McCullough's background and alibi.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=yehling2day /&gt;

Janet's sisters Katherine and Jeanne told investigators of their suspicions, and Jeanne said that John had molested her as a child and other young girls.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt; Another woman alleged that John Tessier had given her a piggyback ride as a child and refused to put her down until her father intervened.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lachman /&gt; State police investigators reviewed evidence and developed a new timeline under which Tessier could have kidnapped Maria and driven to Rockford in time to make a telephone call at 6:57 pm and meet with recruiting officers at 7:15 pm. Under this new timeline, they determined that Maria would have been kidnapped no later than 6:20 pm. The police search for Maria was underway by 7 pm according to Katherine, who said she had returned home from a party at 7 pm to find the search in progress.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=schmack032416rep /&gt;

[[File:US_military_issued_train_ticket,_Rockford_to_Chicago,_December_1957.jpg|thumb|left|The unused military-issued train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that was not used as evidence against Jack McCullough at his 2012 murder trial.]]
Hoping to have Kathy Chapman (née Sigman) review a photographic lineup, police took five pictures from the 1957 [[Sycamore High School (Sycamore, Illinois)|Sycamore High School]] yearbook, but John Tessier's picture was not in the yearbook as he had been expelled. Police obtained a contemporary photo of him from his former girlfriend, which differed from the yearbook photos in that Tessier was wearing an open collar rather than a suit and the background was dark rather than light. Chapman identified the picture of Tessier.&lt;ref name=takench4&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill |first=Ann |url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/us/oldest-cold-case/ch4.html|title=Taken: Chapter 4: 'That's Him'|date=August 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill |first=Ann |url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/us/oldest-cold-case/evidence.html|title=Taken: Reference: The Evidence|date=August 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the picture, Tessier's former girlfriend provided an unused, military-issued train ticket from Rockford to Chicago dated December 1957. The investigators took this to suggest that contrary to Tessier's alibi, Tessier had not taken the train on his trip to Chicago and had instead driven his car there, meaning that he could have driven back to Sycamore after noon on December 3, kidnapped Maria, and driven to Rockford.&lt;ref name=takench3&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill |first=Ann |url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/08/us/oldest-cold-case/ch3.html|title=Taken: Chapter 3: Bulldogs on the Case |date=August 2013|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police located a high school friend of Tessier's who recalled seeing Tessier's distinctively painted car in Sycamore that afternoon, and said that Tessier did not let anyone else drive his car.&lt;ref name=takench3 /&gt;

In July 2011 the [[Seattle Police Department]], which had joined with the Illinois State Police in the investigation,&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-mccullough-murder-sentencing-20121211,0,5763790.story|title=Defiant ex-cop gets life for girl's 1957 murder|last=Ward|first=Clifford|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought McCullough in for questioning (using a professional interrogator due to McCullough's law enforcement experience).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/us/maria-ridulphs-killer-gets-life-55-years-after-her-death.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes|title=55 Years After Girl’s Death, Her Killer Gets a Life Term|last=Goode|first=Erica|date=December 10, 2012|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, McCullough spoke calmly and cooperated, but when faced with questions about the murder of Maria Ridulph and his whereabouts on the night of the crime, he became evasive and aggressive. After McCullough refused to answer any more questions, he was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph and [[extradition|extradited]] to Illinois.&lt;ref name=takench5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=takench4 /&gt;

Maria's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]] that same month to check for DNA evidence, but none could be found. However, a forensic anthropologist found that Maria had been stabbed in the throat at least three times by a long, sharp blade, pointing out nicks in her [[sternum]] and neck [[vertebra]]e, consistent with "at least three" slashes to her throat.&lt;ref name=takench5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|url=http://www.thonline.com/news/iowa-illinois-wisconsin/article_be60ade4-46f0-534c-8971-747f696dcbae.html|title=Body of Girl Killed in 1957 Exhumed: Examination Comes Weeks After Authorities Charge a Seattle Man With Murder|date=July 28, 2011|newspaper=[[Telegraph Herald]]|location=[[Dubuque, Iowa]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=April 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311143836/http://www.thonline.com/news/iowa-illinois-wisconsin/article_be60ade4-46f0-534c-8971-747f696dcbae.html|archive-date=March 11, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although stabbing was considered a likely cause of death,&lt;ref name=takench5 /&gt; an appellate court later stated that the findings did not preclude other possible causes of death such as [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligature strangulation]], which could not be adequately investigated due to the decomposition of soft tissue.&lt;ref name=illappctop /&gt;

News of the arrest in a 54-year-old murder case drew national attention. The lead prosecutor, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell, was reluctant to take the case due to its age and the lack of any physical evidence connecting McCullough to the crime. But, after being persuaded by the Ridulph and Tessier families, who all believed that McCullough was guilty, he formally charged McCullough with the kidnapping and murder of Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://6abc.com/archive/8618293/|title=Man not guilty in 1962 rape case; still faces charges in 1957 slaying|access-date=April 13, 2017|newspaper=6abc|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court proceedings==
In September 2012, McCullough was tried in DeKalb County, Illinois for the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph, and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=takench5 /&gt; On appeal, the court vacated his convictions on the lesser kidnapping charges, but upheld his murder conviction.&lt;ref name=dahlstrom&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dahlstrom |first1=Katie |last2=Duchnowski |first2=Jillian |date=February 13, 2015 |title=Appellate Court Upholds Jack McCullough's Murder Conviction, Vacates Others |url=http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2015/12/29/convicted-murderer-jack-mccullough-to-return-to-dekalb-county/afuc4b2/?page=1 |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=DeKalb County, Illinois |access-date=April 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McCullough then petitioned for post-conviction relief, asking that his murder conviction be set aside. After DeKalb County's top prosecutor reviewed the evidence and determined that McCullough could not have committed the crime based on the evidence, his murder conviction was overturned and he was released from prison in April 2016.&lt;ref name=oneill04152016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ward04222016 /&gt;  The DeKalb County Circuit Court declared McCullough to be actually innocent of the crime on April 12, 2017.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

===Trial===
At trial, the prosecution contended that McCullough was attracted to Maria and decided to kidnap her, but instead ended up killing her, presenting new autopsy reports suggesting Maria was stabbed to death. Although the prosecutors suspected McCullough of molesting Maria, they were unable to prove it and never brought it up in court. Numerous witnesses testified for the prosecution, including Maria's family members, neighbors, law enforcement personnel and Kathy Sigman Chapman, who was the star witness and identified McCullough as "Johnny", the man who had walked up to her and Maria 50 years earlier. Another childhood friend of Maria's testified that she had also been offered a piggyback ride from "Johnny" and identified him as McCullough. Three inmates who were jailed with McCullough testified that he talked about killing Maria. However, their stories were both inconsistent and failed to match the evidence indicating Maria had been stabbed. One inmate said McCullough spoke of strangling Maria with a wire, and another said McCullough accidentally smothered her to stop her from screaming.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt;

The defense argued that the prosecutors and police were pressured by the Ridulph and Tessier families to solve the case and implicate McCullough, although there was no physical evidence, motive, or indication that McCullough was in the area when Maria was kidnapped. McCullough did not take the stand in his own defense on the advice of his attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jack McCullough (interviewee) |date=May 24, 2014 |year= |title=48 Hours Presents: Cold as Ice |trans-title= |medium=documentary |language=English |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-childhood-memory-help-solve-1957-murder-of-maria-ridulph/ |access-date=April 19, 2016 |format= |time= |location= |publisher=[[CBS News]] |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=My attorneys told me they didn't want me to take the stand. |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2012, McCullough was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph and received a [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life sentence]] with the possibility of parole after 20 years.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He was 73 years old at the time of sentencing.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

===Appeal===
McCullough appealed his convictions. On February 13, 2015, the [[Illinois Appellate Court]] (Second District) upheld his murder conviction, but vacated his convictions for kidnapping and abduction of an infant as being outside the three-year [[statute of limitations]] in effect for those crimes in 1957. The decision had no effect on McCullough's life sentence, as the sentencing court had provided that the sentences for kidnapping and abduction would "merge" into McCullough's life sentence for murder.&lt;ref name=illappctop&gt;''[http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/AppellateCourt/2015/2ndDistrict/2121364.pdf People v. McCullough]'', No. December 2, 1364 (Ill. App. Ct. February 11, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the appellate court ruled that Eileen Tessier's deathbed statement should not have been admitted as evidence against McCullough, the court declined to overturn the murder conviction because Judge Hallock did not rely heavily upon the statement in issuing the conviction.&lt;ref name=dahlstrom /&gt;

===Post-conviction proceedings overturning conviction===
In 2015, McCullough, acting [[pro se legal representation in the United States|pro se]], filed a petition for post-conviction relief asking that his murder conviction be set aside. After McCullough's petition was initially dismissed by the court as "frivolous and without merit", the public defender who had originally represented McCullough at trial — and who had continued to investigate the case while staying in touch with McCullough, despite the fact that he was no longer appointed to defend McCullough — asked the court to reconsider the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/286510947/Jack-McCullough-Motion-to-Reconsider#8221 Motion to Reconsider the Dismissal of Defendant's Post-Conviction Petition], ''People v. McCullough'', Gen. No. 11 CF 454 (Ill. Cir. Ct. October 13, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; McCullough filed a successive motion that could not be denied without a hearing from the State Attorney's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Katie |date=December 29, 2015 |title=Convicted Murderer Jack McCullough to Return to DeKalb County |url=http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2015/12/29/convicted-murderer-jack-mccullough-to-return-to-dekalb-county/afuc4b2/?page=1 |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=DeKalb County, Illinois |access-date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the motions, DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack, who had replaced Clay Campbell in that position, conducted an extensive review of the evidence, which led Schmack to conclude that McCullough could not have committed the crime and was actually innocent. According to Schmack, evidence was kept out of the trial that clearly established McCullough's whereabouts on the evening of Maria Ridulph's abduction and supported his alibi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 17, 2016 |title=No Longer a Convicted Killer, Freed Man 'Didn't Think This Day Would Come' |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/17/us/jack-mccullough-freed-exclusive-interview/|work=CNN |access-date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, phone records from [[Illinois Bell]] showed that McCullough made a collect call to his mother that evening from a pay phone in downtown Rockford rather than from Sycamore as alleged at his trial. Given the timing of the telephone call, the approximately 40-mile distance between Sycamore and Rockford, and icy road conditions, Schmack concluded that McCullough could not possibly have been in Sycamore at the time of Maria Ridulph's disappearance.&lt;ref name=Hinkel /&gt;&lt;ref name=schmack032416&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/305929737/State-s-Attorney-Court-Filing People's Answer to Defendant's Pro Se Petition Under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401], ''People v. McCullough'', Gen. No. 11 CF 454 (Ill. Cir. Ct. March 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a March 2016 court hearing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward |first=Clifford |date=March 29, 2016 |title=Man Convicted of '57 Murder of 7-Year-Old Girl Staying in Prison For Now |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-sycamore-cold-case-murder-hearing-0330-20160329-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location= |access-date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on April 15, 2016 Judge William P. Brady of the Illinois Circuit Court vacated McCullough's original conviction and sentence and ordered a new trial. McCullough, who remained charged with the crime, was released on bond that day pending the new trial.&lt;ref name=oneill04152016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward |first=Clifford |date=April 15, 2016 |title=Jack McCullough Freed After Conviction Vacated in '57 Sycamore Murder |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-sycamore-cold-case-jack-mccullough-released-20160415-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location= |access-date=April 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Judge Brady dismissed the charges against McCullough; however, the dismissal of the murder charge was without [[Prejudice (legal term)#Criminal law|prejudice]], meaning that McCullough could be tried again for the murder of Maria Ridulph should a prosecutor wish to do so. Brady postponed ruling on a request by Maria's brother Charles Ridulph, backed by the signatures of hundreds of Sycamore citizens including the city's mayor, that a special prosecutor be appointed to replace Schmack on McCullough's case.&lt;ref name=oneill04222016 /&gt;  On August 5, 2016, Judge Brady denied the motion for a special prosecutor; Charles Ridulph then stated that he would not appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rowland |first=Brett |date=August 5, 2016 |title=Judge Denies Special Prosecutor in Maria Ridulph Murder Case |url=http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2016/08/05/judge-denies-special-prosecutor-in-maria-ridulph-murder-case/aybdoh9/ |newspaper=[[Daily Chronicle (Illinois)|Daily Chronicle]] |location=DeKalb County, Illinois |access-date=December 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCullough was declared actually innocent of the crime by the DeKalb County Circuit Court on April 12, 2017.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

===Freedom of Information Act Requests===
On July 21, 2016 Porter, son-in-law of McCullough, filed a [[lawsuit]] (Case 2016-CH-09536 (Cook County, Illinois)) against the Illinois State Police and Sycamore Police Department for refusal to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request related to the investigation of the case. The FOIA request was prompted by Schmack's allegations of police misconduct on November 3, 2015.

==Memorials==
The "Maria Ridulph Memorial Map", an eight-foot-square map of Sycamore constructed of steel and porcelain, was mounted on the front exterior of the Sycamore Municipal Building in 1958, in commemoration of Maria Ridulph.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; The map was removed in 2002 and replaced with a bronze memorial plaque that was installed on a pedestal outside the Municipal Building.

The Ridulph family also established a "Maria Ridulph Memorial Fund" that was originally used to pay for the memorial map and was later used as a scholarship, compassion and summer camp fund for local children in need. A portion of the proceeds from Charles Lachman's 2014 book about the case, ''Footsteps in the Snow'', was donated to the fund.

==In popular culture==
At the time of McCullough's 2012 trial and conviction, the case was the subject of several news documentaries, including an episode of ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]''&lt;ref name=48hours /&gt; and a [[CNN]] Interactive web feature entitled ''Taken: The Coldest Case Ever Solved''.&lt;ref name=takench1 /&gt; A [[true crime]] book by Charles Lachman, ''Footsteps in the Snow'' (2014), also became the basis for a [[LMN (TV channel)|Lifetime Movie Network]] documentary of the same name. These works, which were published before McCullough's conviction was overturned, presumed that the case had been successfully solved. In contrast, Northern Illinois author Jeffrey Dean Doty self-published a non-fiction book, ''Piggyback'' (2014), in which he reviewed evidence and court filings in the case and examined whether McCullough had been wrongfully convicted.

As part of his review of McCullough's case, State's Attorney Richard Schmack read ''Taken'', ''Footsteps in the Snow'', and ''Piggyback'', and cited to portions of ''Taken'' and ''Footsteps'' in his 2016 court filing supporting McCullough's innocence.&lt;ref name=oneill04152016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=schmack032416 /&gt;&lt;ref name=schmack032416rep /&gt;

'''Old Ephraim''' or '''Ol' Ephraim''' is a term popularized in the [[American Old West|19th-century American West]] to refer to [[grizzly bear]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brown Gary, ''The Great Bear Almanac'', The Lyons Press, New York, 1993. P 28.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as describing the archetypal grizzly bear, the name has also been used in frontier folklore to refer to specific bears, most notably '''Old Ephraim''' (known as "Old Three Toes" by [[sheepherder]]s due to a deformity on one foot&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/79147|title=Old Ephraim, the Ten-Foot Grizzly Bear|last=Clarke|first=Linda Weaver |date=October 27, 2008|work=American Chronicle|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a very large grizzly bear that roamed the [[Cache National Forest]] in Idaho and Utah from circa 1911 until his death on August 22, 1923. He was named after another grizzly bear in California described in a story by [[P. T. Barnum]].

==Frank Clark and Old Ephraim==
The grizzly bear from the Cache National Forest that eventually became known as "Old Ephraim" was first identified by its distinctive tracks. The bear lived within a large wilderness from as far north as [[Soda Springs, Idaho]] to as far south as [[Weber County, Utah|Weber County]], Utah, before settling in [[Logan Canyon]], about 20 miles east of [[Logan, Utah]].

In 1914, Frank Clark set out to stop Old Ephraim. He set many traps in Old Ephraim's favorite wallows, but the traps were always removed, un-sprung, or flung away.&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; Although Clark seldom saw the bear, dead sheep around the herd indicated its presence.&lt;ref name="USU_FC"/&gt; Despite Clark's efforts, Old Ephraim killed more and more sheep without being stopped. He is said to have once killed 50 sheep at a time.

==Death==
Though Clark had planned to kill the bear since 1914, he did not succeed until 1923. On the night of August 21, Clark woke to "a roar and groan", and took his gun to investigate. At the time, Clark said he was unaware it was Old Ephraim. After several unsuccessful shots, Clark finally found the bear, which had been caught in a trap Clark had set earlier. Clark shot five rounds from a .25-35 carbine rifle but the bear did not go down, so Clark started heading for [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], about 20 miles away. After about 20 yards he turned around to find the bear being harassed by his dog, so he went closer and shot Old Ephraim in the head. It reportedly took all five rounds to kill the bear. Clark described killing Old Ephraim as "the hardest of them [the bears] all". He later expressed remorse for having to do it. 

==Memorial==
Old Ephraim was skinned and buried, but was later dug up by Boy Scout Troop 43, which sent the bear's skull to the [[Smithsonian]]. According to Clark, a pile of stones was erected by Boy Scouts over the bear's remains.&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USU_FC"/&gt; Most of the remains were eventually taken by tourists as souvenirs.&lt;ref name="USU_FC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.usu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/Ephraim&amp;CISOPTR=101&amp;REC=10|title=Old Ephraim|last=As told by Frank Clark|publisher=Utah State University Archives|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://logannature.org/podcasts/08-HLLC-Ephraim.pdf

Later, an {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} stone monument designed, lettered, and erected by Max Arthur and Howard Jorgensen was placed at the grave site. This memorial was officially dedicated on September 23, 1966.&lt;ref name="boss"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

At the time of his death, Old Ephraim stood {{Convert|10|ft}} tall and weighed {{Convert|1100|lb}}. His [[skull]] was sent to [[The Smithsonian]], where it was identified as a [[grizzly bear]].

==Legacy==
The Old Ephraim Trail is a popular "fat tire" bike trail in the Logan area. It is a 20-mile loop with almost 3,000 feet of vertical gain, and is intended for intermediate or advanced riders.&lt;ref name="UTI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/bike/trails/old_ephraims.htm|title=Old Ephraim's Grave Trail|last=Bromka|first=Gregg|work=Utah.com|publisher=Utah Travel Industry|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UTI_Map"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/bike/trails/old_ephraims_map.htm|title=Old Ephraim's Grave Trail Map|work=Utah.com|publisher=Utah Travel Industry|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loop starts with several miles of moderate climbing up Cowley Canyon, and proceeds uphill to the upper trailhead of Ricks Canyon. The loop circles north through aspen groves and meadows. After passing Old Ephraim's grave it descends to the Right Fork of Logan River, after which there is one more sizable climb. At the top of this climb, you can see the Mt. Naomi Wilderness and the terraced cliffs of Logan Canyon. The loop ends on the single-track Willow Creek Trail.&lt;ref name="UTI"/&gt;

The Bear 100 Mile Endurance Run, starting in the Logan area and ending in [[Fish Haven, Idaho]], is a 100-mile [[ultramarathon]] through the Wasatch and Bear River Ranges. Though considered one of the most difficult 100-mile races, it is also considered one of the most scenic, taking advantage of the fall foliage of September. Male and female overall winners receive the Old Ephraim award.

A lifesize bronze statue of Old Ephraim stands along [[U.S. Route 89]] (Washington Street) as it enters [[Montpelier, Idaho]] from the west.

'''Sam''' ({{Korean|삼|參}}) was one of the four members ([[No In]], [[Han Eum]], Sam and [[Wang Gyeop]]) who operated the government of [[Wiman Joseon]]. He was a [[chancellor]] of Nigye ([[Hangul]]:니계 [[Hanja]]:尼谿) and it was where he based himself for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yukio Takeda|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an only one who did not have [[family name]] in those 4 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yukio Takeda|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|National Institute of Korean History||p=註 042}}&lt;/ref&gt; In BC 109 to 108, when [[Han dynasty]] attacked Wiman Joseon, those three exiles from [[China]], No In, Han Eum and Wang Gyeop surrendered instantly while leaving the King of Wiman Joseon [[Ugeo]] and Sam was only one who resisted against Han dynasty among those members. However, in BC 108, Sam sent an assassin to Ugeo, killed him and urrendered to Han dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yukio Takeda|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his surrender, he was nominated as a peerage of  Hwae Cheong ([[Hangul]]:홰청 [[Hanja]]:澅清) by Han dynasty. 11 years later, he was arrested on suspicion of hiding the fugitive from Wiman Joseon and died of illness while he was in [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yukio Takeda|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Waldo''' (August 7, 1696 – May 23, 1759) was a wealthy merchant, land speculator, soldier and political figure in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].

He was born in [[Boston]], the son of Jonathan Waldo and Hannah Mason. In 1722, he married Lucy Wainwright.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ozNSzDNwaZMC&amp;lpg=PA956&amp;ots=yXKPS9Ph8J&amp;dq=Samuel%20Waldo%20born%201696&amp;pg=PA956#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Charles H. Browning, ''The American Historical Register;'' The Historical Register Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1730, he purchased a 17th-century title to a large tract of land in [[Nova Scotia]] with the intent of establishing a colony there; the title did not stand up when he proposed this plan to the authorities in England.  A one-time business partner of [[Colonel Thomas Westbrook]], Waldo acquired a large tract of land between the [[Penobscot River|Penobscot]] and [[Muscongus Bay|Muscongus]] Rivers in what is now [[Maine]] where he settled Irish and German immigrants.

During [[King George's War]], he served as [[brigadier-general]] in [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|the attack]] on [[Fortress Louisbourg]] in 1745 and served on the temporary council that administered the settlement until [[Peter Warren (Royal Navy officer)|Peter Warren]] was named governor. In 1757, during the [[French and Indian War]], he submitted a plan to [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] which served as a basis for the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|second capture of Louisbourg]] from the French the following year. Waldo died of [[apoplexy]] near present-day [[Bangor, Maine]] in 1759 while participating in a military expedition with Governor [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB

The Maine towns of [[Waldo, Maine|Waldo]] and [[Waldoboro, Maine|Waldoboro]], together with [[Waldo County, Maine|Waldo County]], are named for their early proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9nEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NGcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3417%2C2283219 | title=Many Maine towns bear names of military men | work=Lewiston Evening Journal | date=Apr 20, 1949 | accessdate=17 October 2015 | last=Chadbourne |first=Ava H. | pages=A-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son-in-law Thomas Flucker was royal secretary of [[Massachusetts]] and later Provincial Governor. His grand-daughter, [[Lucy Flucker Knox]], married Revolutionary War hero and founding father [[Henry Knox]]. The Knox's built the impressive ''Montpelier'' on Waldo's tract of land in [[Thomaston, Maine]].

The '''Slitheen''' are a family of massive, bipedal [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s from the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and are adversaries of the [[Ninth Doctor]] and later [[Sarah Jane Smith]]. The Slitheen are of the egg-laying [[calcium]]-based '''Raxacoricofallapatorian''' race native to [[List of Doctor Who planets#R|Raxacoricofallapatorius]], though many use "Slitheen" in referring to the race in general. Instinctive hunters trained to kill at a young age, Slitheen are a ruthless criminal sect whose main motivation is profit. They are also convicted on their home world, not willing to return to their planet due to a  [[capital punishment|death sentence.]]

The Slitheen first appeared in the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 series]] episodes "[[Aliens of London]]" and [[World War Three (Doctor Who)|"World War Three"]], and subsequently recur in later episodes of both ''Doctor Who'' and spin-off series ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''.

==Physical characteristics==
Adult Slitheen are {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip}} tall, rather fat with long forearms, powerful claws, and infantile face. They do not appear to have eyelids, but have a [[nictitating membrane]]. They have a highly developed sense of smell, able to track a single target across a few city blocks, smell [[adrenaline]] and hormones in people, and can sense if one of their own dies. Female Raxacoricofallapatorians can produce poisons within their bodies to use against their enemies. Known methods of delivery include a poisoned dart that is formed in the finger and then fired, and exhalation of poisoned breath. Members of the Slitheen family have green skin, though there is variation in the skin tone of other Raxacoricofallapatorian families. In ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' episode ''[[The Gift (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Gift]]'', members of the Slitheen-Blathereen family group are seen to have orange skin.

The Slitheen disguise themselves by fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields created by a collar worn around their necks to squeeze their huge size into a slightly smaller space. Initially the compression ratio was limited, so the disguises tended to be [[obesity|obese]] people. This issue was overcome by new technology by the time of ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]'', in which the skins of thinner people were used (by the time of "[[From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love]]" short people could also be used). The exchange of gases that compression entails also builds up within the acquired skin, causing very loud flatulence in humans (the expelled gas smells like [[breath odor|bad breath]], which the Doctor noted was a form of calcium decay—though, in reality, [[bacterium|bacteria]] that cause [[Teeth#Tooth decay|tooth decay]] are different from those that cause bad breath). This side-effect is also overcome by the newer technology in ''The Lost Boy''.

==Gas exchange==
When the Slitheen are in their skin suits they fart loudly; they call this the gas exchange.
This can also be caused by over-eating. In ''The Gift'', [[Sarah Jane Smith|Sarah Jane]] and the gang destroy the food, a plant called Rackweed, which is native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, The rackweed which has been digested sits in their stomachs and when Mr Smith triggers a sound in the attic it causes them to start farting and then their stomachs start to move and then their stomachs explode covering everyone and everything in orange goo. Clyde then says that they farted themselves to death. This is due to the fact that the communication that the rackweed had with the wailing sound was interrupted with the sound Mr smith had made, when he linked up to all devices capable of emitting such a sound.

===Vulnerabilities===
Raxacoricofallapatorians are vulnerable to [[acetic acid]], which reacts explosively&amp;mdash;and fatally&amp;mdash;with their bodies, making Slitheen allergic to [[vinegar]], [[ketchup]] and [[Coca-Cola]]. One of the Raxacoricofallapatorian methods of execution is the lowering of the condemned into a cauldron of acetic acid, which is then heated to boiling. The acidity of the solution is formulated to dissolve the skin, allowing the internal organs to drop into the liquid while the condemned is still alive, reducing them to "soup" in a slow and painful death. In "World War Three", when a single Slitheen was electrocuted, the effects were transmitted to other Slitheen, even those across the city.

==Appearances==
When they first appeared in "Aliens of London" (set in 2006), the Pasameer-Day branch of the Slitheen had been in Great Britain for some time, having infiltrated various levels of British society, from community leaders and military personnel to mid-level politicians and government officials. Their intent was to instigate [[World War III]] and sell the [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] remains of Earth to a [[recession|depressed]] galactic economy as fuel for interstellar spacecraft. They staged the crash landing of an alien spaceship in central [[London]], setting up a cybernetically augmented pig as an "extraterrestrial" body.

With the world in a state of heightened alert and panic, and with their commander Jocrassa assuming the role of Acting [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], they persuaded the [[United Nations]] to allow the United Kingdom to use its nuclear arsenal against the alien "massive weapons of destruction". Before the Slitheen could receive the launch codes, the [[Ninth Doctor]] arranged for a [[Harpoon missile]] to demolish [[10 Downing Street]], ending the scheme and killing all but one of them who managed to escape through an emergency teleport.

[[List of Doctor Who villains#Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen|Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen]], who had assumed the identity of Margaret Blaine of [[MI5]], survived and appeared in the episode "[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]". In the intervening six months, "Blaine" was elected as [[Lord Mayor]] of [[Cardiff]] and planned to leave Earth by using the energy from a new [[nuclear power station]] to interact with the [[Cardiff Rift]], unconcerned that the planet would be destroyed in the process. Blon was stopped by the Doctor and his companions, and on exposure to the "heart" of the [[TARDIS]], regressed to an egg. The Doctor took the egg to the hatcheries on Raxacoricofallapatorius so she could be given a second chance at life.

Some years after the events of "World War Three", in ''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]'' (set in either 2008 or 2009)&lt;ref&gt;It is stated in "Invasion of the Bane" that K-9 Mark IV has been in a black hole for 18 months, "School Reunion" having taken place in 2007.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; another group of Slitheen infiltrated a construction company with plans to turn off the Sun and destroy [[Earth]] by draining the world's energy to avenge the deaths of the Pasameer-Days. It is mentioned that the [[Judoon]] have begun to force out the Slitheen, and the various other families have been working against them. The families Blathereen and Hostrazeen are mentioned as part of the Raxacoricofallapatorian ruling bodies, the Senate and the Grand Council. After Commander Glune was killed by [[Maria Jackson]], [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]] was able to trick the Slitheen into resetting their machinery, which then malfunctioned and exploded. Two of the remaining Slitheen were killed, and the others escaped, including Korst, the first child Slitheen to appear.

The Slitheen returned in ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]'' where, using the newer compression technology, two Slitheen named Dax and Bloorm posed as Luke's 'real' parents Jay and Heidi Stafford. They were under the command of Korst from ''Revenge of the Slitheen'', who planned to avenge the deaths of his family. Another shorter adult Slitheen appeared in the 2009 "[[From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love]]", masquerading as a galactic diplomat in an attempt to steal Sarah Jane's robot dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]].

The Slitheen appeared in the [[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|New Series Adventures]] novel ''[[The Monsters Inside]]'' by [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]]. When the Ninth Doctor and Rose are arrested in the Justicia System in the year 2501, the Doctor shares a cell with Dram Fel-Fotch and Ecktosca Fel-Fotch Happen-Bar Slitheen, who claim that after the Earth incident, the remnants of the family went bankrupt and had become historians. The Slitheen had not actually given up business, and were in conflict with a more influential family, the Blathereen. When the Doctor and Rose defeat an attempted Blathereen takeover of the system, the Slitheen are pleased to see they can once again become the profit-holders of their race. The Blathereen were mentioned again in the Sarah Jane adventures episode ''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]''.

In the Series 3 finale of ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'', ''[[The Gift (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Gift]]'', a pair of Slitheen-Blathereen from an intermarried line of the two families attempted to overrun Earth with Rakweed, a plant native to Raxacoricofallapatorius and used as an addictive vegetable.

In "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]", a stuffed Raxacoricofallapatorian arm was among a collection of alien artifacts owned by American billionaire [[List of Doctor Who villains#Henry van Statten|Henry van Statten]] in the year 2012.

Rose mentioned the Slitheen Parliament of Raxacoricofallapatorius in "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" (though her impromptu speech was a pastiche of phrases she's picked up on her travels with the Doctor). A member of the Slitheen was captured by the [[List of Doctor Who aliens#Graske|Graske]] in the mini-episode "[[Attack of the Graske]]". Rose accused the Doctor (after his [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regeneration]] into the [[Tenth Doctor]]) of being a Slitheen in disguise in the [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|2005 Children in Need mini-episode]] and the Doctor makes a passing reference to the Slitheen and their skin-suits in "[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]".

In the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|2006 series]] episode "[[Love &amp; Monsters]]", an alien called the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Abzorbaloff|Abzorbaloff]], whose natural form is similar to that of the Slitheen, claims to be from Raxacoricofallapatorius's twin planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#C|Clom]]. The Slitheen space ship from "Aliens of London" was also seen in a flashback in the same episode.

A Slitheen appears briefly in the Tenth Doctor novel ''[[The Nightmare of Black Island]]'' by [[Mike Tucker]], created from Rose's memories, along with a [[Dalek]] and the [[Auton|Nestene Consciousness]]. The Slitheen are also briefly referenced by the Doctor in the same novel while speaking to a member of the Cynrog about hiding under human-like skinsuits. In the later novel, ''[[The Last Dodo]]'', when the Doctor is asked if he's ever had a dream, he claims to have a recurring one in which a Slitheen on a [[rocking horse]] chases him.

The Slitheen appear in John Smith's ''[[List of Doctor Who items#J|A Journal of Impossible Things]]'' in the episode "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]". The scribbled words by the drawing note that "it's always for money." A Fact File book about the Slitheen has also been released.

In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Reset (Torchwood)|Reset]]", a newspaper clipping of Blon posing as Margaret Blaine, previously seen in "[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]", can be seen as Martha Jones enters the Hub.

The ''Doctor Who'' website features a segment called [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack]]'s Monster Files, narrated by [[John Barrowman]], which provides information about alien species. An episode focusing on the Slitheen [http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/videos/slitheen] shows a family tree that refers to a number of related families, all with the suffix, ''-een'', with the exception of the 'Absorbalovian Rebels', referring to the Absorbaloff from "[[Love &amp; Monsters]]", from the twin planet of Clom.

The Slitheen are mentioned in the audio book ''[[Wraith World]]'', when [[Clyde Langer]] remarks he cannot understand why [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]] and [[Rani Chandra (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Rani]] would want to read about made up adventures, when they have faced Slitheen.

Though the Slitheen don't appear in "[[The Time of the Doctor]]", the Doctor mentions them as among the forces gathered around Trenzalore.

==Naming==
One of the factors that helped the Doctor determine the home planet of the Slitheen was the fact that they had a hyphenated surname. Examples include the names Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen, and Jocrassa Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen. Additional hyphenated forms in Slitheen names suggest family sub-units within the broader Slitheen family.

'''Strobilation''' or '''transverse fission''' is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] consisting of the spontaneous transverse [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] of the body. It is observed in certain [[cnidarian]]s and [[helminth]]s. This mode of reproduction is characterized by high offspring output, which, in the case of the [[parasite|parasitic]] tapeworms, is of great significance.

==Strobilation in cnidarians==
*The process starts with preliminary morphological changes. In particular, the cnidarian's tentacles tend to be reabsorbed.
*Neck-formation: transverse constrictions appear near the upper extremity of the animal. A strobilating polyp is called a '''strobila''' while the non-strobilating polyp is called a '''scyphistoma''' or '''scyphopolyp'''.
*Segmentation: the number of constriction sites increases and migrates down the body length, transforming the body into a sequence of disks. The fissures intensify until the initial body is divided into equally spaced, separate segments. The oral end of the polyp becomes the oral end of the ephyra.
*Metamorphosis: The two previous processes involve [[neurosecretory]] products, which now disappear.

It is to be noted that neck-formation and segmentation are only separated for clarity purposes. In reality, the two processes are simultaneous, with segmentation to release new ephyras occurring at the upper end while neck formation spreads further down the body. Usually, a portion of the animal remains adhered to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] and regenerates the body.

===Examples===
*The [[moon jellyfish]] (''Aurelia aurita'') reproduces both sexually and by strobilation. This latter process occurs during the colonial [[polyp]] stage and produces either polyps or juvenile [[Medusa_(biology)|Medusae]] called [[Jellyfish#Phases|ephyra]]. Strobilation tend to occur at specific periods, typically early spring. As ephyra size remains constant regardless of the polyp size, larger polyps produce more numerous ephyras.
*Some [[scyphozoa]]ns, such as ''[[Nausithoe aurea]]'', cnidarians also strobilate in their solitary polyp form, producing either ephyra or [[planuloid]]s. Strobilation does not happen periodically, but is thought to be induced by external stimuli, such as [[iodine]], light regime, temperature, or food availability.

===Induction in laboratory conditions===
Strobilation is successfully induced in laboratory conditions by intensive feeding and temperature lowering, and also by the effect of artificial compounds.

==Strobilation in helminths==
In [[cestode]]s, the whole body except for the head and the neck undergoes strobilation continuously, reflecting the important role reproduction plays in the parasitic mode of life. The strobilating section is called strobila, or scolex, and each of its segment is a [[proglottid]]. As they mature, proglottids are disposed of in the [[feces]] of the host.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}

In [[baseball]], a '''switch hitter''' is a player who [[Batting (baseball)|bats]] both right-handed and left-handed, usually right-handed against left-handed pitchers and left-handed against right-handed pitchers.

==Characteristics==
Usually, right-handed batters hit better against left-handed pitchers and ''vice versa''. Most [[curveball]]s break away from batters hitting from the same side as the opposing pitcher, making them harder to hit with the barrel (or "[[Sweet spot (sports)|sweet spot]]") of the bat. Additionally, the pitcher's release is farther from the batter's center of vision. In [[switch-pitcher]] [[Pat Venditte]]'s words, "If I'm pitching right-handed and they're hitting right-handed, it's tougher for them to see. And then, your breaking pitches are going away from their barrel rather than into their barrel."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=FtofU1hgf2w|title=ESPN E:60 Pat Venditte segment, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, many switch-hitters do better from one side of the plate than the other.

Numerous switch-hitters have achieved a higher batting average on one side, yet have more power from the other.  For instance, [[New York Yankees]] great [[Mickey Mantle]] always considered himself a better right-handed hitter, but hit more home runs left-handed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/deaths/mickey_mantle_obituary.shtml "Mickey Mantle Obituary"], ''Baseball Almanac''. Retrieved on July 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of Mantle's left-handed home runs were struck at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], a park notorious for being very friendly to left-handed power hitters due to the short right field porch, and Mantle batted left-handed much more often than right-handed, simply because there have always been more right-handed than left-handed pitchers. Mantle's longest home run, a 565-foot clout in 1953 at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Griffith Stadium]], came batting right-handed.

Most switch-hitters have been right-handed throwers, though–among other exceptions–there have been the following players: [[Lance Berkman]], [[Dave Collins]], [[Doug Dascenzo]], [[Mitch Webster]], [[Wes Parker]], [[Melky Cabrera]], [[Nick Swisher]], [[Justin Smoak]], [[David Segui]], [[Daniel Nava]], and [[J. T. Snow]] (who, in the final years of his career, hit exclusively left-handed).

Switch-hitting pitchers are relatively rare. They include [[Mordecai Brown]], [[Norm Charlton]],&lt;ref name="st29Oct2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Larry|title=10 great moments in switch-hitting history|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003130073_moments16.html|accessdate=29 October 2010|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marvin Rotblatt]], [[Sid Monge]], [[Johnny Vander Meer]], [[J.C. Romero]], [[Kyle Snyder]], [[Wandy Rodriguez]], [[Troy Patton]], [[Tim Dillard]], [[Tyler Johnson (baseball)|Tyler Johnson]], [[Carlos Zambrano]], [[Dock Ellis]], [[Vida Blue]], [[Anthony Claggett]], [[Kris Medlen]], [[Justin De Fratus]], [[Drew Storen]] and [[Kenley Jansen]]. [[Joaquín Andújar]] sometimes hit right-handed against lefties, sometimes left-handed. [[Tomo Ohka]] batted left-handed against right-handed pitchers in three games in 2006, but otherwise batted exclusively right-handed. Left-handed reliever [[Steve_Kline_(left-handed_pitcher)|Steve Kline]] was primarily a switch hitter, but batted right-handed against right-handed pitchers several times throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=ohkato01&amp;year=Career&amp;t=b#plato "Tomo Ohka Career Batting Splits"], ''Baseball Reference''. Retrieved on November 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Management also had a say in the switch-hitting careers of [[Bob Gibson]] and [[Dwight Gooden]].  Both Gibson and Gooden—each right-handed, and a fine hitting pitcher—had reached the major leagues as a switch-hitter, and both their teams required them to bat only right-handed, to reduce the possibility of their pitching arms being hit by a pitch.

== Vs. switch pitchers ==
[[Pat Venditte]], who played college baseball for the [[Creighton Bluejays baseball|Creighton Bluejays]], regularly pitched with both arms.&lt;ref name="Scharz"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Schwarz | first = Alan | date = April 6, 2007 | title = Throwing Batters Curves Before Throwing a Pitch | newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/sports/baseball/06pitcher.html?ex=1333512000&amp;en=a34837d6efb38b04&amp;ei=5124 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Venditte, drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] in 2008, was called up to the [[Oakland Athletics]]' major-league roster in 2015.&lt;ref name="Venditte call-up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25206138/ambidextrous-pitcher-pat-venditte-coming-to-majors-with-as |title=Ambidextrous pitcher Pat Venditte coming to majors with A's |first=Matt |last=Snyder |publisher=''[[CBSSports.com]]'' |date=June 5, 2015 |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he opposed switch-hitter [[Ralph Henriquez, Jr.|Ralph Henriquez]] while in the minor leagues, Venditte switched his modified glove to his left arm. Henriquez then switched to batting left-handed, and a series of changes continued for several minutes. This prompted the PBUC (Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation) to issue rules about switch-pitching: switch-pitchers must choose which way they will begin pitching before they start. Then, batters will select the side of home plate from which they will hit. The batter and the pitcher are each allowed one switch during the plate appearance, after the first pitch is thrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hill | first = Benjamin | title = Venditte's versatility prompts new rule | publisher = Major League Baseball | date = July 2, 2008 | url = http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080702&amp;content_id=3051858&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb | accessdate = 2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable switch hitters==
* [[Mickey Mantle]] — The all-time home run leader among switch-hitters, a first-ballot [[List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], and one of a handful of players in the conversation for "greatest player ever".
* [[Chipper Jones]] — Also a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the most recent of only two switch-hitters with extended MLB careers (5,000 at-bats or more) to have a career batting average of .300 from each side of home plate.
* [[Eddie Murray]] — Hall of Famer and the only other switch-hitter (apart from Mantle) with [[500 home run club|500 career homers]]. Also, is one of two switch hitters (Pete Rose being the other) with 3,000 or more hits.
* [[Frankie Frisch]] — Another Hall of Famer, and the only other switch-hitter with an extended career to hit .300 from each side of home plate.
* [[Pete Rose]] — The all-time career hits leader in MLB. Currently barred from Hall of Fame consideration due to his [[Dowd Report|betting on baseball]].

==In other sports==
===Boxing and mixed martial arts===
In [[boxing]] and mixed martial arts, switch-hitting refers to the ability to change boxing stances mid-fight between an [[orthodox stance]] (Right-handed preference straight and left-handed preference jab) and a [[southpaw stance]] (Left-handed preference straight and right-handed preference jab).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.myboxingcoach.com/switch-hitting-boxing-drill/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fightland.vice.com/blog/jack-slack-how-prince-naseem-became-the-king-of-boxing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cricket===
{{Main|switch hit}}
The term switch hitting in cricket is used to describe a move in which the batsman changes stance during the bowlers run-up or shortly after the ball is bowled. The move was first done by [[Kevin Pietersen]], and he attributed his own success in executing the move by having strong wrists from playing tennis, [[Field hockey|hockey]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BT Sport|title=Masterclass: KP,  Gilchrist, Ponting and Vaughan on the art of attacking batting|date=2017-12-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wdT4zzNinI|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and likened it to playing a backhand shot with the right hand. It also ties into the reverse sweep, which also involves the bat being extended to the non-dominant hip without changing stances with their leg, i.e. for [[Glenn Maxwell]] to play a reverse sweep, his left leg stays in front of the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=cricket.com.au|title=Masterclass: KP and Maxi on switch-hits|date=2016-12-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFh013k6dUk|accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]], who is normally a left-handed batsman, had practised batting right-handed in his youth, so he is able to switch his batting hand before the bowler's run-up as well. He also bowls with his right arm.

'''Vaginal trauma''' is injury to the [[vagina]]. It can happen during [[childbirth]], sexual assault, and accidental occurrences.

This injury often consists of bruising. But in some cases, severe hemorrhage can be a concern that requires immediate medical attention. In adults, the vagina is largely protected from trauma due to the protective function of the [[mons pubis]] and [[labia majora]]. This protection is lacking in girls who lack a protective fat layer to protect the vagina. Vaginal trauma can occur when something is inserted into the vagina, for example, a sharp object causing [[penetrating trauma]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Barbara L.|title=Williams Gynecology|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=9780071716727|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma can occur as a result of a painful sexual experience or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/vagina/art-20046562|title=Vagina: What's normal, what's not|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma can occur in children as a result of a straddle injury. Most of these, though distressing, are not serious injuries.

In some instances, a severe injury occurs and requires immediate medical attention. Especially if the bleeding won't stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texaschildrens.org/blog/2012/07/vaginal-trauma-you-fell-what|title=Vaginal Trauma: You Fell On What? {{!}} Texas Children's Hospital|website=www.texaschildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattlechildrens.org/medical-conditions/symptom-index/genital-injury-female/|title=Genital Injury - Female|website=www.seattlechildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma also occurs during an episiotomy&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/558117|title=Minimizing Genital Tract Trauma and Related Pain Following Spontaneous Vaginal Birth|last=|first=|date=|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vaginal childbirth. Avoiding vaginal injuries during childbirth will help to prevent depression, hospital readmissions, perineal pain.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms include:
[[abdominal pain]],
[[bleeding]],
[[Bruise|bruising]],
[[Syncope (medicine)|faintness]],
[[vaginal discharge]],
embedded object in the vagina,
genital pain,
swelling,
[[vomiting]],
painful urination,
inability to urinate,
presence of a [[wound]],
report of [[sexual abuse]], and

==Cause==

=== Pregnancy related ===
During childbirth, vaginal or cervical injuries can occur and will likely require surgery to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/vaginal-and-cervical-trauma-5045|title=Vaginal and cervical trauma|website=stratog.rcog.org.uk|language=en-uk|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vagina is sometimes injured during the course of labor and perineal tears extend from the vagina to various points of the perineum.

=== Non pregnancy related ===
Non-obstetric causes include:
sexual assault,&lt;ref name=mci2017&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas K. |last=McInerny |date=2017 |title=Textbook of Pediatric Care - 2nd Edition |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |ISBN=978-1-58110-966-5}}  [http://online.statref.com/Do STAT!Ref Online Electronic Medical Library]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk factors===
Risk factors include:
first episode of consensual intercourse,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
￼￼ [[breastfeeding]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
￼￼ [[menopause]],{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
and medication [[side effect]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Prevention==
A safe environment can be created for young children in addition to keeping [[infant and toddler safety|small objects out of reach]].&lt;ref name = medline&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000044.htm|title=Genital injury: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/getting-ready-baby/making-your-home-safe-baby|title=Making your home safe for baby {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment begins with a thorough assessment. The presence of someone to provide support during the examination is very beneficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such support is especially prioritized in cases of vaginal trauma due to sexual assault. A support person provides emotional support and can help minimize the risk of re-traumatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.victimlaw.org/victimlaw/pages/victimsRight.jsp |title=VictimLaw - Victims Right |website=www.victimlaw.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/what-is-a-victim-advocate- |title=What is a Victim Advocate- |website=victimsofcrime.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those treating victims employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.&lt;ref name="mci2017"/&gt;

[[File:Watsonia meriana near end of flowering showing cormlets on IMG 6913.JPG|thumb|''[[Watsonia meriana]]'', near end of flowering, has [[Corm|cormlets]] that eventually drop and root.]]
[[File:Plody mangrovnika (Rhizophora mangle).jpg|thumb|Red [[mangrove]] seeds germinate while still on the parent tree.]]

In plants, '''vivipary''' occurs when seeds or embryos begin to develop before they detach from the parent. Plants such as some [[Iridaceae]] and [[Agavoideae]] grow cormlets in the axils of their inflorescences. These fall and in favourable circumstances they have effectively a whole season's start over fallen seeds. Similarly, some [[Crassulaceae]], such as [[Bryophyllum]], develop and drop plantlets from notches in their leaves, ready to grow. Such production of embryos from somatic tissues is asexual [[vegetative reproduction]] that amounts to [[cloning]].

Again, in some species of [[mangrove]]s, for instance, the seed germinates and grows from its own resources while still attached to its parent. Seedlings of some species are dispersed by currents if they drop into the water, but others develop a heavy, straight taproot that commonly penetrates mud when the seedling drops, thereby effectively planting the seedling. This contrasts with the examples of vegetative reproduction mentioned above, in that the mangrove plantlets are true seedlings produced by [[Plant reproductive morphology|sexual reproduction]].

In some trees, like [[jackfruit]], some citrus, and avocado, the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe; strictly speaking this condition cannot be described as vivipary, but the moist and humid conditions provided by the fruit mimic a wet soil that encourages germination. However, the seeds also can germinate under moist soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/a1366tx.html|title=UCLA: The Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden|website=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivipary includes reproduction via embryos, such as shoots or [[Bulb#bulbil|bulbils]], as opposed to germinating externally from a dropped, dormant [[seed]], as is usual in plants;&lt;ref name= "HendersonKJH"&gt;Kenneth, John H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5727">The '''World Federation of Right to Die Societies''' is an international federation of associations that promote access to voluntary [[euthanasia]]. It holds regular international meetings on dying and death.

The World Federation, founded in 1980, consists of 45 right to die organizations from 25 countries. The Federation provides an international link for organizations working to secure or protect the rights of individuals to self-determination at the end of their lives.

== World Right to Die Day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldrtd.net/2-november-world-right-die-day|title=2 November World Right to Die Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
World Right to Die Day&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:World Federation of Right to Die Societies#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; is celebrated November 2 in countries such as France, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, and Venezuela. The celebration was founded in France at the WF Conference in 2008 and has since spread. The participating countries vary in their customs of celebration. This day also falls in with the celebration of [[Day of the Dead|Dia De Los Muertos]] in Mexico and is represented in the bigger cities as part of their celebration.

== Controversy ==
Cases of people choosing assisted suicide programs has been met with some controversy in the media and public. One famous case is that of [[Brittany Maynard]]. She was diagnosed with a terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life, but before that she chose to speak out about her situation and her choice, thus opening up the debate about the right-to-die movement in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=bf438873-8c70-46aa-9bbe-630d853fcfe7@sessionmgr105&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=124|title=Is Dying a Pro-Choice Issue?: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy also lies in issues regarding whether or not the right to die should be granted to those who are in a [[Minimally conscious state|Minimally Conscious State]] (MCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=23034669|title=The right to die in the minimally conscious state on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; MCS refers to people who have suffered neurological damage and will never fully recover, but still have some awareness.

Groups, such as The National Right to Life Committee, fight against the movement to legalize and promote the right to die. Their goal is to prevent the determination of handicapped and senior individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrlc.org/medethics|title=Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics {{!}} National Right to Life|website=www.nrlc.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World March for Peace and Nonviolence''' is an initiative of [[World without Wars]], an international organization which has worked for peace and nonviolence since 1995 and was created by the [[Humanist Movement]].

The project of the World March was launched in 2008 and is supported by hundreds of organizations and personalities in the Arts, Music, Politics, Literature, Sports, etc.

The March started October 2 (Gandhi's birthday), 2009 in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] and finished on January 2, 2010 in [[Punta de Vacas]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]]. The March was intended to rise worldwide awareness for nonviolence. Concrete demands of the March are: abolition of nuclear weapons;  withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories; the progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons; the signing of non-aggression treaties among nations and the renunciation by governments of war as a way to resolve conflicts.

The World March for Peace and Nonviolence is projected to include millions of individuals, on six continents in 90 countries, traveling some 160,000 kilometers.

==Demands put forward by world march==

* Nuclear disarmament at a global level.
* The immediate withdrawal of invading troops from occupied territories.
* The progressive and proportional reduction of conventional weapons.
* The signing of non-aggression treaties between countries.
* The renunciation by governments of the use of war as a means to resolve conflicts.

==Notable endorsers==
One of the key strategies to promote the March is to receive endorsements from as many celebrated personalities as possible in a variety of fields. These include: Nobel Prize winners, national presidents, sportsmen and women, actors and actresses, singers, composers etc.

Amongst this list are:
