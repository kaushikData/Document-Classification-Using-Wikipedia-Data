      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3811">'''1PN58''' ({{lang-rus|1ПН58}}) is the [[GRAU index]] for a Soviet designed passive [[Night vision device|night scope]] for a range of Soviet designed [[small arms]] and [[grenade launchers]]. ''1PN'' is the GRAU index of night vision devices, where PN stands for ''Nochnoy Pritsel'' ({{lang-rus|Ночной прицел}}) meaning night sight. It is also called NSPUM ({{lang-rus|НСПУМ}}).

The scope weighs 2&amp;nbsp;kg and measures 458&amp;nbsp;mm × 186&amp;nbsp;mm × 99&amp;nbsp;mm (length × height × width).

It is attached onto a matching side rail on the weapon after which a lever on the scope is pressed to hold it in place.

The 1PN58 comes in a metal container with room for extra batteries, battery charger and the other accessories, weighing 7.3&amp;nbsp;kg in total.

==Optics==
The scope gathers light into a refractor which can be protected with an aperture cover. The center of the cover has a circular aperture with dark glass allowing the scope to be used in light conditions that would otherwise saturate the light intensifier.

For zeroing the sight the left side of the scope has two perpendicular knobs, of which the elevation knob has a detachable scale. The scope comes with seven different, detachable elevation scales, one for each of the supported weapons.

The eyepiece has a detachable soft rubber eyecup.

The scope has a magnification of 3.5.

==Light Intensifier and Reticle==

On the left below the aperture the device has a brightness knob. Apart from powering on and off the device, this knob controls the brightness of the [[reticle]] allowing for the reticle to be visible without outshining the target.

The reticle has markings that match targets of various heights from 0.3&amp;nbsp;m to 2.7&amp;nbsp;m at distances ranging from 100&amp;nbsp;m to 970&amp;nbsp;m. This is similar to the reticle of the [[1PN51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ИЗДЕЛИЕ 1ПН51 ТЕХНИЧЕСКОЕ ОПИСАНИЕ И ИНСТРУКЦИЯ ПО ЭКСПЛУАТАЦИИ |trans-title= PRODUCT 1PN51 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS|date= January 1992 |page= 43|language= ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power==
The light intensifier is powered by a pack of 5 D-0,55S ({{lang-rus|Д-0,55С}}) rechargeable cells, providing up to 7&amp;nbsp;V. The scope requires 6.25&amp;nbsp;V. The current drawn is 7&amp;nbsp;mA.

The D-0,55S battery pack is used by a range of devices including 1PN51 and [[1PN51-2]] and has a separate charging device. The charging device has a switch to select one of 12&amp;nbsp;V or 27&amp;nbsp;V input and two red control lamps, one to indicate that power is available and one to indicate that charging is complete.

==Supported Weapons==
[[File:SpB-Museum-artillery-128.jpg|thumb|1PN58 mounted on a RPK-74N2]]
As of 1991 the 1PN58 can be used with the following weapons (weapons on the same line share the elevation scale):

[[Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova|SVDN2]],

[[AK-74|AK-74N2]] (AKS-74N2),

[[PK machine gun|PKMN2]] (PKMSN2),

[[RPG-7|RPG-7N2]] (RPG-7DN2),

[[AKM|AKMN2]] (AKMSN2),

[[RPK#RPK-74|RPK-74N2]] (RPKS-74N2),

[[RPK|RPKN2]] (RPKSN2).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1123">The '''AGO system''' is the industrial process for manufacturing stitchless ([[Adhesive|glued]]) shoes. 

The first effective and reliable [[adhesive]] was invented and patented in 1909 by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[chemist]] [[Francesco Rampichini]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rampichini.it/F-Rampichini.pdf Un pioniere della moderna industria conciaria e calzaturiera: Francesco Rampichini (1878-1958)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206200306/http://www.rampichini.it/F-Rampichini.pdf |date=December 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also developed the whole manufacturing process and the relevant machinery in 1910&amp;ndash;13.

The name AGO (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ago'', meaning "attract", "fasten"), still used in the industry, was chosen by Rampichini for the glue and the process in 1910.

'''''A Hacker Manifesto''''' is a critical manifesto written by [[McKenzie Wark]], which criticizes the [[commodification]] of information in the age of digital culture and globalization. It was published in the United States in 2004.

== Structure, style and influence ==
A Hacker Manifesto is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter including a series of short numbered paragraphs (a total of 389) that mimics the epigrammic style of [[Guy Debord]]’s [[The Society of the Spectacle]]. The opening sentence in the book, “A double spooking the world, the double of abstraction” &lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; is a clear homage to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]’ [[The Communist Manifesto]] which opens with the line “A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of Communism”.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, Engels, Friedrich. ''The communist manifesto''. 1848. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Wark builds on Marx and Engels’ ideas, alongside Deleuze and Guattari, by adding two new classes of workers into the mix - the “hacker class” and the “vectoralist class”.

As its title reads, the book really is a manifesto. It's a public declaration of principles for a radically new vision and a call to arms based on that vision. The written style is not 'difficult' in comparison to other post-structuralist philosophical texts; however in Wark's own words, it's "abstract". There are a few spelling/grammar mistakes and the language can be tricky to sink in at times, but its short, bullet style paragraphs depict a lot in the least possible space. Influenced by Marx, the book is awash with Communist Manifesto-like lingo, and Wark proceeds to link Marx's ideas to concepts in the current digital information age we live in, such as "intellectual property".

== Main ideas ==

=== Abstraction/hacker ===
For Wark, hacking begins with what he defines as an "abstraction", the construction of different and unrelated matters into previously unrealized relations. Hackers produce new conceptions, perceptions and sensations hacked out of raw data. Everything and anything is a code for the hacker to hack, be it "programming, language, poetic language, math, or music, curves or colourings" &lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and once hacked, they create the possibility for new things to enter the world. What they create is not necessarily "great", or "even good", but new, in the areas of culture, art, science, and philosophy or "in any production of knowledge where data can be extracted from it."

Wark argues that (new) information comes from the hack. It doesn't matter if you are a computer programmer, a philosopher, a teacher, a musician, a physicist, if you essentially produce new information - it's a hack [http://intertheory.org/wark-ruiz.htm]. In this sense, hackers are creators and they bring new ideas into the world. The aim of the book is to highlight the origins, purpose and efforts by this emerging hacker class, who produce new; concepts, perceptions, and sensations out of the stuff of raw data.

=== Commodification of information ===
The commodification of information is about how information that was free is appropriated by the vectoral class. McKenzie claims that free information is not a product, but a condition of the affective allocation of resources. There are many public and gift economies based around free information that keep the question of property open.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McKenzie Wark when information becomes a commodity it means we will only be able to see the information produced by the vectoral class. This is because they are the ones whose profits depend on the scarcity of information. So when information becomes intellectual property we are bound to repeat the same commodity form, because this is what the market decrees.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the previously mentioned hacker class that produces new information, free from the restrictions of a property form. This however is then used by the vectoral class, who own and control the means of production of information on an industrial scale. The hacker and the vectoral class aren’t always at odds with each other. They can compromise on the free flow of information and the extraction of wealth from this information to fund its development. Think of the open source movement, Reddit and Wikipedia. McKenzie Wark believes that the hacker class should ally themselves with the other producing classes so that they together don’t have to answer to the vectoral class anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vectoralist Class ===
The hacker's main opposition to creating a world where information is free, and free of scarcity, is what Wark denotes as the "vectoralist" class. Named for their control over vectors (i.e. various pathways and networks over which information flows), the vectoralist class are the modern day dotcom corporate giants, the transnational turbo-capitalist regime, who own the means of production and thus monopolize abstractions. They maintain control by waging "an intensive struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property", enforced by a series of patent and copyright laws that are used to separate the hacker class from the fruits of their labor.

== Reception ==
"Ours is once again an age of manifestos. Wark's book challenges the new regime of property relations with all the epigrammatic vitality, conceptual innovation, and revolutionary enthusiasm of the great manifestos." —Michael Hardt, co-author of ''Empire''

"A Hacker Manifesto will yield some provocative ideas and real challenges to a world in which everything is commodified." —Eric J. Iannelli, The Times Literary Supplement

"Wark- responds to the problems created by the current proliferation of digital culture. He pumps air back into Marxian categories and spices them up with Debord and Gautarri. As Millions of young people illegally download electronic information off the Internet, Wark sees possibilities for revolutionary politics grounded on the chaotic circulation of information freed from the regime of property." -William W. Sokoloff, ''Political Theory'', Vol. 34, No. 1 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20452438]

"Writers, artists, biotechnologists, and software programmers belong to the 'hacker class' and share a class interest in openness and freedom, while the 'vectoralist' and 'ruling classes' are driven to contain, control, dominate, and own. Wark crafts a new analysis of the tension between the underdeveloped and 'overdeveloped' worlds, their relationships to surplus and scarcity, and the drive toward human actualization." —Michael Jensen, The Chronicle of Higher Education [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674015432&amp;content=reviews]

'''BeIA''', or '''BeOS for Internet Appliances''', was a minimized version of [[Be Inc.]]'s [[BeOS]] [[operating system]] for [[embedded system]]s.

The BeIA system presents a browser-based interface to the user. The browser was based on the [[Opera browser|Opera]] 4.0 code base, and was named Wagner. Unlike the BeOS, which runs the Tracker and Deskbar at boot-up, the BeIA OS boots straight into the Opera browser interface (much like the later [[Google Chrome OS]]). While it is possible to boot BeIA into an interface similar to the standard BeOS, doing so involves special knowledge.

==BeIA compression techniques==
The BeIA operating system employs a number of techniques to minimise the system footprint. These involve a number of pre processes which yield an installable file system image.&lt;ref name="Patent referring to BeIA specific compression."&gt;BeIA compression patent  [https://web.archive.org/web/20161220123452/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;r=1&amp;l=50&amp;f=G&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=6883087.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F6883087&amp;RS=PN%2F6883087 United States Patent: 6883087]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CFS Filesystem''' was used to reduce the file system size. CFS (Compressed File System) was a file system created in house at Be Inc that aimed to compress the files within itself to save space. The filesystem had a similar set of properties to the native BeOS file system BFS, but some of the more advanced features (live queries and attributes) were either broken or non-functional in many of the Beta releases of the software.

The BeOS uses [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] format executable files, much as many other operating systems. BeIA uses an extended version of ELF, the name of which is unknown but which has come to be known as CELF, from the ''CEL'' magic word within the executable header and the fact that it is derived from ELF format executables through a compression process. The CELF (Compressed ELF) files use a patented technique to compress the op codes within the executable and reduce the overall footprint of each executable file. The file was compressed by creating a set of dictionaries that contain the op codes and are read by the kernel at start up and mapped into the executable in memory at run time. This makes the file fast loading, but has an extreme disadvantage, in that the dictionary is not extendible by the user and adding extra executable was not possible when using CELF compression techniques unless the executable symbols existed within the dictionary already present. The creation of CELF executables is generally done in batch. The entire system will be compressed and a file system image created from the crushed files.
 
'''Crushing''' was the term coined for the compression of the system using CELF format. BeIA can run either as CELF or ELF based. However, it can only use one or the other file formats.

==Versions==
The following BeIA versions were released to developers at stages of the development of the system.
*  Pre 1.0 build - reports to be 4.5.2, this is likely a hang over from the BeOS version. Pre numbering of BeIA.
* 1.0 beta 9 (uncrushed binaries are compatible with Release Candidate)
* 1.0 Release Candidate (circa the clipper)
* 1.0
* 2.0 (the version Dano seems to have been aimed at.)

==History==
BeIA is believed by many{{who|date=January 2013}} to be partially responsible for the death of Be, Inc., as sales were never anywhere near as high as anticipated.

During 2001, a [[Zanussi]] "internet fridge" toured the US with a BeIA powered DT-300 webpad docked in its door.

==List of BeIA devices==
* [[Sony eVilla]] - sold as a home web terminal with BeIA preloaded
* [[Compaq]] IA-1 - sold with either BeIA or [[MSN Companion]].
* [[Home Audio Reference Platform|HARP]] - not a computer, but a standard for audio streaming terminals, used by [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] in some of their stores
* [[Proview]] iPAD (PI-520B)
* [http://www.dtresearch.com/ DT Research] DT-300 (NB. DT-325 was used with later 2.0 betas)

'''Binapacryl''' was used as a [[miticide]] and [[fungicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/binapacryl.html Binapacryl] at alanwood.net&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemically, it is an [[ester]] derivative of [[dinoseb]].  Although binapacryl has low toxicity itself, it is readily [[metabolism|metabolized]] to form dinoseb, which is highly toxic.&lt;ref name=inchem/&gt;

International trade in binapacryl is regulated by the [[Rotterdam Convention]]; it has been withdrawn as a pesticide, since products were highly toxic to mammals, fish and aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/Reports/79.htm Pesticide Properties DataBase: Binapacryl]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Data Processing Associates''' ('''BDPA''') is a non-profit organization that serves the professional well-being of its stakeholders. BDPA provides resources that support the professional growth and technical development of minority individuals in the [[information technology]] industry.  Through education and leadership, BDPA promotes innovation, business skills, and professional development.  The organization has over 50 chapters throughout the United States.  BDPA National headquarters is located in [[Largo, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdpa.org/?page=About_BDPA About BDPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BDPA was founded in 1975 by [[Earl A. Pace, Jr]]. and David Wimberly after the two met in [[Philadelphia]] to discuss their concerns about [[ethnic minorities]] in the data processing field. The founders cited a lack of minorities in middle and upper management, low recruitment and poor preparation of minorities for these positions, and an overall lack of career mobility.

The founders built an organization of 35 members, hosted presentations to improve data processing skills and launched a job opportunities announcement service. This nucleus has grown to over 50 chapters throughout the United States and thousands of members. The organization is a catalyst for professional growth and technical development for those in the IT industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Digital Inclusion, Teens, and Your Library: Exploring the Issues and Acting on Them |author= Lesley S.

'''Cartrivision''' is an analog  [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format introduced in 1972, and the first format to offer [[feature film]]s for consumer rental.&lt;ref name="cedmagic"&gt;[http://www.cedmagic.com/history/cartrivision.html 1972: Cartrivision — The First VCR with Prerecorded Tapes], CED Magic, cedmagic.com. Article retrieved 2006-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by [[Frank Stanton (entrepreneur)|Frank Stanton]]'s [[Cartridge Television, Inc.]] (CTI), a subsidiary of [[Avco]],&lt;ref name="labguys"&gt;[http://www.labguysworld.com/Museum017.htm "Cartrivision — The First ALL American Home VCR!"], LabGuy's World (labguysworld.com). Article last updated 2005-01-09, retrieved 2006-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; who also owned [[Embassy Pictures]] at the time. Cartrivision was available in the form of a [[TV set]] with a built-in recorder for the format.&lt;ref name="labguys" /&gt; Cartrivision recorders and sets were manufactured by [[Avco]], a company that CTI partnered with to manufacture and develop the format, as well as Admiral, [[Packard Bell]], [[Emerson Radio|Emerson]], [[Montgomery Ward]], and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], the latter two marketing Cartrivision sets under their own brand names in their stores. While Montgomery Ward's TV used the Admiral chassis, as did all Montgomery Ward airline TVs, Admiral marketed their own Cartrivision with a different chassis.

The first model of Cartrivision-equipped TV set sold for US $1,350&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906419,00.html Television on a Disk], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Sept. 18, 1972. Retrieved 2006-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1350|1973|fmt=eq}}), and was the first videocassette recorder to have pre-recorded tapes of popular movies available for rent. Like Philips' [[Video Cassette Recording|Video Cassette Recording (VCR)]] format (introduced at the same time in Europe), the square Cartrivision cassette had the two reels of half-inch [[magnetic tape]] mounted on top of each other, but it could record up to 114 minutes. It did so using an open loop helical scan "[[skip-field]]" form of [[video format]] that recorded every other [[field (video)|video field]] and played it back three times. Citing {{US Patent|3718755}} "the present invention (of recording and playback) represents an improvement over the prior conventional skip-field systems..." "Such conventional systems are described in {{US Patent|3,359,365}} issued to Kihara on Dec. 19, 1967. 

Cassettes of major movies such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[Divorce Italian Style]]'', ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'', ''[[Two Rode Together]]'' and ''[[Brother Rat]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/18617712/ Cumberland Evening Times 6 July 1972  Page 11]&lt;/ref&gt;  were ordered via the initial 200-movie catalog at a [[retailer]], delivered by parcel mail, and then returned to the retailer after viewing. These rental cassettes were red, approximately {{convert|7|in|mm}} high by {{convert|6.5|in|mm}} wide by {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} deep (however used the same videotape used today) and could not be rewound by a home Cartrivision recorder.  Rather, they were rewound by a special machine upon their return to the retailer.&lt;ref name="mrbetamax"&gt;[http://www.mrbetamax.com/CartCassetteHist1.htm Cartrivision Cassette], mrbetamax.com. Article retrieved 2006-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cassettes on sports, travel, art, and [[how-to]] topics were available for purchase. These cassettes were black, and could be rewound on a Cartrivision recorder. An optional [[monochrome]] camera manufactured for Cartrivision by [[Eumig]] could be bought to make home videos. A color camera was in the works but never materialized before CTI's demise.

Avco Corp. introduced Cartrivision at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in New York in June 1970. It was first sold in June 1972, mainly through Sears, [[Macy's]], and Montgomery Ward [[department store]]s in the United States. Manufacture ended thirteen months later in July 1973&lt;ref name="cedmagic" /&gt; after poor sales. Later, it was found that Cartrivision tapes that had been stored in a warehouse had disintegrated due to humidity.&lt;ref name="labguys" /&gt;

After the demise of Cartrivision in 1973, many Cartrivision-equipped TV sets, separate recording mechanisms, tapes, and other parts and accessories were liquidated by surplus retailers, mainly in California, and many electronic hobbyists bought quite a few of the Cartrivision systems. Some made their own homebrew modifications with the hardware, such as a stand-alone Cartrivision player in its own chassis with a [[RF modulator]] to hook it up to any TV set, much like later VCRs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">'''Drilling fluid invasion''' is a process that occurs in a well being drilled with higher wellbore pressure (normally caused by excessive mud weights) than [[formation pressure]].  The liquid component of the [[drilling mud|drilling fluid]] (known as the [[mud filtrate]], or spurt) continues to "invade" the porous and permeable formation until the solids present in the mud, commonly [[bentonite]], clog enough pores to form a [[mud cake (oil and gas)|mud cake]] capable of preventing further invasion.

If invasion is severe enough, and reservoir pressures are unable to force the fluid and associated particles out entirely when the well starts producing, the amount of oil and gas a well can produce can be permanently reduced.  This is especially true when a process called [[phase trapping]] occurs.  This is when a fluid enters a formation that is below its [[irreducible saturation]] of that fluid.  Once the fluid is present, it is held in place by capillary forces and usually can not be removed.

Invasion also has significant implications for [[well logging]].  In  many cases the "depth of investigation" of a well logging tool is only a few inches (or even less for methods such as [[sonic logging|sonic logs]]), and it is quite possible that drilling fluid has invaded beyond this depth. In these cases readings are strongly influenced by mud filtrate properties rather than pure formation (in situ) properties. This influence must be considered when interpreting the resulting logs.

Using the API, an application can provide a custom interface, functionality or specialized operations not otherwise afforded by the eBay interface.

==Functionalities==

With the eBay API, developers can create programs that can
* Display eBay listings
* Get high-bidder information for sold items
* Get the current list of eBay categories
* Leave feedback about other users when finishing a commerce transaction  
* Retrieve lists of items a particular user is currently selling
* Retrieve lists of items a particular user has bid
* Submit items for listing on eBay
* View information about items listed on eBay

As the API does not depend upon the [[eBay UI|eBay User Interface]], this makes it possible to create stable, custom functionality and interfaces that meet business needs.

'''Eppendorf''', a company with its registered office in [[Germany]], develops, produces and sells products and services for laboratories around the world.

Eppendorf products are used in academic and industrial research laboratories, e.g. in companies in the pharmaceutical, biotech, chemical and food industries. They are also used in laboratories that perform clinical or environmental analysis, in forensic laboratories, and in industrial laboratories where industrial process analysis, production and quality assurance are performed. Eppendorf describes its business as consisting of three divisions: liquid handling, cell handling, and sample handling.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/products/competence-areas/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Eppendorf develops, produces and sells devices, [[consumables]] and services for laboratories. The liquid handling line includes products such as manual and electronic [[micropipette]]s, automated pipetting systems, and milliliter pipette controllers.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/products/competence-areas/liquid-handling/&lt;/ref&gt; The cell handling line includes products such as fermenters and [[bioreactor]]s and [[cell culture]] supplies.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/products/competence-areas/cell-handling/&lt;/ref&gt; The sample handling line includes products such as [[centrifuges]] and related accessories, PCR equipment, laboratory freezers, and reagent tubes.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/products/competence-areas/sample-handling/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eppendorf was founded in 1945 by Heinrich Netheler and Hans Hinz in the [[Hamburg]] district of [[Eppendorf, Hamburg|Eppendorf]] on the grounds of the University Hospital Eppendorf, originally as a workshop for medical devices.&lt;ref name=history&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/company/history/&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Netheler and Dr Hinz developed the first ultrasound device and the stimulator, a machine used for diagnosing and therapeutically treating muscle and nerve damage. They also invented an electrical thermometer (the “Thermorapid”) that, for the first time, enabled body temperature to be measured in just a few seconds.

In 1954, the company was renamed "Netheler &amp; Hinz GmbH".&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/company/history/founders/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Eppendorf Gerätebau, Netheler und Hinz GmbH was renamed Eppendorf AG and became a public company.

In 1961, Eppendorf launched the microliter [[pipette]] system. This allowed precise measurement of liquids. The first [[microcentrifuge]] was sold in 1962.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 1965, the company moved to a facility in Barkhausenweg in the Hamburg district of [[Hummelsbüttel]], where Eppendorf has been headquartered ever since.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Thomas Bachmann became Chief Executive Officer of the Eppendorf Group on August 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/company/boards/management/thomas-bachmann/&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2017, Eppendorf AG has subsidiaries in 26 countries and more than 3000 employees worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.eppendorf.com/en/company/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

Eppendorf sponsors awards for investigators which are awarded through [[Science Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/prizes/eppendorf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisitions==
In 2007, Eppendorf took over New Brunswick Scientific Co., an American company headquartered in [[Edison, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In January 2012, Eppendorf acquired DASGIP, a mid-sized German company headquartered in Jülich, Germany that manufactured parallel bioreactor systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laboratory-journal.com/news/company-news/eppendorf-acquires-dasgip-group|title=Eppendorf acquires DASGIP Group {{!}} Laboratory Journal – Business Web for Users in Science and Industry|last=KGaA|first=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.|website=www.laboratory-journal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frédéric Mazzella''' (born March 9, 1976&lt;ref name=capital&gt;{{cite web | last1=Miguet | first1=François | title=Les Petits Secrets de Frederic Mazzella, P-DG de BlaBlaCar | url=http://www.capital.fr/enquetes/hommes-et-affaires/les-petits-secrets-de-frederic-mazzella-p-dg-de-blablacar-1108914 | publisher=Capital | date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a French entrepreneur and the founder of [[BlaBlaCar]], an [[online marketplace]] for [[carpool]]s.

==Early life and education==
Mazella was classically trained as a pianist and was educated at some of the best schools in France. After majoring in maths, physics and chemistry at the [[Lycée Henri IV]], he received a [[Master of Physics]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (Normal Sup). While a student at Normal Sup, he received an internship in the [[robotics]] department of [[Stanford University]], designing a virtual tool to allow surgeons on [[NASA]] [[spaceflight]]s practice procedures before performing them on [[astronaut]]s. In 1999, he enrolled at Stanford in a Master's program in Computer Science.&lt;ref name=multi&gt;{{cite news | first=MATT | last=COWAN | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/blablacar | title=BlaBlaCar has turned ride-sharing into a multi-million-euro business | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After receiving a degree, he returned to Paris and began working for Kabira.&lt;ref name=multi/&gt; In 1999, he also worked as a consultant for Blue Pumpkin and in 2000, he worked as a [[research assistant]] for [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=capital/&gt;

===BlaBlaCar===
In December 2003, Mazella wanted to travel from Paris to visit his family in the French countryside for [[Christmas]] but he did not own a car and the trains were fully booked. After his sister made a 150 kilometer detour to collect him, he noticed that most cars going in his direction did not have any passengers. During nights and weekends, he began working on creating a concept to address the issue. By 2006, he bought a website called Covoiturage.fr, French for "carpooling".&lt;ref name=multi/&gt;

In 2007, Mazella enrolled at the [[Master of Business Administration]] program at [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref name=multi/&gt;

In 2008, along with Francis Nappez and Nicolas Brusson, he launched BlaBlaCar. In 2015, BlaBlaCar raised $200m bringing total funding to over $300m and valuing the company at $1.6bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/09/16/meet-europes-newest-unicorn-blablacar-raises-200-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/#1974531c1bf1|title=Meet Europe's Newest Unicorn: BlaBlaCar Raises $200 Million At $1.6 Billion Valuation|last=Chen|first=Liyan|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investments===
Mazella has invested in several technology startups including Bim App, Patatam, Happydemics, 
Gojob, Bnbsitter, Zenpark, Onfido, Yescapa, [[Shapr]], and StarOfService.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/frdric-mazzella/investments/investments_list | title=Frédéric Mazzella &gt; Personal Investments | work=[[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
In September 2015, Mazzella was ranked 49th on the [[WIRED]] list of top 100 digital influencers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Medeiros | first1=Joao | title=The 2015 WIRED 100: Frédéric Mazzella (No. 49) | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-2015-wired-100-frederic-mazzella| work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ground Combat Vehicle''' ('''GCV''') was the [[United States Army]]'s replacement program for [[Armoured fighting vehicles|armored fighting vehicles]] in [[Brigade combat team#Armored brigade combat team|Armored]] and [[Brigade combat team#Stryker brigade combat team|Stryker]] [[brigade combat team]]s. The GCV was organized under the ''Follow On Incremental Capabilities Package'' of the [[BCT Modernization]] program. The first variant of the vehicle was to be [[prototype]]d in 2015 and fielded by 2017. It replaced the canceled [[Future Combat Systems]], [[Future Combat Systems manned ground vehicles|manned ground vehicles]] program.&lt;ref name = replace&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.asdnews.com/news/21975/Army_Partially_Terminates_FCS_Manned_Ground_Vehicle.htm |title= Army Partially Terminates FCS Manned Ground Vehicle | work = ASD News |date= 21 July 2009 | accessdate = 27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ground Combat Vehicle program was cancelled in February 2014.&lt;ref name="defensenews6april14"&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140406/DEFREG02/304060009/US-Army-Marines-Struggle-Infantry-Vehicle-Replacements US Army, Marines Struggle With Infantry Vehicle Replacements] - Defensenews.com, 6 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Specific design elements of the GCV were contracted out, though the Army designed the architecture and retained overall responsibility for synchronization. This contrasted with the former [[Future Combat Systems manned ground vehicles|FCS manned ground vehicles program]] where contractors had more control over the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Dorothy |last= Ramienski | url = http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?nid=35&amp;sid=1713120 |title= Army Implements New BCT Modernization Quickly after FCS |work=Federal News Radio | publisher =[[WFED]] |date=8 July 2009 | accessdate = 14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCV was to be [[BCT Network|networked]] and offer improved survivability, while using the state-of-the-art mobility and power management functions. The military released classified details of the FCS Manned Ground Vehicles program to interested contractors to be utilized in design proposals for the GCV. The GCV family was to be built around a common [[chassis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://defense-update.com/newscast/0909/news/220909_ground_combat_vehicle.html | title =US Army Defines Ground Combat Vehicles (GCV) Priorities |work = [[Defense Update]] |publisher= Lance &amp; Shield | accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:File-BCT Ground Combat Vehicle Program2.jpg|thumb|right|The GCV was planned to be [[BCT Network|networked]].]]
The GCV was to be operable with the current ''battle command control and communications suite'' but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the [[BCT Network]]. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the [[BCT Soldier]] subsystems. The system would be capable of integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.&lt;ref name = GCVspecs&gt;{{cite web | url= http://defense-update.com/features/2010/january/gcv_army_details_100110.html |title= US Army Outlines Ground Combat Vehicles Priorities |work=[[Defense Update]] | publisher = Lance &amp; Shield | accessdate = 26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobility===
The GCV must have been transportable by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by the dimensions of the [[C-130 Hercules]], which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious [[C-17 Globemaster III]]. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30&amp;nbsp;mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power.&lt;ref name=GCVspecs /&gt; The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs.&lt;ref name= IFVspecs /&gt; The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-doing-the-math/ | title = Abrams Dieselization Project: Doing the Math | publisher = Defense media network | date = 7 November 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its standard configuration the IFV would have a crew of three and carry a squad of nine. The vehicle could be reconfigured to support [[casualty evacuation]]. The Army stated no preference as to whether the IFV should be tracked or wheeled but suggested that it be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements.&lt;ref name=IFVspecs&gt;{{cite web |first= Bettina |last= Chavanne |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&amp;id=news/GCV120409.xml|title=New Combat Vehicle for U.S. Army| work= Aviationweek |publisher= |date= December 4, 2009|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lighter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey: Make Ground Combat Vehicle lighter|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2010/06/army_gcv_casey_062110w/|publisher=Army Times Publishing Company|accessdate=16 August 2010|author=Matthew Cox|date=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offensive capabilities===
The Army wanted the vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, [[autocannon]], [[coaxial weapon]], and an [[anti-tank guided missile]] system. The weapons suite had to be manually operable when damaged and the commander's weapon station had to incorporate a shield.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry day #1|url=http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/gcv/ID_1_Master_19Oct091.pptx|accessdate=19 September 2010|author=MT Kash|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722183427/http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/gcv/ID_1_Master_19Oct091.pptx|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor weapon would be carried on board.&lt;ref name="Industry day 1" /&gt; The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.&lt;ref name=Optimizing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20Narrative.pdf |title=The ground combat vehicle strategy: Optimizing for the future |publisher=U.S. Army |accessdate=December 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044607/http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20Narrative.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCVspecs/&gt;

In May 2012, the Army's Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System (PM MAS) began to emphasize the need for munitions suppliers to begin readying for GCV IFV ammunition needs.  Solutions ranged from 25&amp;nbsp;mm to 50&amp;nbsp;mm, but [[30x173mm]] was identified as "the most likely" design to meet lethality and stowed kill requirements.  Specific requirements were for [[Airburst round|airburst]] capability to defeat infantry targets (with high explosive incendiary recognized as a "less effective alternative"), [[armor-piercing]] rounds to defeat material threats, and training ammunition for each tactical round.  Potential candidates included five U.S. produced and three foreign-made rounds.  On 7 August 2013, a sources sought announcement was made for a [[Cooperative Research and Development Agreement]] for 30x173 mm ammunition: 2,700 rounds of Mk 238 Mod 1 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer (HEI-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 258 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 268 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); and 2,000 rounds of Mk 317 Target Practice Discarding Sabot-Tracer (TPDS-T).  The announcement called for the cartridges to be compatible with the Bushmaster III weapon system, such as XM813 and/or [[Mk44 Bushmaster II|Mk 44 Mod 1]].  All interested participants had to provide the ammo quantities and associated information before the end of March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/army-refines-30mm-ammunition-efforts-for-gcv/ Army Refines 30mm Ammunition Efforts for GCV] - Defensemedianetwork.com, 18 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countermeasures===
The Army wanted the GCV to have a passive blast protection level equal to the [[MRAP]] and would utilize [[active protection system|hit avoidance systems]].&lt;ref name=GCVspecs/&gt; The Army wanted to install an [[active protection system]] on the Ground Combat Vehicle.

===Budget concerns and proposed cuts===
In December 2012, it was reported that the Army may need to cut $150 million from the GCV program in 2014, with deeper cuts between $600–700 million between 2014 and 2018. This put the program, one of the Army's highest priorities, at serious risk. With the drawdown of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and budgetary concerns, the expensive development of a new combat vehicle was not seen as feasible. [[BAE Systems]] and [[General Dynamics]] were each awarded engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase contracts in August 2011. The EMD phase was to last 48 months for both contractors, but there were arguments for only one to proceed as a cost-saving measure. This would present the problem of selecting a vehicle based on design outlines, rather than on real prototypes. Another suggestion was to lengthen the EMD period to allow for smaller contract awards over time. This might delay the operational deadline beyond the planned 2018 date. The underlying concern is the fact that the Army plans to spend 80 percent of its ground combat vehicle budget on GCV development from 2013-2018. With 1,847 [[GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle]]s expected to be acquired, they would make up only 10 percent of the Army combat vehicle fleet. Redirected funds could be shifted to modernization efforts for the combat-proven [[Stryker]], [[M1 Abrams]], and [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|Bradley]] families of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidedefense.com/201212052418071/Inside-Defense-General/Public-Articles/massive-gcv-cuts-on-the-table-as-army-reviews-program/menu-id-926.html "Massive GCV Cuts On The Table As Army 'Reviews' Program"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130127175742/http://insidedefense.com/201212052418071/Inside-Defense-General/Public-Articles/massive-gcv-cuts-on-the-table-as-army-reviews-program/menu-id-926.html |date=27 January 2013}}.

===Revision===
The GCV acquisition strategy was revised on 17 January 2013 to further reduce risk and maintain affordability of the program. The revision extended the technology development phase by six months to give industry more time to refine vehicle designs. Milestone B would occur in 2014, with the selection of a single vendor for the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and production phases of the program. This would initiate critical design and testing activities in anticipation of vehicle production. Budgetary pressures caused the reduction of number of vendors to be selected from two to one.&lt;ref name="3rd revision"&gt;{{cite news|title=Army Ground Combat Vehicle Acquisition Strategy Revised|url=http://www.army.mil/article/94605/|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=Army.mil|date=18 January 2013|author=US Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBO report===
On 2 April 2013, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) issued a report on the progress of the GCV program. The report questioned the program, estimated to cost $28 billion from 2014–2030, with the possibility of alternate vehicle options. While none met overall Army goals desired in the GCV, they offered advantages in being less costly and delayed. Planned GCV prototypes were heavy, weighing up to 84 tons, to be better protected and seat a nine-man squad. Officials said that a vehicle of that size would not be well suited to operations faced in Iraq or Afghanistan. Alternate vehicles would be cheaper and more maneuverable in urban settings. The CBO report analyzed four alternative options:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2013/04/03/report-gcv-is-worst-choice-to-replace-bradley/ Report: GCV is worst choice to replace Bradley] – DoDBuzz.com, 3 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44044 The Army’s Ground Combat Vehicle Program and Alternatives] – CBO.gov, 2 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Purchase the [[Namer]] APC – Seats 9 soldiers with combat survival rates expected slightly higher than the GCV, and costs $9 billion less. The Namer has less ability to destroy other enemy vehicles and is less mobile. Production would be conducted in part domestically, but fielding would require collaboration with foreign companies and governments.
* Upgrade the Bradley IFV – An upgraded Bradley would be more lethal than the GCV against enemy forces and would probably survive combat at about the same rates as would the GCV, saving $19.8 billion. Upgrading the Bradley would make it "significantly more capable" than the GCV. The Bradley still only carries a 7-man squad and has less mobility.
* Purchase the [[Puma (IFV)]] – More lethal than the GCV, combat survival and protection at better rates, and just as mobile. Purchasing the Puma would save $14.8 billion and was considered the most capable of the vehicles. Puma IFVs only carry six infantrymen, which would require five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys. Development and production would require collaboration with foreign companies and governments.
* Cancel the Ground Combat Vehicle – If the Army reconditioned its current Bradley instead of replacing them, the current capability of the IFV fleet could be maintained through 2030. The Army could continue to investigate ways to improve the current Bradleys, but it would not field any new or improved vehicles. The $24 billion saved in funding could be used on other programs.

General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who received contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying they used the wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did not account for the change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25&amp;nbsp;mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30&amp;nbsp;mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2013/04/04/army-industry-slam-cbos-scathing-gcv-report/ Army, industry slam CBO’s scathing GCV report] – DoDBuzz.com, 4 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding cut and prioritization===
On 29 July 2013, Army Chief of Staff General [[Ray Odierno]] warned that the Ground Combat Vehicle program might be delayed or possibly even cancelled because of the sequestration budget cuts. Although he specifically said it could be delayed, he did not rule out the possibility of cancellation. The GCV was high-priority for the Army to give better protection than the M2 Bradley, but because of the sequester cuts everything was being considered. On 1 August 2013, Defense Secretary [[Chuck Hagel]] outlined two basic results if the effects of sequestration continued: modernization programs like the GCV would be cut to maintain troop levels, or high-end capability efforts like the GCV would be preserved to continue modernization and keep equipment technologically advanced with troop levels being cut. Odierno was committed to balancing soldiers, readiness, and modernization, and was intent on the need for the Ground Combat Vehicle. Suggested alternative options, such as further upgrading the Bradley and buying currently available infantry fighting vehicles like the German Puma, were recommended as cost-saving measures. Army leaders said the Puma's low troop-carrying capacity would require buying five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys, and that upgrading the Bradley would essentially be engineering a new vehicle. While these options would offer no improvement over the fleet's current capability, not pursuing the GCV would allow the money to be spent elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/07/30/gcv-in-danger-of-cancelation.html?ESRC=todayinmil.sm Odierno: GCV in Danger of Cancelation] – Military.com, 30 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/article/20130805/NEWS04/308050022/Ground-Combat-Vehicle-may-delayed-canceled "Ground Combat Vehicle may be delayed – or canceled"], ''Army Times'', 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reports{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} suggested that the [[Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle]] program to replace the [[M113]] family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the [[Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle]] (AMPV) fleet would cost over $5 billion, the [[Government Accountability Office]] estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] said the AMPV would be a better buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 [[Congressional Research Service]] report suggested that given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131002/DEFREG02/310020011/US-Army-Looks-Delay-Increase-Cost-AMPV-Program US Army Looks To Delay, Increase Cost of AMPV Program] – Defensenews.com, 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Army leaders say having a large ground army is still necessary for deterrence and "[[regime change]]" operations. They also realize that their equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current equipment for the rest of the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in the future will be used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2013/11/army-regime-change-maybe-gcv-probably-not/ Big Army For Big Wars? Yes! GCV? Probably Not] – Breakingdefense.com, 13 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2014, a spending bill passed by the House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29–34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce the weight of the vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140115/NEWS05/301150035/Ground-combat-vehicle-budget-slashed-cancellation-more-likely |title=Ground Combat Vehicle Budget Slashed, Cancellation More Likely |last1=Bacon |first1=Lance M. |date=15 January 2014 |work=Military Times |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140118/DEFSECT02/301180024/US-Army-s-GCV-Program-Downgraded-Study-Project US Army's GCV Program Downgraded To Study Project] – Defensenews.com, 18 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/01/22/gcvs-loss-will-reset-army-buying-priorities.html?ESRC=todayinmil.sm GCV's Loss Will Reset Army Buying Priorities] – Military.com, 22 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on 23 January 2014, General Ray Odierno confirmed that the Ground Combat Vehicle program was being put on hold due to budget difficulties. He said that the Army needed a new IFV but that they could not afford one at the time. Odierno said that he was pleased with the requirements for the vehicle and that progress and development with the contractors was good. "Leap-ahead technologies" that make the vehicle light and mobile while still being protected against RPGs and roadside bombs are still desired. In the past decade, mobility was traded for protection, but Army war games caused the service to decide it will need small, mobile formations to be deployed quickly in the future, and recent conflicts showed the need for expeditionary forces to be transported quickly to remote areas in small packages with as little support as possible; weight estimates of 70 tons for the GCV IFV did not make it easily deployable. The Army may direct some funds for technology development so it can start another program within "three to four years."&lt;ref name="defensenews23jan14"&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140123/DEFREG02/301230041/US-Army-Chief-Confirms-Ground-Combat-Vehicle-Dead-Now- US Army Chief Confirms: Ground Combat Vehicle Is Dead (For Now)] – Defensenews.com, 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Science and technology investments were to be made to address the size and weight of armored ground vehicles to make it easier and cheaper to transport greater numbers of them across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140128/NEWS/301280010/Army-leaders-preview-lighter-faster-service "Army leaders preview lighter, faster service"], ''Military Times'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
The Pentagon FY 2015 budget proposal unveiled on 24 February 2014 cancelled the GCV program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://swampland.time.com/2014/02/24/pentagon-to-cut-army-to-pre-world-war-ii-levels/ | title = Pentagon to Cut Army to Pre-World War II Levels | newspaper = Time | date = 24 February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Army acquisition executive [[Heidi Shyu]] said that criticism of the program was "unfortunate" and cancelling it had nothing to do with vehicle performance.  She said the program had been doing "remarkably well" and wasn't having technical issues, and that the contracts were being executed well.  The decision to cancel development was based entirely on budget calculations, with no possible way to come up with funds no matter how many other areas were reduced.  Money will be redistributed to engineering change proposals (ECP) on existing platforms until budget difficulties pass to allow investment in next-generation capabilities in about seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140225/DEFREG02/302250025/US-Army-Official-Defends-GCV-Against-Attacks- US Army Official Defends GCV Against 'Attacks'] - Defensenews.com, 25 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision had to be made to either exclusively fund the GCV or ECPs, so upgrades were chosen for the Bradley, Abrams, Stryker, and [[M109 Paladin]] fleets to have them more combat-capable in the near-term, should they be needed for an international situation.  Vehicles like the Bradley and Abrams have been upgraded since the 1980s with new armor, sensors, and other gear that have maxed out the platforms for further horsepower and electrical advances, so the requirement for an entirely new ground combat vehicle built from the outset from lessons learned in combat from the previous decade remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/03/shyu-sings-the-army-electric-services-2015-budget-sacrifices-weapons-for-electronics/ Shyu Sings The Army Electric: 2015 Budget Sacrifices Weapons For Electronics] - Breakingdefense.com, 3 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Army's own budget proposal unveiled on 4 March discontinued the program, and instead funds were shifted to the AMPV program as the main vehicle priority and to improving the Bradley IFV in the interim until more resources become available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2014/03/04/army-2015-budget-kills-gcv-cuts-readiness/ Army 2015 Budget Kills GCV, Cuts Readiness] - DoDBuzz.com, 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/121217/FY15_Army_budget__request_includes_small_pay_raise__490K_end_strength/ FY15 Army budget, request includes small pay raise, 490K end strength] - Army.mil, 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Incremental improvements will be made to current vehicle fleets to improve protection and networking abilities.  $131 million will be directed into science and technology to look at the feasibility of future combat vehicle technologies, and Secretary Hagel has directed the Army, as well as the Marine Corps, to deliver "realistic" visions for vehicle modernization by the end of FY 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1435 Army Budget Makes Force Structure, Modernization Cuts Official] - Nationaldefensemagazine.org, 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The cancellation of the GCV is the second time in 15 years an Army program to replace the Bradley has failed.  FCS ran from 1999 to 2009, with the Manned Ground Vehicles portion for replacing several armored vehicle classes costing "hundreds of millions" of dollars out of $20 billion total.  From 2010 to 2014, the Army spent over $1 billion on the GCV.  Although there was criticism that vehicle weight could not be kept at a reasonable level while meeting its size and power requirements, the Army maintains the official reason for the cancellation was budgetary pressures.  BAE Systems and General Dynamics will each receive $50 million in FY 2015 to continue technology development.  The next follow-up IFV development program is currently named the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV).&lt;ref name="defensenews6april14"/&gt;

===Continued technology development===
On 18 July 2014, BAE and General Dynamics were awarded $7.9 million study contracts for technical, cost, and risk assessments to salvage subsystems and other technologies created under the GCV for use in the FFV system.  General Dynamics will utilize the GCV integrated propulsion and mobility subsystems Automotive Test Rig (ATR), and the conventional drive integrated propulsion subsystem, while BAE will utilize the GCV TD phase integrated hybrid-electric propulsion and mobility subsystems ATR and the hybrid-electric integrated propulsion subsystem (Hotbuck).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/army-attempts-to-salvage-gcv-technology-advances/ Army Attempts to Salvage GCV Technology Advances] - Defensemedianetwork.com, 25 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2014/08/gcv-ffv-technologies.html Army asks BAE Systems and General Dynamics to recycle GCV vetronics for Future Fighting Vehicle] - Militaryaerospace.com, 18 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army was using an incremental approach to combat vehicle modernization, centered on the Ground Combat Vehicle. The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of existing vehicles. Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113 family of vehicles]] such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|Bradley]] and [[Stryker]] vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on the rate at which the GCV was introduced.&lt;ref name=Replace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20Narrative.pdf |title=The Ground Combat Vehicle Strategy: Optimizing for the Future |work=[[United States Army]] |publisher= |accessdate=14 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044607/http://www.bctmod.army.mil/GCV_focus/GCV%20Narrative.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Cox |url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4271063&amp;c=AME&amp;s=LAN |title=U.S. Army Details Ground Combat Vehicle Plans |work=[[Defense News]] |publisher=Army Times Publishing Company |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=13 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although upgraded, the Bradley and Stryker would also be replaced in the midterm.&lt;ref name=Replace/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2207">'''Hyalobarrier''' is a substance to keep tissue apart post surgery and therefore prevent [[adhesions]]. It contains autocross-linked [[hyaluronan]]. Highly viscous due to condensation. Hyaluronan is present in cartilage and skin hence there is a natural [[metabolic pathway]] for it. This gel is used to separate organs and tissue after surgery. 
Scientific documentation so far covers the gynaecology speciality. IE [[Laparoscopic surgery]], [[hysteroscopy]]/hysteroscopic surgery but also [[open surgery]].
According to data in a [[Cochrane collaboration]] review barrier agents may be a little more effective in preventing adhesions than no intervention. The Cochrane report also states that the incidence of postsurgical adhesions is as high as 50 to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ahmad G, O'Flynn H, Hindocha A, Watson A |title=Barrier agents for adhesion prevention after gynaecological surgery |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD000475 |year=2015 |pmid=25924805 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD000475.pub3 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000475.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a recent review by C Sutton (University of Surrey, Guilford UK), it is stated that Hyalobarrier is the only anti adhesive substance that has published data for intrauterine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sutton C |title=Adhesions following surgery: pathogenesis and current experience with adhesion barriers |journal=Surg Technol Int |volume=18 |issue= |pages=144–56 |year=2009 |pmid=19579202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IQAir''' is a Swiss and U.S. based company that specializes in technology [[solution]]s that help protect people from airborne pollutants. IQAir implements this technology in residential, commercial and public buildings. IQAir also engages in international projects that create ultra-clean living and working environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shareholder Agenda: Tea and Blank Pages |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/business/24suits.html |date=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IQAir Perfect 16 |publisher=Extreme Makeover |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8cxQ_VvboQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baby Jaelyn Gets a Heart |url=http://www.andersoncooper.com/videos/0-d5uafg8e/?__hstc=56977397.a00b510d88dba5eda9a5ef0d59b3e49f.1376935472882.1376950580462.1377031647670.3&amp;__hssc=56977397.2.1377031647670 |publisher=Anderson Cooper 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company’s history goes back to 1963, when brothers Manfred and Klaus Hammes introduced an air filter system for residential coal ovens in Germany. The product was initially sold to help reduce the black dust build-up on the walls behind ovens. Soon though, Manfred Hammes, a lifelong [[asthma]] sufferer, noticed that the filter reduced his flare-ups during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=History of Air Cleaning |journal=Floor Care Professional Magazine |date=June 2006 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus Hammes continued through the 1960s and ’70s to adapt the air filter for other heating systems such as [[radiators]], [[baseboard heating]] and [[forced-air]] heating and cooling systems. In 1982, Klaus Hammes relocated the company headquarters to Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the early ’90s, Frank Hammes, Klaus' oldest son, joined the family business. After promoting an after-market cabin air filter the company had developed for [[Mercedes-Benz]] automobiles, Frank Hammes turned his attention to portable room air cleaners. Dissatisfied with existing products, he set out to build a line of portable air purifiers with medical grade air cleaning performance. Frank Hammes and a small team of Swiss and German engineers worked for four years on the project. In the spring of 1998, IQAir shipped its first HealthPro air purifier from its Swiss factory. IQAir air purifiers were initially available only in Europe and Asia, but became available in the United States in 2000. In 2001, Klaus Hammes' second son, Jens Hammes, joined the business and helped the expansion of IQAir in Asia and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=Every week we receive takeover bids |url=http://www.cash.ch/news/front/wir_erhalten_jede_woche_uebernahmeangebote-3111727-449 |work=Cash |date=12 August 2013 |title=Wir erhalten jede Woche Übernahmeangebote |first=Von Daniel |last=Hügli |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
IQAir currently has products that fall into four product categories:

'''1. Portable room air purifiers'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=IQAir |title=Compact Stand-Alone Air Purifiers |url=http://www.iqair.com/commercial-compact-stand-alone-filtration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First introduced in 1998, the modular design of its portable room air purifiers allowed IQAir to create different models with optimized air filtration technology for the removal of specific groups of air pollutants. One of IQAir’s most popular models is the IQAir HealthPro Plus (HealthPro 250 outside North America), which uses three separate filter stages that are arranged in a modular tower design. In August 2012, the company announced a major overhaul of its portable room air purifiers with the designation "New Edition" or "NE."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IQAir's New Edition Redefines High-Performance Air Purification |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/05/idUS89412+05-Sep-2012+PRN20120905}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new air cleaners have improved airflow, filter life and reduced sound levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The World's Best Air Purifiers Just Became The Quietest |publisher=IQAir |date=September 2012 |url=http://www.vdta.com/Magazines/SEP12/fc-IQAirSept12.html |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2. Large commercial air cleaning systems'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=High-Capacity Stand-Alone Filtration |url=http://www.iqair.com/commercial-high-capacity-stand-alone-filtration |publisher=IQAir}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In July 2013, IQAir introduced on its website two new commercial air cleaning systems: the CleanZone SL and CleanZone 5000. These two systems are intended for larger commercial spaces such as open plan [[offices]], hospitals and [[classrooms]]. The CleanZone SL is a slim, wall-mounted air cleaning system for particularly noise-sensitive indoor environments. The CleanZone 5000 is a large, mobile air cleaning system that is available in various configurations to address specific groups of particulate and gaseous air pollutants.

'''3. HVAC-based air cleaning'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perfect 16® |url=http://www.iqair.com/perfect-16-whole-house-air-purifier |publisher=IQAir |access-date=30 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930215635/http://www.iqair.com/perfect-16-whole-house-air-purifier |archive-date=30 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, IQAir introduced its first air cleaning system to work in conjunction with ducted forced-air heating, ventilation and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems. The Perfect 16 derives its name from being the first independently tested residential and commercial air cleaning system for HVAC systems to achieve the highest [[minimum efficiency reporting value]] (MERV 16) under the [[ASHRAE]] 52.2 test format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Test of One IQAir Perfect 16 ID-2225 Air Filter |publisher=ETL SEMKO |url=http://issuu.com/iqair/docs/intertek-studies-p16-2225-2530-aircleaners1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characteristics of the system include very low [[pressure drop]] and a filter life of up to 3 years.

'''4. Air Quality Monitoring'''

In 2000, IQAir introduced a line of hand-held optical [[particle counter|particle counters, to measure airborne particle concentration]]s.

In 2017, IQAir added AirVisual products to its product line.  The AirVisual Pro is a low-cost air quality monitoring station that can be used to sense air quality indoors and outdoors. Air quality is transmitted to the AirVisual air quality data platform and made available through the AirVisual App and website.

== Research studies ==
The IQAir Science and Technology Team provides technical support to academic researchers from around the world conducting health and environmental intervention studies.

In a peer-reviewed 2015 study funded by CARB (California Air Resources Board), researchers at the [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/on-board-school-bus-filtration-system-reduces-pollutants-by-88-percent UCLA Fielding School of Public Health] found that an IQAir school bus air purification system was able to reduce harmful air pollutants by 88 percent.

In a peer-reviewed 2015 passenger vehicle study funded by CARB, researchers at the [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es404952q?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=esthag UCLA Fielding School of Public Health] found that an IQAir high-efficiency cabin air filtration was able to reduce ultra-fine particle exposure by 93% while keeping carbon dioxide concentrations in the range of 620-930 ppm.

A CARB funded study by [https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/apr/past/11-311.pdf Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] investigating reducing in-home exposure to air pollution, found that IQAir MERV16 filtration on a supply system provided the greatest reductions in outdoor pollutant levels with indoor time-averaged concentrations that were lower than corresponding outdoor levels by 97– 98% for PM2.5, 97–99% for UFP, and at least 84–92% for BC and at least 97% for ozone. 

A two-year study conducted by [https://www.arb.ca.gov/research/apr/past/11-324.pdf UC Davis] and funded by CARB, focused on households with asthmatic children finds that the use of high-efficiency filtration improves indoor air quality. Installation of IQAir stand-alone air cleaners and high-efficiency filters in central air conditioning systems, were shown to improve indoor air quality across all particle size fractions, with the greatest improvement in the smaller size fractions. The study also found that while participants did not report reduced asthma symptoms, they did have fewer visits to doctor’s offices and hospitals for asthma care and slept better if they also kept their bedroom door closed.

== Special projects ==
'''Hospital projects'''

IQAir products are used in hospitals around the world for [[infection control]]. The [[Hong Kong Hospital Authority]] selected IQAir portable air purifiers to help against the spread of [[SARS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Hong Kong Hospitals Get New Tool for the Fight Against SARS; Specialized Air Cleaners to Be Used to Take Virus Out of the Air |publisher=IQAir |date=16 October 2003 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hong+Kong+Hospitals+Get+New+Tool+for+the+Fight+Against+SARS%3B...-a0108907670 |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the Journal of Hospital Infection reported that an IQAir Cleanroom H13 air purifier reduced [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)]] contamination in hospital isolation rooms. The researchers concluded: "This portable HEPA-filtration unit can significantly reduce MRSA environmental contamination within patient isolation rooms, and this may prove to be a useful addition to existing MRSA infection control measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2005.11.011 |title=Reduction in MRSA environmental contamination with a portable HEPA-filtration unit |year=2006 |last1=Boswell |first1=T.C. |last2=Fox |first2=P.C. |journal=Journal of Hospital Infection |volume=63 |pages=47–54 |pmid=16517004 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted at [[Singapore General Hospital]] and published in the American Journal of Infection Control in 2010 found that the use of IQAir portable air purifiers with HyperHEPA filtration reduced the spread of invasive [[aspergillosis]] (IA) by 50%. The researchers concluded: "The cost of widespread portable HEPA filtration in hospitals will be more than offset by the decreases in nosocomial infections in general and in IA in particular."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2009.09.014 |title=The impact of portable high-efficiency particulate air filters on the incidence of invasive aspergillosis in a large acute tertiary-care hospital |year=2010 |last1=Abdul Salam |first1=Zakir-Hussain |last2=Karlin |first2=Rubiyah Binte |last3=Ling |first3=Moi Lin |last4=Yang |first4=Kok Soong |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=e1–7 |pmid=20129702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Bigeleisen''' (pronounced ''BEEG-a-lie-zen''; May 2, 1919 &amp;ndash; August 7, 2010) was an American [[chemist]] who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] on techniques to extract [[uranium-235]] from uranium ore, an isotope that can sustain [[nuclear fission]] and would be used in developing an [[atomic bomb]] but that is less than 1% of naturally occurring uranium. While the method of using photochemistry that Bigeleisen used as an approach was not successful in isolating useful quantities of uranium-235 for the war effort, it did lead to the development of isotope chemistry, which takes advantage of the ways that different isotopes of an element interact to form chemical bonds.

==Biography==
Bigeleisen was born on May 2, 1919, in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. His mother wanted him to go to college and a friend suggested that he study chemistry, noting that Paterson's dye companies that served the textile plants there would always need chemists. He attended the University College of [[New York University]] in the [[Bronx]], earned a master's degree in 1941 from [[Washington State University]] and was awarded a doctorate in 1943 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Chang, Kenneth. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/science/31bigeleisen.html "Jacob Bigeleisen, Isotope Chemist on Manhattan Project, Dies at 91"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 30, 2010. Accessed August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manhattan Project===
He became part of the Manhattan Project at [[Columbia University]], where he worked on methods to achieve the separation of the uranium-235 from the more plentiful isotope uranium-238 needed to complete an atomic bomb using the [[enriched uranium]]. The method of photochemistry that Bigeleisen researched did not lead to an effective method of separating the uranium isotopes, and [[gaseous diffusion]] and methods that took advantage of the electromagnetic properties of uranium proved to be more effective means of [[isotope separation]]. Bigeleisen's research led to the development of isotope chemistry based on the principle that heavier isotopes formed stronger [[chemical bond]]s allowing for the creation of a straightforward theory to explain the progress of chemical reactions through the interaction of isotopes in gaseous form, which he did together with [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]], who would later win the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Chemists can gain a better understanding of a chemical reaction by using different isotopes to analyze the differing reaction rates, which has allowed for advances in [[chemical physics]], [[geochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Bigeleisen, Jacob. [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/147/3657/463 "Isotope chemistry has opened new areas of chemical physics, geochemistry, and molecular biology"], ''[[Science (magazine)]]'', January 29, 1965, Vol. 147. no. 3657, pp. 463 - 471. Accessed August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bigeleisen developed the basic theories of the effect of isotopic substitution on chemical equilibrium ([[Equilibrium_constant#Effect_of_isotopic_substitution|equilibrium isotope effect]]) and on reaction rates ([[kinetic isotope effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler, K.J.]] ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987), p.427  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research he did in collaboration with [[Harold Urey]] that studied the varying levels of [[isotopes of oxygen]] in marine fossils allowed for the determination of the water temperature that prevailed while the animals were alive.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

In an address in March 1983 at Washington State University at ceremonies where he was awarded the college's Distinguished Alumni Award, Bigeleisen advocated on behalf of nuclear disarmament, saying that "we have to stop putting our efforts into building more and more bombs" and that the time had come to start dismantling the tens of thousands of nuclear warheads in the nation's stockpile. While saying that he didn't regret his participation in the Manhattan Project. he said that "having lived through that time, that any further use of nuclear weapons is out of the question".&lt;ref&gt;via [[United Press International]].

== British Army ==
A recruit was still entitled to return the shilling until becoming subject to [[martial law]] upon formal [[Affirmation in law|attestation]] before a [[Justice of the Peace]].&lt;ref name="bbch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="warof1812" /&gt; At this point, a more substantial [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] was paid to the new recruit, which fluctuated from two [[guineas]] to a high of [[£sd|£]]23/17/6d in 1812.

However, this payment generally was quickly lost to various duties and dues, such as uniform.
The monetary amount of this bounty, which might be equivalent to half a year's wages for the average unskilled worker,&lt;ref name="coss" /&gt; was enough to persuade most potential recruits to join.&lt;ref name="warof1812"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warof1812.ca/recruit.htm|title=Taking the King's Shilling: Recruitment for the British Army, 1812|publisher=The Discriminating General|author=Robert Henderson|date=2001|archivedate=2014-05-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512215203/http://www.warof1812.ca/recruit.htm|accessdate=2014-05-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who hesitated were often won over by making them intoxicated with strong drink.&lt;ref name="warof1812" /&gt; The bounty was lucrative enough for some to repeatedly [[Desertion|desert]], then reenlist: one man was hanged in 1787 for doing so 47 times.&lt;ref name="bbcs" /&gt;

The pay for a [[private (rank)|private]] in the [[English Army]] was originally one shilling a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Francis Grose]]|title=Military antiquities respecting a history of the English Army, from the conquest to the present time.| publisher = Bavarian State Library| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8zhTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA413| year =  1786| isbn =  | page = 413|oclc=21135023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A soldier was expected to pay for food and clothing out of their wages after using the initial sign-up bounty to purchase their initial equipment. It was not until 1847 that a limit was placed on deductions, ensuring that each soldier was paid at least one [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]] (a twelfth of a shilling) a day, after deductions.&lt;ref name="bbch" /&gt;

Novel incentives were sometimes used to persuade soldiers to enlist in the army. [[Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon]] was known to tour [[Scotland]] with a shilling in her lips for anyone wishing to join up to take.&lt;ref name="bbcs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hansard91"&gt;{{cite hansard |house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] |date=October 15, 1991|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1991-10-15a.209.0|speaker=[[Nicholas Fairbairn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 song "[[I'll Make a Man of You]]" posits a "new recruiting scheme" in which the female singer states: "On Saturday I'm willing, if you'll only take the shilling, to make a man of any one of you." &lt;ref&gt;"I'll Make a Man of You (Recruiting Song)," words by Arthur Wimperis; music by Herman Finck. Francis, Day and Hunter, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal Navy ==
[[impressment|Press gangs]] had the power to compel British seamen into the Royal Navy. A man forced unwillingly into the Navy in this way was given the King's shilling, but was often offered a chance to volunteer: a volunteer would be eligible for an advance of two months' wages and would be treated more favourably than their pressed counterparts.&lt;ref name="broadside" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fubar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon L.|title=FUBAR : soldier slang of World War II|date=2007|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|location=Botley, Oxford, U.K.|isbn=1846031753|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPx1hL-vZZsC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothes and equipment, such as a [[hammock]], had to be bought from the ship's [[purser]] out of the advance. Volunteers were also protected from [[creditor]]s, up to the value of £20.&lt;ref name="rnm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impressment |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_impressment.htm |publisher=[[Royal Naval Museum]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |archivedate=14 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PYvjhTal?url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_impressment.htm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are recurring tales of sailors being pressed after a shilling was slipped into their drink,&lt;ref name="bbcs" /&gt; leading to glass-bottomed [[tankard]]s. However, this is likely to be a [[myth]], for the Navy could press by force, rendering [[deception]] unnecessary.&lt;ref name="broadside" /&gt;

It has been used metaphorically for other activities paid for by the [[British Government]]. Employees of [[Post Office Ltd|post offices]] that were [[bailed out]] have been referred to as taking the shilling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110112/debtext/110112-0001.htm#11011258002774|column=298|speaker=[[Michael Connarty]]|date=January 12, 2011|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as have [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs accused of lobbying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1992-07-06a.119.0&amp;s=%22king%27s+shilling%22#g125.5|speaker=[[Barry Sheerman]]|date=July 6, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] militia in [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction = Republic of Ireland|url = http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1934020700033?opendocument|house = Dáil Éireann|date = 7 February 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[judge]]s upon taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/amlr42&amp;div=67&amp;id=&amp;page=|title = Book Reviews|last = Atlay|first = J.B.|date = 1908|journal = American Law Review|accessdate = |doi = |volume = 42|page = 935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was mentioned in [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s [[s:Sons and Lovers/Chapter 8|''Sons and Lovers'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=D.H.|title=[[s:Sons and Lovers|Sons and Lovers]]|date=1913|publisher=[[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworth]]|location=London|authorlink=D.H.

The term was also mentioned in the [[BBC]] drama, ''[[Our Girl]]''.

The phrase is used in the 1968 song "[[Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)]]" by the British band [[The Zombies]], which is written from the perspective of a butcher serving on the front lines in [[World War I]].

The term is used in the BBC television series ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'' (Episode 3.6) by the character Thomas Shelby.  Addressing subordinates he says, "When you take the King's shilling, the King expects you to kill.", in reference to killings that he had ordered.

* [[RTV-A-2 Hiroc]] (High-altitude Rocket)
* [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] (SM-65, CGM-16): Former ICBM launched from silo, the rocket was modified and used in 1962-1963 for four manned [[Mercury-Atlas]] flights, and was used, along with the [[Agena (rocket)|Agena]] or [[Centaur (rocket)|Centaur]] upper stages, as a medium-lift satellite and interplanetary probe launcher for NASA and the USAF.  Original design, with "balloon tanks" and "1.5 staging," has since been retired and replaced with the [[Atlas V]], which has an internal structure similar to the Titan ICBM, but using conventional propellants.
* [[HGM-25A Titan I|Titan I]] (SM-68, HGM-25A): Based in underground launch complexes.  Used LOX/RP-1 propellants like Atlas, but stored in conventional tanks.
* [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] (SM-68B, LGM-25C): Former hypergolic-fueled ICBM launched from silo, the rocket was used in 1965-1966 for ten manned [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] flights and its two-stage core was modified into the heavy-lifting [[Titan III]] and [[Titan IV]] rockets.  All Titan II, III, and IV models have since been retired.

* [[JL-2]] SLBM

==France==
[[France]]'s proximity to Russia made only [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s and [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s necessary for strategic deterrence, while smaller warheads have been used as free-fall bombs and on airborne [[cruise missile]]s or [[short-range ballistic missile]]s ([[Pluton (missile)|Pluton]] and [[Hadès]]).

===Active===
[[France]] now only deploys submarine-launched ballistic missiles, with all land based IRBMs decommissioned in September 1996. The French Air Force and French Navy retain aircraft-carried nuclear-tipped cruise missiles ([[SCALP-EG]]) to fulfill the pre-strategic role (tactical-sized weapons used as "ultimate warning" before launching an all-out strategic strike). 
* [[M45 SLBM]] (progressively retired)

[[Game engine]]s are tools available for game designers to code and plan out a game quickly and easily without building one from the ground up. Whether they are 2D or 3D based, they offer tools to aid in asset creation and placement.

== Engines ==
&lt;!-- Please: In the table below, avoid overlinking. Link only one (1), early, obvious instance of a given topic, such as a game engine, programming language, license, etc. Try to put links with a more significant project where they will last, instead of a minor project where they are more likely to be deleted. --&gt;
Note: The following list is not exhaustive. Also, it mixes game engines with rendering engines as well as API bindings without any distinctions.

'''Molecular wires''' (or sometimes called molecular nanowires) are molecular chains that conduct electric current. They are the proposed building blocks for molecular 
electronic devices. Their typical diameters are less than three nanometers, while their lengths may be macroscopic, extending to centimeters or more.

==Examples==
Most types of molecular wires are derived from organic molecules. One naturally occurring molecular wire is [[DNA]]. Prominent inorganic examples include polymeric materials such as Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0025-5408(84)90054-0|journal=Mater.

==Structure==
[[File:636 single side.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The structure of a Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; molecular wire. Mo atoms are blue, iodine atoms are red and sulphur atoms are yellow.]]
Unlike the more usual nanowires (which are very thin crystals), molecular nanowires are composed of repeating monomers. In the case of [[DNA]], the repeat units are the nucleotides with a backbone made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of bases. In case of Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the repeat units are Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; clusters, which are joined together by flexible sulfur or iodine bridges. 
Molecular nanowires can be manipulated and investigated as single molecules, but they often aggregate in solution into swatches or bundles. In the case of the Mo chalcogenide-halides, they grow in the form of ordered strands, in which the individual strands are linked by very weak Van der Waals forces. Individual molecules can be manipulated, ordered and their length can be controlled with atomic force microsope tips.

==Conduction of electrons==
Molecular wires conduct electricity. They typically have non-linear current-voltage characteristics, and do not behave as simple ohmic conductors.  The conductance follows typical power law behavior as a function of temperature or electric field, whichever is the greater, arising from their strong one-dimensional character. Numerous theoretical ideas have been used in an attempt to understand the conductivity of one-dimensional systems, where strong interactions between electrons lead to departures from normal metallic ([[Fermi liquid]]) behavior. Important concepts are those introduced by [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]], [[Luttinger]] and [[Wigner]]. Effects caused by classical Coulomb repulsion (called [[Coulomb blockade]]), interactions with vibrational degrees of freedom (called [[phonon]]s) and [[Quantum decoherence|Quantum Decoherence]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Synthesis ==
Various methods have been developed for the synthesis of different types of [[molecular wires]] (e.g. organic molecular wires and inorganic molecular wires).&lt;ref&gt;James, D. K.; Tour, J. M., Top. Curr. Chem. 2005, 257, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle is to build repetitive molecular structures that are connected together to conduct electricity. Organic molecular wires are usually synthesized via [[transition metal]]-mediated cross-coupling reactions. Inorganic molecular wires are grown at conditions that allow formation of one-dimensional inorganic structures.

===Organic Molecular Wires===
Organic molecular wires usually consist [[aromatic rings]] connected by ethylene group or [[acetylene]] groups. Transition metal-mediated cross-coupling reactions are used to connect simple building blocks together in a convergent fashion to build organic molecular wires. For example, a simple oligo(phenylene ethylnylene) type molecular wire (B) was synthesized starting from readily available 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene (A).&lt;ref&gt;Tour, J. M. et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2001, 7, 5118.&lt;/ref&gt; The final product was obtained through several steps of [[Sonogashira coupling]] reactions.

[[File:21 fig. 1.png|thumb|Fig. 1: Synthesis of a simple organic molecular wire]]

Other organic molecular wires include [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[DNA]]. Carbon nanotubes can be synthesized via various nano-technological approaches. DNA can be prepared by either step-wise [[DNA synthesis]] on solid-phase or by DNA-polymerase-catalyzed replication inside cells.

===Inorganic Molecular Wires===
Inorganic molecular wires consist of one-dimensional cluster structures that are usually held together by [[ionic bonds]]. These materials can be synthesized at high temperature. For example, a typical synthesis of Mo6S9-xIx was performed in sealed and vacuumed quartz [[ampoule]].&lt;ref&gt;Mihailovic, D. Progress in Materials Science 2009, 54, 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The commercially available [[molybdenum]] sheet metal, sulfur powder, and [[iodine]] were mixed at the desired ratio. The ampoule was slowly heated to a temperature of 1343 K, the sample was kept at that temperature for 72 hours and was then slowly cooled down to obtain the molecular wires.

==Nanowires in [[molecular electronics]] ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mreza11-2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A molecular scale circuit made from 5 nm diameter gold nanoparticles (GNPs) connected by conducting MoSI wires. The diameter of the wires is 0.9 nm. Red dots label the GNPs, green dots label the connections with no GNPs.]] --&gt;To be of use for connecting molecules, MWs need to self-assemble following well-defined routes and form reliable electrical contacts between them. To reproducibly self-assemble a complex circuit based on single molecules. Ideally, they would connect to diverse materials, such as gold metal surfaces (for connections to outside world), biomolecules (for nanosensors, nanoelectrodes, molecular switches) and most importantly, they must allow branching. The connectors should also be available of pre-determined diameter and length. They should also have covalent bonding to ensure reproducible transport and contact properties. 

DNA-like molecules have specific molecular-scale recognition and can be used in molecular scaffold fabrication. Complex shapes have been demonstrated, but unfortunately metal coated DNA which is electrically conducting is too thick to connect to individual molecules. Thinner coated DNA lacks electronic connectivity and is unsuited for connecting molecular electronics components. 

Some varieties of [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs) are conducting, and connectivity at their ends can be achieved by attachment of connecting groups. Unfortunately manufacturing CNTs with pre-determined properties is impossible at present, and the functionalized ends are typically not conducting, limiting their usefulness as molecular connectors. Individual CNTs can be soldered in an electron microscope, but the contact is not covalent and cannot be self-assembled. 

Possible routes for the construction of larger functional circuits using Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;9−x&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MWs have been demonstrated, either via gold nanoparticles as linkers, or by direct connection to thiolated molecules. The two approaches may lead to different possible applications. The use of GNPs offers the possibility of branching and construction of larger circuits.

===Other research===
Molecular wires can be incorporated into [[polymer]]s, enhancing their mechanical and/or conducting properties. The enhancement of these properties relies on uniform dispersion of the wires into the host polymer.  MoSI wires have been made in such composites, relying on their superior solubility within the polymer host compared to other nanowires or nanotubes. Bundles of wires can be used to enhance tribological properties of polymers, with applications in actuators and potentiometers. It has been recently proposed that twisted nanowires could work as electromechanical nanodevices (or torsion nanobalances) to measure forces and torques at nanoscale with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=J. C.|last2=Justo|first2=J. F.|title=Twisted ultrathin silicon nanowires: A possible torsion electromechanical nanodevice|journal=Europhys.

Typically the Hg–C bond is stable toward air and moisture but sensitive to light.

==Synthesis==
Organomercury compounds are generated by many methods, including the direct reaction of hydrocarbons and mercury(II) salts.  In this regard, organomercury chemistry more closely resembles organopalladium chemistry and contrasts with [[organocadmium compound]]s.

===Mercuration of aromatic ring===

Electron-rich [[arene]]s undergo direct '''mercuration''' upon treatment with [[Mercury(II) acetate|Hg(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

The first such reaction, including a mercuration of [[benzene]] itself was reported by [[Otto Dimroth]] between 1898 and 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Directe Einführung von Quecksilber in aromatische Verbindungen | journal = [[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | year = 1898 | pages = 2154–2156 | author = [[Otto Dimroth]] | doi = 10.1002/cber.189803102162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ueber die Einwirkung von Quecksilberoxydsalzen auf aromatische Verbindungen | journal = [[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | year = 1899 | pages = 758–765 | author = [[Otto Dimroth]] | doi = 10.1002/cber.189903201116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ueber die Mercurirung aromatischer Verbindungen | journal = [[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | year = 1902 | pages = 2032–2045 | author = [[Otto Dimroth]] | doi = 10.1002/cber.190203502154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addition to alkenes===

The Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center binds to alkenes, inducing the addition of [[hydroxide]] and [[alkoxide]].  For example, treatment of [[methyl acrylate]] with mercuric acetate in [[methanol]] gives an α--mercuri ester:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | vauthors = Carter HE, West HD | title = dl-Serine | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 774 | year = 1955 | prep = cv3p0774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Hg(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(HgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The resulting Hg-C bond can be cleaved with [[bromine]] to give the corresponding [[alkyl]] bromide:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(HgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHBrCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  BrHgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is called the '''Hofmann-Sand Reaction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K. A. Hofmann |author2=J. Sand | journal = [[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] | title = Ueber das Verhalten von Mercurisalzen gegen Olefine | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1340–1353 | year = 1900 | doi = 10.1002/cber.190003301231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction of Hg(II) compounds with carbanion equivalents===
A general synthetic route to organomercury compounds entails alkylation with [[Grignard reagent]]s and [[organolithium compound]]s.  Diethylmercury results from the reaction of [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercury chloride]] with two equivalents of ethylmagnesium bromide, a conversion that would typically be conducted in [[diethyl ether]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Synthetic Methods of Organometallic and Inorganic Chemistry Volume 5, Copper, Silver, Gold, Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury | editor = W.A. Herrmann | isbn = 3-13-103061-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hg is a [[density|dense]] liquid (2.466 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that [[boiling point|boils]] at 57&amp;nbsp;°C at 16 [[torr]]. The compound is slightly soluble in ethanol and soluble in ether.

Similarly, diphenylmercury (m.p.&amp;nbsp;121–123&amp;nbsp;°C) can be prepared by reaction of mercury chloride and [[phenylmagnesium bromide]].  A related preparation entails formation of [[phenylsodium]] in the presence of mercury(II) salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Calvery, H. O. | title = Diphenylmercury | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 228 | year = 1941 | prep = CV1P0228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===

Hg(II) can be alkylated by treatment with [[diazonium salt]]s in the presence of copper metal.  In this way 2-chloromercuri-naphthalene has been prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Nesmajanow, A. N. | title = β-Naphthylmercuric Chloride | collvol = 2 | collvolpages = 432 | year = 1943 | prep = CV2P0432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phenyl(trichloromethyl)mercury]] can be prepared by generating dichlorocarbene in the presence of phenylmercuric chloride.  A convenient carbene source is [[sodium trichloroacetate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Logan, T. J. | title = Phenyl(trichloromethyl)mercury | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 969 | year = 1973 | prep = cv5p0969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compound on heating releases [[dichlorocarbene]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;HgCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;HgCl  +  CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Reactions==
Organomercury compounds are versatile synthetic intermediates due to the well controlled conditions under which they undergo cleavage of the Hg-C bonds.  [[Diphenylmercury]] is a source of the phenyl radical in certain syntheses.  Treatment with aluminium gives triphenyl aluminium:
:3 Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Hg  +  2 Al  &amp;rarr;  (AlPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 Hg
As indicated above, organomercury compounds react with halogens to give the corresponding organic halide.
Organomercurials are commonly used in [[transmetalation]] reactions with lanthanides and alkaline-earth metals.

Cross coupling of organomercurials with organic halides is catalyzed by palladium, which provides a method for C-C bond formation.
Usually of low selectivity, but if done in the presence of halides, selectivity increases.  Carbonylation of lactones has been shown to employ Hg(II) reagents under palladium catalyzed conditions. (C-C bond formation and Cis ester formation).&lt;ref&gt;"Reactivity control in palladium-catalyzed reactions: a personal account" Pavel Kocovsky J. Organometallic Chemistry 687 (2003) 256-268. {{doi|10.1016/j.jorganchem.2003.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Due to their toxicity and low [[nucleophilicity]], organomercury compounds find limited use. The [[oxymercuration reaction]] of alkenes to alcohols using mercuric acetate proceeds via organomercury intermediates. A related reaction forming phenols is the [[Wolffenstein–Böters reaction]]. The toxicity is useful in antiseptics such as [[thiomersal]] and [[merbromin]], and fungicides such as [[ethylmercury]] chloride and [[phenylmercury acetate]].

[[Mercurial diuretic]]s such as [[mersalyl acid]] were once in common use, but have been superseded by the [[thiazide]]s and [[loop diuretic]]s, which are safer and longer-acting, as well as being orally active.

===Thiol affinity chromatography===
[[Thiol]]s are also known as mercaptans due to their propensity for ''mer''cury ''capt''ure. Thiolates (R-S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[thioketone]]s (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=S), being [[HSAB theory|soft]] [[nucleophile]]s, form strong coordination complexes with mercury(II), a soft electrophile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Clayden|author2=Nick Greeves|author3=Stuart Warren|title=Organic Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQgu2j_ber0C&amp;pg=PA658|date=2012-03-15|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-927029-3|pages=658}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This mode of action makes them useful for [[affinity chromatography]] to separate thiol-containing compounds from complex mixtures. For example, organomercurial agarose gel or gel beads are used to isolate thiolated compounds (such as [[thiouridine]]) in a biological sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Masao Ono  |author2=Masaya Kawakami  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Separation of Newly-Synthesized RNA by Organomercurial Agarose Affinity Chromatography | journal = [[J. Biochem.]] | year = 1977 | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 1247–1252 | pmid = 19428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palm is developed, designed, and marketed by Palm Ventures Group, a [[San Francisco]]-based start up founded by [[Dennis Miloseski]] and [[Howard Nuk]]. Palm Ventures is financially backed by Chinese electronics company [[TCL Corporation|TCL]] that owns the Palm trademark, originally of [[Palm, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/38779/news/tcl-acquires-palm-brand-preps-for-comeback|title=TCL Acquires Palm Brand, Preps for Comeback|date=2015-01-06|work=PCMag UK|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-welland-tribune/20181016/281767040192149|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Palm is marketed as "an ultra-mobile companion" device that is meant to be used in conjunction with a regular smartphone—positioning it as a cross-over between a wearable and a smartphone. It features a 3.3-inch display, very small by industry standards at the time, and is also very lightweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/palm-plans-comeback-with-tiny-phone-stephen-curry-endorsement|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45876934|title=Tiny Palm smartphone baffles gadget fans|last=Kleinman|first=Zoe|date=2018-10-16|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is especially used in the surroundings of [[six sigma]] projects.  It has first been established by [[AT&amp;T]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The PPI is calculated as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{PPI} = \frac{\text{savings} \times \text{probability of success}}{\text{cost} \times \text{time of completion}}&lt;/math&gt;

A high PPI suggests a high project priority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4966">'''The Plate Boundary Observatory''' (PBO) is the geodetic component of the EarthScope Facility. EarthScope is an earth science program that explores the 4-dimensional structure of the North American Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EarthScope|website=EarthScope|accessdate=9 April 2015|location=http://www.earthscope.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; EarthScope (and PBO) is a 15-year project (2003-2018) funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] in conjunction with the [[NASA]]. PBO construction (an NSF MREFC) took place from October 2003 through September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNAVCO|title=Plate Boundary Observatory: The first five years|date=2009|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 of operations and maintenance concluded in September 2013. PBO is currently in phase 2 of operations, which will end September 2018.

PBO precisely measures Earth deformation resulting from the constant motion of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates in the western United States. These Earth movements can be very small and incremental and not felt by people, or they can be very large and sudden, such as those that occur during earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The high-precision instrumentation of the PBO enables detection of motions to a sub-centimeter level. PBO measures Earth deformation through a network of instrumentation including: high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, strainmeters, seismometers, tiltmeters, and other geodetic instruments. The GAGE Facility (Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope), operated by UNAVCO, Inc., is responsible for instrument installation, ongoing maintenance, communications, data archiving, data processing, and data availability for the instrumentation. [[UNAVCO]] is a non-profit university-governed consortium that facilitates geoscience research and education using geodesy.

The PBO GPS network includes 1100 stations extending from the Aleutian Islands south to Baja and eastward across the continental United States. During the construction phase, 891 permanent and continuously operating GPS stations were installed, and another 209 existing stations were integrated (PBO Nucleus stations) into the network. Geodetic imaging data is transmitted, often in realtime, from a wide network of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] stations, augmented by [[seismometers]], strainmeters and tiltmeters, complemented by InSAR ([[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]]), [[LiDAR]] (light-activated radar), and [[geochronology]]. 
 
The GPS stations are categorized into clusters. The transform cluster is near the [[San Andreas Fault]] in [[California]]; the subduction cluster is in the [[Cascadia subduction zone]] (northern California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and southern [[British Columbia]]); the extension cluster is in the [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] region; the volcanic cluster is in the [[Yellowstone caldera]], the [[Long Valley caldera]], and the [[Cascade volcanoes]]; the backbone cluster is at 100–200&amp;nbsp;km intervals across the United States to provide complete spatial coverage.

[[Image:EarthScope-geosensor.jpg|thumb|An EarthScope GPS sensor, a component of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) system.]]

Data from the PBO is transmitted to UNAVCO to the data center where it is collected, archived and distributed. These data sets are freely and openly available to the public, with equal access provided for all users. PBO data includes the raw data collected from each instrument, quality-checked data in formats commonly used by PBO's various user communities, and processed data such as calibrated time series, velocity fields, and error estimates.

Some scientific questions that are being addressed by the EarthScope project and the PBO include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams, M.L., K.M. Fische r,  J.T. Freymuelle r,  B. Tikoff, A.M.

[[File:Makeup Powder Puffs - Πομ πον μακιγιαζ.JPG|thumb|Powder puffs]]
'''Powder puffs''' are pieces of soft material used for the application of [[face powder]]. They may be shaped as balls or pads.

Historically, powder puffs have been made of very fine [[down feather]]s, cotton, fine [[Wool|fleece]], etc. In modern times [[Synthetic chemical|synthetic material]]s are widely used for powder puffs.

In addition to softness, an important characteristic of powder puffs is their intake ability, i.e., the ability to hold powder.  It was reported that for [[synthetic fiber]]s important factors in designing high-intake powder puffs are mostly geometric ones: fiber diameter, [[pile (textile)|pile]] length, and space between fibers, with little dependence on material factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200518/000020051805A0742682.php "Intake Ability of Powder Puffs Made of Synthetic-fiber Cloths"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716234829/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200518/000020051805A0742682.php |date=2011-07-16 }}, Journal of the Japan Research Association for Textile End-Uses (2005), vol. 46, no. 8. 519-528. &lt;/ref&gt;

Powder puffs have been used as a stereotype image for soft, careless [[femininity]], as seen, e.g., in the term "[[Powderpuff (sports)|powderpuff sports]]", including collegiate sorority flag football leagues. The name of the [[Powerpuff Girls]] is a pun on "powder puff".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
 
American inventor [[Ellene Alice Bailey]] (1853-1897) patented several versions of powder puffs and has been described as "America’s powder puff pioneer".&lt;ref name=collecting&gt;{{cite web|last=Compactstory|url=http://collectingvintagecompacts.blogspot.com/2012/02/in-search-of-first-american-compact.html |title=In Search of the First American Compact  Part 2|website=Collecting Vintage Compacts|date= February 10, 2012|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Product engineering''' refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production [[manufacturing]] process. Product [[engineering]] usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. These product characteristics are generally all sought in the attempt to make the resulting product attractive to its intended [[Market (economics)|market]] and a successful contributor to the business of the organization that intends to offer the product to that market. It includes design, development and transitioning to manufacturing of the product. The term encompasses developing the concept of the product and the design and development of its mechanical, electronics and [[software]] components. After the initial design and development is done, transitioning the product to manufacture it in volumes is considered part of product engineering.

For example, the engineering of a [[digital camera]] would include defining the feature set, design of the optics, the mechanical and [[ergonomic design]] of the packaging, developing the electronics that control the various component and developing the software that allows the user to see the pictures, store them in memory and download them to a [[computer]]. 

Product engineering is an [[engineering]] discipline that deals with both design and [[manufacturing]] aspects of a product.

==Area of responsibility==

* Product engineers define the yield road map and drive the fulfillment during ramp-up and volume production,
* Identify and realize measures for yield improvement, test optimization and product cost-ability methods,
* Define qualification plan and perform feasibility analysis.

Product engineers are the technical interface between the component development team and the production side (Front End and Back End), especially after the development phase and qualifications when the high volume production is running.

Product engineers improve the product quality and secure the product reliability by balancing the cost of tests and tests coverage that could impact the production fall-off. They support failure analysis request from customers.

==Knowledge and skills==

The job requires the product engineer to have a very good working knowledge of:

* Statistical methods and tools
* Manufacturing process
* Software, hardware and systems implementation 
* Product reliability and qualification
* Physical analysis methods
* [[Computer-aided design]] and simulation programs
* Specific technology
* Strong product Knowledge
* Strong analytic work methodology and problem solving skills
* Continuous Improvement Knowledge

==Tools==
A product engineer will use a wide range of tools and software, possibly including:
20/20, AutoCad, CATIA, PTC Creo, Solidworks, Unigraphics, Labview, JMP, DataConductor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5234">The '''reciprocating chemical muscle (RCM)''' is a mechanism that takes advantage of the superior [[energy density]] of [[chemical reactions]]. It is a regenerative device that converts chemical energy into motion through a direct noncombustive chemical reaction.

==Function==
RCM is capable of generating [[Autonomic Computing|autonomic]] wing beating from a chemical energy source. It can also be used to provide a small amount of electricity to the onboard control systems. It further helps in differential lift enhancement on the wings to achieve roll, pitch, and hence, steered flight. The RCM technique is particularly useful in the manufacturing of insect-like [[micro air vehicle]]s. The first generation of RCMs was large and had a reciprocating frequency around 10&amp;nbsp;Hz. The later generations&lt;ref&gt;http://angel-strike.com/wiki/index.php?title=File:RCM-Generations.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; developed were very much smaller and lighter. Also, the reciprocating frequency of this generation RCM was as high as 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The reciprocating chemical muscle was invented by Prof. [[Robert C. Michelson]] of the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] and implemented up through its fourth generation by Nino Amarena of ETS Laboratories.

==Benefits==
Particular benefits of the RCM are:
*It requires no ignition source (thereby allowing it to work in explosive atmospheres).
*It is independent of external oxidant (thereby allowing it to operate under water or in oxygen-free environments such as the lower atmosphere of the planet [[Mars]]).
*It [[Thermoelectricity|thermoelectrically]] generates electrical energy from its own exothermic metabolism.
*It converts chemical potential energy directly into [[kinetic energy]] with greater [[energy density]] than batteries.&lt;ref name="IME-JAE"&gt;Michelson, R.C., ''Novel Approaches to Miniature Flight Platforms,'' Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, Vol. 218 Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, Special Issue Paper 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;363–373&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The reciprocating chemical muscle uses various [[monopropellant]]s in the presence of specific [[catalyst]]s to create gas from a liquid without [[combustion]].&lt;ref name="NIAC"&gt;Colozza, A., Michelson, R.C., ''et al.'', ''Planetary Exploration Using Biomimetics – An Entomopter for Flight on Mars,'' [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/522Colozza.pdf Phase II Final Report (see chapter on fuels)], NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Project NAS5-98051, October 2002.  [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/abstracts/448Colozza.pdf abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  This gas is used to drive reciprocating opposing cylinders (in the fourth-generation device) to produce sufficient motion (throw) with sufficient [[force]] and [[frequency]] to allow flapping-wing flight.  As of 2004, the RCM had been demonstrated in the Georgia Tech Research Institute laboratory to achieve sufficient throw, force, and frequency for operation of a 50-gram [[entomopter]] while using high concentration (&gt; 90%) [[hydrogen peroxide]] in the presence of a proprietary catalyst developed by ETS Laboratories.&lt;ref name="VonKarmen"&gt;Michelson, R.C., Naqvi, M.A., ''Extraterrestrial Flight (Entomopter-based Mars Surveyor),'' von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics RTO/AVT Lecture Series on Low Reynolds Number Aerodynamics on Aircraft Including Applications in Emerging UAV Technology, Brussels Belgium, 24–28 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific uses==
The reciprocating chemical muscle was developed as a drive mechanism for the flapping wings of the entomopter.  The RCM reuses energy many times before releasing it into its surroundings.&lt;ref name="Neurotechnology"&gt;Michelson, R.C., 'Neurotechnology for Biomimetic Robots,'' {{ISBN|0-262-01193-X}}, The MIT Press, September 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;481 – 509, (chapter author)&lt;/ref&gt;  First, it converts mainly heat energy into flapping-wing motion in the entomopter.  Then, heat is scavenged for [[Thermoelectricity|thermoelectric]] generation in support of ancillary systems.  Waste gas from the chemical decomposition of the fuel is then used to create a [[FMCW|frequency modulated continuous wave]] acoustic ranging signal that is [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] insensitive (used for obstacle avoidance).  Waste gas is then passed through an ejector to entrain external atmospheric gases to increase mass flow and decrease waste gas temperature so that lower-temperature components can be used downstream.  Some waste gas is diverted into gas bearings for rotational and linear moving components.  Finally, remaining waste gas is vectored into the wings where it is used for circulation-controlled lift augmentation ([[Coanda effect]]).  Any remaining gas can be used for [[vectored thrust]], but if the gas budgets are correctly designed, there should be no extra gas beyond the circulation control points.  The features of the RCM are tailored to the entomopter to conserve energy.&lt;ref name="IME-JAE"/&gt;

'''Recirculating aquaculture systems''' ('''RAS''') are used in home aquaria and for [[fish]] production where [[water]] exchange is limited and the use of [[biofiltration]] is required to reduce [[ammonia]] toxicity.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of [[filtration]] and environmental control are often also necessary to maintain clean water and provide a suitable [[habitat]] for fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page=192 |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main benefit of RAS is the ability to reduce the need for fresh, clean water while still maintaining a healthy environment for fish. To be operated economically commercial RAS must have high fish stocking densities,  and many researchers are currently conducting studies to determine if RAS is a viable form of intensive [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Jenner | first1 = Andrew | title = Recirculating aquaculture systems: The future of fish farming?| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0224/Recirculating-aquaculture-systems-The-future-of-fish-farming| website = Christian Science Monitor| date = February 24, 2010 | accessdate =August 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RAS water treatment processes==
[[File:Outdoor biofilter and degasser on a largemouth bass farm.jpg|thumb|A biofilter and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degasser on an outdoor recirculating aquaculture system used to grow largemouth bass.]]
[[File:Recirculating aquaculture system flow chart.png|thumb| Water treatment processes needed in a recirculating aquaculture system.]]
A series of treatment processes is utilized to maintain water quality in intensive fish farming operations. These steps are often done in order or sometimes in tandem. After leaving the vessel holding fish the water is first treated for solids before entering a biofilter to convert ammonia, next degassing and oxygenation occur, often followed by heating/cooling and sterilization. Each of these processes can be completed by using a variety of different methods and equipment, but regardless all must take place to ensure a healthy environment that maximizes fish growth and health.

===Biofiltration===
{{Main|Biofiltration}}

All RAS relies on [[biofiltration]] to convert [[ammonia ]](NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) excreted by the [[fish]] into [[nitrate]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Hall |first=Antar |date=December 1, 1999 |title=A Comparative Analysis of Three Biofilter Types Treating Wastewater Produced in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems |type= Master of Science |chapter= |publisher= |docket= |oclc= |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-0104100-133802/unrestricted/AntarThesisFinalForm3.pdf |access-date= September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is a waste product of fish [[metabolism]] and high concentrations (&gt;.02&amp;nbsp;mg/L) are toxic to most finfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Stickney|title=Principles of Aquaculture|edition= 2nd |publisher= Wiley |year=1994|page=91 |isbn=0-471-57856-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrifying bacteria are [[chemoautotrophs]] that convert ammonia into nitrite then nitrate. A [[biofilter]] provides a substrate for the bacterial community, which results in thick [[biofilm]] growing within the filter.&lt;ref name= "Hall"/&gt; Water is pumped through the filter, and ammonia is utilized by the bacteria for energy. Nitrate is less toxic than ammonia (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;mg/L), and can be removed by a denitrifying biofilter or by water replacement. Stable environmental conditions and regular maintenance are required to ensure the biofilter is operating efficiently.

===Solids removal===

In addition to treating the liquid waste excreted by fish the solid waste must also be treated, this is done by concentrating and flushing the solids out of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Summerfelt | first1 = Robert | last2 = Penne | first2 = Chris| title =Solids removal in a recirculating aquaculture system where the majority of the flow bypasses the microscreen filter | journal = Aquacultural Engineering | volume = 33 | pages = 214–224 | date = September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing solids reduces bacteria growth, oxygen demand, and the proliferation of [[disease]]. The simplest method for removing solids is the creation of settling basin where the relative velocity of the water is slow and particles can settle at the bottom of the tank where they are either flushed out or vacuumed out manually using a siphon. However, this method is not viable for RAS operations where a small footprint is desired. Typical RAS solids removal involves a sand filter or particle filter where solids become lodged and can be periodically backflushed out of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Chen | first1 = Shulin | last2 = Malone | first2 = Ronald | title =Suspended solids control in recirculating aquaculture systems | journal = Proceedings from Aquaculture Symposium in Cornell University, Ithaca, NY | volume =  | pages = 170–186 | date = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common method is the use of a mechanical drum filter where water is run over a rotating drum screen that is periodically cleaned by pressurized spray nozzles, and the resulting slurry is treated or sent down the drain. In order to remove extremely fine particles or colloidal solids a [[Protein_skimmer|protein fractionator]] may be used with or without the addition of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Oxygenation===

Reoxygenating the system water is a crucial part to obtaining high production densities. Fish require oxygen to metabolize food and grow, as do bacteria communities in the biofilter. Dissolved oxygen levels can be increased through two methods [[aeration]] and [[oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]]. In aeration air is pumped through an air stone or similar device that creates small bubbles in the water column, this results in a high surface area where oxygen can dissolve into the water. In general due to slow gas dissolution rates and the high air pressure needed to create small bubbles this method is considered inefficient and the water is instead oxygenated by pumping in pure oxygen.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various methods are used to ensure that during oxygenation all of the oxygen dissolves into the water column. Careful calculation and consideration must be given to the oxygen demand of a given system, and that demand must be met with either oxygenation or aeration equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Kepenyes | first1 = J.| title = Chapter 15 Recirculatig Systems and Re-use of Water in Aquaculture| url =http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5744E/x5744e0g.htm| website =FAO| date = | accessdate =October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH control===

In all RAS [[pH]] must be carefully monitored and controlled. The first step of nitrification in the biofilter consumes [[alkalinity]] and lowers the pH of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 =Losordo| first1 =T.| last2 =Massar| first2 =M.| last3 =Rakocy| first3 =J| title =Recirculating Aquaculture Tank Production Systems: an overview of critical conditions| url =http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/f/f5/Overview_of_RAS.pdf| website =| date =September 1998| accessdate =August 25, 2015| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151017093654/http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/f/f5/Overview_of_RAS.pdf| archivedate =October 17, 2015| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping the pH in a suitable range (5.0-9.0 for freshwater systems) is crucial to maintain the health of both the fish and biofilter. pH is typically controlled by the addition of alkalinity in the form of lime (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A low pH will lead to high levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which can prove toxic to fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Summerfelt | first1 = Steven | title = Engineering of water reuse systems | url = http://www.ncrac.org/NR/rdonlyres/E4216F9B-2961-4145-A136-850BD8E8A9D9/0/Chapter11.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102042354/http://www.ncrac.org/NR/rdonlyres/E4216F9B-2961-4145-A136-850BD8E8A9D9/0/Chapter11.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-01-02 | website =  | date = 1996 | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pH can also be controlled by [[degassing]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a packed column or with an aerator, this is necessary in intensive systems especially where oxygenation instead of aeration is used in tanks to maintain O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Malone | first1 = Ron| title = Recirculating Aquaculture Tank Production Systems: A Review of Current Design Practices| url =http://appliedecology.cals.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/453.pdf| website =North Carolina State University| date = October 2013 |page=5 | accessdate =October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature control===

All fish species have a preferred [[temperature]] above and below which that fish will experience negative health effects and eventually death. Warm water species such as [[Tilapia]] and [[Barramundi]] prefer 24&amp;nbsp;°C water or warmer, where as cold water species such as [[trout]] and [[salmon]] prefer water temperature below 16&amp;nbsp;°C. Temperature also plays an important role in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, with higher water temperatures having lower values for DO saturation. Temperature is controlled through the use of submerged heaters, [[heat pumps]], [[chillers]], and [[heat exchangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=136 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four may be used to keep a system operating at the optimal temperature for maximizing fish production.

===Biosecurity===

[[Disease]] outbreaks occur more readily when dealing with the high fish stocking densities typically employed in intensive RAS. Outbreaks can be reduced by operating multiple independent systems with the same building and isolating water to water contact between systems by cleaning equipment and personnel that move between systems.&lt;ref name= "Yanong"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Yanong | first1 = R. | title = Fish Health Management Considerations in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems - Part 1: Introduction and General Principles| url=http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/6/69/Fish_Health_Management_Considerations_in_RAS,_Introduction_and_General_Principles.pdf| website =| date = | accessdate =August 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the use of a [[Ultra Violet]] (UV) or [[ozone]] water treatment system reduces the number of free floating virus and bacteria in the system water. These treatment systems reduce the disease loading that occurs on stressed fish and thus reduce the chance of an outbreak.

*High operating costs mostly due to electricity, and system maintenance.&lt;ref name= "Rawlinson"/&gt;
*A need for highly trained staff to monitor and operate the system.&lt;ref name= "Rawlinson"/&gt;

==Special types of RAS==

===Aquaponics===
{{Main|Aquaponics}}

Combining plants and fish in a RAS is referred to as aquaponics. In this type of system ammonia produced by the fish is not only converted to nitrate but is also removed by the plants from the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Diver | first1 = S. | title = Aquaponics Integration of Hydroponics and Aquaculture | url = http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/2/28/Hydroponics_with_Aquaculture.pdf | website =  | date = 2006 | accessdate = August 25, 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417140632/http://www.extension.org/mediawiki/files/2/28/Hydroponics_with_Aquaculture.pdf | archivedate = April 17, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an aquaponics system fish effectively fertilize the plants, this creates a closed looped system where very little waste is generated and inputs are minimized. [[Aquaponics]] provides the advantage of being able to harvest and sell multiple crops.

===Aquariums===
{{Main|Aquariums}}

Home aquaria and inland commercial aquariums are a form of RAS where the water quality is very carefully controlled and the stocking density of fish is relatively low. In these systems the goal is to display the fish rather than producing food. However, biofilters and other forms of water treatment are still used to reduce the need to exchange water and to maintain water clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David  E. Boruchowitz |title=The Simple Guide to Freshwater Aquariums|edition= |publisher=T.F.H |year=2001|page=31 |isbn=9780793821013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like in traditional RAS water must be removed periodically to prevent nitrate and other toxic chemicals from building up in the system. Coastal aquariums often have high rates of water exchange and are typically not operated as a RAS due to their proximity to a large body of clean water.

A '''rolling chassis''' is the [[chassis]] of a [[car]] or [[truck]], assembled together with the [[engine]] and [[drivetrain]], but without [[coachwork|bodywork]]. Such rolling chassis were built by [[car maker]]s, for supply to [[coachbuilder]]s who would later build the bodywork. Although common in the early days of motoring, such rolling chassis are now rare. A few custom markets, such as [[limousine]]s, may still use them.

[[File:AK 427 Cobra replica rolling chassis - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|Modern [[kit car]] rolling chassis]]
In some cases, a rolling chassis had a basic fuel tank and driver's seat attached, so that they could be driven to the coachbuilder under their own power. This was more common for [[coach (bus)|coach]]es and trucks, where specialised body styles were to be built by the coachbuilders, and the chassis was much larger than a car and so more difficult to carry by another vehicle.

In restoration circles, the term is also applied to a [[bodyshell]] with [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] fitted, but with the relatively simple engine and transmission removed.

A '''satellite modem''' or '''satmodem''' is a [[modem]] used to establish [[data transfer]]s using a [[communications satellite]] as a [[relay]]. A satellite modem's main function is to transform an input bitstream to a radio signal and vice versa. 

There are some devices that include only a demodulator (and no modulator, thus only allowing data to be downloaded by satellite) that are also referred to as "satellite modems."  These devices are used in [[satellite Internet access]] (in this case uploaded data is transferred through a conventional [[PSTN]] modem or an [[ADSL]] modem).

== Satellite link ==
{{Main|Satellite link}}

A satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel. Other equipment that are essential for creating a satellite link include [[satellite antenna]]s and frequency converters.

Data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from [[Data terminal equipment]] (e.g. a [[computer]]). The modem usually has [[Intermediate frequency]] (IF) output (that is, 50-200&amp;nbsp;MHz), however, sometimes the signal is modulated directly to [[L-band]]. In most cases frequency has to be converted using an [[Block upconverter|upconverter]] before amplification and transmission.

A modulated signal is a sequence of ''symbols'', pieces of data represented by a corresponding signal state, e.g. a bit or a few bits, depending upon the [[modulation]] scheme being used. Recovering a symbol clock (making a local symbol clock generator synchronous with the remote one) is one of the most important tasks of a demodulator.

Similarly, a signal received from a satellite is firstly [[downconverter|downconverted]] (this is done by a [[Low-noise block converter]] - LNB), then demodulated by a modem, and at last handled by data terminal equipment. The LNB is usually powered by the modem through the signal cable with 13 or 18 V [[Direct current|DC]]

== Features ==
The main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation. Satellite communication standards also define [[error correction]] codes and [[framing (World Wide Web)|framing]] formats.

Popular modulation types being used for satellite communications:
* Binary phase shift keying ([[BPSK]]);
* Quadrature phase shift keying ([[QPSK]]);
* Offset quadrature phase shift keying ([[OQPSK]]);
* [[8PSK]];
* [[Quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM), especially 16QAM.

The popular satellite error correction codes include:
* [[Convolutional code]]s:
** with [[constraint length]] less than 10, usually decoded using a [[Viterbi algorithm]] (see [[Viterbi decoder]]);
** with [[constraint length]] more than 10, usually decoded using a [[Fano algorithm]] (see [[Sequential decoder]]);
* [[Reed-Solomon]] codes usually concatenated with convolutional codes with an [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaving]];
* New modems support superior error correction codes ([[turbo code]]s and [[LDPC]] codes).

Frame formats that are supported by various satellite modems include:
* Intelsat business service (IBS) framing
* Intermediate data rate (IDR) framing
* [[MPEG-2]] transport framing (used in [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]])
* [[E-carrier|E1]] and [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] framing

[[High-end]] modems also incorporate some additional features:

* Multiple data interfaces (like [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[V.35 (recommendation)|V.35]], [[G.703]], [[LVDS]], [[Ethernet]]);
* ''Embedded Distant-end Monitor and Control'' (EDMAC), allowing to control the distant-end modem;
* ''Automatic Uplink Power Control'' (AUPC), that is, adjusting the output power to maintain a constant [[signal-to-noise ratio|signal to noise]] ratio at the remote end;
* [[Drop and insert]] feature for a [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] stream, allowing to replace some channels in it.

== Internal structure ==
[[File:Satellite modem block diagram.png|right|thumb|500px|Satellite modem's internal structure]]
Probably the best way of understanding modem's work is to look at its internal structure. A block diagram of a generic satellite modem is shown on the image. Almost all parts are optional.

=== Analog tract ===

After a [[Digital to analog converter|digital-to-analog conversion]] in the transmitter the signal passes through a [[reconstruction filter]]. Then its frequency is converted if needed.

The purpose of the analog tract in the receiver is to convert signal's frequency, to adjust its power via an [[automatic gain control]] circuit and to get its [[complex envelope]] components.

The input signal for the analog tract is at the [[intermediate frequency]] or in the [[L-band]], in the second case it must be firstly converted to IF. Then the signal is either [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] or processed by the four-quadrant multiplier which produces the complex envelope components (''[[I and Q|I, Q]]'') through multiplying it by the heterodyne frequency.

See [[Superheterodyne receiver]].

At last the signal passes through an [[anti-aliasing filter]] and '''[[sampling (signal processing)|sampled]]''' ('''digitized''').

=== Modulator and demodulator ===

A digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal on [[Intermediate frequency]] (IF). A modulator is generally a much simpler device than a demodulator, because it doesn't have to recover symbol and carrier frequencies.

A demodulator is one of the most important parts of the receiver. The exact structure of the demodulator is defined by a [[modulation]] type. However, the fundamental concepts are similar. Moreover, it is possible to develop a demodulator which can process signals with different modulation types.

Digital demodulation implies that a ''symbol clock'' (and, in most cases, an intermediate frequency generator) at the receiving side have to be synchronous with those at the transmitting side. This is achieved by the following two circuits:
* timing recovery circuit, determining the borders of symbols;
* carrier recovery circuit, which determines the actual meaning of each symbol. There are modulation types (like [[frequency shift keying]]) that can be demodulated without carrier recovery (noncoherent demodulation) but this method is generally worse.

There are also additional components in the demodulator such as the [[Intersymbol interference]] [[Equalization (communications)|equalizer]].

If the analog signal was digitized without a four-quadrant multiplier, the complex envelope has to be calculated by a digital ''complex mixer''.

Sometimes a digital [[automatic gain control]] circuit is implemented in the demodulator.

=== FEC coding ===

[[Error correction]] techniques are essential for satellite communications, because, due to satellite's limited power a [[signal-to-noise ratio|signal to noise]] ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor. Error correction works by adding an artificial redundancy to a data stream at the transmitting side, and using this redundancy to correct errors caused by noise and interference.

A ''FEC encoder'' applies an error correction code to the digital stream, adding redundancy.

A ''FEC decoder'' decodes the [[Forward error correction]] code that is used in the specific signal.
For example, the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] standard defines a concatenated code consisting of inner convolutional (standard NASA code, punctured, with rates &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2/3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;3/4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;5/6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;7/8&lt;/math&gt;), interleaving and outer [[Reed-Solomon]] code (block length: 204 bytes, information block: 188 bytes, can correct up to 8 bytes in the block).

=== Differential coding ===

{{Main|Differential coding}}

There are several modulation types (such as [[phase shift keying|PSK]] and [[quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]) that have a phase ambiguity, that is, a carrier can be restored in different ways. [[Differential coding]] is used to resolve this ambiguity.

When differential coding is used, the data are deliberately made to depend not only on the current ''symbol'', but also on the previous one.

=== Scrambling ===

{{Main|Scrambler (randomizer)}}
[[Scrambler (randomizer)|Scrambling]] is a technique used to randomize a data stream to eliminate long '0'-only and '1'-only sequences and to assure energy dispersal.
Long '0'-only and '1'-only sequences create difficulties for timing recovery circuit.
Scramblers and descramblers are usually based on [[linear-feedback shift register]]s.

A scrambler randomizes the data stream to be transmitted.
A descrambler restores the original stream from the scrambled one.

Scrambling shouldn't be confused with encryption, since it doesn't protect information from intruders.

=== Multiplexing  ===

A [[multiplexer]] transforms several digital streams into one stream. This is often referred to as 'Muxing.'

Generally, a [[demultiplexer]] is a device which transforms one [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] data stream to several streams which it consists of. Satellite modem doesn't have so many outputs, so a ''demultiplexer'' here performs a [[drop and insert|drop]] operation, allowing to choose channels that will be transferred to output.

A demultiplexer achieves this goal by maintaining ''frame synchronization''.

== Applications ==
[[File:NovelSat Satellite Modem NS3000.png|thumb|The NS3000 Satellite Modem modulates and demodulates data and video signals transmitted via satellite.]]
[[File:ASTRA2Connect Modem front.jpg|thumb|right|The "IPmodem" (satellite modem" developed and made by Newtec of Belgium for [[SES S.A.|SES]]' 2Mbit/s [[ASTRA2Connect]] European two-way satellite Internet system]]
Satellite modems are often used for home [[satellite internet|internet access]].

There are two different types, both employing the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) standard as their basis:
*One-way satmodems ('''DVB-IP''' modems) use a return channel not based on communication with the satellite, such as [[telephone]] or [[cable TV|cable]].
*Two-way satmodems ('''[[DVB-RCS]]''' modems, also called '''astromodems''') employ a satellite-based return channel as well; they do not need another connection. DVB-RCS is [[ETSI]] [[standardization|standard]] '''EN 301 790'''.

There are also industrial satellite modems intended to provide a permanent link. They are used, for example, in the Steel shankar network.

The '''Sholes and Glidden typewriter''' (also known as the '''Remington No.&amp;nbsp;1''') was the first commercially successful [[typewriter]]. Principally designed by the [[United States|American]] [[inventor]] [[Christopher Latham Sholes]], it was developed with the assistance of fellow printer [[Samuel W. Soule]] and amateur mechanic [[Carlos Glidden|Carlos S. Glidden]].  Work began in 1867, but Soule left the enterprise shortly thereafter, replaced by [[James Densmore]], who provided financial backing and the driving force behind the machine's continued development. After several short-lived attempts to manufacture the device, the machine was acquired by [[E. Remington and Sons]] in early 1873. An arms manufacturer seeking to diversify, Remington further refined the typewriter before finally placing it on the market on July&amp;nbsp;1, 1874.

During its development, the typewriter evolved from a crude curiosity into a practical device, the basic form of which became the industry standard. The machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design, including a cylindrical [[platen]] and a four-rowed [[QWERTY]] keyboard. Several design deficiencies remained, however. The Sholes and Glidden could print [[All caps|only upper-case]] letters—an issue remedied in its successor, the Remington No.&amp;nbsp;2—and was a "blind writer", meaning the typist could not see what was being written as it was entered.

Initially, the typewriter received an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, and the need for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, had created a need for expedient, legible correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.

==History==

===Early development===
[[File:TypewriterPatent1868.jpg|thumb|alt=A 45-degree view of a wooden device with piano-like keyboard and, centered on its top, a metal disk over which a mechanical arm with two spindles is suspended.|The machine patented on June 23, 1868, resembled "a cross between a piano and a kitchen table".&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Sholes and Glidden typewriter had its origin in a printing machine designed in 1866 by Christopher Latham Sholes to assist in printing page numbers in books, and serial numbers on tickets and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Oden 1917, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Sholes, a [[Wisconsin]] printer, formed a partnership with Samuel W. Soule, also a printer, and together they began development work in Charles F. Kleinsteuber's machine shop, a converted mill in northern [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. Carlos S. Glidden, an inventor who frequented the machine shop, became interested in the device and suggested that it might be adapted to print alphabetical characters as well.&lt;ref name="bliven44"&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1867, Glidden read an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' describing "the Pterotype", a writing machine invented by John Pratt and recently featured in an issue of ''London Engineering''. Glidden showed the article to Sholes, who thought the machine "complicated and liable to get out of order",&lt;ref name="iles321"&gt;Iles 1912, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; and was convinced that a better machine could be designed. To that point, several dozen patents for printing devices had been issued in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="cortada15"&gt;Cortada 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; None of the machines, however, had been successful or effective products.&lt;ref name="cortada15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ck24"&gt;Campbell-Kelly 2004, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1866, following their successful collaboration on the numbering machine,&lt;ref name="iles321" /&gt; Sholes asked Soule to join him and Glidden in developing the new device. Mathias Schwalbach, a German clockmaker, was hired to assist with construction. To test the proposed machine's feasibility, a key was taken from a [[telegraph]] machine and modified to print the letter "W";&lt;ref name="bliven44"/&gt; by September 1867, a model with a full alphabet, numbers, and rudimentary punctuation had been completed, and it was used to compose letters to acquaintances in the hope of selling the invention, or procuring funds for its manufacture.&lt;ref name="current98"&gt;Current 1977, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; One recipient, James Densmore, immediately bought a 25% interest for $600, the cost of the machine's development to that date.&lt;ref&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beeching 1974, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Densmore saw the machine for the first time in March 1868, and was unimpressed; he thought it clumsy and impractical, and declared it "good for nothing except to show that its underlying principles were sound".&lt;ref name="iles328"&gt;Iles 1912, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Among other deficiencies, the device held paper in a horizontal frame, which limited the thickness of the paper that could be used and made alignment difficult.&lt;ref name="iles324"&gt;Iles 1912, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; A patent for the "Type-Writer" was granted on June&amp;nbsp;23, 1868, and, despite the device's flaws, Densmore rented a building in [[Chicago]] in which to begin its manufacture. Fifteen units were produced before a lack of funds forced the venture back to Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refinement===
During 1869, an improved model was designed which, unlike the previous version, drew upon work done by other inventors. A machine patented in 1833 by Charles Thurber,{{#tag:ref|Alternatively, the Thurber device is dated 1845.&lt;ref name="iles323"&gt;Iles 1912, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oden 1917, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} for example, used a cylindrical platen.&lt;ref name="current49397"&gt;Current 1949, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Sholes adapted the idea and implemented a rotating drum to which the paper was clipped, replacing the frame of the previous model.&lt;ref name="current99"&gt;Current 1977, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Soule and Glidden did not assist development of the new platen and, as their interest in the venture was waning, sold their rights to the original machine to Sholes and Densmore.&lt;ref name="iles328"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; Prototypes were sent to professionals in various fields, including [[James O. Clephane]], a [[stenographer]] whose heavy use destroyed several machines. Clephane's feedback, although "caustic",&lt;ref name="iles328"/&gt; led to the development of an additional 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;prototypes, each an improvement on its predecessor. In summer 1870, Densmore traveled to [[New York City|New York]] to demonstrate the machine to [[Western Union]],&lt;ref name="bliven52"&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beeching 1974, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The telegraph company is also reported to have been the Automatic Telegraph Company,&lt;ref name="current399"&gt;Current 1949, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; or the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Telegraph Company.&lt;ref name="current100"&gt;Current 1977, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic &amp; Pacific acquired Automatic Telegraph and was itself later absorbed by Western Union in February 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer 2004, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reid 1886, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} which was looking for a method to record [[telegram]]s. Western Union ordered several machines,&lt;ref name="current399"/&gt; but declined to purchase the rights, as it believed a superior device could be developed for less than Densmore's asking price of $50,000.&lt;ref name="bliven52"/&gt;

[[File:Remingtonfactory1874.png|thumb|alt=A sprawling industrial complex with numerous buildings and smokestacks of varying sizes|E. Remington and Sons' factory in [[Ilion, New York]], c&amp;nbsp;1874]]
To supply the orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to manufacture the machine in summer 1871.&lt;ref name="current399"/&gt; During this time, the machine was revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production.&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former [[wheelwright]] shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of [[economy of scale|economies of scale]] prevented the venture from yielding a profit.&lt;ref name="current100"/&gt; In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring an ever-increasing [[ownership|ownership interest]]. Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $12,000.&lt;ref name="melville42"&gt;Melville 1923, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p.402&lt;/ref&gt; Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost, a manufacturer with whom he had been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons.&lt;ref&gt;Current 1977, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president [[Philo Remington]] to pursue the device.&lt;ref name="mayo29"&gt;Mayo 2007, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sholes-Glidden 1874.jpg|thumb|alt=An ornately decorated typewriter with black lacquer, gold detailing and various floral arrangements|A redesign incorporated floral ornamentation, a characteristic from Remington's sewing machine division.]]
Following a demonstration at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March&amp;nbsp;1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000&amp;nbsp;machines, with the option to produce an additional 24,000.&lt;ref name="cortada15"/&gt; Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed to serve as the exclusive sales agent.&lt;ref name="mayo29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Densmore ultimately earned $1,500,000 in royalty payments.&lt;ref name="iles331"&gt;Iles 1912, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July&amp;nbsp;1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a [[japanning|japanned]] case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a [[treadle]] to operate the carriage return.&lt;ref&gt;Burlingame 1976, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing,&lt;ref&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.&lt;ref name="bliven58"&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1874, only 400&amp;nbsp;typewriters had been sold, due in part to their high price and poor reliability.&lt;ref name="utterback7"&gt;Utterback 1999, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; As businesses were slow to adopt the machine, authors, clergymen, lawyers and newspaper editors were the targeted customers.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell-Kelly 2004, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals, however, generally did not write enough to justify the machine's price of about $125, the average annual income per person at the time.&lt;ref name="cortada17"&gt;Cortada 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krystal 2007, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; There were exceptions, however; [[Mark Twain]] was among the first to purchase the machine, which he termed a "curiosity breeding little joker".&lt;ref name="melville42"/&gt; Although the machine was exhibited at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in 1876, it was overshadowed by [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Several design and manufacturing improvements followed—including replacing the treadle with a hand lever—and 4,000&amp;nbsp;machines had been sold by 1877.&lt;ref name="utterback7"/&gt; In 1878, Remington outsourced marketing to [[Fairbanks-Morse|E. &amp; T. Fairbanks &amp; Company]], a scale manufacturer, as marketing to that point had produced only lackluster sales.&lt;ref name="cortada16"&gt;Cortada 2000, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

An improved model, the Remington No.&amp;nbsp;2, was also introduced in 1878. The new machine was able to type upper and lowercase characters, thus remedying a significant drawback of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="utterback7"/&gt; As the only typewriter manufacturer, Remington maintained a [[monopoly]] position until the [[American Writing Machine Company]] introduced a typewriter to compete with the Remington machines in 1881.&lt;ref name="ck26"&gt;Campbell-Kelly 2004, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the new competition, Remington lowered the price of the Sholes and Glidden (referred to in sales literature as the Remington No.&amp;nbsp;1) to $80, and negotiated an agreement with the marketing firm Wyckoff, [[Clarence Seamans|Seamans]] &amp; Benedict to take all the machines produced.&lt;ref name="cortada17"/&gt; The arrangement marked the beginning of the typewriter's commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;Ingham 1983, p. 1270&lt;/ref&gt; as the agency's marketing prowess led to the sale of 1,200&amp;nbsp;machines in its first year.&lt;ref name="cortada17"/&gt; By 1884, more competitors had appeared, including the Hammond Typewriter Company, the Crandall Type-Writer Company and the Hall Typewriter Company; in the decade since the introduction of the Sholes and Glidden, a "thriving typewriter industry" had developed.&lt;ref name="cortada17"/&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Sholesgliddenpatentside.png|thumb|alt=A side view of a typewriter depicting internal linkages and components; a wire runs from the two-banked keyboard down to a lever at the bottom of the device, from which another wire runs upwards to a basket formed by the typebars. Several gears and counterweights are located towards the rear of the machine.|One variant of the Sholes and Glidden typewriter used wires and levers to connect the keys and typebars.]]

The Sholes and Glidden typewriter incorporated several components adapted from existing devices, such as [[escapement]] (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from [[clockwork]], keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers adapted from the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Utterback 1999, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs which could have been avoided.&lt;ref name="iles323"/&gt; The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30&amp;nbsp;years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.&lt;ref name="iles323"/&gt;

In the machine's original 1868 design, paper was placed horizontally on the top of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a [[typebar]] to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as [[tissue paper]]).&lt;ref name="iles324"/&gt; Two variants were produced with alternative methods of actuating the typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly "kicked" the typebars upwards.&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sholesglidden3.png|thumb|left|alt=A wooden typewriter with a "QWE-TY" keyboard composed of circular, white keys. The platen rests on top of the device, connected to a bar which extends several inches beyond the sides of the machine. Counterweights are suspended from each end of the bar, to which several wheels and gears are also attached.|By the end of 1872, the typewriter had taken an appearance similar to that of a modern typewriter.]]

The arm and frame components were replaced with a cylindrical platen in 1869. Unlike modern typewriters, the revised machine entered letters around the cylinder, with axial rotation providing letter spacing and horizontal shifting providing line spacing. Paper was clipped directly to the cylinder, which limited its length and width to the dimensions of the apparatus.&lt;ref name="current49397"/&gt; The platen was again redesigned in early 1872 to allow the use of paper of any length. The redesigned platen also introduced the modern spacing functionality (horizontal and axial movement providing letter and line spacing, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Current 1949, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; The cylindrical platen became "an indispensable part of every standard [typewriter]".&lt;ref name="iles323"/&gt;

By the end of 1872, the appearance and function of the typewriter had assumed the form that would become standard in the industry and remain largely unchanged for the next century. Although the machine possessed a cylindrical platen and what was essentially a QWERTY keyboard, two design elements that would later become essential were lacking: the ability to write in upper and lowercase letters and "visible" print.&lt;ref name="current100"/&gt; Although the former was implemented in the Remington No.&amp;nbsp;2, the machine was fundamentally an "upstrike" design, meaning the typebars struck upwards against the underside of the platen. As this occurred inside the machine, the operator could not see what was being entered as it was typed. Although competing brands, such as the [[Oliver Typewriter Company|Oliver]] and [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]], began to market "visible" typewriters in the 1890s, a Remington-branded model did not appear until the Remington No.&amp;nbsp;10 in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Post 1981, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===QWERTY keyboard===
{{Main article|QWERTY}}
The QWERTY keyboard, so named for the first six characters of the uppermost alphabetic row, was invented during the course of the typewriter's development. The first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as follows:&lt;ref name="iles323"/&gt;

[[File:Sholesdisk.png|thumb|alt=A portion of a metal ring (with dashed lines to indicated the truncated portion) to which a series of U-shaped brackets are screwed. To one of the brackets, a pivoting typebar with a curved typehead is affixed.|Typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring such that they would strike a common center.]]
Schwalbach later replaced the piano-like keys with "buttons" and positioned them into four banked rows.&lt;ref&gt;Current 1954, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanics of the machine, however, made the alphabetical arrangement problematic. The typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring, forming a "basket". When a key was pressed, the corresponding typebar would swing upwards, causing the [[print head]] to strike at the center of the ring. Gravity would then return the typebar to its initial position. The implication of this design, however, was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam the machine. To mitigate this problem, keys were reordered using analysis of [[letter frequency]] and trial and error.&lt;ref name="utterback5"&gt;Utterback 1999, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Densmore asked his son-in-law, a Pennsylvania school superintendent, what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Lekberg 1972, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Typebars corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs, such as S and T, were placed on opposite sides on the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell-Kelly 2004, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard ultimately presented to Remington was arranged as follows:&lt;ref name="utterback5"/&gt;
{|

|}
After it purchased the device, Remington made several adjustments—including switching the period and "R" keys—which created a keyboard with what is essentially the modern QWERTY layout.&lt;ref&gt;Pool 1997, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
{{See also|Typewriter}}
[[File:Gurneyshorthand.png|thumb|alt=Four lines of shorthand writing, symbolic characters composed of dots and straight and curved lines|Shorthand, although capable of being written quickly, required special training to comprehend. The typewriter simultaneously addressed the need for speed and legibility.]]

The Sholes and Glidden was the first commercially successful typewriter.&lt;ref name="cortada15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ck24"/&gt; [[Industrialization]] and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased the speed with which business was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie 2007, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in [[shorthand]] or [[cursive|longhand]]. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. [[Typesetter|Typesetting]] was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.&lt;ref name="ckrj"&gt;Campbell-Kelly 2005, §Prehistory&lt;/ref&gt;

The public was initially skeptical of the typewriter, and reactions included apathy and antagonism.&lt;ref name="bliven58"/&gt; Outside of large companies, letters generally did not need to be composed quickly; as the device was reliant upon its operator, it offered no automation. In business settings involving customer interaction, the unfamiliar machines were viewed with suspicion (as there existed the perception that mechanical devices could be rigged by unscrupulous merchants) and the presence of such a large object between the customer and employee "interrupted the 'personal touch{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="burlingame136"/&gt; Individuals receiving typewritten letters often found them insulting (as type implied they could not read handwriting) or impersonal, problems exacerbated by the all upper-case writing.&lt;ref name ="burlingame136"&gt;Burlingame 1976, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cortada 2000, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The typewriter also precipitated privacy concerns, as recipients of letters of a personal nature believed a third-party operator or typesetter must have been involved in their composition.&lt;ref&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and the typewriter===
[[File:Sholesglidden4.png|thumb|alt=A woman in a long, frilled dress with a pleated train sits at a large, wooden typewriter which is approximately half her size. The typewriter is affixed to a small table with an open drawer.|A female typist operates a Sholes and Glidden typewriter, as depicted in an 1872 ''Scientific American'' article.]]

The association of women with the typewriter may be linked to the way in which it was marketed.&lt;ref&gt;Hoke 1979, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Before the typewriter was acquired by Remington, Sholes' daughter was employed to demonstrate the device and to appear in promotional images, which served as the basis for early advertisements.&lt;ref name="wosk24"&gt;Wosk 2001, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Remington's sales agents later marketed the machine with tactics including the use of attractive women to demonstrate the device at trade shows and in hotel lobbies.&lt;ref name="miller349"&gt;Miller 1997, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of female operators suggested the device was "easy enough for a woman" and suited for domestic use.&lt;ref name="wosk24"/&gt; Although also designed to allow Remington to maintain manufacturing efficiencies with its sewing machine division, the typewriter's aesthetics (the sewing machine stand and floral ornamentation) were further intended to facilitate its acceptance into the household.&lt;ref name="ckrj"/&gt;

A "major consequence"&lt;ref&gt;Utterback 1999, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; of the typewriter's development was the entrance of women into the clerical work force.&lt;ref&gt;Beeching 1974, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings.&lt;ref&gt;Burlingame 1976, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[YWCA|Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;Bliven 1954, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine.&lt;ref name="miller349"/&gt; The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work.&lt;ref&gt;Hoke 1979, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%.&lt;ref name="krystal15"&gt;Krystal 2007, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, "I do feel that I have done something for the women who have always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living."&lt;ref name="melville42"/&gt;

|[[Image:Signatureprogram.gif|thumb|center|An example signature program compiled and run in Windows CLI.]]
|-
|}
A '''signature program''' is a small, highly condensed piece of code (commonly written in [[C programming language|C]] or [[C++]]), usually three or fewer lines in length which when compiled produces an interesting pattern or function that is not always obvious from the code.

Signature programs are generally found in the signature section of user posts in forums, messages etc., particularly in technically oriented websites such as [[Slashdot]].

== Optimisation and example ==
In order for the program, often of great complexity, which would usually be represented with many lines of code, to fit into a single line, many compression techniques are used. The following program prints out an [[ASCII art]] version of the [[Sierpinski triangle]] fractal, shown in the illustration:

&lt;pre&gt;
main(c,r){for(r=32;r;) printf(++c&gt;31?c=!r--,"\n":c&lt;r?" ":~c&amp;r?" `":" #");}
&lt;/pre&gt;

An uncompressed "spelt out" version of this program may look like this:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {

    int c = 0;
    int r = 32;

    while (r != 0) {

        c = c + 1;
        if (c &gt; 31) {
            c = !r;   /* same as c = 0 */
            r = r - 1;
            printf("\n");
        }
        else {
            if (c &lt; r) {
                printf(" ");
            }
            else {
                if ((~c &amp; r) != 0) {
                    printf(" `");
                }
                else {
                    printf(" #");
                }
            }
        }

    }
    return 0;
}&lt;/source&gt;

Here we can see that many portions of code are missing from the signature program, most obviously the lack of &lt;code&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, no return type of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; as well as the use of non-standard &lt;code&gt;main(c,r)&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;[[?:]]&lt;/code&gt; operator plays a vital role in reducing the overall size of the program, allowing a single expression to replace the sizeable number of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; logical conditionals. Size is also dramatically reduced by removing all [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] and line breaks.

Signature programs often make use of undocumented or lesser-known features or quirks in a particular [[compiler]] which allow for smaller overall program size, as well as obscurity.

== Obfuscated programs ==
{{main|Obfuscated code}}
A common theme in signature programs is to make the code so [[obfuscated]] that the outcome and purpose of the program is not apparent, at least to start with, or that the programs are masked to give the impression that the program performs one function when it actually does something completely different, sometimes with alarming or embarrassing outcomes.

== MinRay ==
[[Computer graphics]] expert [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/ Paul Heckbert] took the condensed program concept to a new level by legibly printing the results of a contest for a minimal [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] program on the back of a [[business card]]. Code from the ''[[Graphics Gems]] IV'' [http://www.GraphicsGems.org/gemsiv/minray/  repository] is reproduced here.

While this is uncomfortably long for a signature, it is remarkably short (albeit inefficient) for a ray-tracer.

{{merge|Sodium metasilicate|discuss=Talk:Sodium silicate#Merger proposal|date=September 2018}}
'''Sodium silicate''' is a generic name for [[chemical compound]]s with the formula {{chem|Na|2''x''|Si|O|2+''x''}} or {{chem|(|Na|2|O|)|''x''}}·{{chem|Si|O|2}}, such as [[sodium metasilicate]] {{chem|Na|2|SiO|3}}, [[sodium orthosilicate]] {{chem|Na|4|Si|O|4}}, and [[sodium pyrosilicate]] {{chem|Na|6|Si|2|O|7}}.  The anions are often [[polymer|polymeric]].  These compounds are generally colorless transparent solids or white powders, and soluble in water  in various amounts.

Sodium silicate is also the technical and common name for a mixture of such compounds, chiefly the metasilicate, also called '''waterglass''', '''water glass''', or '''liquid glass'''.   The product has a wide variety of uses, including the formulation of [[cement]]s, [[passive fire protection]], textile and lumber processing, manufacture of [[refractory]] ceramics, as [[adhesives]], and in the production of [[silica gel]].  The commercial product, available in water solution or in solid form, is often greenish or blue owing to the presence of iron-containing impurities.

In industry, the various grades of sodium silicate are characterized by their SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O weight ratio (which can be converted to molar ratio by multiplication with 1.032).  The ratio can vary between 2:1 and 3.75:1.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Gerard Lagaly, Werner Tufar, A. Minihan, A. Lovell "Silicates" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grades with ratio below 2.85:1 are termed alkaline. Those with a higher SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ratio are described as neutral.

==History==
Soluble silicates of [[alkali]] metals (sodium or [[potassium]]) were observed by European [[alchemy|alchemists]] already in the 1500s.  [[Giambattista della Porta]] observed in 1567 that ''tartari salis'' (cream of tartar, [[potassium hydrogen tartrate]]) caused powdered ''crystallum'' (quartz) to melt at a lower temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista della Porta (1569): ''Magia naturalis sive de miraculis rerum naturalium, libri iiii'' (Natural magic or on the miracles of nature, in four books); [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9j1m8oXBlEC&amp;pg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 290–291, "Crystallus, ut fusilis fiat" (quartz, so made molten)]. Published by Guillaume Rouillé (Gulielmum Rovillium) in Lyon (Lugdunum) France&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible early references to alkali silicates were made by [[Basil Valentine]] in 1520,&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, C. (1862): "Die Erfindung des Wasserglas im Jahre 1520" (The invention of waterglass in the year 1520), ''Zeitschrift des Oesterreichischen Ingenieur-Vereins'' (Journal of the Austrian Engineer Association), volume 14, pages 229–230.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]] in 1550. Around 1640, [[Jean Baptist van Helmont]] reported the formation of alkali silicates as a soluble substance made by melting sand with excess alkali, and observed that the silica could be precipitated quantitatively by adding acid to the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes van Helmont (1644): ''Opuscula medica inaudita'', published by Jost Kalckhoven (Jodocum Kalcoven) Cologne, Germany.  In Part I:  De Lithiasi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2wo5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 53], van Helmont mentions that alkalis dissolve silicates:  "''Porro lapides, gemmae, arenae, marmora, silices, &amp;c. adjuncto alcali, vitrificantur:  sin autem plure alcali coquantur, resolvuntur in humido quidem:  ac resoluta, facili negotio acidorum spirituum, separantur ab alcali, pondere pristini pulveris lapidum''." (Furthermore, stone, gems, sand, marble, silica, etc., become glassy by the addition of alkali: but if roasted with more alkali, they are dissolved in moisture: and the former weight of the stone powder is separated from the alkali and released by simply adding acid.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1646. [[Johann Rudolf Glauber|Glauber]] made [[potassium silicate]], that he termed ''liquor silicum'' by melting [[potassium carbonate]] (obtained by [[calcination|calcinating]] cream of tartar) and sand in a crucible, and keeping it molten until it ceased to bubble (due to the release of [[carbon dioxide]]).  The mixture was allowed to cool and then was ground to a fine powder.  When the powder was exposed to moist air, it gradually formed a viscous liquid, which Glauber called "''Oleum oder Liquor Silicum, Arenæ, vel Crystallorum''" (i.e., oil or solution of silica, sand or quartz crystal).&lt;ref&gt;Johann Rudolf Glauber (1646), ''Furni Novi Philosophici'' (New Philosophical Furnace). Published by Johan Jansson, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johann Rudolf Glauber (1661): ''Furni Novi Philosophici Oder Beschreibung einer New-erfundenen Distillir-Kunst'' (New Philosophical Furnace, or Treatise on Newly Discovered Distillation Art) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DxBKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false chapter LXXIX, pages 164–166]: "Wie durch Hülff eines reinen Sandes oder Kißlings auß Sale Tartari ein kräfftiger Spiritus kan erlanget werden." (How with the help of a pure sand or silica a powerful solution can be gotten from cream of tartar).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was later claimed that the substances prepared by those alchemists were not waterglass as it is understood today.&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (1863): [https://books.google.com/books?id=ew8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Die Erfindung des Wasserglases im Jahre 1520."] ''Kunst- und Gewerbe-Blatt'', volume 49, pages 228–230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon.

Reprint, ''Neues Repertorium für Pharmacie'', volume 12, pages 271–273.&lt;/ref&gt; That would have been prepared in 1818 by [[Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs]], by treating [[silicic acid]] with an alkali; the result being soluble in water, "but not affected by atmospheric changes".&lt;ref&gt;Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-aE8AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA385#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ueber ein neues Produkt aus Kieselerde und Kali"] (On a new product from silica and potash), ''Archiv für die gesammte Naturlehre'', volume 5, issue 4, pages 385–412. On page 386: "Ich erhielt es zuerst, vor ungefähr 7 Jahren" (I first obtained it about 7 years ago).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Joh.

''Polytechnisches Journal'', volume 17, pages 465–481.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "water glass" and "soluble glass" were used by [[Leopold Wolff]] in 1846,&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Wolff (1846): ''Das Wasserglas: Seine Darstellung, Eigenschaften und seine mannichfache Anwendung in den technischen Gewerben'' (Water-glass:  its preparation, properties, and its manifold uses in technical commerce) published by Quedlinburg, Leipzig, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;, by [[Émile Kopp]] in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;Emile Kopp (1857): "Sur la préparation et les propriétés du verre soluble ou des silicates de potasse et de soude; analyse de tous les travaux publiés jusqu'a ce jour sur ce sujet" (On the preparation and properties of soluble glass or the silicates of potash and soda; analysis of all works published until today on this subject).

Published by Hartleben, Vienna, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Rudolf Von Wagner distinguished [[soda glass|soda]], [[potash]], double (soda and potash), and fixing (i.e., stabilizing) as types of water glass. The fixing type was "a mixture of silica well saturated with potash water glass and a sodium silicate" used to stabilize inorganic water color pigments on cement work for outdoor signs and murals.&lt;ref&gt;Von Wagner, Rudolf (1892; translation of 13th edition by Willian Crookes) ''Manual of Chemical Technology'' [https://archive.org/details/manualchemicalt00croogoog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Wagner, ''Manual of Chemical Technology'' (1892 translation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Mayer (1925): ''Das Wasserglas;  Sein Eigenschaften, Fabrikation und Verwendung auf Grund von Erfahrungen und Mitteilungen der Firma Henkel &amp; Cie''.

Published by Vieweg, Braunschweig, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Morris Schrero (1922): [https://books.google.com/books?id=WYkmAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Water-glass: A Bibliography''].  Published by Carnegie Library, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Sodium silicates are colorless glassy or crystalline solids, or white powders.  Except for the most silicon-rich ones, they are readily soluble in water, producing [[alkaline]] solutions.

Sodium silicates are stable in [[pH|neutral]] and [[alkaline]] [[solution]]s. In [[acidic]] solutions, the [[silicate]] ions react with hydrogen ions to form [[silicic acid]]s, which tend to decompose into [[hydrate]]d silicon dioxide [[gel]].  Heated to drive off the water, the result is a hard translucent substance called [[silica gel]], widely used as a [[desiccant]].

==Production==
Solutions of sodium silicates can be produced by treating a mixture of [[silica]] (usually as [[quartz sand]]), [[caustic soda]], and water, with hot steam in a [[chemical reactor|reactor]]. The overall reaction is
: 2''x'' NaOH + {{chem|Si|O|2}} → {{chem|(|Na|2|O|)|''x''}}·{{chem|SiO|2}} + ''x'' {{chem|H|2|O}}

Sodium silicates can also be obtained by dissolving [[silicon dioxide|silica]] {{chem|Si|O|2}} (whose [[melting point]] is 1713 °C) in molten [[sodium carbonate]] (that melts with decomposition at 851 °C):&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''x'' {{chem|Na|2|CO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}} → {{chem|(|Na|2|O|)|''x''}}·{{chem|SiO|2}} + {{chem|CO|2}}
The material can be obtained also from [[sodium sulfate]] (melting point 884 °C) with [[carbon]] as a reducing agent:
: 2''x'' {{chem|Na|2|SO|4}} + C + 2 {{chem|SiO|2}} → 2 {{chem|(|Na|2|O|)|''x''}}·{{chem|Si|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|SO|2}} + {{chem|CO|2}}

In 1990, 4 million [[ton]]s of alkali metal silicates were produced.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Uses==
The main applications of sodium silicates are in detergents, paper, water treatment, and construction materials.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Engineering===

====Adhesive====
The largest application of sodium silicate solutions is a cement for producing cardboard.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; When used as a paper cement, the tendency is for the sodium silicate joint eventually to crack within a few years, at which point it no longer holds the paper surfaces cemented together.

====Drilling fluids====
Sodium silicate is frequently used in [[drilling fluid]]s to stabilize borehole walls and to avoid the collapse of bore walls. It is particularly useful when drill holes pass through [[argillaceous]] [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formations]] containing swelling [[clay minerals]] such as [[smectite]] or [[montmorillonite]].

====Concrete and general masonry treatment====
[[Concrete]] treated with a sodium silicate solution helps to reduce [[porosity]] in most [[masonry]] products such as [[concrete]], [[stucco]], and  [[plaster]]s. This effect aids in reducing water penetration, but has no known effect on reducing water vapor transmission and emission&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sgh.com/sites/default/files/downloads/technicalbrief_alkali_silicate_based_admixtures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. A chemical reaction occurs with the excess Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[portlandite]]) present in the concrete that permanently binds the silicates with the surface, making them far more durable and water repellent. This treatment generally is applied only after the initial [[curing (chemistry)|cure]] has taken place (7 days or so depending on conditions). These [[coating]]s are known as [[silicate mineral paint]].

====Detergent auxiliaries====
It is used in detergent auxiliaries such as complex sodium disilicate and modified sodium disilicate.  The detergent granules gain their ruggedness from a coating of silicates.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

====Water treatment====
Sodium silicate is used as an alum coagulant and an iron [[flocculant]] in waste[[water treatment]] plants. Sodium silicate binds to [[colloid]]al molecules, creating larger [[Flocculation|aggregates]] that sink to the bottom of the water column. The microscopic negatively charged particles suspended in water interact with sodium silicate. Their [[electrical double layer]] collapses due to the increase of [[ionic strength]] caused by the addition of sodium silicate (doubly negatively charged anion accompanied by two sodium cations) and they subsequently aggregate. This process is called [[coagulation]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

====Refractory use====
Water glass is a useful binder of solids, such as [[vermiculite]] and [[perlite]]. When blended with the aforementioned lightweight aggregates, water glass can be used to make hard, high-temperature insulation boards used for refractories, [[passive fire protection]] and high temperature insulations, such as moulded pipe insulation applications. When mixed with finely divided mineral powders, such as vermiculite dust (which is common scrap from the exfoliation process), one can produce high temperature adhesives. The intumescence disappears in the presence of finely divided mineral dust, whereby the waterglass becomes a mere matrix. Waterglass is inexpensive and abundantly available, which makes its use popular in many refractory applications.

====Dye auxiliary====
Sodium silicate solution is used as a fixative for hand dyeing with [[reactive dyes]] that require a high pH to react with the textile fiber. After the dye is applied to a cellulose-based fabric, such as cotton or rayon, or onto silk, it is allowed to dry, after which the sodium silicate is painted on to the dyed fabric, covered with plastic to retain moisture, and left to react for an hour at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Passive fire protection====
[[Image:Fs195.jpg|thumb|right|Expantrol proprietary sodium silicate suspended in about a 6.5-mm-thick layer of red rubber, type 3M FS195, inserted into a metal pipe, then heated, to demonstrate hard [[char]] [[intumescent|intumescence]], strong enough to shut a melting plastic pipe]]
[[Image:Palusolmanschette.jpg|thumb|right|Palusol-based [[intumescent]] plastic pipe device used for commercial [[firestop]]ping]]
Sodium silicates are inherently [[intumescent]]. They come in prill (solid beads) form, as well as the liquid, water glass. The solid sheet form (Palusol) must be waterproofed to ensure long-term [[passive fire protection]] (PFP).

Standard, solid, bead-form sodium silicates have been used as aggregate within [[silicone]] rubber to manufacture [[plastic]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] [[firestop]] devices. The silicone rubber was insufficient waterproofing to preserve the intumescing function and the products had to be recalled, which is problematic for firestops concealed behind [[drywall]] in [[building]]s.

Pastes for [[caulking]] purposes are similarly unstable. This, too, has resulted in recalls and even litigation. Only [[3M]]'s "Expantrol" version, which has an external heat treatment that helps to seal the outer surface, as part of its process standard, has achieved sufficient longevity to qualify for [[Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik|DIBt]] approvals in the US for use in firestopping.

Not unlike other intumescents, sodium silicate, both in bead form and in liquid form, are inherently [[endothermic]], due to liquid water in the water glass and [[hydrate]]s in the [[prill]] form. The absence in the US of mandatory aging tests, whereby PFP systems are made to undergo system performance tests ''after'' the aging and humidity exposures, are at the root of the continued availability, in [[North America]], of PFP products that can become inoperable within weeks of installation. Indiscriminate use of sodium silicates without proper [[waterproofing]] measures are contributors to the problems and risk. When sodium silicates are adequately protected, they function extremely well and reliably for long periods. Evidence of this can be seen in the many DIBt approvals for plastic pipe firestop devices using Palusol (a product of [[BASF]]), which use waterproofed sodium silicate sheets.

====Metal repair====
Sodium silicate is used, along with [[magnesium silicate]], in [[muffler]] repair and fitting paste. When dissolved in water, both sodium silicate and magnesium silicate form a thick paste that is easy to apply. When the [[exhaust system]] of an internal combustion engine heats up to its [[operating temperature]], the heat drives out all of the excess water from the paste. The [[silicate]] compounds that are left over have glass-like properties, making a temporary, brittle repair.

====Automotive repair====
Sodium silicate is also used currently as an exhaust system joint and crack sealer for repairing mufflers, resonators, tailpipes, and other exhaust components, with and without fiberglass reinforcing tapes.  In this application, the sodium silicate (60–70%) is typically mixed with [[kaolin]] (40-30%), an aluminium silicate mineral, to make the sodium silicate "glued" joint opaque. The sodium silicate, however, is the high-temperature adhesive; the kaolin serves simply as a compatible high-temperature coloring agent. Some of these repair compounds also contain glass fibres to enhance their gap-filling abilities and reduce brittleness.

Sodium silicate can be used to fill gaps within the [[head gasket]]. Commonly used on aluminum alloy [[cylinder head]]s, which are sensitive to thermally induced surface deflection. This can be caused by many things including head-bolt stretching, deficient [[antifreeze|coolant]] delivery, high cylinder head pressure, overheating, etc.

"Liquid glass" (sodium silicate) is added to the system through the radiator, and allowed to circulate. Sodium silicate is suspended in the coolant until it reaches the cylinder head. At 100–105°C (212-221°F), sodium silicate loses water molecules to form a glass seal with a remelt temperature above 810°C (1,490°F).

A sodium silicate repair can last two years or longer. The repair occurs rapidly, and symptoms disappear instantly. This repair works only when the sodium silicate reaches its "conversion" temperature at 100–105°C. Contamination of engine oil is a serious possibility in situations in which a coolant-to-oil leak is present. Sodium silicate (glass particulate) contamination of lubricants is detrimental to their function.

Sodium silicate solution is used to inexpensively, quickly, and permanently disable automobile engines. Running an engine with about 2 liters of a sodium silicate solution instead of [[motor oil]] causes the solution to precipitate, catastrophically damaging the engine's bearings and pistons within a few minutes.&lt;ref name="helliker"&gt;Helliker, Kevin. "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124934376942503053#mod=loomia?loomia_si=t0:a16:g2:r5:c0.077553:b26935024 The Killer App for Clunkers Breathes Fresh Life Into 'Liquid Glass']" ''The Wall Street Journal'', 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, this procedure was used to comply with requirements of the [[Car Allowance Rebate System|Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS)]] program.&lt;ref name="helliker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cars.gov/files/disposal-salvage/engine-disablement-procedures.pdf Engine Disablement Procedures for the CARS program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019102043/http://cars.gov/files/disposal-salvage/engine-disablement-procedures.pdf |date=2010-10-19 }}, cars.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safe construction====
A mixture of sodium silicate and [[sawdust]] has been used in between the double skin of certain [[safe]]s. This not only makes them more [[Fireproofing|fire resistant]], but also makes cutting them open with an [[oxyacetylene torch]] extremely difficult due to the [[smoke]] emitted.

====Crystal gardens====
When crystals of a number of metallic salts are dropped into a solution of water glass, simple or branching [[stalagmites]] of coloured metal silicates are formed. This phenomenon has been used by manufacturers of toys and chemistry sets to provide instructive enjoyment to many generations of children from the early 20th century until the present. An early mention of crystals of metallic salts forming a "[[chemical garden]]" in sodium silicate is found in the 1946 ''Modern Mechanix'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2006/07/21/magic-garden/|journal=Mechanix Illustrated|date=April 1946|page=88|title=Magic garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Metal salts used included the sulfates and/or chlorides of copper, cobalt, iron, nickel, and manganese.

====Pottery====
Sodium silicate is used as a [[deflocculant]] in casting slips helping reduce [[viscosity]] and the need for large amounts of water to liquidize the clay body. It is also used to create a crackle effect in pottery, usually wheel-thrown. A vase or bottle is thrown on the wheel, fairly narrow and with thick walls. Sodium silicate is brushed on a section of the piece. After 5 minutes, the wall of the piece is stretched outward with a rib or hand.  The result is a wrinkled or cracked look.

It is also the main agent in "magic water", which is used when joining clay pieces, especially if the moisture level of the two differs.&lt;ref&gt;http://lakesidepottery.com/HTML%20Text/Tips/pottery-magic-mud-magic-water-paper-clay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sealing of leaking water-containing structures====
Sodium silicate with additives was injected into the ground to harden it and thereby to prevent further leakage of highly radioactive water from the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant]] in Japan in April, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail Reporter. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1373901/Fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-Liquid-glass-used-plug-leak.html#ixzz1IlSiOwOk "Liquid glass successfully plugs radioactive leak at crippled Fukushima nuclear plant"], "Mail Online News", April 6, 2011, accessed April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The residual heat carried by the water used for cooling the damaged reactors accelerated the setting of the injected mixture.

On June 3, 1958, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], the world's first nuclear submarine, visited Everett and Seattle. In Seattle, crewmen dressed in civilian clothing were sent in to secretly buy 140 quarts of an automotive product containing sodium silicate (originally identified as Stop Leak) to repair a leaking condenser system. The ''Nautilus'' was en route to the North Pole on a top secret mission to cross the North Pole submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Commander William R. Anderson with Clay Blair Jr., Nautilus 90 North (Cleveland and New York: The World Publishing Co., 1959), pp. 133–137; Commander William R. Anderson with Clay Blair Jr., Nautilus 90 North (New York: The New American Library, 1959), 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Firearm cartridges====
A historical use of the adhesive properties of sodium silicates is the production of [[paper cartridge]]s for black powder revolvers produced by [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]] during the period from 1851 until 1873, especially during the American Civil War. Sodium silicate was used to seal combustible nitrated paper together to form a conical paper cartridge to hold the black powder, as well as to cement the lead ball or conical bullet into the open end of the paper cartridge. Such sodium silicate cemented paper cartridges were inserted into the cylinders of revolvers, thereby speeding the reloading of cap-and-ball black powder revolvers. This use largely ended with the introduction of Colt revolvers employing brass-cased cartridges starting in 1873.&lt;ref name=kelley&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilwarguns.com/9508.html |title=Making and using combustible paper pistol cartridges |author=Tom Kelley |date=August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirst&gt;{{cite book |author=Kirst, W.J. |title=Self consuming paper cartridges for the percussion revolver |place=Minneapolis, Minnesota |publisher=Northwest Development Co. |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sodium silicate was also used to cement the top wad into brass [[shotgun shell]]s, thereby eliminating any need for a crimp at the top of the brass shotgun shell to hold a shotgun shell together. Reloading brass shotgun shells was widely practiced by self-reliant American farmers during the 1870s, using the same waterglass material that was also used to preserve eggs.  The cementing of the top wad on a shotgun shell consisted of applying from three to five drops of waterglass on the top wad to secure it to the brass hull.  Brass hulls for shotgun shells were superseded by paper hulls starting around 1877.  The newer paper-hulled shotgun shells used a roll crimp in place of a waterglass-cemented joint to hold the top wad in the shell.  However, whereas brass shotshells with top wads cemented with waterglass could be reloaded nearly indefinitely (given powder, wad, and shot, of course), the paper hulls that replaced the brass hulls could be reloaded only a few times.

===Food and medicine===

====Food preservation====
[[File:"Raise More Poultry...on Farms and Back Yards...More Eggs and Poultry Will save Beef and Pork." - NARA - 512571.tif|thumb|World War I poster suggesting the use of waterglass to preserve eggs (lower right).]]
Waterglass has been used as an egg preservative with large success, primarily when refrigeration is not available. 
Fresh-laid eggs are immersed in a solution of sodium silicate (waterglass). If they are then stored in appropriate environment, the majority of bacteria which would otherwise cause them to spoil are kept out and their moisture is kept in.
According to the cited source, treated eggs can be kept fresh using this method for up to five months. 
When boiling eggs so preserved, the shell is no longer accessible to water, and the egg will tend to crack unless a hole in the shell is made (e.g. with a pin) in order to allow steam to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/how-to-store-fresh-eggs-zmaz77ndzgoe How To Store Fresh Eggs]. motherearthnews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homebrewing====
Sodium silicate [[flocculant]] properties are also used to clarify wine and beer by precipitating colloidal particles. As a clearing agent, though, sodium silicate is sometimes confused with [[isinglass]] which is prepared from [[collagen]] extracted from the dried [[swim bladder]]s of [[sturgeon]] and other fishes. Eggs preserved in a bucket of waterglass gel, and their shells are sometimes also used (baked and crushed) to clear wine.&lt;ref&gt;SM Tritton (1956) ''Amateur wine making''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Is it the place to describe all that here ? Or maybe simply a joke ? Wikipedia is not a manual. Irrelevant information has been removed, but the main message is preserved hereabove. Assumed good faith. --&gt;

====Aquaculture====
Sodium silicate gel is also used as a substrate for algal growth in [[aquaculture]] hatcheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{doi|10.1021/j150528a013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16631">The '''space mapping''' methodology for modeling and design optimization of [[engineering systems]] was first discovered by [[John Bandler]] in 1993. It uses relevant existing knowledge to speed up model generation and design [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] of a system. The knowledge is updated with new validation information from the system when available.

==Concept==
The space mapping methodology employs a "quasi-global" formulation that intelligently links companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) and "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In engineering design, space mapping aligns a very fast coarse model with the expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment can be done either off-line (model enhancement) or on-the-fly with surrogate updates (e.g., aggressive space mapping).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Space Mapping Concept.png|thumb|left|400px|The space mapping concept as it has evolved over the years (Bandler et. al 1994-)&lt;ref name = "feel"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

==Methodology==
At the core of the process is a pair of models: one very accurate but too expensive to use directly with a conventional optimization routine, and one significantly less expensive and, accordingly, less accurate. The latter (fast model) is usually referred to as the "coarse" model ([[Coarse space (numerical analysis)|coarse space]]). The former (slow model) is usually referred to as the "fine" model. A validation space ("reality") represents the fine model, for example, a high-fidelity physics model. The optimization space, where conventional optimization is carried out, incorporates the coarse model (or [[surrogate model]]), for example, the low-fidelity physics or "knowledge" model. In a space-mapping design optimization phase, there is a prediction or "execution" step, where the results of an optimized "mapped coarse model" (updated surrogate) are assigned to the fine model for validation. After the validation process, if the design specifications are not satisfied, relevant data is transferred to the optimization space ("[[feedback]]"), where the mapping-augmented coarse model or surrogate is updated (enhanced, realigned with the fine model) through an iterative optimization process termed "parameter extraction". The mapping formulation itself incorporates "intuition", part of the engineer's so-called "feel" for a problem.&lt;ref name = "feel" /&gt; In particular, the Aggressive Space Mapping (ASM) process displays key characteristics of cognition (an expert's approach to a problem), and is often illustrated in simple cognitive terms.

A '''towel animal''' is a depiction of an [[animal]] created by folding small [[towel]]s. It is conceptually similar to [[origami]], but uses towels rather than paper. Some common towel animals are [[elephant]]s, [[snake]]s, [[rabbits]] and [[swan]]s.

The exact originator of towel animals is unknown, but their popularity is often attributed to [[Carnival Cruise Lines]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cruises.about.com/od/cruisenews/a/050209carnival.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestors of the towel animals are perhaps handkerchief animals or [[Napkin folding|napkin folds]].

Carnival, [[Norwegian Cruise Lines]], [[Disney Cruise Line]], [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], Disney Hotels and [[Holland America Line]] cruises will often place towel animals on a patron's bed as part of their nightly [[turndown service]]. Towel animals are also appearing in higher-end hotels and resorts such as [[Grupo Vidanta]]'s Grand Luxxe Residence Clubs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grandluxxe.com/&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nuevo Vallarta]] and [[Riviera Maya]].

[[File:Peacock and hen towel animal.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Peacock and peahen towel animals with flowers]]
Carnival offers their guests a book by pre-ordering before the cruise, or on board ship in the Formalities shop.&lt;ref&gt;Carnival Towel Creations, published by Navigate Express. The third edition contains an illustrated guide to making nearly 40 different towel animals&lt;/ref&gt; Holland America makes a similar offer. There are several other books available on the subject&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Deanna ''Towel Folding 101'', Barnes &amp; Noble Books (April 2006) {{ISBN|0-7607-7959-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Alison ''The Lost Art of Towel Origami'', Andrews McMeel Publishing (October 2005) {{ISBN|0-7407-5563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulanax Carol ''How to make a towel monkey and other cruise ship favorites'' , Tiny Tortoise Publishing (August 2006) {{ISBN|0-9787477-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland America Line|title=Towel Creations - 40 Designs|year=2007|publisher=New Holland + Publishers|asin=B001M96NRW}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these books illustrate how one can enhance the towel animals by the simple addition of cut-out eyes and button noses. Some of the creations in the gallery require the use of multiple towels and at times, [[hand towel]]s or [[washcloth]]s. The Grand Luxxe uses [[flower]]s or [[flower petal]]s and the tips of [[Arecaceae|palm]] branches to enhance some of their creations such as the image picturing a peacock and peahen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10993">{{Hydraulic fracturing}}

Radioactive sources are used for logging formation parameters. Radioactive tracers, along with the other substances in hydraulic-fracturing fluid, are sometimes used to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.&lt;ref name="Reis iodine" /&gt;

==Use of radioactive sources for logging==
[[File:LI1LOG.jpg|thumb|Composite [[wireline logging|wireline log]] for the Lisburne 1 well, Alaska - the [[Formation evaluation neutron porosity|neutron]] and [[density logging|density logs]] used radioactive sources]]
Sealed radioactive sources are routinely used in [[formation evaluation]] of both hydraulically fractured and non-fracked wells. The sources are lowered into the borehole as part of the [[well logging]] tools, and are removed from the borehole before any hydraulic fracturing takes place. Measurement of formation density is made using a sealed [[caesium-137]] source. This bombards the formation with high energy [[gamma ray]]s. The attenuation of these gamma rays gives an accurate measure of formation density; this has been a standard oilfield tool since 1965. Another source is americium berylium (Am-Be) neutron source used in [[Formation evaluation neutron porosity|evaluation of the porosity]] of the formation, and this has been used since 1950. In a drilling context, these sources are used by trained personnel, and radiation exposure of those personnel is monitored. Usage is covered by licenses from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines, SU or European Union protocols, and the Environment Agency in the UK. Licenses are required for access, transport, and use of radioactive sources. These sources are very large, and the potential for their use in a 'dirty bomb' means security issues are considered as important. There is no risk to the public, or to water supplies under normal usage. They are transported to a well site in shielded containers, which means exposure to the public is very low, much lower than the [[background radiation]] dose in one day.

==Radiotracers and markers==
The oil and gas industry in general uses unsealed radioactive solids (powder and granular forms), liquids and gases to investigate or trace the movement of materials.  The most common use of these radiotracers is at the well head for the measurement of flow rate for various purposes. A 1995 study found that radioactive tracers were used in over 15% of stimulated oil and gas wells.&lt;ref&gt;K. Fisher and others, [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=00030794 "A comprehensive study of the analysis and economic benefits of radioactive tracer engineered stimulation procedures,"] ''Society of Petroleum Engineers'', Paper 30794-MS, October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of these radioactive tracers is strictly controlled.  It is recommended that the radiotracer is chosen to have readily detectable radiation, appropriate chemical properties, and a half life and toxicity level that will minimize initial and residual contamination.&lt;ref name="IAEA 2003" /&gt;  Operators are to ensure that licensed material will be used, transported, stored, and disposed of in such a way that members of the public will not receive more than 1 mSv (100 mrem) in one year, and the dose in any unrestricted area will not exceed 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour.  They are required to secure stored licensed material from access, removal, or use by unauthorized personnel and control and maintain constant surveillance of licensed material when in use and not in storage.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; Federal and state nuclear regulatory agencies keep records of the radionuclides used.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

As of 2003 the isotopes [[Antimony-124]], [[argon-41]], [[cobalt-60]],  [[iodine-131]], [[iridium-192]], [[lanthanum-140]], [[manganese-56]], [[scandium-46]], [[sodium-24]], [[silver-110m]], [[technetium-99m]], and [[xenon-133]] were most commonly used by the oil and gas industry because they are easily identified and measured.&lt;ref name="IAEA 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Brunswick" /&gt; [[Bromine-82]],  [[Carbon-14]], [[hydrogen-3]], [[iodine-125]] are also used.&lt;ref name="IAEA 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

Examples of amounts used are:&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nuclide !! Form !! Activity
|-
| Iodine-131 || Gas || {{convert|100|mCi|GBq}} total, not to exceed {{convert|20|mCi|GBq|abbr=on}} per injection
|-
| Iodine-131 || Liquid || {{convert|50|mCi|GBq}} total, not to exceed {{convert|10|mCi|GBq|abbr=on}} per injection
|-
| Iridium-192 || "Labeled" frac sand || {{convert|200|mCi|GBq}} total, not to exceed {{convert|15|mCi|GBq|abbr=on}} per injection
|-
| Silver-110m || Liquid || {{convert|200|mCi|GBq}} total, not to exceed {{convert|10|mCi|GBq|abbr=on}} per injection

In hydraulic fracturing, plastic pellets coated with Silver-110m or sand labelled with Iridium-192with may be added to a proppant when it is required to evaluate whether a fracturing process has penetrated rocks in the pay zone.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;  Some radioactivity may by brought to the surface at the well head during testing to determine the injection profile and location of fractures. Typically this uses very small (50 kBq) Cobalt-60 sources and dilution factors are such that the activity concentrations will be very low in the topside plant and equipment.&lt;ref name="IAEA 2003" /&gt;

==Regulation in the US==
The NRC and approved state agencies regulate the use of injected radionuclides in [[hydraulic fracturing in the United States]].&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt;

The US EPA sets radioactivity standards for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA, [http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/basicinformation/radionuclides.cfm#What are EPA’s drinking water regulations for radionuclides? What are EPA's drinking water regulations for radionuclides?], accessed 15 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal and state regulators do not require sewage treatment plants that accept gas well wastewater to test for radioactivity. In Pennsylvania, where the hydraulic fracturing drilling boom began in 2008, most drinking-water intake plants downstream from those sewage treatment plants have not tested for radioactivity since before 2006.&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt; The EPA has asked the [[Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection]] to require community water systems in certain locations, and centralized wastewater treatment facilities to conduct testing for radionuclides.&lt;ref name="Urbina 26Feb2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA letter to PADEP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Urbina 07Mar2011" /&gt;

'''Viralytics''' Ltd is an Australian [[biotechnology]] company working in the field of [[oncolytic virus]]es, that is, viruses that preferentially infect and kill cancer cells. The company's oncolytic virus product, called [[Cavatak]], is currently in clinical trials in metastatic melanoma and other cancers. The drug was granted [[Orphan Drug]] status in advanced melanoma in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psiron's Cavatak received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20051221/pdf/3tv5gzx4nrrjx.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, [[Merck &amp; Co.]] announced it would acquire Viralytics for AUD$502 million ($394 million).&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-viralytics-m-a-merck-co/merck-to-buy-virus-based-cancer-drug-firm-viralytics-for-394-million-idUKKCN1G50ZN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==
Around 1999 a team led by the virologist Professor Darren Shafren at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] in Australia established that a [[Coxsackievirus]] called Coxsackievirus A21 was an oncolytic virus, in addition to being a common-cold virus causing mild upper respiratory tract infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Magee WE |author2=Miller OV. |title=Individual variability in antibody response of human volunteers to infection of the upper respiratory tract by coxsackie A21 virus. |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=122 |issue=3 |pages=127–38. |date=1 September 1970 |doi= 10.1093/infdis/122.3.127 |pmid=4317757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shafren filed for patent protection over the use of the virus in oncology&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent |country=WO |number=2001037866 |status= application |title=A method of treating a malignancy in a subject and a pharmaceutical composition for use in same |pubdate=2001-05-31 |fdate=2000-11-27 |pridate=1999-11-25 |invent1=Darren Shafren |assign1= The University of Newcastle
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Newcastle subsequently formed a spin-out company called ViroTarg Pty Ltd. An [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]]-listed biotech company called Psiron began to fund development of the ViroTarg project in June 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psiron signs MOU and moves to a cancer therapy focus|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20040622/pdf/3lxr775b152fy.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=22 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2006 acquired the Virotarg intellectual property. Psiron changed its name in the process to Viralytics to reflect the fact that oncolytic viruses were now its core focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Change of Name to Viralytic Ltd|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20061221/pdf/310885vn0wwcv3.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=21 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shafren's [[wild-type]] Coxsackievirus A21, which Viralytics called Cavatak, was trialled in a Phase I in melanoma between 2007 and 2010 and in 2012 the product entered a Phase II trial in advanced melanoma called 'CALM', short for '{{underline|CA}}vatak in {{underline|L}}ate Stage {{underline|M}}elanoma'. This trial took place under an [[Investigational New Drug]] application. The trial completed in 2015 with favourable results and multiple trials are now underway to establish various indications for Cavatak.

Viralytics stock is publicly traded on the ASX under the code VLA. In the US its [[American depositary receipt|ADRs]] have traded OTC since October 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commencement of ADR trading|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20061013/pdf/3yz7tmlkb3l28.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[OTC Markets Group|OTCQX]] under the code VRACY since August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Viralytics commences trading on US OTCQX marketplace|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20130805/pdf/42hh32cck2xdqn.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of ADRs to the ordinary shares is 30:1.

===Locations===
Viralytics' is headquartered in the City Mutual Building, an [[art deco]] icon in the Sydney CBD located at 66 [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]]. Darren Shafren has a laboratory in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===Cavatak===
Cavatak is the [[trade name]] for a preparation of wild-type [[Coxsackievirus]] A21, as manufactured by Viralytics. Within the ''[[Picornaviridae|Picornaviradae]]'' family of viruses, Coxsackievirus A21 is a member of the [[Human enterovirus C]] species. The virus consists of a single positive-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]] within a [[capsid]] of approximately 28&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.
The virus is known to utilise the [[viral entry]] receptor [[ICAM-1]] as its primary entry receptor, with [[Decay-accelerating factor|DAF]] as a [[co-receptor]] to infect host cells.&lt;ref name="pmid9151867"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shafren DR, Dorahy DJ, Ingham RA, Burns GF, Barry RD | title=Coxsackievirus A21 binds to decay-accelerating factor but requires intercellular adhesion molecule 1 for cell entry. | journal=J Virol | year= 1997 | volume= 71 | issue= 6 | pages= 4736–43 | pmid=9151867 | doi= | pmc=191695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanism of action====
The firm argues that Cavatak has a dual mechanism of action. As well as [[oncolysis]] through the preferential targeting of cells that over-express the molecules [[ICAM-1]] and/or [[Decay-accelerating factor|DAF]] compared to normal cells, there is also an immunological involvement in which the infection promotes tumour inflammation, which in turn prompts the patient's immune system to attack the infected cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Pre-clinical evidence of efficacy====
Shafren et al. first published data showing that Cavatak could destroy malignant melanoma cells in the journal ''[[Clinical Cancer Research]]'' in January 2004.&lt;ref name="pmid14734451"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shafren DR, Au GG, Nguyen T, Newcombe NG, Haley ES, Beagley L, etal | title=Systemic therapy of malignant human melanoma tumors by a common cold-producing enterovirus, coxsackievirus a21. | journal=Clin Cancer Res | year= 2004 | volume= 10 | issue= 1 Pt 1 | pages= 53–60 | pmid=14734451 | doi= 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-0690-3| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=14734451  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2005 paper in the ''[[International Journal of Oncology]]'' showed that this effect worked as well for melanoma exhibiting a highly vascular phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, in a paper in the ''[[British Journal of Haematology]]'', the Shafren lab showed that Cavatak could work in [[multiple myeloma]]&lt;ref name="pmid17391493"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Au GG, Lincz LF, Enno A, Shafren DR | title=Oncolytic Coxsackievirus A21 as a novel therapy for multiple myeloma. | journal=Br J Haematol | year= 2007 | volume= 137 | issue= 2 | pages= 133–41 | pmid=17391493 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06550.x | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=17391493  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years papers in ''[[The Prostate]]'' (May 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Berry LJ, Au GG, Barry RD, Shafren DR | title=Potent oncolytic activity of human enteroviruses against human prostate cancer. | journal=Prostate | year= 2008 | volume= 68 | issue= 6 | pages= 577–87 | pmid=18288643 | doi=10.1002/pros.20741 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18288643}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Breast Cancer Research and Treatment]]'' (January 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Skelding KA, Barry RD, Shafren DR | title=Systemic targeting of metastatic human breast tumor xenografts by Coxsackievirus A21. | journal=Breast Cancer Res Treat | year= 2009 | volume= 113 | issue= 1 | pages= 21–30 | pmid=18256929 | doi=10.1007/s10549-008-9899-2 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18256929}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested similar pre-clinical efficacy in [[prostate cancer|prostate]] and breast cancer respectively. What these cancers have in common is that they all have high levels of ICAM-1 expression.

====2007–2011: Early clinical work====
In January 2010 Viralytics reported favourable results from a nine patient Phase I trial of Cavatak in Stage IV melanoma patients ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT00438009) where the virus was administered intratumourally. In this trial, which was initiated in May 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Patient Enrolled in Viralytics' Phase I Melanoma Cancer Trial With Cavatak|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20070524/pdf/312ly6drpjd2tm.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not completed until 2009, all patients were given two Cavatak doses of the same size 48 hours apart into a single cutaneous melanoma lesion. Three patients received a low dose, three a middle dose and three a high dose.
* Five of the nine patients, or 55.6%, experienced transient/stable reductions in injected tumour volume or tumour stabilization. No objective responses were observed, however, two patients displayed stable disease as assessed by [[RECIST]] following [[CT scan]] evaluation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melanoma Phase I Clinical Trial Report Completed|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20100119/pdf/31n76qgzblyb5v.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two of the patients that had enjoyed large reductions in lesion volume registered elevated levels of serum [[GM-CSF]], suggesting that there had been an anti-tumour immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chief Scientific Officer's Presentation at the International Melanoma Conference|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20101105/pdf/31tq2j1ykqg4pb.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These results were presented at the May 2011 Annual Meeting of the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]], held that year in Chicago.

====2012–2015: The CALM study====
The Phase II CALM study ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT01227551) took a considerable period of time for Viralytics to initiate – the pre-IND meeting with the FDA was held in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US FDA Pre-IND Meeting Update|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20100625/pdf/31r0bc8k41zt6v.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Viralytics lodged its IND in November 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigational New Drug Application Lodged With the FDA|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20101103/pdf/31tn3878kqdb35.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the trial wasn't cleared until June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Allowance of FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for Cavatak Phase II Melanoma Trial|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20110627/pdf/41zfbjfzr2zl66.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the study didn't dose its first patient until after January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Patients Commence Cavatak Injections in Phase II Clinical Trial|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20120119/pdf/423v46n6ggv71s.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this [[open-label trial]] was eventually able to evaluate 57 patients with stage IIIc or stage IV melanoma. Each evaluated patient received 10 intratumoural injections of Cavatak over 18 weeks. The dose level was 3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; virus with the investigators measuring response rates as well as Progression Free Survival at 6 months, and tracking the immune response of the patient. The trial was one of the first in the world to make use of the new [[Immune-Related Response Criteria]].

* '''Immune-related Progression Free Survival'''. CALM's Primary Endpoint, reached in September 2013, was 10 patients from a total of 54 evaluable patients experiencing immune-related Progression Free Survival (irPFS) at six months, that is, their tumour had not 'progressed' (i.e. worsened) as determined by the Immune-Related Response Criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Primary Endpoint Achieved in Cavatak Phase II Melanoma Trial|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20130918/pdf/42jfgyp6t2wwxc.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014 Viralytics was able to report a 39% irPFS rate at six months (22 of 57 evaluable patients).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Updated positive data from Phase 2 trial of Cavatak in late stage melanoma|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20140929/pdf/42sj256mrsxfnj.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Survival and Response Rate.''' In June 2015 final survival data from CALM showed a 73% one-year Overall Survival rate in the CALM patients (43 out of 57 patients). The Overall Response Rate in the study from the final data was 28% (8 complete and 8 partial responses out of 57 patients). The Durable Response Rate, where the response continued more than six months, was 21% (12 out of 57 patients). The investigators also noted activity in non-injected distant lesions including lung and liver metastases.&lt;ref name="asx.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|title=Viralytics Reports Positive Final Results from Cavatak Phase II melanoma trial|url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150602/pdf/42yy9ntnfyw9vy.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2015|agency=asx.com.au|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Phase II study ([[ClinicalTrials.gov]] identifier NCT01636882) is giving patients from the CALM study who have not experienced an immune-related progression event another nine intra-tumoural Cavatak injections in order to allow biopsies taken from both injected and non-injected melanoma lesions. These biopsies are being examined with a view to better understanding how Cavatak triggers an immune response. Data from 13 evaluated patients in the study, reported in June 2015, has shown tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 upregulation in the area of the lesions, the latter phenomenon suggesting that Cavatak may be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;ref name="asx.com.au"/&gt;

The '''Wamesit Canal-Whipple Mill Industrial Complex''' is a historic mill and canal at 576 Lawrence Street in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].  This industrial area of Lowell, located on the [[Concord River]], underwent a major expansion from a more modest millworks in the mid-19th century by Oliver Whipple, a manufacturer of [[gunpowder]].

==Gunpowder mill==
Oliver Whipple was a grandson of [[American Revolutionary War]] officer James Whipple of [[Grafton, Massachusetts]]. Whipple was born in [[Weathersfield, Vermont]], in 1794; and in 1815 he followed the [[Connecticut River]] downstream to learn gunpowder manufacturing at the [[Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company#Formation|Laflin]] mill in [[Southwick, Massachusetts]]. As the Laflin brothers moved their gunpowder manufacturing operations elsewhere, Whipple moved east in 1818 to manage a gunpowder mill built by Moses Hale on River Meadow Brook in East Chelmsford upstream of its confluence with the Concord River. River Meadow Brook became known as Hale's Brook. Whipple became Hale's partner after marrying Hale's daughter in 1820. Whipple undertook the construction of a canal along the Concord River to provide power for a number of mills he erected in the area, consulting with engineer [[Loammi Baldwin, Jr.]] on the matter. Whipple manufactured ''Boston Gunpowder'' at the improved mill until 1855; although he began moving gunpowder manufacturing operations to a more remote location on Maine's [[Cumberland and Oxford Canal]] in 1833 to minimize risks of accidental explosions and to be closer to supplies of charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lowelllandtrust.org/greenwayclassroom/history/WhipplePowderMill.pdf |title=Whipple Powder Mill |last= |first= |website= |publisher=Lowell Land Trust |accessdate=13 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
The area was further developed in the second half of the 19th century by [[Benjamin Butler]]'s Wamesit Power Company, which acquired most of Whipple's properties and water rights.  Portions of Whipple's gunpowder mill built in the 1820s are among the oldest surviving industrial structures in the city.&lt;ref name=MACRIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=LOW.F|title=MACRIS inventory record for Wamesit Canal-Whipple Mill Industrial Complex|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

A '''weigh station''' is a checkpoint along a highway to inspect vehicular weights. Usually, [[truck]]s and [[commercial vehicle]]s are subject to the inspection.

Weigh stations are equipped with [[truck scale]]s, some of which are [[weigh in motion]] and permit the trucks to continue moving while being weighed, while older scales require the trucks to stop. There are many different scales used, from single axle scales to multi-axle sets. Signal lights indicate if the driver should pull over for additional inspection or if they are allowed to return to the highway.

Many jurisdictions employ the use of portable scales, allowing weigh stations to be set up at any point. Portable scales allow states to set up temporary scales for situations such as seasonal check points, temporary checkpoints on isolated roads often used by trucks, and help prevent drivers from avoiding scales at fixed locations. Portable scales may be set up at purpose built locations that are not normally manned. A common reason for setting up portable scales is to monitor trucks during harvest season.

==United States==
[[Image:WeighStationSign.jpg|right|thumb|[[Road signs in the United States#R13 Series: Weigh Stations|Road signs, like this]] one in [[Interstate 70 in Colorado]], typically indicate that a weigh station is upcoming, and a signal indicates whether it is open. ]]
A weigh station located near a state border is called a [[port of entry]]. States may also locate weigh stations in the interior of the state. Interior weigh stations are often located at choke points or areas where freight originates or is delivered. 

Weigh stations were primarily created to collect road use taxes before [[International Fuel Tax Agreement|IFTA]] created an integrated system of doing so. While taxes can still be paid at weigh stations, their primary function is now enforcement of tax and safety regulations. These include: to check freight carrier compliance with [[fuel tax]] laws; to check weight restrictions; to check equipment safety; to check compliance with hours of service Regulations. Weigh stations are regulated by individual state governments and therefore have vastly different requirements from state to state. They are typically operated by the state's [[Department of Transportation]] (DOT) or [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) in conjunction with the state [[highway patrol]] or [[state police]], thus enabling enforcement of applicable laws. The federal maximum weight is set at 80,000 [[pounds (mass)|pounds]]. Trucks exceeding the federal weight limit can still operate on the country's highways with an overweight permit, but such permits are only issued before the scheduled trip and expire at the end of the trip. Overweight permits are only issued for loads that cannot be broken down to smaller shipments that fall below the federal weight limit, and if there is no other alternative to moving the cargo by truck. Permitted oversize trucks are often required to coordinate with the Departments of Transportation and law enforcement agencies of the transited states before the trip begins, as most states require oversize trucks to be [[escort vehicle|escorted]]. Many states have [[weigh in motion]] technology that allow a continuous flow of truck weighing.

Many states also check freight paperwork, vehicle paperwork, and logbooks to ensure that fuel taxes have been paid and that truck drivers are obeying the [[hours of service]] (a federal requirement). Also, the truck and driver may have to undergo a DOT inspection, as most states perform the bulk of their DOT inspections at their weigh stations. In some cases, if a truck is found to be overweight, the vehicle is ordered to stop until the situation can be fixed by acquiring an overweight permit. In other cases, the driver may receive an overweight ticket and may or may not be required to offload the extra freight. Offloading the extra freight may not be practical for perishable or hazardous loads. The first state to implement a weight law was [[Maine]], which set a limit of 18,000 [[pounds (mass)|pounds]] (9 tons; 8,200&amp;nbsp;kg) in 1918.

Two types of loads may result in overweight trucks: divisible and non-divisible. A divisible load is a load which can be easily divided into smaller parts, such as products that are shipped on pallets, automobiles or grains. A non-divisible load is a load which is unable to be divided into smaller parts, like a piece of equipment or a steel beam. All states provide permits for non-divisible loads though the truck may have restricted routing. Some states allow tolerances for any over weight truck. Some states have specific allowances for types of loads for which they will allow tolerances. For example, Wyoming allows 2000 pounds for chains, tarps and [[dunnage]] that accompany a non-divisible load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopsareopen.com/news/overweight-in-wyoming.html |title=Overweight in Wyoming? |publisher=Coopsareopen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truckers often refer to weigh stations as "chicken coops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coopsareopen.com/news/truck-driver-chicken-obsession.html |title=Chicken Obsessions |publisher=Coopsareopen.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic weigh station bypass===

Many states now use electronic bypass systems (or AVI - Automatic Vehicle Identification) to alleviate some of the truck traffic through the weigh station. Some of the best known are [[PrePass]], [[NORPASS]] and [[Drivewyze]]. The system may consist of equipment at the weigh station itself, as well as a truck mounted [[transponder]] or [[smartphone]], usually placed on the inside of the windshield or on the dashboard. These are similar to transponders used for [[toll road|toll collection]]. Each transponder is directly registered to a specific truck, and contains a unique identification. The registration process propagates information such as carrier name, unit number, and elected gross weight to weigh stations. In addition, the system keeps a basic safety and compliance record for each vehicle. As a truck approaches a weigh station (approximately one mile before), an electronic "reader" on a boom over the freeway reads the information from the truck transponder. It also looks at the [[motor carrier safety rating|safety and compliance record]] on the database. A display shows the results to the weigh master, including the speed of the vehicle. The weigh master may have the system automatically determine if a truck needs to stop or may override the system. Approximately one-half to one full mile after passing under the "reader", the truck will pass under another boom which has an electronic unit to send the transponder a signal. If the safety information is acceptable the truck may receive a green light and can continue without entering the weigh station at all. There are weight detecting devices in the roadway itself. A driver may get a red light. On these occasions, the truck must pull into the weigh station for the normal weigh-in procedure. The most common reason a truck is "redlighted" is a weight problem, or a random check. Each time a truck is randomly pulled in, it is noted in the system whether the driver was compliant or not during the check. This affects how often a truck (or different trucks from the same company) are pulled in. For example, a company which is very compliant with the law will probably only have 5% of its trucks "redlighted."

==Canada==

===British Columbia===

Weigh Stations (aka "Scales") are usually on the right-hand side of the travelled highway, but median scales are appearing (as of 2005) on divided highways, often combined with "weigh-in-motion" technology.

A median scale is placed between the opposing lanes of traffic, necessitating heavy vehicles exiting from the left lane (rather than the right) and re-entering traffic from the left, potentially at a lower speed than the normal "free-flow" traffic would expect in the left (often thought of as "fast") lane.

"Weigh-in-motion" technology allows heavy vehicles that do not exceed limits of weight (and size) to pass the scale, thus improving both freight and weigh scale operation efficiency.

===Alberta===

In Alberta, scales can be on either side of the road, on the median or off-highway. Flashing lights inform drivers as to whether the scale is operational. Occasionally, the lights may be operational in only one direction.

Alberta scales are all of the 'weigh-in-motion' type, and vehicles are not required to stop; they merely have to slow to 10&amp;nbsp;km/h.

Scales which are not operational are often available to drivers as a 'self-weigh' site, where drivers can check their axle loads without enforcement officials being involved.

===North West Territories===

The government of the North West Territories operates only one scale. It is situated in the townsite of Enterprise, 83 kilometres north of the border with Alberta, and issues permits for vehicles from other jurisdictions as well as weighing vehicles and enforcing hours of service legislation.

==Taiwan==
[[Image:Taiwan road sign Art060.4.png|thumb|A weigh station sign in Taiwan with Chinese text reading: "trucks are to be weighed"]]

In Taiwan, weigh stations ({{zh|地磅站|links=no}}) are located on major highways, especially at all [[toll booths]] on [[freeway]]s. Advanced signs tell that trucks must enter the weigh stations when the attached lights are flashing, usually when tolls are collected.

Since the [[National Highway 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway 1]] was built with older designs, all weigh stations have older scales so trucks must stop. Weigh stations along the [[National Highway 3 (Taiwan)|National Highway 3]] have weigh-in-motion scales at 7 central and southern toll stations, but northern stations at [[Cidu]], [[Shulin]], and [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan]] have traditional scales where trucks must stop.

The Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau applies for periodical inspections of truck scales every three months.&lt;ref&gt;Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau: [http://www.freeway.gov.tw/14_content.asp?SID=25&amp;Item=13&amp;ord=13 Frequently asked questions] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truckers entering a weigh-in-motion scale are advised not to accelerate or decelerate suddenly, or they may be required to be weighed again.&lt;ref&gt;Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau: [http://www.freeway.gov.tw/IMAGES/drvsafe/28_03.PDF Safe Driving Guide] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
