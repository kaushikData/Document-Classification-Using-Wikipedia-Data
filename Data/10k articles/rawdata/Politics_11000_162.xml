      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">'''A2LL''' is the abbreviation of the [[Germany|German]] [[Unemployment benefits#Germany|social services and unemployment]] software system "[[Hartz concept#Hartz IV|Arbeitslosengeld II]] – Leistungen zum Lebensunterhalt" (Unemployment money II - subsistence payments). This [[eGovernment]] process was to help combine unemployment insurance and welfare, but has instead become one of the many difficulties associated with the [[Hartz IV]] reforms in Germany.

== Development ==
A2LL was first developed by a consortium of [[T-Systems]], the software division of the former German state telecommunications company, and ProSoz, with a team of 30 developers, in the town of [[Herten]]. The software, which was delivered late in the last quarter of 2004, went live on January 1, 2005. It is now only maintained by T-Systems, since ProSoz left the consortium in May 2005, allegedly due to being on the brink of bankruptcy, (according to the local paper "Hertener Allgemeine").

== Technology ==
The software is used in the social services offices through a web browser interface using secure communication. Administrative changes are only possible by direct access to the system via intranet of the Bundesagentur für Arbeit - the social services agency responsible for administrating welfare.

The system is based on 16 [[Server (computing)|server]]s with 4 [[central processing unit|processor]]s each, all running [[Linux]]. A [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] [[servlet]] container defines the [[Graphical User Interface|graphical user interface]]. A [[web services]] [[Software framework|framework]] from the  Systinet company, uses a server farm of approximately 200 Windows 2003 servers which run the application server developed by ProSoz. The application server was developed using [[Microsoft]]'s [[Distributed Component Object Model|(D)COM]] technology and uses an Informix 9.4x database running on a [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] machine containing 80 [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] and a 300 [[Gigabyte|GB]] Cache-[[Random access memory|RAM]].

== History ==
The software was delivered to large German cities such as [[Cologne]], [[Hamburg]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Berlin]] on October 18, 2004. Other towns followed on October 21, although only 20% of the end user stations were permitted to use the system, to keep it from going down. More and more stations were soon added to the system, but there were many problems with the extremely slow response and data entry times. Staff in the social services agencies had to work overtime to get as much data into the system as possible before the start.

On December 23, 2004, the system had 2.6 million households registered and the FINAS booking system was prepared to send out 1.3 billion euros to accounts across the nation on January 1.

The first major error was found during the first payment - account numbers which were shorter than the standard 10 digits were filled up with zeros on the end instead of the beginning (i.e., 1234567 became 1234567000 instead of the correct 0001234567). The banks could not process the payments and thus had to be credited to fragment accounts until they could be sorted out. Due to the massive number of mistakes, the banks had to invest much effort into locating the owners, and the government had to issue emergency cash so that people could buy food.

As a quick fix the system switched to printing checks (not normally used in German financial transactions), but since the field for the street name chosen was too small, many of the checks could not be delivered to the intended recipients.

The software house ProSoz, a wholly owed subsidiary of the city of Herten, was on the brink of bankruptcy and resigned from the consortium. T-Systems hired the programmers from the company.

Even six months after the start of the system, there were many needed features of the system that could not be used. For example, neither an [[analysis of variance]] nor a list of persons who had received too much money could be printed. The printing of documents was not flexible enough to fit many local situations. New legal rules for deducting current income from small jobs could not be completed in time for the official start of the system on October 1, 2005.

In July 2005 it was discovered that the system could not cope with one-time payments, for example so that schoolchildren could purchase books; consequently, this feature was disabled entirely. A few days later it was discovered that the system was not registering people properly with their insurance companies, causing enormous administrative headaches for the insurance providers.

In September 2005 the German press reported that the system had been transferring 25 million euros too much per month to the insurance providers. This meant that they could not calculate the new, lower insurance rate that was mandated to save the government money. According to press reports, an expert committee had determined the software to be non-maintainable and non-adaptable and was considering a completely new software system, just 9 months after it had gone into operation.

'''Accommodationism''' is a [[judicial interpretation]] which espouses that "the government may support or endorse religious establishments as long as it treats all religions equally and does not show preferential treatment."&lt;ref name="Education2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=Developing Core Literacy Proficiencies|date=15 September 2016|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|language=English |isbn=9781119192541|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Accommodationists''' espouse the view that "religious individuals, and/or religious entities may be accommodated by government in regard to such things as free exercise rights, access to government programs and facilities, and religious expression."&lt;ref name="Ravitch2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ravitch|first=Frank S.|title=Masters of Illusion: The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses|year=2007|publisher=[[NYU Press]]|language=English |isbn=9780814775851|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accommodationists hold that religion "has beneficial consequences for human behavior; that is, religion provides a transcendent basis for morality and provides limits for the scope of political conflict".&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=Clyde|last2=Jelen|first2=Ted G.|title=Public Attitudes Toward Church and State|date=16 September 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English |isbn=9781315485478|pages=20, 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; They teach that religion "combines an objective, nonarbitrary basis for public morality with respect for the dignity and autonomy of each individual" and thus "balances the need for public order with a respect for individual liberty."&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;

Since the time that the first president of the United States, [[George Washington]], wrote a notable letter to the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) affirming [[Peace Testimony|their right to conscientious objection with regard to war]], "the accommodationist position has been dominant in U.S. law and public culture".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/veiled-threats/?mcubz=3|title=Veiled Threats?|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|date=11 July 2010|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|language=English|accessdate=30 September 2017|quote=On the whole, the accommodationist position has been dominant in U. S. law and public culture ─ ever since George Washington wrote a famous letter to the Quakers explaining that he would not require them to serve in the military because the "conscientious scruples of all men" deserve the greatest "delicacy and tenderness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nussbaum2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|title=The New Religious Intolerance|date=24 April 2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|language=English|isbn=9780674065918|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also advocated by many [[social conservatives]] of many political orientations, such as [[Christian democratic]] political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Political Economy, Issues 19-21|year=1986|publisher=Carleton University Graphic Services|language=English |page=97|quote=Shortly after Independence, George Washington offered an influential statement of the accomodationist position in a letter he wrote to the Quakers, apropos of their refusal to perform military service (1789)...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accommodationism stands in tension with the judicial interpretation of [[separation of church and state]], and the constitutionality of various government practices with respect to religion is a topic of active debate.  Both principles arise from interpretations of the [[Establishment Clause]] and the [[Free Exercise Clause]] in the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]].

== History == 
[[File:Valley Forge prayer.jpg|thumb|In his role as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Continental Army]], General [[George Washington]] acknowledged a day of "fasting, humiliation and prayer" proclaimed by the Continental Congress to be held on Thursday, May 6, 1779. To enable his soldiers to observe the day, Washington ordered a one-day cessation of recreation and "unnecessary labor".&lt;ref name="writings of George Washington"&gt;{{cite book|page=369 |title=The Writings of George Washington, from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 |volume=14 |date=1779 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Historians [[Mark Noll]] and Luke E. Harlow write that accommodationism was the view held by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]:&lt;ref name="NollHarlow2007"/&gt;

{{quotation|The accommodationist perspective emphasizes rather that the First Amendment was clearly not intended to be antireligious--indeed, as already suggested, it was drafted precisely to protect the various religious practices of the states, including preferential establishments in some of them. Accommodationists therefore reinterpret the First Amendment to make of religious liberty a positive right, the exercise of which is to be encouraged by the government. By the same token, they believe that the First Amendment excludes only the direct establishment of, or preferential treatment for, a particular religion. Indeed, government should facilitate the practice of religion by both individuals and collectivities as essential to the common good. This position is very different from that of the separationists and leads to markedly different contemporary policies and practices. In addition, as the point of departure for historical interpretation, it focuses attention upon the residual religious quality of this founding period, which was hardly secularist. The same Congress that proposed the First Amendment was opened with prayer and named a chaplain. Indeed, most of the early presidents declared occasional days of thanksgiving--and even of humiliation. Provision was made for support of religion in western lands. And, in time, the resources of religious groups were utilized in making government policy for relations with Native Americans. In sum, accommodationists consider that the operative ideal of the early republic was a nonpreferentialist posture of support for religion on the part of the government. In turn, that seems to point toward a modern ideal of accommodation of government to religion in ways that secure the greater common civil good as well as serve the spiritual ends of numbers of citizens.&lt;ref name="NollHarlow2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noll|first1=Mark A.|last2=Harlow|first2=Luke E.|title=Religion and American Politics: From the Colonial Period to the Present|date=13 September 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780198043164|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted that most [[Christian denomination]]s produce similar political effects in society:&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;
{{quotation|The sects that exist in the United States are innumerable. They all differ in respect to the worship which is due to the Creator; but they all agree in respect to the duties which are due from man to man.... Moreover, all the sects of the United States are comprised within ''the great unity of Christianity, and Christian morality is everywhere the same''.... Christianity, therefore, reigns without obstacle, by universal consent; the consequence is ... that every principle of the moral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is abandoned to the debates and experiments of men." (Tocqueville 1945, 314- 15; emphasis added).&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;}}
In light of this broad consensus, many political scientists have noted that religion legitimizes political authority.&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt; Accommodationism also opines that "there is a common set of religiously based morals" with values such as "chastity, honesty, charity, and frugality [which are] ultimately regarded as having a religious basis, but are common to virtually all religious traditions".&lt;ref name="SchultzWest1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schultz|first1=Jeffrey D.|last2=West|first2=John G.|last3=MacLean|first3=Iain S.|title=Encyclopedia of Religion in American Politics|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|language=English |isbn=9781573561303|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard John Neuhaus]] likewise stated that religion provides a "sacred canopy" under which political activity can occur, stating:&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;
{{quotation|Politics derives its directions from the ethos, from the cultural sensibilities that are the context of political action. The cultural context is shaped by our moral judgments and intuitions about how the world and how it ought to be. Again, for the great majority of Americans such moral judgments and intuitions are inseparable from religious belief. Perhaps this is true not jus of the majority but of all of us, whether or not we call our ultimate values religious. In any event, whether it is called the Judeo-Christian etehic, or Christianity,... it is the dynamic of religion that holds the promise of binding together [''religare''] a nation in a way that may more nearly approximate ''civitas'' (1984, 60).&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;}} In light of what accommodationists see as the ethical dimension of religion, especially that of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, in the United States "accomodationists tend to take a very narrow view of the establishment clause, arguing that this clause ''only'' requires nonpreferentialism".&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;

In contrast to Tocqueville's view, different Christian denominations have taken opposing views on moral issues which have been the basis for law, such as [[Christian views on slavery|slavery]], [[Christian views on contraception|contraception]], [[Abortion and Christianity|abortion]], [[homosexuality|Christianity and homosexuality]], [[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|capital punishment]], and [[Christianity and violence|war]].  Some of these disputes break down into the [[Christian right]] vs. [[Christian left]]. [[Christian libertarianism]] is directly opposed to the use of state power to support religious beliefs.

== Policy == 
[[File:2014 ATB Quarter Obv.png|thumb|right|A [[quarter dollar]] with the United States' official motto "In God We Trust" on the obverse side]]
Accommodationism advocates providing aid to [[parochial schools]], [[school vouchers]] that provide tax credit for private/parochial schools, as well as nonsectarian [[school prayer]], as long as these policies apply equally to all religious institutions and individuals.&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt; In contrast to those advocating [[laïcité]], accommodationists view the expression of one's religious faith in the public sphere as a human right, such as the wearing of a [[cross necklace]] or [[Headscarf#Headscarves and religion|headcovering]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonomastatestar.com/news/2015/1/10/cross-necklace-controversy-sweeps-ssu-campus|title=Cross necklace controversy sweeps SSU campus|author=Katie McDonagh|author2=Cameron Hatheway|last-author-amp=yes|date=5 July 2013|publisher=Sonoma State Star|language=English|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nussbaum2010"/&gt;

In the United States, religious-based federal holidays and observances, including the [[National Day of Prayer]] and [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], as well as [[Christmas]], exist based on accommodationist principles.&lt;ref name="Drakeman1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Drakeman|first=Donald L.|title=Church-state Constitutional Issues: Making Sense of the Establishment Clause|date=1 January 1991|publisher=Greenwood Press|language=English |isbn=9780313276637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accommodationism also is seen in national anthem and the official motto of the United States, [[In God We Trust]], as well as in the judicial oath [[So help me God]].&lt;ref name="Drakeman1991"/&gt; Notably, [[William O. Douglas]], Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, sounded the "clarion call for accommodation" when he stated in his ruling:
{{quotation|We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as one chooses. We make room for as wide a variety of beliefs and creeds as the spiritual needs of man deem necessary. We sponsor an attitude on the part of government that shows no partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal of its dogma. When the state [p314] encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. (Reports 343 U.S. 310 [1952])&lt;ref name="WaldCalhoun-Brown2010"/&gt;}}

In the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled with an accommodationist outcome in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'', ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'', ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'', ''Board of Education v. Allen'', ''[[Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York]]'', ''Tilton v. Richardson'',  ''Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Maryland'', ''CPERL v. Regan'', ''Widmar v. Vincent'', ''Larson v. Valente'', ''[[United States v. Lee (1982)|United States v. Lee]]'', ''[[Mueller v. Allen]]'', ''[[Marsh v. Chambers]]'', ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', ''Alamo Foundation v. Secretary of Labor'', ''[[Bowen v. Roy]]'', ''[[Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind]]'', ''[[Goldman v. Weinberger]]'', ''Corp. of Presiding Bishop v. Amos'', ''[[Bowen v. Kendrick]]'', ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'', ''[[Hernandez v. Commissioner]]'', ''Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v.

Freedom From Religion Foundation]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="WaldCalhoun-Brown2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wald|first1=Kenneth D.|last2=Calhoun-Brown|first2=Allison|title=Religion and Politics in the United States|date=16 August 2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442201538|pages=80–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics == 
In the United States, organizations that promote accommodationism include [[The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty]], [[Foundation for Moral Law]], [[Lord's Day Alliance]], [[Alliance Defending Freedom]], [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], and the [[First Liberty Institute]].&lt;ref name="BanksBlakeman2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banks|first1=Christopher P.|last2=Blakeman|first2=John C.|title=The U.S. Supreme Court and New Federalism: From the Rehnquist to the Roberts Court|date=13 July 2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442218581|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social conservatism in the United States|Socially conservative]] political parties such as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]], and [[American Solidarity Party]] espouse accommodationism.&lt;ref name="WilcoxJelen2016"/&gt;

Organizations that have argued against accommodationist policies in the United States include [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]], the [[Military Religious Freedom Foundation]], [[People for the American Way]], and the [[Secular Coalition for America]].

'''Adelbert Althouse''' (May 23, 1869 &amp;ndash; May 17, 1954) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Captain (United States)#U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Captain]] who served as the 27th and 29th [[Naval Governor of Guam]]. Prior to his Governorship, he served on ships in the Navy and participated in both the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I]]. He earned the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for his actions commanding {{USS|Brooklyn|CA-3|6}} and serving as Chief of Staff for the Commander and Chief of the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] during the World War. As Governor, he focused on reforming the island's education system. He modeled a new system after that of co-educational [[California]], but also outlawed the speaking of the [[Chamorro language]] at schools in an effort to improve the [[English language]] skills of the local children. Most of his education reform took place in his first term.

Asked in November 2018 to name three policies by the Trump administration that had contributed to cleaner air, Wheeler struggled to answer and two of his three answers were rollbacks of Obama administration policies intended to curb climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/politics/epa-administrator-climate-report/index.html|title=Acting EPA administrator says administration deserves credit for decline in carbon emissions in wake of climate report|author=Gregory Wallace|publisher=CNN|access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Ukrainian sentiment''' or '''Ukrainophobia''' is animosity towards Ukrainians, [[Ukrainian culture]], [[Ukrainian language|language]] or [[Ukraine]] as a nation.&lt;ref name = "Okara"&gt;Andriy Okara. Ukrainophobia is a gnostic problem. "[http://www.ji.lviv.ua/n18texts/okara.htm n18texts Okara]". Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, significant presence of Ukrainophobia may be distinguished in three geographical areas, where it differs by its roots and manifestation:
*In the [[Russian Federation]], and among the [[Russophone]] population of South-Eastern Ukraine (where a large portion of the population is composed of ethnic Russians).&lt;ref name="Olson-Pappas"&gt;James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CquTz6ps5YgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=James+Stuart+Olson,+Lee+Brigance+Pappas,+Nicholas+Charles+Pappas,+An+Ethnohistorical+Dictionary+of+the+Russian+and+Soviet+Empires&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TIA1T-2SCuWjiALBxZDDCg&amp;ved=0CDYQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994. {{ISBN|0-313-27497-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{page needed|date=February 2012}} Its opposite is [[Ukrainophilia]].
*In Poland
*In Canada, where a significant [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian diaspora]] is present.
Historically, Ukrainian culture was oppressed in states which included the Ukrainian population: [[Russian Empire]], [[Soviet Union]] and historical Polish states.

Modern scholars define two types of anti-Ukrainian sentiment. One is based on discrimination of Ukrainians based on their ethnic or cultural origin, a typical kind of [[xenophobia]] and [[racism]]. Another one is based on the conceptual rejection of [[Ukrainians]], Ukrainian culture, and language as artificial and unnatural; at the turn of the 20th century, several authors supported an assertion that Ukrainian identity and language had been created artificially in order to undermine Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjZ-m82b91MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA166&amp;dq=Russia+anti-Ukrainian#PRA1-PA165,M1|title=Russia and Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been promulgated by several conservative Russian authors.&lt;ref name="Okara"/&gt;

==Ukrainophobic stereotypes==
Ukrainophobic stereotypes range from mockery to ascribing negative traits to the whole Ukrainian nation.

==Russian Empire==
{{see also|Russification of Ukraine}}
The rise and spread of Ukrainian self-awareness around the time of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] produced an anti-Ukrainian sentiment within some layers of society within the [[Russian empire]]. In order to retard and control this movement, the use of Ukrainian language within the Russian empire was initially restricted by official government decrees such as the [[Valuev Circular]] &lt;small&gt;(July 18, 1863)&lt;/small&gt; and later banned by the [[Ems ukaz]] &lt;small&gt;(May 18, 1876)&lt;/small&gt; from any use in print (with the exception of reprinting of old documents). Popularly the anti-Ukrainian sentiment was promulgated by such organizations as the "[[Black Hundreds]]", which were vehemently opposed to Ukrainian self-determination. Some restrictions on the use of Ukrainian language were relaxed in 1905–1907. They ceased to be policed after the February Revolution in 1917.

[[File:Kaniv1914.jpg|thumb|right|Russian gendarmes in 1914 at the [[Taras Shevchenko]] burial.]]Beside the [[Ems ukaz]] and [[Valuev Circular]], there were a [[Chronology of Ukrainian language bans|multiple number]] of other anti-Ukrainian edicts starting from the 17th century, when Russia was governed by the [[House of Romanov]]. In 1720 [[Peter the Great]] issued an edict prohibiting printing books in the Ukrainian language, and since 1729 all edicts and instructions have only been in the [[Russian language]]. In 1763 [[Catherine the Great]] issued an edict prohibiting lectures in the [[Ukrainian language]] at the [[Kiev-Mohyla Academy]]. In 1769 the [[Most Holy Synod]] prohibited printing and using the Ukrainian [[alphabet book]]. In 1775 the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] was destroyed. In 1832 all studying at schools of the [[Right-bank Ukraine]] transitioned to exclusively [[Russian language]]. In 1847 the Russian government persecuted all members of the [[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]] and prohibited the works of [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]], [[Nikolay Kostomarov]] (Mykola Kostomarov) and others. In 1862 all free Sunday schools for adults in Ukraine were closed. In 1863 the Russian Minister of Interior Valuev decided that the Little Russian language (Ukrainian language) had never existed and could not ever exist. During that time in the winter of 1863–64, the [[January Uprising]] took place at the western regions of the [[Russian Empire]], uniting peoples of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Next year in 1864 the "Regulation about elementary school" claimed that all teaching should be conducted in the [[Russian language]]. In 1879 the Russian Minister of Education [[Dmitry Tolstoy]] (later the Russian Minister of Interior) officially and openly stated that all people of the Russian Empire should be '''Russified'''. In the 1880s several edicts were issued prohibiting education in the [[Ukrainian language]] at private schools, theatric performances in Ukrainian, any use of Ukrainian in official institutions, and [[Naming ceremony|christening]] Ukrainian names. In 1892 another edict prohibited translation from the Russian to Ukrainian. In 1895 the Main Administration of Publishing prohibited printing children books in Ukrainian. In 1911 the resolution adopted at the 7th Congress of Noblemen in Moscow prohibited the use of any languages other than Russian. In 1914 the Russian government officially prohibited celebrations of the 100th Anniversary of Shevchenko's birthday and posted gendarmes at the [[Chernecha Hill]]. The same year [[Nicholas II of Russia]] issued an edict prohibiting the Ukrainian press.

Under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule in Ukraine, a policy of [[korenization]] was adopted after defeat of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and initially supported Ukrainian cultural self-awareness. This policy was phased out in 1928 and terminated entirely in 1932 in favor of general [[Russification]].

In 1929 [[Mykola Kulish]] wrote a theatrical play "Myna Mazailo" where the author cleverly displays the cultural situation in Ukraine. There was supposedly no anti-Ukrainian sentiment within the Soviet government, which began to repress all aspects of Ukrainian culture and language contrary to the ideology of Proletarian Internationalism.

In 1930 the [[Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process]] took place in [[Kharkiv]], after which a number of former Ukrainian politicians and their relatives were deported to Central Asia. The ethnic cleansing against the Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] was never evaluated and is poorly documented.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The contemporary historical reevaluations of that period are viewed as hostile by the leadership of the [[Russian Federation]], or at the very least as unfriendly.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

During the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], the population of Ukraine was reduced by the artificial famine called [[Holodomor]] in 1932–33 along with the population of other nearby agrarian areas of the USSR.

Many prominent Ukrainians were labelled as nationalists or anti-revolutionaries, and many were repressed and executed as ''[[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Dmytryshyn, ''Moscow and the Ukraine, 1918–1953: A Study of Russian Bolshevik Nationality Policy'', Bookman Associates, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1944 during a session of Politbureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin personally gave a speech "About anti-Lenin mistakes and nationalistic perversions in a film-tale of [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] "Ukraine in flames".&lt;ref&gt;Shapoval, Yu. ''[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2013/05/9/123358/ Гітлер, Сталін і Україна: безжальні стратегії (Hitler, Stalin and Ukraine: merciless strategies)]''. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. May 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 1951 the Communist newspaper [[Pravda]] published an article "On Ideological Perversions in Literature" in regards of the [[Volodymyr Sosyura]]'s poem "Love Ukraine" where it stated the following: "This poem could have been signed by such foes of the Ukrainian people as [[Symon Petliura|Petliura]] and [[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]] ... For Sosiura writes about Ukraine and the love of it outside the limits of time and space. This is an ideologically vicious work. Contrary to the truth of life, the poet sings praises of a certain ‘eternal’ Ukraine full of flowers, curly willows, birds, and waves on the Dnipro."&lt;ref&gt;Siundiukov, I.

===Soviet language policy in cinematography of Ukraine===
The biggest film studio of Ukraine, [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]] ([[Kiev]]), explicitly shows the Soviet language policy of [[Russification]] even during the so-called policy of "[[korenizatsiya]]". A simple analysis of all studio productions which accounts for some 378 films shows that 338 films (88.9%) were produced either completely in the [[Russian language]] or the [[Ukrainian language]] could be heard in few episodes or in folkloristic scenes (such as songs) to distinct Ukrainian region. Only 22 (5.8%) films were produced in the [[Ukrainian language]] and language production of another 14 (3.7%) films was difficult to evaluate, while 6 (1.6%) films were really bilingual (Russian-Ukrainian).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/blogs/2013/07/17/130811/ Dovzhenko Film Studios as a mirror of Russification policy in the USSR]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. July 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other incidents===
Numerous publications have been written about Russification by a number of academics and literary specialists such as [[Nina Virchenko]], [[Rostyslav Dotsenko]], [[Mykhailyna Kotsiubynska]] (niece of [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]]), and many others.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Ukraine==

On Sunday July 15, 2012 the national television broadcasting station in Ukraine [[Pershyi Natsionalnyi (Ukraine)|First National]] in its news program "Weekly overview" ({{lang-uk|Підсумки тижня}}) showed a video footage on a development of anti-Ukrainian sentiments within Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/videos/2012/07/18/90151/ 2012: історія русифікації від провладного телеканалу (2012: History of Russification by the pro-state TV-station)], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (July 18, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

A propaganda article posted on the website of the [[Kremenchuk]] department of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] argues that history that was published during the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet regime]] was the true history, and that new historical facts being uncovered from the archives are false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Василий Витальевич Шульгин.

Mykola Levchenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian from [[Party of Regions]], and the deputy of [[Donetsk]] City Council states that there should be only one language, Russian. He says that the Ukrainian language is impractical and should be avoided. Levchenko called Ukrainian the language of folklore and anecdotes. However, he says he will speak the literary Ukrainian language on principle, once Russian is adopted as the sole state language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.ua/politics/35871-sekretar-donetskoji-miskradi-levchenko-pro-movu-shevchenka-i-sifilis.html|title=Секретар Донецької міськради Левченко – про мову, Шевченка і сифіліс|author=Антон Зікора|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna German, the spokesperson of the same party, highly criticized those statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homin.ca/news_view.php?category=news&amp;news=1189&amp;lang=ua|script-title=uk:Анна Герман вважає провокаційною заяву Миколи Левченка щодо Української мови|trans-title=Hanna Herman considers Mykola Levchenko's statement concerning the Ukrainian language to be provocative|language=uk|work=homin.ca|date=8 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928061430/http://www.homin.ca/news_view.php?category=news&amp;news=1189&amp;lang=ua|archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mykhailo Bakharev, the vice-speaker of the Crimean Autonomous Republic parliament (and the main editor of [[Krymskaya Pravda]]), openly says that there is no Ukrainian language and that it is the language of the non-educated part of population. He claims that it was invented by [[Taras Shevchenko]] and others. He also believes that there is no Ukraine nation, there is no future for the Ukrainian State, and that Ukrainization needs to be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Semena |first1=Nikolai  |journal=[[Zerkalo nedeli]] |date=10 October 1997 |volume=40 |issue=157 |page=4 |url= http://www.zn.ua/1000/13275/ |script-title= ru:"Объявить Крым зоной интеллектуального бедсвия..." предложил вице-спикер крымского парламента Рефат Чубаров.

===Minister of Education of Ukraine===
The former Ukrainian Minister of Science and Education, [[Dmytro Tabachnyk]], sparked protests calling him anti-Ukrainian in some parts of Ukraine due to this statements about Western Ukrainians, his preference for the Russian language, and his [[Holodomor denial|denial of the Holodomor]].&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100419052542/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/62086/ "Furor over Tabachnyk appointment rising"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101009062917/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/84817/%22Ukrainian Education Minister Tabachnyk Confirms His Russian Nationalist Credentials"&lt;/ref&gt; Tabachnyk's view of [[History of Ukraine|Ukraine’s history]] includes the thesis that western Ukrainians aren’t really [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]. In an article for the [[Russia]]n newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'' Tabachnyk wrote last year: “[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Halychany]] (western Ukrainians) practically don’t have anything in common with the people of [[Great Ukraine]], not in mentality, not in religion, not in linguistics, not in the political arena” “We have different enemies and different allies. Furthermore, our allies and even brothers are their enemies, and their ‘heroes’ ([[Stepan Bandera]], [[Roman Shukhevych]]) for us are killers, traitors and abettors of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]’s executioners.”&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"/&gt; By March 17, 2010 four of western Ukraine’s regional councils had passed resolutions calling for the minister’s dismissal. A host of civic and student organizations from all over the country (including [[Kherson]] in southern Ukraine and [[Donetsk]] in [[Ukraine|eastern Ukraine]]), authors and former [[Soviet dissidents]] also signed petitions calling for his removal.&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"/&gt; Tabachnik also had stated that Ukrainian history textbooks contained "simply false" information and announced his intention to rewrite them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukranews.com/news/18566.---.uk|script-title=uk:Табачник: українські й російські вчителі будуть викладати історію за спільним посібником|trans-title=Tabachnyk: Ukrainian and Russian teachers will be teaching history using a joint manual|language=uk|work=ukranews.com|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Katya Gorchinskaya|title=Tabachnyk's views are dangerous in classroom|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/tabachnyks-views-are-dangerous-in-classroom-62058.html|agency=Kyiv Post|date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll held by [[Levada Center]] in June 2009 in Russia 75% of Russian respondents respected Ukrainians as ethnic group but 55% were negative about Ukraine as the state.

==Canada==
Anti-Ukrainian discrimination was present in Canada from the arrival of [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainians in Canada]] around 1891 until the late 20th Century. In one sense this was part of a larger trend towards [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] in English Canada during the period. But Ukrainians were singled out for special discrimination because of their large numbers, visibility (due to dress and language), and political activism. During the First World War, [[Ukrainian Canadian internment|around 8,000 Ukrainian Canadian were interned by the Canadian government as "enemy aliens"]] (because they came from the Austrian Empire). In the interwar period all Ukrainian cultural and political groups, no matter what their ideology was, were monitored by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and many of their leaders were deported.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Steve. "Policing the Promised Land: The RCMP and Negative Nation-building in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Interwar Period", ''The Prairie West as Promised Land'' ed. R. Douglas Francis and Chris Kitzan (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2007), 318-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

This attitude began to slowly change after the [[Second World War]], as Canadian immigration and cultural policies generally moved from being explicitly pro-British to a more pluralistic foundation. Ukrainian nationalists were now seen as victims of communism, rather than dangerous subversives. Ukrainians began to hold high offices, and one, Senator [[Paul Yuzyk]] was one of the earliest proponents of a policy of "[[multiculturalism]]" which would end official discrimination and acknowledge the contribution of non-English, non-French Canadians. The [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] of the 1960s, which had originally been formed only to deal with French-Canadian grievances, began the transition to multiculturalism in Canada because of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s desire to court Ukrainian votes in Western Canada. The Commission also included a Ukrainian commissioner, [[Jaroslav Rudnyckyj]].

Since the adoption of official multiculturalism under [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 1982, Ukrainians in Canada have had legal protection against discrimination.

The caption reads, "So that's what you, [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]], look like!" and the sign reads "Caution: [[Khokhol]]s" - a reference to an [[ethnic stereotype]] of Ukrainians supposedly extremely fond of  [[Salo (food)|''salo'']] (pork [[fatback]])]]
The use of ethnic slurs and stereotypes in relation to Ukrainians in [[Russian media]]&lt;ref name="smi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smi.ru/02/06/28/548258.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20020705025808/http://www.smi.ru/02/06/28/548258.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-07-05|publisher=archive.is|title={{lang&amp;#124;ru&amp;#124;Андрей Моченов, Сергей Никулин.

MCK}}|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of Ukrainian community's concerns in Russia.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;

===Ethnic slurs===
*[[Bohunk]]
* [[Khokhol]]
* Saloyed (Literally: ''[[Salo (food)|salo]]'' eater; based on a stereotype and a running joke that ''salo'' is a national food favorite of the Ukrainians)
*Ukr (plural:Ukry): After gaining its independence, Ukrainians started rebuilding their history after a long period of [[Polonization]] and [[Russification]]. This nation-building drive was derided by Russians. A Russian running joke is that Ukrainians derive the name of the country ''Ukraine'' from the name of the ancient tribe of "Ukrs" (also derisively called "Great Ukrs", Великие Укры).
* Ukrop (literally "[[dill]]", a pun: '''ukr'''ainian&lt;-&gt;'''ukr'''op).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/putin-unapologetic-uncompromising-on-war-against-ukraine-375567.html Putin unapologetic, uncompromising on war against Ukraine], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (Dec. 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The slur was repurposed by Ukrainians during the [[war in Donbass]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/26519406.html "Як українці стають «Укропами»"], ("How Ukrainian become 'Ukrops'") ''[[Radio Liberty]],'' Ukraininan redaction&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the [[UKROP]] party.

===Political insults and historical nicknames===
* Maloross - Ukrainian, literally "dweller of ''Malorossiya'' ([[Little Russia]])". In the 19th century it was a neutral word in Russian language, but considered discriminatory by Ukrainians.
There are a number of Russian insults based on the alleged opposition of all Ukrainians to all things Russian (or all things [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], in the past)
* ''Mazepinets'' - (Mazepite, [[Ivan Mazepa]] supporter) - archaic
* ''Pyetlyurovets'' - (Petlyurite, [[Symon Petliura]] supporter)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vladislav Berdichevskiy, MP of the People’s Council of the DPR from the fraction Free Donbass about postponing of elections (VIDEO)|url=http://novorossia.today/vladislav-berdichevskiy-mp-of-the-people-s-council-of-the-dpr-from-the-fraction-free-donbass-about-postponing-of-elections-video/|accessdate=|work=Novorossia Today|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Zhydobandera'' or ''Zhydobanderovets'' - a conflation of Zhyd (i.e. a [[Kike]]) and a Bandera follower.
* ''Maidaun'' - a conflation of the [[Euromaidan]] and the [[Down Syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teenslang.su/id/16647|title=Что такое Майдаун - Значение слова "Майдаун"|author=Штирлитсс|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Svidomit'' - derived from Ukrainian "svidomyi", i.e. conscious or conscientious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teenslang.su/index.php?searchstr=%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82&amp;slang=|title=Что такое свидомит - Значение слов "свидомит"|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian "sodomit", [[sodomy|sodomite]].

===Other===
*''Mova'' - a Russian derisive slang reference to [[Ukrainian language]] (''mova'' literally means "language" in Ukrainian, but there is no such word in formal Russian language){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="677">The '''Association of Socialist Greens''' was a political ginger group, often called a faction, founded by [[Derek Wall]] and others  following the Socialist Conference organised by Tony Benn in the year after the 1987 General Election. It became involved in responses to attempts to organise the UK Green Party (now the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]) on more conventional lines in the 1980s. It ran a newsletter known as ''[[The Way Ahead (Green newsletter)]]''.

It is not affiliated with the more recently created [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], of which Wall is also a founding member.

'''Augustus III''' ({{lang-pl|August III Sas}}, {{lang-lt|Augustas III}}; 17 October 1696 {{ndash}} 5 October 1763) was [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]] from 1734 until 1763, as well as [[List of rulers of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1733 until 1763 where he was known as '''Frederick Augustus II''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Friedrich August II}}).

The only legitimate son of [[Augustus II of Poland]], he followed his father's example by joining the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1712. In 1719 he married [[Maria Josepha]], daughter of the Holy Roman emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] and became elector of Saxony on his father's death in 1733. As a candidate for the Polish crown, he secured the support of the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] by assenting to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], designed to preserve the integrity of the [[Habsburg]] inheritance, and that of the Russian empress [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] by supporting Russia's claim to [[Courland]]. Chosen king by a small minority of electors on 5 October 1733, he drove his rival, the former Polish king [[Stanisław I]], into exile. He was crowned in [[Kraków]] on 17 January 1734, and was generally recognised as king in [[Warsaw]] in June 1736.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43134/Augustus-III&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus gave Saxon support to [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]] in the War of the [[War of Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession (1742)]] and again in the [[Seven Years’ War]] (1756), both of which resulted in Saxony being occupied by Prussia. His last years were marked by the increasing influence of the [[Czartoryski]] and [[Poniatowski]] families, and by the intervention of [[Catherine the Great]] in Polish affairs. His rule deepened the anarchy in Poland and increased the country's dependence on its neighbours. The [[Russian Empire]], which had assisted him in his bid to succeed his father, prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne, supporting instead the aristocrat [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]]. During his reign, Augustus spent little time in Poland and more interested in ease and pleasure than in affairs of state, this notable patron of the arts left the administration of Saxony and Poland to his chief adviser, [[Heinrich von Brühl]], who in turn left Polish administration chiefly to the powerful [[Czartoryski family]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

The reign of Augustus witnessed one of the greatest periods of disorder in [[Poland|Polish history]].

==Biography==
[[File:Augustus III of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Augustus, aged 19&amp;nbsp;years in 1715 by [[Nicolas de Largillière]]]]
Augustus was the only legitimate son of [[Augustus II the Strong]], [[Prince-Elector]] of [[Saxony]] and king of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] who belonged to the Albertine line of the [[House of Wettin]]. His mother was [[Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]]. Groomed to succeed his father as king of [[Poland]], Augustus converted to Catholicism in 1712; when publicly announced, this caused discontent among the [[Protestant]] Saxon aristocracy.&lt;ref name= "Flathe"&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich Theodor | last = Flathe | title = Friedrich August II., Kurfürst von Sachsen | journal = [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB) | volume = 7 | publisher = Duncker &amp; Humblot | place = Leipzig | year = 1878 | pages = 784–86 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staszewski"&gt;{{Citation | first = Jacek | last = Staszewski | title = August III.

[[File:Royal Monogram of King Augustus III of Poland.svg|thumb|left|150px|Royal Monogram Of King Augustus III of [[Poland]].]]
Upon the death of Augustus II in 1733, Augustus inherited the Saxon electorate and was elected to the Polish throne, with the support of the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He was opposed by the forces of [[Stanisław I Leszczyński]], who had usurped the throne with Swedish support during the [[Great Northern War]]. Reigning from 1706 until 1709, Stanisław was overthrown after the Swedish [[Battle of Poltava (1709)|defeat at Poltava]]. Returning from exile in 1733 with the support of [[Louis XV of France]], Stanisław sparked the [[War of the Polish Succession]], which concluded in 1738 with a victory for Augustus's Russian and Imperial allies.&lt;ref name ="Flathe" /&gt;

As King, Augustus was uninterested in the affairs of his Polish–Lithuanian dominion, focusing instead on hunting, the opera, and the collection of artwork (see [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]). He spent less than three years of his thirty-year reign in Poland, where political feuding between the [[House of Czartoryski]] and the [[Potocki family|Potocki]] paralysed the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] ([[Liberum veto|Liberum Veto]]), fostering internal political anarchy and weakening the Commonwealth. Augustus delegated most of his powers and responsibilities in the Commonwealth to [[Heinrich von Brühl]], who served in effect as the viceroy of Poland.

Augustus's eldest surviving son, [[Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony|Frederick Christian of Saxony]], succeeded his father as Elector. A Russian-supported coup d'état in Poland, instigated by the Czartoryskis, resulted in the election of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] as king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 7 September 1764. Reigning under the name Stanisław II, Poniatowski was the son of [[Stanisław Poniatowski (1676–1762)|the elder Stanisław Poniatowski]], a powerful Polish noble and a onetime agent of Stanisław I; he was a lover of [[Catherine II of Russia]] and as such enjoyed strong support from that Empress's court.

August was portrayed by [[Ernst Dernburg]] in the 1941 film ''[[Friedemann Bach (film)|Friedemann Bach]]''.

==Marriage and children==
In [[Dresden]] on 20 August 1719, Augustus married [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria]], the eldest child of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I, the Holy Roman Emperor]]. They had sixteen children:&lt;ref name="Flathe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staszewski" /&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1733, the composer [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] dedicated the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Mass for the Dresden court]] (Kyrie and Gloria of what would later become his [[Mass in B Minor]]) to Augustus in honor of his succession to the Saxon electorate, with the hope of appointment as Court Composer, a title Bach received three years later.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11619/ |title = Missa in B Minor ("Kyrie" and "Gloria" of the B Minor Mass) |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1733 |accessdate = 2013-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bach's title of 'Koeniglicher Pohlnischer Hoff Compositeur' ('Royal Polish Court Composer,' and court composer to the Kurfuerst of Saxony) is engraved on the title page of Bach's famous [[Goldberg Variations]].

'''''Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea''''' is a 2013 book by [[Mark Blyth]] that explores the [[economic policy]] of [[austerity]]. Studying the use of austerity around the world up to the early 2010s and tracing its intellectual lineage, Blyth argues that the case for [[expansionary fiscal contraction|increasing economic growth through austerity]] is overstated, is counterproductive when implemented during recessions, and has exacerbated the [[Eurozone crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.time.com/2013/04/18/why-austerity-is-a-dangerous-idea/ Blyth, Mark (April 18th, 2013). Why Austerity Is a Dangerous Idea. ''TIME''. Retrieved March 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Austerity'' was selected among the ''Best Books of 2013'' by reviews in the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/f60b681e-529f-11e3-8586-00144feabdc0 ''Financial Times'' (November 29th, 2013).

== Background==

[[Mark Blyth]] is the Eastman Professor of Political Economy and Professor of Political Science and International and Public Affairs at [[Brown University]]'s [[Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty/blyth Profile of Mark Blyth on the website of the Watson Institute. Retrieved March 23rd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''Austerity'' in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession]] following the [[G20]]s' turn in mid-2010 away from [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] [[fiscal stimulus]] and towards fiscal consolidation and [[austerity]].&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, Mark (2013). ''Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. Preface.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis==

Blyth begins by reviewing the arguments in favour of [[austerity]], namely an increase in business confidence and consequent investment due to less [[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]] of private sector debt by government debt and a lower risk of default and the inefficiency of public spending due to small [[fiscal multiplier]]s. While Blyth acknowledges that countries cannot solve the problem of high public debt through further borrowing, he highlights that it is impossible for countries in a globalized economy to increase [[economic growth]] by simultaneously cutting public spending. Exploring the rationale for austerity in the 2010s, he traces the built-up of public debt in the U.S. and European countries back to governments' bailouts of the financial sector during and after the [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] and the use of countercyclical policies in the [[Great Recession]], in contrast to austerity advocates' narrative of governmental profligacy (with the exception of [[Greece]]). With regard to the [[European debt crisis]], Blyth explains how the institutional setup of the [[Eurozone]] - in particular the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]'s narrow focus on inflation control, countries' inability to individually devalue their currencies after the adoption of the [[euro]], and the financial sector's overleveraging - created a situation in which solvent North European countries were unwilling to financially support already highly indebted South European countries without the latter's commitment to austerity because of [[moral hazard]].

Thereafter, Blyth goes on to trace austerity's origins to [[classical economics|classical economists]]' ([[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Adam Smith|Smith]]) negative view of government debt, its translation into [[liquidationism]] in the U.S. ([[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]]) and into the [[Treasury view]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and the intellectual dominance of [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]] [[deficit spending]] over austerity in the wake of the [[Great Depression]]. He then describes how the doctrine of austerity survived intellectually within [[Germany]]'s [[ordoliberalism]] due to its lack of emphasis on business cycle management as well as within the [[Austrian School of Economics]] in the U.S. ([[Ludwig von Mises|Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]], [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]]), how the displacement of Keynesianism by [[monetarism]] ([[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]) focused macroeconomic policy on [[inflation]] control through [[central bank independence]] and dismissed [[natural rate of unemployment|unemployment as voluntary]], and how the [[public choice]] school's theory of [[political business cycle]]s ([[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], [[George Stigler|Stigler]]) criticized the negative role of [[democracy]] for fiscal stability, thereby setting the stage for a revival of austerity in the form of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]'s [[structural adjustment programme]]s. Blyth also explains the intellectual genesis of the theory of [[expansionary fiscal contraction]] at the hands of [[Alberto Alesina|Alesina]], [[Guido Tabellini|Tabellini]], [[Francesco Silvia Ardagna|Ardagna]], and [[Roberto Perotti|Perotti]]. Turning towards austerity's empirical record between 1914 and 2012, Blyth critically investigates the effectiveness of austerity in the [[interwar period]], emphasizing the role of austerity in the rise of [[fascism]], and dismisses the case studies from the 1980s and early 2000s (mostly Baltic and Eastern European countries) typically advanced by austerity advocates on various grounds. Finally, comparing Ireland's 2008 bank bailout with Iceland's 2009 default, Blyth questions whether the financial sector is worth saving and suggests [[financial repression]] and more [[progressive taxation]] as alternatives to austerity with regard to reducing governments' public debt.

== Reception==

Overall, ''Austerity'' received mixed to positive reviews.

==Education and career==

Chase graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[mathematics]] in 1983. She then studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] at [[Harvard Extension School]]&lt;ref name="weil"/&gt;  and at [[Middlebury College]]’s Intensive Summer Language Institute. In 1985, Chase was working as a [[graphic designer]].&lt;ref name="ota1986"&gt;U.S. Congress, [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (1986). Intellectual property rights in an age of electronics and information, OTA-CIT-302. U.S. Government Printing Office, April. {{ISBN|1-4289-2303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved to [[Japan]] as a visiting scholar at [[Hiroshima University]]. She later started a [[computer software]] firm near [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="ward1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward | first1 = Fred | year = 1989 | title = Images for the computer age | url = | journal = [[National Geographic Magazine]] | volume = 175 | issue = | pages = 718–751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Japan, she also did translation work. "I was good at all the hard stuff, the non-emotional stuff that’s considered more masculine."&lt;ref name="McDonough"/&gt; Upon return to the United States, Chase began working as an intersex activist. In 2008, Chase received a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[organization development]] from [[Sonoma State University]].

==Activism==
Chase had a "[[mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]" in her mid-30s.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;Liu, Shirley. [http://www.curvemag.com/Detailed/77.html Cheryl Chase.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506064735/http://www.curvemag.com/Detailed/77.html |date=May 6, 2006 }} ''[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]''&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''Salon'' she once contemplated committing [[suicide]] "in front of the mutilating physician who had rendered her genitalia numb and scarred."&lt;ref name="hyena"/&gt; When she was 35, Chase returned to the U.S. and badgered her mother for answers, then embarked on a search for a fuller understanding of what she had learned. Chase contacted many academic researchers and people with personal experiences of intersex conditions. In 1993, via a letter to the editor published in ''[[The Sciences]]'' July/August issue, she founded the now-defunct [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) by fiat and asked for people to write to her under her new name, Cheryl Chase, the beginning of the movement to protect the [[Intersex human rights|human rights]] of people born with intersex conditions in the U.S.&lt;ref name="chasefiat"&gt;Chase, Cheryl. [http://www.nyas.org/publications/sciences/pdf/ts_07_93.pdf Letters from readers.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928114318/http://www.nyas.org/publications/sciences/pdf/ts_07_93.pdf |date=2006-09-28 }} ''[[The Sciences]]'' July/August 1993, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, she began using the names Bo Laurent and Cheryl Chase simultaneously, sometimes in the same publication.&lt;ref name="hwafall95"&gt;Laurent B (1995). Sexual scientists question treatment. in Chase C (ed.) ''[[Hermaphrodites with Attitude]]'' Fall/Winter 1995-1996, p. 16 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; She is the creator of ''Hermaphrodites Speak!'' (1995), a 30-minute [[documentary film]] in which several intersex people discuss the psychological impact of their conditions and the medical treatment and parenting they received,&lt;ref name="Humpartzoomian"&gt;Humpartzoomian R, Rye BJ (2000). Hermaphrodites Speak! (Review). ''Journal of Sex Research'', Aug2000, Vol. 37 Issue 3, p295-298.&lt;/ref&gt; and the editor of the journal ''[[Hermaphrodites with Attitude]]''.

In 1998 Chase wrote an [[amicus brief]] for the [[Intersex rights in Colombia|Colombian]] constitutional court, which was then considering a ruling on surgery for a six-year-old boy with a [[micropenis]]. In 2004, Chase and the ISNA persuaded the [[San Francisco Human Rights Commission]] to hold hearings on medical procedures for intersex infants. Chase has published commentaries in medical journals&lt;ref name="chasenurse"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chase | first1 = Cheryl | year = 1999 | title = Rethinking treatment for ambiguous genitalia | url = | journal = Pediatric Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 451–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has criticized [[feminist]] writers, including [[Alice Walker]] and [[Katha Pollitt]], for not putting intersexuality on the feminist agenda, despite their condemnation of [[female genital cutting]] in [[Africa]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="newitz"&gt;Newitz, Annalee (July 27, 1999). [http://www.gettingit.com/article/552 They Wrecked My Genitals! When doctors try to fix what ain't broke .] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217025218/http://www.gettingit.com/article/552 |date=February 17, 2006 }} Gettingit.com&lt;/ref&gt; ISNA was honored with the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]]'s 2000 Felipa de Souza Human Rights Award.

[[File:Chase and Mathias marry.jpg|right|thumbnail|Cheryl Chase and Robin Mathias married in California in 2008.]]Chase’s activism was a factor in the [[urology]] and [[endocrinology]] disciplines’ reopening of their consideration of intersex conditions. Chase advocates a more complex view of intersexuality: in particular, that difficulties cannot be eliminated by early genital surgery.  In August 2006, ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' published a letter signed by 50 international experts, including Chase, titled "Consensus Statement on the Management of Intersex Disorders". The statement, however, does not discourage surgical interventions, but did emphasize caution.

In 2017, Chase took part in the launch of a report by [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]] on medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children, “I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me”, based on interviews with intersex persons, families and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=khnlt6qNFS0 | title = HRW Live: Medically Unnecessary Surgeries on Intersex Children in the US| date = July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that [[intersex medical interventions]] persist as default advice from doctors to parents, despite some change in some regions of the U.S. and claims of improved surgical techniques, resulting in an uneven situation where care differs and a lack of standards of care, but paradigms for care are still based on socio-cultural factors including expectations of "normality" and evidence in support of surgeries remains lacking. "Nearly every parent" in the study reported pressure for their children to undergo surgery, and many reported misinformation. The report calls for a ban on "surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred."&lt;ref name="hrw2017"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-62313-502-7| last1 = Human Rights Watch| author1-link = Human Rights Watch | last2 = interACT | author2-link = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = "I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me"| date = July 2017| url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Chase has written about being openly [[lesbian]] since her 20s.&lt;ref name="healy1986"&gt;Eloise Klein Healy, "Looking for the Amazons," ''Lesbian Ethics'', Spring 1986, 2(1):50-64&lt;/ref&gt; Chase [[Same-sex marriage in California|married]] her partner of five years, Robin Mathias, in [[San Francisco]] in 2004.

[[Image:Constituencies for French residents overseas.svg|thumb|right|500px|The eleven constituencies (note Bhutan, North Korea and Western Sahara in grey).]]
{{Politics of France}}
The '''constituencies for French residents overseas''' are eleven [[Constituency (France)|French constituencies]], each electing one representative to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].

They were created by the [[2010 Redistricting of French Legislative Constituencies|2010 redistricting of French legislative constituencies]], the aim of which was to enable French citizens overseas (''Français établis hors de France'') to be represented as such, rather than vote in a constituency on French territory, as was the case previously. Their creation does not increase the overall number of seats in the Assembly, which remains stable at 577, since it is compensated for by a redrawing of boundaries which reduces the number of seats in France itself to 566. These measures were implemented for the [[French legislative election, 2012|June 2012 legislative election]]. (There are already [[Senate of France|Senators]] representing overseas citizens, since 1982, but, like all French Senators, they are elected indirectly, by the [[Assembly of French Citizens Abroad]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/les-francais-etranger_1296/elections-2012-votez-etranger_20721/elections-deputes-par-les-francais-etranger-2012_91742.html "Elections 2012 - Votez à l’étranger"], French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/role/fiche/franc_etrang.html "La représentation des Français établis hors de France"], French Senate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepetitjournal.com/homepage/expat/48389-dtfrans-de-langer.html "Redécoupage électoral - 11 députés pour les Français de l'étranger"], ''Le Petit Journal'', October 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/region/deputes-de-l-etranger-comment-ca-marche_794793.html "Députés de l'étranger: comment ça marche?"], ''L'Express'', October 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of these constituencies created some controversy, when ''[[Le Monde]]'' estimated that they would be far more favourable to the main centre-right party, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), then in power, than to the main centre-left party, the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS). The newspaper pointed out that, in nine of these constituencies, a majority of voters appeared to favour the right, based on the figures from the [[2007 French presidential election]]. The constituency of Central and Eastern Europe and that of North-West Africa were the only ones to appear left-leaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2009/06/29/francais-de-l-etranger-9-circonscriptions-a-droite-2-a-gauche_1213146_823448.html "La couleur politique des nouvelles circonscriptions des Français à l'étranger"], ''Le Monde'', September 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Le Monde'' provided the figures without comment, left-wing politicians such as Socialist MP [[Jean-Jacques Urvoas]] suggested that the government was attempting to provide itself with extra seats, and [[French Communist Party|Communist]] MP [[Jean-Paul Lecoq]] suggested overseas citizens should continue to vote solely in French constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepetitjournal.com/homepage/expat/48389-dtfrans-de-langer.html "Redécoupage électoral - 11 députés pour les Français de l'étranger"], ''Le Petit Journal'', October 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to expectations, however, the Socialist Party candidates won seven of the eleven constituencies in the 2012 election, with their parliamentary allies in [[Europe Ecology – The Greens]] (EELV) winning one, and the UMP winning only three. Two of the winning Socialist candidates were later disqualified by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] due to campaign finance irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Le Conseil constitutionnel annule l'élection de deux députées PS des Français de l'étranger |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/02/15/le-conseil-constituionnel-annule-l-election-de-deux-deputees-ps-des-francais-de-l-etranger_1833158_823448.html#meter_toaster |accessdate=2017-02-02 |work=[[Le Monde]] |agency=AFP |date=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were replaced in by-elections by a candidate from the UMP and a candidate from the center-right [[Union of Democrats and Independents]] (UDI), leaving the overseas constituencies with five MPs from the Socialist Party, four from UMP (which in 2015 changed its name to [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]]), one from EELV, and one from UDI.

In the [[French legislative election, 2017|2017 election]], [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s party [[La République En Marche!]] (REM) won a majority of seats in the National Assembly nationwide and also was the most successful party in the overseas constituencies, winning 8 of the 11 seats. Another constituency went to a candidate from [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]], which is allied with REM in the legislature. One UDI candidate retained his seat, and one seat was won by an independent candidate.

In all, the [[Americas]] are divided into two constituencies, North and South (1 &amp; 2); Europe into six (3 to 8), with the eighth constituency also incorporating [[Israel]]; and [[Africa]] into two (9 &amp; 10), with the tenth constituency also incorporating the [[Arabian peninsula]] as well as [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. The eleventh constituency, the largest, includes every other country in [[Asia]], as well as the entirety of [[Oceania]], along with [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Overseas departments and territories of France]] are not included, as they are ''de jure'' part of France, and already have [[Constituency (France)#Overseas: 22 constituencies|their own electoral constituencies]]. In addition, [[North Korea]], which is [[France – North Korea relations|not diplomatically recognised by France]], is not part of any constituency. [[Foreign relations of Bhutan|The same is true]] of [[Bhutan]]. [[Kosovo]], which is [[France–Kosovo relations|recognised by France]], is part of the seventh constituency. [[Taiwan]] is incorporated into the eleventh constituency as part of China, as France [[People's Republic of China – France relations|recognises]] the [[One China policy]]. [[Western Sahara]] is not part of any constituency - being neither recognised as part of [[Morocco]], nor included in the ninth constituency in its own right. The status of the [[Palestinian territories]] is not explicitly defined, but French residents there were able to vote, as part of the same constituency as [[Israel]]. Other self-proclaimed and ''de facto'' but non-recognised independent countries, such as [[Somaliland]] or [[Abkhazia]], are incorporated as part of the country which claims sovereignty over them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/les-francais-etranger_1296/elections-2012-votez-etranger_20721/les-elections-2012-etranger_20770/votre-circonscription-pour-election-deputes_91684.html "Les élections en 2012 à l’étranger: Votre circonscription pour l’élection des députés"], French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/emission/20120601-legislatives-francaises-8e-circonscription-etranger-reportage-israel "Les législatives françaises dans la 8e circonscription de l'étranger - Reportage en Israël"], Radio France Internationale, 1 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral results==

===2012===
The [[French legislative election, 2012|2012 legislative election]] resulted in the election of the very first National Assembly members representing French residents overseas.

Voting occurred over a week, from 23 to 29 May or on 2 or 3 June for the first round, well in advance of voting in [[metropolitan France]] (10 June) or certain [[overseas departments and territories of France|French overseas territories and departments]] (9 June). [[Two-round voting|Second round voting]] occurred from 6 to 12 June or on 16 or 17 June (as opposed to 17 June alone in metropolitan France). Unlike their compatriots in France itself, expatriates could vote by [[postal ballot]] or over the Internet, though they could of course vote in person in their local consulate. The date depends on voters' location and the method by which they cast their ballot. If an expatriate voted via the Internet, he or she had a week to do so from 23 to 26 May. A [[postal ballot]] could be cast, if received by 31 May in the [[Americas]] or by 1 June in the rest of the world. Those who preferred to vote in person in their local consulate had to do so on 2 June in the Americas or 3 June in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/les-francais-a-l-etranger/elections-2012-votez-a-l-etranger/elections-legislatives/article/dates-et-modalites-98992 Elections législatives.

In April 2011, the ruling [[Union for a Popular Movement]] chose several prominent members to stand as candidates overseas. Thus, [[Frédéric Lefebvre]], Secretary of State for Commerce, was chosen as UMP candidate for the First constituency; [[Éric Besson]], Minister of Industry, for the Fifth; and [[Thierry Mariani]], Secretary of State for Transport, for the Eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2011/04/12/01002-20110412ARTFIG00729-legislatives-l-ump-a-designe-ses-candidats-pour-l-etranger.php "Législatives : l'UMP a désigné ses candidats pour l'étranger"], ''Le Figaro'', April 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] preferred to select long-term residents of their respective constituencies, who are active in their local community but generally unknown in national French politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ffe-ps.org/2011/05/10/pour-des-deputes-ps-a-l%E2%80%99etranger-en-2012-2/ "Elections législatives 2012 : nos candidates et candidats"], Parti Socialiste - Fédération des Français à l'Etranger&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other parties presented candidates, in particular the [[MoDem]] and the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]]. Many independent candidates were also present in all consistencies.

In the first round, the Socialist Party finished first in six constituencies, while a Socialist-endorsed Green candidate finished first in the second constituency (Central America, Caribbean and South America). The Union for a Popular Movement finished first in the other three (the fifth, tenth and eleventh). The second round, in every constituency except the second, was a run-off between the Socialist Party and the UMP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/les-francais-a-l-etranger/elections-2012-votez-a-l-etranger/elections-legislatives/article/resultats-provisoires-pour-le-1er Official results for the first round of the 2012 legislative election], French Ministry for Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; The second round confirmed this trend, with the left taking eight seats, and the UMP only three. This was a significant surprise; early indications had been that most of the seats would go to the right. Indeed, the UMP government had been accused of having created these constituencies so as to establish right-wing safe seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2012/06/18/la-gauche-l-emporte-chez-les-francais-de-l-etranger_1720178_823448.html "La gauche l'emporte chez les Français de l'étranger"], ''Le Monde'', 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/fr/20120618-gauche-rafle-circonscriptions-francais-etranger-legislatives-expatries-lefebvre-narassiguin "La gauche rafle 8 des 11 circonscriptions des Français de l’étranger"], France 24, 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The left's victory in North America was described as "incredible", and explained, by commentators in ''[[Libération]]'', as being due to Socialist candidate [[Corinne Narassiguin]]'s strong and active campaign, and local voters' rejection of UMP candidate [[Frédéric Lefebvre]], perceived as knowing little about North America and as barely speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washington.blogs.liberation.fr/great_america/2012/06/la-vague-socialiste-emporte-même-lamérique.html "La vague socialiste emporte même l'Amérique!"], ''Libération'', 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Turnout was particularly low in every constituency (from 13 to 28%). A number of expatriates, living far from any polling station, said they had been unable to vote online, because they had not received the necessary login codes, or because of errors when they attempted to log in and cast their vote. Others said they had abstained deliberately, considering that they should not be voting in an election when the results would primarily affect residents of France. Others considered that the candidates were necessarily ill-suited to represent the interests of expatriates scattered over often vast and diverse territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2012/06/08/legislatives-les-francais-de-l-etranger-abstentionnistes-expliquent-leur-non-vote_1715155_823448.html "Législatives : les Français de l'étranger abstentionnistes expliquent leur non-vote"], ''Le Monde'', 8 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Based on projections from the 2007 presidential election results, the carving of constituencies should have resulted in a 9-to-2 division of the seats between the UMP and the Socialists, however French expatriates ended up electing seven Socialists, one Green (Europe Écologie - Les Verts) and three UMP deputies. The results were likely impacted by low turnout and support for Francois Hollande following his presidential election.

In February 2013, the elections of Socialist MPs [[Corinne Narassiguin]] and [[Daphna Poznanski-Benhamou]] were annulled by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], due to irregularities in the funding of their electoral campaigns. They were barred from standing for public office for a period of one year. Four defeated right-wing candidates in their two constituencies were also barred from standing for public office for a year, for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/02/15/le-conseil-constituionnel-annule-l-election-de-deux-deputees-ps-des-francais-de-l-etranger_1833158_823448.html "Le Conseil constitutionnel annule l'élection de deux députées PS des Français de l'étranger"], ''Le Monde'', 15 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dislocated worker funding''' is typically used to help workers in events of mass employment loss. In the [[United States of America | United States]] several grants have been established by the [[United_States_Secretary_of_Labor|Secretary of Labor]] known officially as National Dislocated Worker Grants. The grants provide resources for states or other applicants to mitigate job losses caused by large, unexpected layoffs.&lt;ref name=doleta/&gt; The grants were established in 2014 by the [[Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act]].

==Grants==

The grants have been used for a variety of reasons in the United States since their creation. A common reason is layoffs attributed to aging energy infrastructure such as end-of-life coal power plants or closing coal mines.&lt;ref name=doleta&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.doleta.gov/DWGs/ |title=National Dislocated Worker Grants |work=U.S. Department of Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KULR8&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulr8.com/story/38205224/colstrip-awarded-nearly-1-million-grant-for-workforce-planning-and-worker-training/ |title=Colstrip awarded nearly $1 Million grant for workforce planning and worker training |work=kulr8.com |publisher=kulr8.com |accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heavy Metal im Fantasy 16.jpg|thumb|Distinctive features: clothing, habit, and codes]]
In sociology, '''distinction''' is a social force that assigns different values upon different people in societies. In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (''La Distinction'', 1979), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] described how the [[power (sociology)|powers that be]] define [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] concepts such as "[[Taste (aesthetics)|taste]]", whereby the [[social class]] of a person tends to determine his or her cultural interests, likes, and dislikes, and how political and socio-economic, racial and sexual distinctions, based upon social class, are reinforced in daily life within society. Moreover, in ''[[The Rebel Sell|The Rebel Sell: Why the Culture Can't be Jammed]]'' (2004),  [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] describe "distinction" as a social competition in which the styles of social [[fashion]] are in continual development, and that the men and women who do not follow the development of social trends soon become stale, and irrelevant to their social-class stratum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">The '''English Reformation Parliament''', which sat from 3 November 1529 to 14 April 1536, was the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] that passed the major pieces of [[legislation]] leading to the [[English Reformation|Break with Rome]] and establishment of the [[Church of England]]. In Scotland, their [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|1560 Parliament]] had a similar role. Sitting in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] of [[England]], the Parliament was the first to deal with major religious legislation, much of it orchestrated by [[Thomas Cromwell]].

==Background==
After the failure of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] to win the [[Court of Blackfriars]], Henry VIII was frustrated. He was left without a male heir, and his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], was considered to be past child-bearing age. In 1529, Henry opened what would later become known as the English Reformation Parliament. It opened in the month of October and ran until December 1529 without forming a coherent plan on what to do. Because of this, Henry used it to discredit Wolsey. Soon after this Henry turned his attentions to the church itself.

==Acts==
The major pieces of legislation from the Reformation Parliament included: &lt;ref&gt;The names of these acts (and others) may be found at the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1485–1601#1529 (21 Hen. 8)|List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1485–1601]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1529 Clergy legal privilege removed===
An Act passed to prevent the Clergy being subject to separate [[Ecclesiastical court|canonical courts]]. Instead they were now to be tried in the same way as everybody else in England was and not be looked upon favourably by the courts.

===1530 Praemunire charges reinstated===
The Parliament accepted the reinstatement of the charge named [[Praemunire]] where individuals could be convicted of a crime for appealing to any power outside of the realm for resolution of a situation within England. In particular, the law was aimed at those recognising the Pope's authority. The law gave leave that charges could be dropped if fines of £118,000 were paid.

===1532 Rome deprived of a portion of Annates normally remitted===
The session of 1532 saw plan and purpose that had not been evident in earlier sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[[GR Elton]] 1955 ''England under the Tudors'' p 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Act of [[Annates]] (the Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates) was passed allowing only 5% of the money normally remitted to Rome. Annates were monies (church taxes effectively) that were collected in England and sent to Rome. They were levied on any diocese by Rome as payment in return for the nomination and papal authorization  for the consecration of a bishop. One third of the first year's revenues from the particular [[diocese]] went to Rome. The king passed legislation threatening to deprive the Pope of these revenues. During this year even more intensive work was done to try to get Pope Clement to agree to the divorce Henry required. The Parliament threatened that if Henry did not get his [[annulment]]/divorce within a year, then all payments to Rome would be stopped. The [[anti-clerical]] Act titled '''[[Supplication Against the Ordinaries]]''' was also passed.

===1533 All appeals to Rome, religious or otherwise forbidden===
The Annates threat was carried out but not yet legalised by Parliament. Cromwell's [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]] was passed, preparing the way for further [[Praemunire]] charges against leading Catholic clergy and nobles who disagreed with the King's wish to divorce.

===1534 [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations]]===
Payment of [[Peter's Pence]] (a tax collected annually from householders) to the See of Rome was abolished. The act also eradicated Pluralism in the clergy (the right to hold more than one parish) and forbade English clergy from attending religious assemblies abroad.

===1534 Act of Succession===
Declared Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon's marriage invalid and Mary as the illegitimate product of this marriage. The Act of Succession secured the children of Henry and Anne Boleyn to which the whole nation had to swear an oath by. To reject the oath was made treasonous.

===1534 Act of Supremacy; Annates reserved to the English Crown===
The Second Act of [[Annates]] was passed, called the  [[Act in Absolute Restraint of Annates]]. The annates were, along with the supremacy over the church in England, reserved to the crown, and the English crown now took all revenue charged for the appointment of bishops. The '''Act of First Fruits and Tenths''' transferred the taxes on ecclesiastical income from the Pope to the Crown. The [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it [[high treason]] [[capital punishment|punishable by death]] to deny Royal Supremacy. The first  [[Act of Supremacy]] (among other things) began the process by which the [[dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution of monasteries]] was to be undertaken. It quickly followed the receipt of a survey called ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]'', but applied only to religious houses with an income of less than two hundred [[pound sterling|pounds]] a year.

'''''Folk og Land''''' ("People and Country") was a Norwegian newspaper, published in [[Oslo]]. It was an organ of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)]] for Norwegians who [[legal purge in Norway after World War II|were found]] to be [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi collaborators]] during the Second World War.

==History==
''Folk og Land'' had its predecessor in ''Skolenytt'', [[stencil]]ed and published by the [[Kristiansund]]-based former teacher Nils Vikdal from 1947. His agenda was to spread news to former members of [[Lærersambandet]], a trade union for teachers set up by the [[Quisling regime]] during the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] (1940–1945). It was stenciled until the summer of 1948, when printing began. The name was also changed to ''8. Mai'', named after the [[Victory in Europe Day|day the occupation ended]].&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Øvsthus|first=Georg|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]]|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=Folk og Land|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/f/f4.html#folk-land|accessdate=22 July 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|volume=|location=Oslo|isbn=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315114603/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/f/f4.html#folk-land|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Folk og Land'' was formally started on 6 December 1952, edited by Finn Brun Knudsen.&lt;ref name=npresse&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|editor=Flo, Idar|title=Norske aviser fra A til Å|series=Volume four of ''[[Norsk presses historie 1660–2010]]''|year=2010|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-15-01604-7|page=116|chapter=''Folk og Land''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an informal affiliation to the organization [[Forbundet for Sosial Oppreisning]] (FSO, later renamed [[Institutt for Norsk Okkupasjonshistorie]]), made up by former collaborators who were critical to the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]] and the victors' version of history. FSO chairman Anders Hafskjold was among the early shareholders in ''Folk og Land''. From 1958 the newspaper was officially a co-operative with Forbundet for Sosial Oppreisning as owners.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt;&lt;ref name=npresse/&gt; At the same time, the last editor of the now-forbidden [[Nasjonal Samling]] newspaper ''[[Fritt Folk]]'', [[Odd Erling Melsom]], was hired as editor-in-chief, a position he held until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Odd Erling Melsom|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Tore|last=Pryser|authorlink=Tore Pryser|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Odd_Erling_Melsom/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded [[Johannes Kringlebotn]]. Post-1978 editors include Alexander Lange and Kjell Blich Schreiner.&lt;ref name=npresse/&gt;

The newspaper makers claimed that their circulation was six of seven thousand in the 1960s; this is a dubious figure.&lt;ref name=npresse/&gt; Some hundred copies were also distributed for free to politicians and the press all over Norway.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; The goals of the newspaper makers were to gain acceptance for their version of history, as well as to gain legal reparations from the [[Parliament of Norway]] (in which they have failed). They meant that aggressors other than Germany caused the Second World War, that the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]] caused most harm during the war, and that once Germany had occupied Norway, collaborators (including [[Vidkun Quisling|Quisling]]) did the right thing in that they represented a Norwegian rule over the country instead of letting Germans take over.&lt;ref name=npresse/&gt;

In its last years of existence, ''Folk og Land'' was published monthly.&lt;ref name=nkl/&gt; The last issue came on 27 April 2003.&lt;ref name=npresse/&gt;

==Impact==
[[Hans Fredrik Dahl]] has stated that "in several cases, the historical revisionism of the magazine has proven worthwhile".&lt;ref name=npresse/&gt; In [[Egil Ulateig]]'s 1996 book ''Med rett til å drepe'', where Hans Fredrik Dahl was a historical consultant, the newspaper was used extensively as a [[source text]].&lt;ref name=p35&gt;{{cite book |title=Over grensen?|first=Arnfinn|last=Moland|authorlink=Arnfinn Moland|page=35|publisher=Orion|language=Norwegian|location=Oslo|year=1999|isbn=82-458-0337-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moland, 1999: p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Ulateig used a series of articles printed under the title ''Okkupasjonstidens likvidasjoner'', between 7 November 1970 and 25 November 1972.&lt;ref name=p35/&gt; Ulateig's book contained 136 people which allegedly had been liquidated by the [[Norwegian resistance movement]], many cases taken verbatim from ''Folk og Land''. In a thorough critique, [[Arnfinn Moland]] found that 63 of them were correct, most of the rest were nonsense taken from ''Folk og Land''. The newspaper series, said Moland, looked like it was written by a "more or less imbalanced" person.&lt;ref&gt;Moland, 1999: p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frédéric Bintsamou''' (born 29 August 1964, [[Brazzaville]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2006027049.html|title=Ntoumi, Pasteur|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as ''Pastor Ntumi'', is a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[clergy]]man and was the leader of the "semi-religious" rebel group [[Ninja (militia)|The Ninjas]] which led a civil war in [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]].

In April 2007, Bintsamou signed a peace agreement with the central government in [[Brazzaville]].  Under the agreement, Bintsamou was to disband his militia in exchange for a position as a deputy minister responsible for peace and reparations.&lt;ref&gt;John James,  
 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6986550.stm "Ninja leader due in Congo capital"], BBC News, 10 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bintsamou was eventually installed in his official post as Delegate-General for the Promotion of the Values of Peace and Repair of the Ravages of War on 28 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130128071323/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/depeche_afp_20091228T191106Z20091228T191046Z_ma-nomination-s-inscrit-dans-le-cadre-de-la-paix-a-declare-lors-de-la-ceremonie-de-son-installation-m-ntumi-nomme-en-mai-2007-delegue-general-charge-de-la-promotion-des-v.html "Congo: l'ex-chef rebelle Ntumi à Brazzaville, après 12 ans dans le Pool"], Agence France-Presse, 28 December 2009 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/contenu/20091229-retour-brazzaville-pasteur-ntumi "Retour à Brazzaville du pasteur Ntumi"], Radio France Internationale, 29 December 2009 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing as a candidate of his party, the CNR, Bintsamou was elected as a local councilor in [[Mayama District|Mayama]], located in the [[Pool Department]], in the September 2014 local elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adiac-congo.com/content/resultats-des-elections-locales-du-28-septembre-2014-21298 "Résultats des élections locales du 28 septembre 2014"], ADIAC, 6 October 2014 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">The '''Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement''' ('''IRA''' or '''IRA-Mauritania'''; French: ''Initiative pour la Resurgence du mouvement Abolitioniste'') is an [[Slavery in Mauritania|anti-slavery]] group in [[Mauritania]] headed by [[Biram Dah Abeid]]. Mauritania is estimated to have between 140,000&lt;ref name=NYER-2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=OKEOWO|first1=ALEXIS|title=Freedom Fighter|journal=The New Yorker|date=8 September 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/freedom-fighter|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 600,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2010401.stm Millions 'forced into slavery'] BBC News, 27 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml The Abolition season] on [[BBC World Service]]&lt;/ref&gt; slaves. The group has a "network of nine thousand activists" according to journalist Alexis Okeowo.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt;

The group was founded in 2008 and is described by Abeid as "an organization of popular struggle".&lt;ref name=UNPO&gt;{{cite web|title=A Freed Slave’s Son Fights Against Slavery|url=http://www.unpo.org/downloads/648.pdf|publisher=UNPO|accessdate=16 October 2014|ref=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group has been involved in sit-ins in front of the justice ministry, hunger strikes, and marches through cities and towns around Mauritania.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt; The group fights against the religious justification
of slavery.&lt;ref name=UNPO/&gt;

According to Abeid, the group moved on to more direct action in its protests because, “whenever we brought a slavery case to the police, they would release the slave owner.” In  2010 and 2011, the group won a "seminal victory" when it gathered in front of the house of a slave owner and demanded the police arrest him. Both Abeid and the slave owner were arrested—Abeid jailed for three months, the slave owner was released after nine days—but it was the first time that police in Mauritania had imprisoned a slave owner. Other protests and arrests of owners followed (the organization has helped to put about twenty owners in jail as of September 2014). Though the jailings were often only for brief terms, the release of "thousands of slaves" (called "Biram Frees") by fearful owners ensued.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt;

The Initiative feels under pressure from the Mauritanian government which refuses to allow it to register as a nongovernmental organization, and threatened or persuaded supporter to end their support. Lacking NGO status makes it impossible to solicit funding through grants. IRA has relied on gifts from patrons, mainly government employees. The government has persuaded other activists to leave the movement, threatening them or winning them over with lucrative state jobs.&lt;ref name=NYER-2014/&gt;

IRA-Mauritania received the [[Human Rights Tulip]] award in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Human Rights Tulip to be awarded to IRA-Mauritania|url=http://www.humanrightstulip.nl/latest/news/2015/12/8/2015-human-rights-tulip-to-be-awarded-to-ira-mauritania|publisher=Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ireland for Europe''' was a [[civil society]] organisation set up after the defeat of the first Irish referendum to campaign in favour of the [[Treaty of Nice]]. Initially chaired by Adrian Langan, it was chaired by Ciarán Toland from October 2001. The campaign team was also led by Michelle O'Donnell (Secretary) and Kevin Byrne (Campaign Director). Ireland for Europe joined the [[Irish Alliance for Europe]] in August 2002, forming the backbone of its volunteer canvassing campaign. The group has been inactive since the end of 2002.

In June 2009 a new organisation of the same name was launched with [[Pat Cox]] as Director. For this he stepped down from his position as President of the [[European Movement|European Movement International]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.europaeische-bewegung.de/index.php?id=72 Cox wird Kampa-Chef in Irland.

The '''Jury Team''' was a British political campaign established in 2009 to back [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidates in United Kingdom domestic and European elections. Although it was a registered [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|UK political party]], it was described as an [[umbrella organisation]] giving financial and marketing backing to independent candidates, who were free to set their own political agenda outside of the traditional model of standing as the candidate of a particular party. Jury Team employed a novel selection process for its independent candidates, allowing any member of the public to apply to be promoted for backing, and leaving final candidate selection to the public, by text message voting. After contesting the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament]] elections in June 2009, the Jury Team's first Independent [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliamentary]] candidate was [[John Smeaton (baggage handler)|John Smeaton]], who stood in the [[Glasgow North East by-election, 2009|2009 Glasgow North East by-election]].

==Foundation==
The Jury Team campaign for more independent politicians was launched on 8 March 2009 by Sir [[Paul Judge]], a businessman and former director-general of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph8Mar09&gt;{{cite news | last = Kirkup | first = James | title = Sir Paul Judge starts 'Jury Team' campaign for more independent MPs |work=The Daily Telegraph  | date = 8 March 2009 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/4957060/Sir-Paul-Judge-starts-Jury-Team-campaign-for-more-independent-MPs.html | accessdate =10 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = White | first = Michael | title = Oh no – not another new party|work=The Guardian  | date = 9 March 2009 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2009/mar/09/1 | accessdate =10 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jury Team was registered with the UK's [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission's]] Register of Political Parties on 13 March 2009, eligible to field candidates in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=RegisterOfParties&gt;{{cite web

==Politics==
The name ''Jury Team'' reflected the idea behind the jury, that "regular people can make decisions about complex problems with integrity and without any vested interests".&lt;ref name=TIME17Mar09/&gt;

Jury Team was described as an [[umbrella organisation]], with the purpose of giving Independent non-party candidates the platform to compete against the established UK political parties, free of party allegiance and a [[Whip (politics)|party whip]].&lt;ref name=BBC10Jun09/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph-swinburne-rantzen"&gt;
{{cite news |title = MPs' expenses: Jury Team founded as anti-sleaze group |work=The Daily Telegraph  | date = 21 May 2009 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5359978/MPs-expenses-Jury-Team-founded-as-anti-sleaze-group.html | accessdate =21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jury Team aimed to "break the traditional party leaderships' control over the political process".&lt;ref name=Telegraph8Mar09/&gt; A [[YouGov]] poll commissioned by Jury Team as part of its launch suggested that 55% of electors would vote for an Independent candidate if they thought they had a realistic chance of being elected.&lt;ref name=Telegraph8Mar09/&gt;

Jury Team had no [[manifesto]] or specific [[policy|policies]]; any member of the public who was considered to be "committed to the principles of good governance, including selflessness, integrity, openness and honesty" could be publicised by the organisation as a potential Jury Team candidate, and candidates were selected by a system of public voting by text message.&lt;ref name=Independant8Mar09&gt;{{cite news | last = Gourlay  | first = Chris | title = Tycoon finances ‘X Factor’ party to clean up politics |work=The Sunday Times  | date = 8 March 2009 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | accessdate =10 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jury Team candidates that stood in the 2009 European elections represented both sides of the political spectrum as well as those representing several single issue platforms.&lt;ref name=BBC20May09Rantzen/&gt;

As well as ''Jury Team'', ''Jury Team Party'' and ''Jury Team Independents'', the organisation also registered the following as official Party Descriptions: ''Democracy 2.0'', ''Democracy, Accountability, Transparency'', ''Politics for the People'', ''Politics Isn't Working'', ''Politics with Principles'' and ''Politics without Parties''.&lt;ref name=RegisterOfParties/&gt;

While Jury Team had no party policies, they did declare 12 basic principles on issues of governance and representation, covering areas such as term limits and pay transparency for elected representatives, changes to the operation of [[Select committee (Westminster system)|select committees]] and [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]], independence of statistical reporting and complaints functions, and changes to the rules regarding [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referendums]] and calling of [[United Kingdom general elections|general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Candidate selection==
According to its founder and leader Sir Paul Judge, Jury Team Independent candidates "legally committed themselves to our three guiding principles of democracy, accountability and transparency and to abiding by the seven [[Nolan Principles of Public Life]]", and "had all "pledged to vote on conscience for the good of their constituents and the country and will not be required to obey a party whip".&lt;ref name=BBC20May09Rantzen/&gt;

Jury Team Independent candidates for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament elections]] could stand for selection in every [[European Parliament constituency#United Kingdom|British European Parliament constituency]] region except [[Northern Ireland]]. Candidates individual political positions were promoted through the Jury Team website between 16 March to 24 April 2009, during which time the public could vote for their preferred candidates.&lt;ref name=JuryTeamEuro2009Candidates&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful candidates in each region were then ranked by the number of text votes cast, in order to produce a 'party list' for each region according to their allocated number of seats.&lt;ref name=JuryTeamEuro2009Candidates/&gt; ([[European Parliament]] seats from in England, Scotland and Wales are allocated using a system of [[proportional representation]] using the [[d'Hondt formula]].)

On 25 September 2009 it was announced that [[John Smeaton (baggage handler)|John Smeaton]], an airport worker who came to national attention for intervening in the [[2007 Glasgow International Airport attack]], 
would be the first candidate selected by Jury Team to stand for a seat in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]], and would contest the [[Glasgow North East by-election, 2009|2009 Glasgow North East by-election]] for the vacant seat formerly held by the Speaker of the House [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]].&lt;ref name=BBCSmeaton25Sep09&gt;{{cite web

==Elections==

===European Parliament election 2009===
Jury Team backed 59 [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] candidates in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament elections]].&lt;ref name=BBC20May09Rantzen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8059333.stm |title=Rantzen backs Jury Team project |publisher=BBC News |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While no Jury Team candidate gained a seat in the [[European Parliament]], the candidates collectively registered 0.5% of the total votes cast in Great Britain, ranking Jury Team candidates as a whole 13th among other parties in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=BBC10Jun09&gt;

===Glasgow North East by-election, 2009===
[[John Smeaton (baggage handler)|John Smeaton]] stood as the Jury Team backed [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] candidate in the [[Glasgow North East by-election, 2009|2009 Glasgow North East by-election]], he came eighth out of 13 candidates with 258 votes.&lt;ref name=BBCSmeaton25Sep09/&gt;

===2010 General Election===
Jury Team fielded [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], on 6 May 2010.&lt;ref name=Telegraph8Mar09/&gt; The group hoped to increase on the number of 5 Independent MPs elected in 2005 out of a total of 646 [[MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2005|currently sitting]] in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=Telegraph8Mar09/&gt; No Jury Team candidates were elected MPs.

==Funding==
The Jury Team campaign was funded by Sir Paul Judge from his estimated £30m personal wealth, together with three other financial backers.&lt;ref name=Independant8Mar09/&gt; The organisation's financial rules precluded individual donations of more than £50,000, in line with the [[Political funding in the United Kingdom#2006 Sir Hayden Phillips inquiry|2006 Sir Hayden Phillips inquiry]].&lt;ref name=Independant8Mar09/&gt;

==Reception==
Jury Team's candidate public vote by text message selection method was likened to the reality TV shows ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X-Factor]]'' and ''[[American Idol]]''.&lt;ref name=Independant8Mar09/&gt; [[Time Magazine|''TIME'' magazine]] called the movement similar to the reality show ''[[American Idol]]''&lt;ref name=TIME17Mar09&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee Adams | first =  William| title = Britain's New American Idol Political Party | place = London |work=Time Magazine | date = 17 March 2009 | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1885729,00.html | accessdate =10 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jury Team's lack of manifesto attracted the moniker the "anti-party party".&lt;ref name=TIME17Mar09/&gt; [[Anthony King (professor)|Anthony King]] stated of Jury Team that "The idea that a non-party party could get very far is farfetched."&lt;ref name=Independant8Mar09/&gt;

== Early life and medical treatment ==

Zieselman has described how, at age 15 and because she hadn't menstruated, she was referred to a reproductive oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital,&lt;ref name="miller2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Miller| first = Susan| title = Model Hanne Gaby Odiele reveals she is intersex| work = [[USA TODAY]]| accessdate = 2017-08-05| date = January 23, 2017| url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/23/model-hanne-gaby-odiele-reveals-she-intersex/96622908/}}&lt;/ref&gt; a teaching hospital, and told that her ovaries and uterus needed to be removed to eliminate a risk of cancer.&lt;ref name="nib2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| volume =  5| issue = 2| pages = 122–125| last = Zieselman| first = Kimberly| title = Invisible Harm| journal = [[Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics]]| date = 2015| url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nib/summary/v005/5.2.zieselman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miller2017" /&gt; She had surgery at age 16, requiring a subsequent dependence on [[hormone replacement therapy]]. Neither Zieselman nor her parents were told the truth about her diagnosis, that she had [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], XY sex chromosomes, and internal testes.&lt;ref name="nib2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goodh" /&gt;

Zieselman discovered her medical records at age 41,&lt;ref name="goodh" /&gt; including a statement that she and her parents had consented after full disclosure of a diagnosis. Discovery was disorientating, challenging her identity and that of her husband,&lt;ref name="goodh" /&gt; but Zieselman has also described how "I felt free when I found out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = A step forward for intersex visibility and human rights| date = September 25, 2016| accessdate = 2017-08-05| url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Astepforwardforintersexvisibility.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Zieselman trained as a lawyer, and worked in the field of family law and [[assisted reproductive technology]].&lt;ref name="goodh" /&gt;

=== Intersex advocacy ===

In 2009, Zieselman discovered the peer support group AIS-DSD Support Group, and she later became a director of that organization.&lt;ref name="nib2015" /&gt; Zieselman is now executive director of [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth|interACT]], an organization that promotes the rights of intersex youth, including through litigation, development of youth leadership, and media work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Khomami| first = Nadia| title = Model Hanne Gaby Odiele reveals she is intersex| work = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 2017-08-05| date = January 24, 2017| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/24/model-hanne-gaby-odiele-reveals-she-is-intersex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of interACT is to end non-medically necessary surgeries on intersex children. Zieselman describes how intersex children just have a different type of body, and [[intersex medical interventions|genital surgeries]] are not medical or social emergencies.&lt;ref name="stewart2017" /&gt; Zieselman describes how shame and secrecy,&lt;ref name="stewart2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Stewart| first = Philippa| title = Interview: Intersex Babies Don't Need 'Fixing'| work = [[Human Rights Watch]]| accessdate = 2017-07-25| date = 2017-07-25| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/interview-intersex-babies-dont-need-fixing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex infants causes devastating physical and psychological harm,&lt;ref name="hrw2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Human Rights Watch| author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = US: Harmful Surgery on Intersex Children| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = 2017-08-05| date = July 25, 2017| url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they take place for sociological reasons.&lt;ref name="stewart2017" /&gt; She calls for a moratorium on surgeries until children are old enough to choose for themselves, with parents given a "full spectrum of choices".&lt;ref name="stewart2017" /&gt;

Zieselman is quoted by the [[United Nations]] Human Rights Office in New York stating:

{{quotation|Doctors often claim there's a "silent majority" of intersex people satisfied with the way they were treated as young patients. I used to be part of that "silent majority" - but I certainly wasn't happy. Doctors draw this false conclusion because most of their young patients haven't returned as adults to complain. But their silence is just as likely to be caused by stigma and shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Radcliffe| first = Charles| title = Intersex Ed at the UN| work = [[The Huffington Post]]| accessdate = 2017-08-05| date = October 2016| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-radcliffe/intersex-ed-at-the-un_b_12613864.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zieselman has described how the [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBT]] community has helped open doors, but how intersex rights are broader: "at its core this is a children's rights issue. It is also about health and reproductive rights, because these operations can lead to infertility".&lt;ref name="stewart2017" /&gt; She has described the MTV series [[Faking It (2014 TV series)|Faking It]] as ground-breaking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Anderson-Minshall| first = Diane| title = Are We Witnessing the Birth of TV's Intersex Liberation?| work = The Advocate| date = July 6, 2016 | access-date = 2017-08-05 | url = https://www.advocate.com/current-issue/2016/7/06/are-we-witnessing-birth-tvs-intersex-liberation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the public disclosure by model [[Hanne Gaby Odiele]] of her intersex trait as a tipping point for the intersex movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Safronova| first = Valeriya| title = How a Top Model Also Became an Intersex Activist| work = [[The New York Times]]| accessdate = 2017-08-05| date = February 11, 2017| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/fashion/hanne-gaby-odiele-model-intersex-activist-fashion-week.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zieselman is a signatory of the [[Yogyakarta Principles|Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]], on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ | title = Yogyakarta Principles plus 10| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043532/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ | archive-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18997">[[Image:Ukposter.jpg|right|thumb|275px| [[Ukrainization]] was the implementation of Korenizatsiya policy in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. This 1921 Soviet recruitment-poster for military education featured the Ukrainization theme. The text reads: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defence of [[Soviet Ukraine]] will be ensured." The poster uses traditional Ukrainian imagery and Ukrainian-language text. The Soviets organized the School of Red Commanders in [[Kharkiv]] to promote the careers of the Ukrainian national cadre in the [[Red Army]].]]

'''Korenizatsiya''' ({{lang-rus|[[wikt:коренизация|коренизация]]|p=kərʲɪnʲɪˈzatsɨjə}}, "putting down roots") was an early policy of the [[Soviet Union]] for the integration of non-Russian nationalities into the governments of their specific [[republics of the Soviet Union|soviet republic]]s. In the 1920s the policy of '''korenization''' (nativization) promoted representatives of the [[titular nation]], and their national minorities, into the lower administrative-levels of the local government, [[bureaucracy]], and [[nomenklatura]] of their Soviet republics. In Russian, the term {{lang|ru-Latn|korenizatsiya}} derives from {{lang|ru-Latn|korennoye naseleniye}} ({{lang|ru|коренное население}}, "native population", or literally "root population").

Politically and culturally, the nativization policy aimed to eliminate Russian domination and culture in the said soviet republics. The de-Russification was forced even on ethnic Russians and their children. For example, all children in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic | Ukraine]] were forced to learn the [[Ukrainian language]]. The policies of korenization facilitated the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union | Communist Party]]'s establishment of the local languages in government and education, in publishing, in culture, and in public life. In that manner, the cadre of the local Communist Party were promoted to every level of government, and ethnic Russians working in said governments were required to learn the local language and culture of the given soviet republic.

== Beginnings ==
The nationalities policy&lt;ref&gt;Nationalities policy went through several stages. For a general timeline, see the Russian-language Wikipedia article on "Nationalities policy of Russia" ([[:ru:Национальная политика России]])  For a substantive analysis, see Slezkine (1994). The korenizatsiya phase roughly spanned the period from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s, though vestiges of it carried over.&lt;/ref&gt; was formulated by the [[Bolshevik]] party in 1913, four years before they came to power in Russia. [[Vladimir Lenin]] sent a young [[Joseph Stalin]] (himself a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] and therefore an ethnic minority member) to [[Vienna]], which was a very ethnically diverse city due to its status as capital of the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]]. Stalin reported back to [[Moscow]] with his ideas for the policy. It was summarized in Stalin's pamphlet (his first scholarly publication), ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;A copy can be found here: http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically Stalin would also be the major proponent of its eventual dismemberment and the reemergence of Russification.

Faced with the massive non-Russian opposition to his regime, Lenin in late 1919 convinced his associates their government had to stop the cultural administrative and linguistic policies it was following in the non-Russian republics. As adopted in 1923 korenizatziya involved teaching and administration in the language of the republic; and promoting non-Russians to positions of power in Republic administrations and the party, including for a time the creation of a special group of soviets called "natssoviety" (nationality councils) in their own "natsraiony" (nationality regions) based on concentrations of minorities within what were minority republics.&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion, see Yuri Slezkine, "The USSR as a Communal Apartment, Or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism," ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 53, No. 2 (Summer 1994): 414-452.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Ukraine]] in the late 1920s there were even natssoviety for Russians and [[Estonians]].

This policy was meant to partially reverse decades of [[Russification]], or promotion of Russian identity culture and language in non-Russian territories that had taken place during the imperial period. It won over many previously anti-bolshevik non-Russians throughout the country. It also provoked hostility among some Russians and Russified non-Russians in non-Russian republics.

In 1920s, the society was still not "Socialist". There was animosity towards the Russians and towards other nationalities on the part of the Russians, but there were also conflicts and rivalries among other nationalities.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen2"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Against Great-Russian chauvinism ==
In 1923 at the [[12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)|12th Party Congress]], Stalin identified two threats to the success of the party's "nationalities policy":  Great Power Chauvinism (Russian chauvinism) and local nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;See "National Factors in Party and State Affairs -- Theses for the Twelfth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Approved by the Central Committee of the Party," available here: http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/NF23.html.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he described the former as the greater danger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] [[Great Russia|Great-Russian]] chauvinist spirit, which is becoming stronger and stronger owing to the [[New Economic Policy|N.E.P.]], . . . [finds] expression in an arrogantly disdainful and heartlessly bureaucratic attitude on the part of Russian Soviet officials towards the needs and requirements of the national republics.  The multi-national Soviet state can become really durable, and the co-operation of the peoples within it really fraternal, only if these survivals are vigorously and irrevocably eradicated from the practice of our state institutions. Hence, the first immediate task of our Party is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The main danger, Great-Russian chauvinism, should be kept in check by the Russians themselves, for the sake of the larger goal of building socialism. Within the (minority) nationality areas new institutions should be organized giving the state a national (minority) character everywhere, built on the use of the nationality languages in government and education, and on the recruitment and promotion of leaders from the ranks of minority groups. On the central level the nationalities should be represented in the [[Soviet of Nationalities]].&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Creation of socialist nations ==
The main idea of the ''Korenizatsiya'' was to grow communist cadres for every nationality. By the mid-1930s the percentage of locals in both the party and state service grew considerably.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen3"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial period of korenizatsiya went together with the development of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|national-territorial administrative units]] and national cultures. The latter was reflected above all in the areas of language construction&lt;ref&gt;For a highly informative yet compact summary see Slezkine (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; and education.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of the national languages in education, see Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Equality, Efficiency, and Politics in Soviet Bilingual Education Policy: 1934-1980," ''American Political Science Review'' 78 (December 1984): 1019-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;  For several of the small nationalities in Russia that had no literary language, a "Committee of the North"&lt;ref&gt;Committee for the Assistance to the Peoples of the Northern Borderlands.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to create alphabets so that the national languages could be taught in schools and literacy could be brought to the people in their native languages — and the minorities would thereby be brought from backwardness to the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Slezkine, ''Arctic Mirrors: Russia and the Small Peoples of the North'' (Ithaca: [[Cornell University Press]], 1994) ({{ISBN|0-8014-8178-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  And in the very large Ukrainian Republic, the program of [[Ukrainianization]] led to a profound shift of the language of instruction in schools to Ukrainian.

In 1930, Stalin proclaimed at the [[16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|16th Party Congress]] that building socialism was a period of blossoming of national cultures. The final goal would be to merge into one international culture with a common language. Meanwhile, the first [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] in 1928–1931 was a period of [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], [[utopianism]] and [[violence]] in an atmosphere of "cultural revolution" {{Verify source|date=April 2017}}. Russian cultural heritage was under attack, churches were closed, old specialists were dismissed, and science and art were proletarianized.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen4"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolsheviks' tactics in their struggle to neutralise nationalist aspirations led to political results by the beginning of the 1930s. The old structure of the Russian Empire had been destroyed and a hierarchical federal state structure, based on the national principle, was created. The structure was nationality-based states in which nationality cultures were blossoming, and nationality languages were spoken and used at schools and in local administration.&lt;ref&gt;It's important to be aware of a terminological distinction. In the context of Soviet nationalities policy the term "national," which for clarity here has been rendered as "nationality," referred to ''ethnic minorities'' and minority territories, as opposed to central or all-Soviet institutions. In this sense, for example, when educational policy focused on expanding "national schools" (natsional'nye shkoly -- национальные школу), it focused on schools in the traditional languages of the national minorities (Ukrainian, Tatar, Armenian, Karelian, and so forth), not on schools for the Soviet Union as a whole.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition was real, not merely a centralized Russian empire camouflaged.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen5"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party|17th Party congress]] in 1934, proclaimed that the building of the material basis for a socialist society had succeeded. The Soviet Union first became an officially socialist society in 1936 when the [[1936 Soviet Constitution|new constitution]] was adopted. The new constitution stated that the many socialist nations had transformed on a voluntary basis into a harmonious union. According to the new constitution there were 11 socialist republics, 22 autonomous republics, nine autonomous regions and nine national territories. At the same time, administration was now greatly centralised. All the Republics were now harnessed to serve one common socialist state.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen6"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of korenization==

=== Purges of national cadre ===
Between 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiya was not actually repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges of the leaderships of the national republics and territories. The charge against non-Russians was that they had instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937 it was proclaimed that local elites had become hired agents and their goal had become dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism. Now it was time to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National leaderships of the republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen7"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reversal to Russification ===

By the mid-1930s, with purges in some of the national areas, the policy of korenizatsiya took a new turn, and by the end of the 1930s the policy of promoting local languages began to be balanced by greater [[Russification#Late_1930s_and_wartime:_Russian_comes_to_fore|Russianization]], though perhaps not overt Russification or attempts to assimilate the minorities.&lt;ref&gt;This distinction can be attributed to Vernon Aspaturian:  Russianization is the spread of Russian language and Russian culture (and, one might add, of Russian people) into non-Russian territories and societies; Russification is the psychological transformation of the self-identities of non-Russians into Russians. See Vernon V. Aspaturian, "The Non-Russian Peoples," in Allen Kassof, Ed., ''Prospects for Soviet Society'' (New York: Praeger, 1968): 143-198. While Russianization may be a factor that fosters Russification, it is not sufficient by itself to produce it and in some circumstances may even have the opposite effect.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the country's leader seemed set on greatly reducing the number of officially recognized nationalities by contracting the official list of nationalities in the 1939 census, compared with the 1926 census.&lt;ref&gt;This, however, would be mainly a change on paper, not in actual ethnic or national identities. The sharply contracted list in 1939 was later expanded again for the 1959 census, though not to the number of peoples listed in 1926; the director of the 1959 census criticized the earlier effort at contraction as artificial.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of so-called "national schools" (национальные школы) in which the languages of minority nationalities were the main media of instruction continued, spreading literacy and universal education in many national minority languages, while teaching Russian as a required subject of study.  The term korenizatsiya went out of use in the latter half of the 1930s, replaced by more bureaucratic expressions, such as "selection and placement of national cadres" (подбор и расстановка национальных кадров).

From 1937 the central press started to praise Russian language and Russian culture. Mass campaigns were organized to denounce the "[[enemies of the people]]". "Bourgeois nationalists" were new enemies of the Russian people which had suppressed the Russian language. The policy of indigenization was abandoned.  In the following years the Russian language became a compulsory subject in all Soviet schools.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen8"&gt;Timo Vihavainen: ''Nationalism and Internationalism. How did the Bolsheviks Cope with National Sentiments?'' in [[#ChulosPiirainen2000|Chulos &amp; Piirainen 2000]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-revolution Russian nationalism was also rehabilitated. Many of the heroes of Russian history were glorified. The Russian people became the "elder brother"  of the [[Soviet republics|"Socialist family of nations"]]. A new kind of patriotism, Soviet patriotism, was declared to mean a willingness to fight for the Socialist fatherland.&lt;ref name="ChulosPiirainen8" /&gt;

In 1938 Russian became a mandatory subject of study in all non-Russian schools.  In general the cultural and linguistic russification reflected the overall centralization imposed by Stalin. The [[Cyrillic]] script was instituted for a number of Soviet languages, including the languages of [[Central Asia]] that in the late 1920s had been given Latin alphabets to replace Arabic ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]] and [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]] kept their original and unique scripts. Many so-called "scriptless" languages, mainly of smaller nationalities in Russia, were first given scripts in Latin alphabet and later changed to Cyrillic. Other languages, in particular in Central Asia, [[Azerbaijan]], and the [[North Caucasus]], first adopted Latin scripts to replace Arabic scripts, and later adopted Cyrillic scripts to replace Latin scripts. Thus, the move to the Cyrillic alphabet was delayed for most non-Russian nationalities until at least the late 1930s, and full implementation of this change took time.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5439">In [[real estate]], a '''landed property''' or '''landed estate''' is a [[property (ownership right)|property]] that generates [[income]] for the owner without the owner having to do the actual work of the estate. In medieval Western Europe, there were two competing systems of landed property,  on one hand [[manoralism]], inherited from the [[Roman villa]] system, where a large estate is owned by the [[Lord of the Manor]] and 
[[tenant farm|leased to tenants]], and on the other hand the [[family farm]] or ''[[:wikt:Hof#German|Hof]]'' owned by and heritable within a [[commoner]] family (c.f. [[yeoman]]), inherited from [[Germanic law]].

A [[gentleman farmer]] is the largely historic term for a country gentleman who has a farm as part of his estate and farms mainly for pleasure rather than for profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition  –  "Gentleman Farmer"|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/gentleman-farmer|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016|quote=A country gentleman who has a farm as part of his estate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition – Gentleman farmer|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gentleman%20farmer|publisher=Merriam-Webster, An Encyclopædia Britannica Company|accessdate=25 June 2016|quote=A man who farms mainly for pleasure rather than for profit}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His acreage may vary from under ten to hundreds of acres. The gentleman farmer  employed labourers and farm managers. However, according to the 1839 ''Encyclopedia of Agriculture'',  he "did not associate with these minor working brethren". The  chief source of income for the gentleman farmer was derived not from any income that his landed property may generate; he had either  access to  his own [[private income]], he worked as a professional and/or he owned a large business elsewhere. Or all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claudius Loudon|first1=John|title=An encyclopædia of agriculture ...

Modern landed property often consists of housing or industrial land, generating income in the form of rents or fees for services provided by the facilities on the land, such as port facilities. Owners often commission an [[estate map]] to help manage their estate as well as serving as a status symbol.&lt;ref&gt;A Sarah Bendall, ''Maps, Land and Society: A History, with a Carto-bibliography, of Cambridgeshire Estate Maps, 1600–1836 '' (Cambridge University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Landed property was a key element of [[feudalism]], and freed the owner for other tasks, such as [[government]] administration, [[military]] service, the practice of Law, or [[religion|religious]] practices.

In later times, the dominant role of landed estates as a basis of public service faded. Development of [[manufacturing]] and [[commerce]] created [[capitalism|capitalist]] means of obtaining income, but ordinarily demanding the attention of the owner; at roughly the same time, governments began imposing taxes to fund government [[Government agency|bureaus]] and the military so that people of talent could perform government services for salaries without need for the proceeds of ownership of farmland. Parts of the [[United States of America]], typically [[New England]], [[Pennsylvania]], and most of the states west of the original colonies never had a landed [[aristocracy]], so their armed forces and government agencies could never be organized on the basis of a [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The '''League of Minnesota Cities''' (LMC), founded in 1913 by a special law passed by the [[Minnesota Legislature]], was initially a part of the Extension Division of the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1974, the League became an independent organization. Today{{when?|date=April 2018}}, the League's membership includes more than 800 cities and their elected and appointed officials, as well as numerous special districts and townships.

The Leagues mission statement: The League of Minnesota Cities promotes excellence in local government through effective advocacy, expert analysis, and trusted guidance for all Minnesota cities.

The '''Lebanese Special Operations Command''' ('''LSOCOM''') ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;قيادة القوات الخاصة اللبنانية&lt;/big&gt;}} ''Kiyadat al Kouwat al Khasa al Loubnanya'') is the joint Special Operations [[Command (military formation)|command]] of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] which groups [[Lebanon]]'s elite units. The command is part of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]].

==Background==
{{Lebanese Military}}
The command was founded as a result of the lessons the [[lebanese army|army]] learned in the [[2007 Lebanon conflict|Nahr el Bared Operation]].  The Lebanese Special Forces spearheaded the attack on the camp in which 169 soldiers died and were the workhorse in the battle and the key to the success of the campaign. Nahr el Bared was the first occasion where these regiments were able to prove themselves capable, especially at [[counter-terrorism]] operations, which prompted the Lebanese Army Command to start planning to expand them.

==Formation==
The LSOCOM includes Lebanon's 4 Special Forces Regiments:

==Future==
At formation, the size of the force was around 5,000 soldiers; however, the plan is to build a force the size of two to three brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Lester Shum''' ({{zh|t=岑敖暉}}; born 1993) is an American living in Hong Kong, known for a foreign social activist and member of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) . He served as deputy secretary-general of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) from April 2014 to March 2015 and a leader of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|2014 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong]].

==Biography==
Shum completed his secondary education at [[Sheng Kung Hui Tsang Shiu Tim Secondary School]] before entering [[The Chinese University of Hong Kong]], majoring initially in Information Engineering but later switched to Government and Public Administration.

His political awakening came from a popular internet forum called [[Hong Kong Golden Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20140921/18873212 【壹週刊】文青遇上高登仔　周永康、岑敖暉] (''When Hipster meets "Golden son" - Lester Shum and Alex Chow''). ''[[Apple Daily]], 2014, 9(21)：&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed the position of Vice-President (External) of the Student Union of the CUHK in Session 2013-2014, and became the deputy secretary-general of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]] (HKFS) afterwards. As the deputy-general of the HKFS, he took a leading role in the [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign|2014 class boycott campaign]] against the [[2014 NPCSC decision|decision]] of the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) which set the framework of the restrictive electoral method on the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Chief Executive election]]. The student movement led to the [[2014 Hong Kong protests|massive Occupy protests]] in September 2014. He was one of the five-member HKFS delegation to held talk with the government officials led by [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Carrie Lam]] in October 2014. He was detained by the police in October 2014 due to the arrest during a sit-in in July. 

==Personal life==
He has been in a relationship with Willis Ho, former deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=孤獨的24歲　岑敖暉：與摰愛分離最難過|date=2017-10-15|work=眾新聞|url=https://www.hkcnews.com/article/7574/%E5%B2%91%E6%95%96%E6%9A%89-%E4%BD%95%E6%BD%94%E6%B3%93-%E7%A4%BE%E9%81%8B-7609/%E5%AD%A4%E7%8D%A8%E7%9A%8424%E6%AD%B2-%E5%B2%91%E6%95%96%E6%9A%89%EF%BC%9A%E8%88%87%E6%91%B0%E6%84%9B%E5%88%86%E9%9B%A2%E6%9C%80%E9%9B%A3%E9%81%8E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limited liability''' is where a person's financial [[Legal liability|liability]] is limited to a fixed sum, most commonly the value of a person's investment in a company or partnership. If a company with limited liability is sued, then the [[claimant]]s are suing the company, not its owners or investors.  A [[shareholder]] in a [[limited company]] is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any.&lt;ref name="Known"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Limited Liability and the Known Unknown|journal=Social Science Research Network|date=2018|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for the members of a [[limited liability partnership]] and the limited partners in a [[limited partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannigan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[sole proprietors]] and partners in [[general partnerships]] are each liable for all the debts of the business (unlimited liability).

If shares are issued "part-paid", then the shareholders are liable, when a claim is made against the capital of the company, to pay to the company the balance of the face or [[par value]] of the shares.

Although a shareholder's liability for the company's actions is limited, the shareholders may still be liable for their own acts. For example, the directors of small companies (who are frequently also shareholders) are often required to give [[personal guarantee]]s of the company's debts to those lending to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://the-llc-company.com/limited-liability/llc-owners-liable/ |title=When LLC Owners Can Be Liable |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will then be liable for those debts in the event that the company cannot pay, although the other shareholders will not be so liable.  This is known as co-signing.

==History==
By the 15th century, [[English law]] had awarded limited liability to [[monastic]] communities and trade [[guilds]] with commonly held property. In the 17th century, [[joint stock]] charters were awarded by the crown to monopolies such as the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref name="Reekie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reekie|first=W. Duncan|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-20794-0|authorlink=Limited liability|editor=Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first modern limited liability law was enacted by the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1811.&lt;ref name="economist-1999"&gt;{{cite news
|title=The key to industrial capitalism: limited liability
|date=December 23, 1999
|newspaper=[[The Economist]]
|url=https://www.economist.com/node/347323
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England it became more straightforward to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] a joint stock company following the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]], although investors in such companies carried unlimited liability until the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]].

There was a degree of public and legislative distaste for a limitation of liability, with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Saville, J. | title=Sleeping partnership and limited liability, 1850–1856 | journal=[[The Economic History Review]] | volume=8 | issue=3 | year=1956 | pages=418–433 | doi=10.2307/2598493| jstor=2598493 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amsler, et al. (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). [[Insurance]] companies were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the [[Companies Act 1862]]. The minimum number of members necessary for registration as a limited company was reduced to seven by the [[Companies Act 1856]]. Limited companies in England and Wales now require only one member.&lt;ref&gt;Mayson, et al. (2005), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar statutory regimes were in place in France and in the majority of the U.S. states by 1860. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, most European countries had adopted the principle of limited liability. The development of limited liability facilitated the move to large-scale industrial enterprise, by removing the threat that an individual's total wealth would be confiscated if invested in an unsuccessful company. Large sums of personal financial capital became available, and the transferability of shares permitted a degree of business continuity not possible in other forms of enterprise.&lt;ref name="Reekie"/&gt;

In the UK there was initially a widespread belief that a [[corporation]] needed to demonstrate its [[creditworthiness]] by having its shares only [[partly paid]], as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable for the remainder of the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the [[Overend Gurney crisis]] (1866–1867) and the [[Long Depression]] (1873–1896) many companies fell into [[insolvency]] and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.&lt;ref name="jefferys-1954"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The denomination and character of shares, 1855–1885
|author-first=J. B.|author-last=Jefferys
|journal=[[The Economic History Review]]
|year=1954|volume=16|issue=1|pages=45–55
|doi=10.2307/2590580|jstor=2590580
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was admitted that those who were mere investors ought not to be liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout the late nineteenth century there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French ''[[société en commandite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lobban (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;DTI (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it became increasingly common from the end of the nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability.

In 1989, the [[European Union]] enacted its [[Twelfth Council Company Law Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0667:EN:HTML 89/667/EEC]&lt;/ref&gt; requiring that member states make available legal structures for individuals to trade with limited liability. This was implemented in England and Wales by [[Statutory Instrument]] [[SI 1992/1699]] which allowed single-member limited-liability companies.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, decentralized corporate law and competition between states for corporate charters and investment led to widespread adoption of freely available limited liability beginning in the 1800s and culminating in the early 1900s.  However, limited liability has been curtailed in specific contexts such as environmental liabilities or (in some states) employees unpaid back-wages.&lt;ref name="Known" /&gt;

==Justification==
Limited liability is related to the concept of separate [[legal personality]] bestowed on the [[corporation|corporate form]], which is promoted as encouraging [[entrepreneurship]] by various economists,&lt;ref&gt;Meiners, et al. (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halpern et al. 1980"&gt;Halpern, et al. (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook &amp; Fischel (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/56/5/Millon.pdf |title=Piercing the Corporate Veil, Financial Responsibility, and the Limits of Limed Liability |author=David Millon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916094129/http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/56/5/Millon.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling large sums to be pooled towards an economically beneficial purpose.

==Criticisms==

An early critic of limited liability, [[Edward William Cox]], a lifelong member of the Conservative Party, wrote in 1855:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hat he who acts through an agent should be responsible for his agent's acts, and that he who shares the profits of an enterprise ought also to be subject to its losses; that there is a moral obligation, which it is the duty of the laws of a civilised nation to enforce, to pay debts, perform contracts and make reparation for wrongs. Limited liability is founded on the opposite principle and permits a man to avail himself of acts if advantageous to him, and not to be responsible for them if they should be disadvantageous; to speculate for profits without being liable for losses; to make contracts, incur debts, and commit wrongs, the law depriving the creditor, the contractor, and the injured of a remedy against the property or person of the wrongdoer, beyond the limit, however small, at which it may please him to determine his own liability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ireland, P. | title =  Limited liability, shareholder rights and the problem of corporate irresponsibility | journal = Cambridge Journal of Economics | volume = 34 | pages = 837–856 | doi = 10.1093/cje/ben040 | year = 2008 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics argue that limited liability favors [[creditors]] who are in the position to negotiate secured terms, whereas small creditors' debts are left unsecured.&lt;ref name="Known" /&gt; Others argue that while some limited liability is beneficial, the privilege ought not to extend to liability in [[tort]] for [[environmental disaster]]s or [[personal injury]].&lt;ref name="Known" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman 1995"&gt;Grossman (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansmann &amp; Kraakman (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Grundfest, J.A. | title=The limited future of unlimited liability: a capital markets perspective | journal=Yale Law Journal | volume=102 | pages=387–425 | doi=10.2307/796841 | year=1992 | jstor=796841 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that limited liability provides investors with insurance-like benefits, without the cost of insurance premiums or safety regulations that usually accompany insurance, and that it therefore be advisable to charge firms for limited liability a rate that reflects risks of limited liability imposing costs on the government or the public. Critics also argue that this would accelerate the spread of information about poorly understood risk.&lt;ref name="Known" /&gt; 

[[Anarcho-capitalist]] [[Murray Rothbard|Murray N. Rothbard]], in his ''[[Power and Market]]'' (1970), criticized the need of limited liability laws, observing that similar arrangements emerge upon mutual and voluntary agreement in a [[free market]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Finally, the question may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some advocates of the free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's ''The Good Society''. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation to decide whether or not they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical development==
Defense and sport were combined in the same ministry from 2009 till 2018.

===Defense Ministry===
Previous to 1918, there was a [[Minister of War (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of War]] for the whole of [[Austria-Hungary]] and a [[Austrian Minister of Defence (Austria-Hungary)|Ministry of Defense]] solely for the Austrian half of the empire. The defence ministry took on various names during the [[First Austrian Republic]] of 1918 to 1938, and was abolished during [[Nazi Germany]]'s annexation of Austria from 1938 to 1945. During the [[Allied occupation of Austria]] from 1945 to 1956, the defence agenda was in the remit of the "Office for National Defense", a section in the [[Federal Chancellery of Austria|Federal Chancellery]].

===Sports Ministry===
Sport first became a government portfolio in Austria in 1966, as part of the remit of the Federal Ministry of Education, which in 1984 was renamed the Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Sports. In 1991 sport was moved to the Federal Ministry of Health, Sport and Consumer Protection, then in 1995 to the Federal Chancellery, in 2000 to the Federal Ministry of the Civil Service and Sports, in 2003 back to the Federal Chancellery and in 2009 joined the Federal Ministry of Defense and Sports. In 2018, the sports agenda was moved to the Ministry of the Civil Service and Sport.

'''Ollanta Moisés Humala Tasso''' ({{IPA-es|oˈʎanta uˈmala}}; born 27 June 1962) is a [[Peru]]vian politician who served as the 65th [[President of Peru]] from 2011 to 2016.  A former army officer, Humala lost the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|2006 presidential election]] and eventually won the [[Peruvian general election, 2011|2011 presidential election]] in a [[Two-round system|run-off vote]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', April 11, 2011, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/peru-elections-fujimori-hamala-runoff Peru elections: Fujimori and Humala set for runoff vote]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as President of Peru in the second round, defeating [[Keiko Fujimori]].

The son of [[Isaac Humala]], a labour lawyer, Humala entered the [[Peruvian Army]] in 1981. In the military he achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant Colonel]]; in 1991 he fought in the [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] against the [[Shining Path]] and three years later he participated in the [[Cenepa War]] against [[Ecuador]]. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful [[coup d'etat]] by soldiers in the southern city of [[Tacna]] against President [[Alberto Fujimori]];&lt;ref name=hoy/&gt; he was pardoned by the [[Congress of Peru|Peruvian Congress]] after the downfall of the Fujimori regime.

In 2005 he founded the [[Peruvian Nationalist Party]] and registered to run in the 2006 presidential election. The nomination was made under the [[Union for Peru]] ticket as the Nationalist party did not achieve its electoral inscription on time. He passed the first round of the elections, held on April 9, 2006, with 30.62% of the valid votes. A runoff was held on June 4 between Humala and [[Alan García]] of the [[Peruvian Aprista Party]]. Humala lost this round with 47.47% of the valid votes versus 52.62% for García. After his defeat, Humala remained an important figure within [[Politics of Peru|Peruvian politics]].

In February 2016, amidst the Peruvian Presidential Race, a report from the Brazilian Federal Police implicated Humala as recipient of bribes from [[Odebrecht]], a Brazilian construction company, in exchange of assigned public works. President Humala rejected the implication and has avoided speaking to the media on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leahy|first1=Joe|title=Peru president rejects link to Petrobras scandal|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/87349398-da88-11e5-9ba8-3abc1e7247e4.html#axzz42VcVN2wQ|accessdate=24 February 2016|agency=Financial Times|publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Post|first1=Colin|title=Peru: Ollanta Humala implicated in Brazil’s Carwash scandal|url=http://perureports.com/2016/02/23/peru-ollanta-humala-implicated-in-brazils-carwash-scandal/|website=www.perureports.com|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humala was arrested by Peruvian authorities in July 2017 and awaits a corruption trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-peru-humala-20170714-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and military career==
Ollanta Humala was born in Lima, Peru on June 27, 1962. He is the son of [[Isaac Humala]], an ethnic Quechua [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] lawyer, member of the [[Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland]], and ideological leader of the [[Movimiento Etnocacerista|Ethnocacerista]] movement. Ollanta's mother is Elena Tasso, from an old [[Italian Peruvian|Italian]] family established in Peru at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/251/1/|title=Ollanta Humala: Peru’s Next President?|date=April 11, 2006|author=Justin Vogler|publisher=upsidedownworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the brother of [[Antauro Humala]], now serving a 25-year prison sentence for kidnapping 17 Police officers for 3 days and killing 4 of them, and professor [[Ulises Humala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} (this cannot be correct because the article on Ulises Humala says he is still alive) explored.com.ec, January 5, 2005, [http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/peru-humala-se-compara-con-chavez-y-lucio-gutierrez-194654-194654.html Perú: Humala se compara con Chávez y Lucio Gutiérrez] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810025539/http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/peru-humala-se-compara-con-chavez-y-lucio-gutierrez-194654-194654.html |date=August 10, 2011 }}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Humala was born in Peru and attended the French-Peruvian school ''Franco-Peruano,'' and later the "Colegio Cooperativo The Great Union," established by part of the Peruvian-Japanese community in Lima. He began his military career in 1982 when he entered the [[Chorrillos Military School]].

In his military career, Humala was also involved in the two major Peruvian conflicts of the past 20 years, the [[Internal conflict in Peru|battle]] against the insurgent organization [[Shining Path]] and the 1995 [[Cenepa War]] with [[Ecuador]]. In 1992 Humala served in [[Tingo María]] fighting the remnants of the Shining Path and in 1995 he served in the Cenepa War on the border with Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/spanish/news/news001101ollanta.shtml "Historia de Ollanta"] November 1, 2000 ''BBC Mundo'' {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000 uprising==
''See also [[:es:Levantamiento de Locumba|Locumba uprising]] (Spanish)''

In October 2000, Humala led an uprising in [[Toquepala mine|Toquepala]]&lt;ref name="BNamericas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/news/mining/Toquepala_Prod,_Unaffected_by_Rebellion|title=Toquepala Prod. Unaffected by Rebellion|date=October 31, 2000|work=BNamericas|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[Alberto Fujimori]] on his last days as President due to multiple corruption scandals. The main reason given for the rebellion was the capture of [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], former intelligence chief who had fled Peru for asylum in [[Panama]] after being caught on video trying to bribe an opposition congressman. The return of Montesinos led to fears that he still had much power in Fujimori's government, so Humala and about 40 other Peruvian soldiers revolted against their senior army commander.&lt;ref name=BBC2000/&gt;  Montesinos claims that the uprising facilitated his concurrent escape.&lt;ref name="fuga"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diariocorreo.pe/ultimas/noticias/EPENSA-010047/montesinos-levantamiento-de-locumba-facilito-mi-fuga-del-pais|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140628025005/http://diariocorreo.pe/ultimas/noticias/EPENSA-010047/montesinos-levantamiento-de-locumba-facilito-mi-fuga-del-pais|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 June 2014|title=Montesinos: "Levantamiento de Locumba facilitó mi fuga del país"|last=Libón|first=Oscar|date=23 May 2011|work=Correo|accessdate=28 June 2014|location=Lima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Humala's men deserted him, leaving him only 7 soldiers. During the revolt, Humala called on Peruvian "patriots" to join him in the rebellion, and around 300 former soldiers led by his brother Antauro answered his call and were reported to have been in a convoy attempting to join up with Humala. The revolt gained some sympathy from the Peruvian populace with the influential opposition newspaper ''[[La República]]'' calling him "valiant and decisive, unlike most in Peru". The newspaper also had many letters sent in by readers with accolades to Ollanta and his men.&lt;ref name=BBC2000&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1003981.stm "Bid to end Peru rebellion peacefully"] November 2, 2000 ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath, the Army sent hundreds of soldiers to capture the rebels. Even so, Humala and his men managed to hide until President Fujimori was impeached from office a few days later and [[Valentín Paniagua]] named interim president. Later Humala was pardoned by [[Congress of Peru|Congress]] and allowed to return to military duty. He was sent as [[military attaché]] to Paris, then to Seoul until December 2004, when he was forcibly retired. His forced retirement is suspected to have partly motivated an ''etnocacerista'' rebellion of Andahuaylas&lt;ref name=hoy&gt;''[[Hoy (Peruvian newspaper)|Diario Hoy]]'', October 31, 2000, [http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/peru-coronelazo-no-cuaja-50268-50268.html PERU, CORONELAZO NO CUAJA]&lt;/ref&gt; led by his brother [[Antauro Humala]] in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} BBC, January 4, 2005, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_4144000/4144497.stm Perú: insurgentes se rinden ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Humala received a master's degree in Political Science from the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú|Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]].&lt;ref name=Caretas&gt;[http://www.caretas.com.pe/2002/1718/articulos/humala.phtml "Ollanta Se Reencaucha"] April 25, 2002 ''[[Caretas]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===2006 presidential campaign===

In October 2005 Humala created the Partido Nacionalista Peruano (the Peruvian Nationalist Party) and ran for the presidency in 2006 with the support of [[Union for Peru]] (UPP).

Ambassador [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], the former Peruvian [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] of the United Nations and founder of UPP, told the press on December 5, 2005, that he did not support the election of Humala as the party's presidential candidate. He said that after being the UPP presidential candidate in 1995, he had not had any further contact with UPP and therefore did not take part in choosing Humala as the party's presidential candidate for the 2006 elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/2005_12_06.php "Ollanta Humala chosen as PNP-UPP presidential candidate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303073536/http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/peru/archives/2005_12_06.php |date=March 3, 2006 }} December 6, 2005 ''University of British Columbia-Peru Elections 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peru21.com/P21Impreso/Html/2005-12-06/Politica0416005.html "Pérez de Cuéllar no avala a UPP"] December 6, 2005 ''Peru 21'' {{es icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303064749/http://www.peru21.com/P21Impreso/Html/2005-12-06/Politica0416005.html |date=March 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some accusations that he incurred in torture, under the ''nom de guerre'' "Capitán Carlos" ("Captain Carlos"), while he was the commander of a military base in the jungle region of Madre Mia from 1992 to 1993. His brother [[Antauro Humala]] stated in 2006 that Humala had used such a name during their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}, ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', February 6, 2006, [http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/02/06/int_ava_06A667483.shtml "Antauro Humala dice que su hermano Ollanta es el 'capitán Carlos'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chrystelle Barbier [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3222,36-745147@51-727046,0.html "Le candidat nationaliste péruvien, Ollanta Humala, accusé de «tortures»"] February 26, 2006 ''Le Monde'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humala, in an interview with [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]], acknowledged that he went under the pseudonym Captain Carlos but stated that other soldiers went under the same name and denied participation in any human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Ramos, [http://peru21.pe/impresa/noticia/humala-admite-que-se-llamo-cap-carlos/2006-02-08/44891 "Humala admite que se llamó Cap.

On March 17, 2006, Humala's campaign came under some controversy as his father, Issac Humala, said "If I was President, I would grant amnesty to him ([[Abimael Guzmán]]) and the other incarcerated members of the [[Shining Path]]". He made similar statements about amnesty for [[Víctor Polay]], the leader of the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]], and other leaders of the MRTA. But Ollanta Humala distanced himself from the more radical members of his family during his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}, ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', March 17, 2006, [http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/03/17/int_ava_17A684289.shtml "Padre de Ollanta Humala pide amnistía para jefes guerrilleros"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protv.ituner.com/rpp-demand/2006/03/19/ollanta1.asf Interview with Ollanta Humala] Audio (needs Windows Media Player) {{es icon}}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907235430/http://protv.ituner.com/rpp-demand/2006/03/19/ollanta1.asf |date=September 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/ecvideos/video/OllantaHumala180306.wmv Press Conference Speech by Ollanta Humala] Video (needs Windows Media Player) ''El Comercio'' {{es icon}}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208010740/http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/ecvideos/video/OllantaHumala180306.wmv |date=December 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humala's mother, meanwhile, made a statement on the March 21 calling for homosexuals to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ubc.ca/peru/2006/03/23/updated-elena-tasso-de-humala-mother-of-candidate-ollanta-humala-calls-for-homosexuals-to-be-shot/ "Elena Tasso de Humala, mother of candidate Ollanta Humala, calls for homosexuals to be shot"] March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ollanta Humala's brother, [[Ulises Humala]], ran against him in the election, but was considered an extremely minor candidate and came in 14th place in the election.

On April 9, 2006, the first round of the Peruvian national election was held. Humala came in first place getting 30.62% of the valid votes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecciones2006.onpe.gob.pe/onpe/presidente/rep_resultados_pre.onpe|title=Presidential Election Results|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903044143/http://www.elecciones2006.onpe.gob.pe/onpe/presidente/rep_resultados_pre.onpe|archivedate=September 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately began preparing to face [[Alan García]], who obtained 24.32%, in a runoff election on June 4.

On May 20, 2006, the day before the first Presidential debate between Alan García and Ollanta Humala, a tape of the former Peruvian intelligence chief [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] was released by Montesinos' lawyer to the press with Montesinos claiming that Humala had started the October 29, 2000 military uprising against the Fujimori government to facilitate his escape from Peru amidst corruption scandals. Montesinos is quoted as saying it was a "farce, an operation of deception and manipulation".

Humala immediately responded to the charges by accusing Montesinos of being in collaboration with García's Aprista Party with an intention to undermine his candidacy. Humala is quoted as stating "I want to declare my indignation at the statements" and went on to say "Who benefits from the declarations that stain the honor of Ollanta Humala? Evidently they benefit Alan García".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/world/americas/21peru.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin "Peru Ex-Spy Chief Says Candidate for President Aided His Escape"] May 21, 2006 ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell A.

Montesinos went on to state that Humala "is not a new ideologist or political reformer, but he is an instrument".&lt;ref&gt;''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', May 30, 2006, [http://www.eluniversal.com/2006/05/30/en_pol_art_30A714409.shtml "Montesinos: Humala is a political "pawn" of Chávez and Castro"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2006, Humala warned of possible voter fraud in the upcoming second round elections scheduled for June 4. He urged UPP supporters to register as poll watchers "so votes are not stolen from us during the tabulation at the polling tables." Humala went on to cite similar claims of voting fraud in the first round made by right-wing National Unity candidate Lourdes Flores when she told reporters that she felt she had "lost at the tabulation tables, not at the ballot box". When asked if he had proof for his claims by [[CPN Radio]] Humala stated "I do not have proof. If I had the proof, I would immediately denounce those responsible to the electoral system". Alan García responded by stating that Humala was "crying fraud" because the polls show him losing the second round.&lt;ref&gt;Carla Salazar, [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/24/ap/world/mainD8HQ8KI01.shtml "Peruvian Candidate Warns of Voting Fraud"] May 24, 2006 ''CBS News'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213113329/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/24/ap/world/mainD8HQ8KI01.shtml |date=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2006, the second round of the Peruvian elections were held. With 77% of votes counted and Humala behind García 45.5% to 55.5% respectively, Humala conceded defeat to Alan García and congratulated his opponent's campaign stating at a news conference "we recognise the results...and we salute the forces that competed against us, those of Mr Garcia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080115083448/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=23342 "Garcia wins to become Peru president"] June 5, 2006 ''Al-Jazeera''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-election===
On June 12, 2006 [[Carlos Torres Caro]], Humala's Vice Presidential running mate and elected Congressman for the [[Union for Peru]] (UPP), stated that a faction of the UPP would split off from the party after disagreements with Humala to create what Torres calls a "constructive opposition". The split came after Humala called on leftist parties to form an alliance with the UPP to become the principal opposition party in Congress. Humala had met with representatives of the [[Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland]] and the [[New Left Movement (Peru)|New Left Movement]]. Humala stated that the opposition would work to "make sure Garcia complies with his electoral promises" and again stated that he would not boycott García's [[inauguration]] on July 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000086&amp;sid=azXn.l8EIeTw&amp;refer=latin_america "Union for Peru Party Splits in Spat With Humala"] June 12, 2006 Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peru21.com.pe/video/macro/defaultP21.asp?cs=672&amp;n=520218&amp;pag=&amp;tipo=B "Humala dice que no dará tregua a Alan García"] ''Peru 21''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212083201/http://www.peru21.com.pe/video/macro/defaultP21.asp?cs=672&amp;n=520218&amp;pag=&amp;tipo=B |date=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, 2006, prosecutors in Peru filed charges against Humala for alleged human rights abuses including forced disappearance, torture, and murder against [[Shining Path]] guerillas during his service in [[San Martín Region|San Martín]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4800691.stm "Humala facing rights abuse claims"] August 17, 2006 ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Brosnan, [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N16195570.htm "Peru nationalist Humala faces human rights charges"] August 16, 2006 ''[[Reuters]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Humala responded by denying the charges and stating that he was "a victim of political persecution". He said the charges were "orchestrated by the Alan Garcia administration to neutralize any alternative to his power".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B244AAC95-A104-4A40-B91A-07B9FD208ED2%7D&amp;language=EN "Humala: I am a Victim of Political Persecution"] September 1, 2006 ''Prensa Latina'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035021/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B244AAC95-A104-4A40-B91A-07B9FD208ED2%7D&amp;language=EN |date=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 election===

Humala ran again in the [[Peruvian general election, 2011|Peruvian general election]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larepublica.pe/28-03-2011/elecciones-generales-2011-ollanta-humala-paso-toledo "Elecciones Generales 2011: Ollanta Humala pasó a Toledo" by ''[[La República]]''&lt;/ref&gt; on April 10, 2011, with [[Marisol Espinoza]] his candidate for Vice-President.

On May 19, at [[National University of San Marcos]] and with the support of many Peruvian intellectuals and artists (including [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] with reservations), Ollanta Humala signed the "Compromiso en Defensa de la Democracia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/politica/759984/noticia-mario-vargas-llosa-reitero-su-respaldo-ollanta-humala-traves-video |title=Vargas Llosa reiteró su respaldo a Ollanta Humala a través de video |publisher=Elcomercio.pe |date= |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/28/mario-vargas-llosa-peru-election Mario Vargas Llosa under fire for Peru election endorsement], Rory Carroll, ''[[The Guardian]]'', April 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He campaigned as a center-left leader with the desire to help to create a more equitable framework for distributing the wealth from the country's key natural resources, with the goal of maintaining foreign investment and economic growth in the country while working to improve the condition of an impoverished majority.

Going into the June 5 runoff election, he was polling in a statistical tie with opponent [[Keiko Fujimori]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolaperuelections.tumblr.com/ "Peru Elections Near: A Look at the Candidates"]. WOLA, June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected the 94th president of Peru with 51.5% of the vote.

===Presidency===
After the news of the election of Ollanta as president the [[Lima Stock Exchange]] experienced its largest drop ever,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/06/leftwinger-narrow-win-peru-markets Leftwinger Ollanta Humala's narrow win in Peru unnerves markets], [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/economia/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=485774 Bolsa de Perú registra la mayor caída de su historia tras el triunfo de Humala], [[Emol]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://peru21.pe/impresa/noticia/bolsa-valores-registra-mayor-caida-su-historia/2011-06-07/305679 Bolsa de Valores registra la mayor caída en su historia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610121952/http://peru21.pe/impresa/noticia/bolsa-valores-registra-mayor-caida-su-historia/2011-06-07/305679 |date=June 10, 2011 }}, [[Peru21]]&lt;/ref&gt; though it later stabilised following the announcement of Humala's cabinet appointees, who were judged to be moderate and in line with continuity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} However he was also said to have inherited "a ticking time bomb of disputes stemming in large part from objections by indigenous groups to the damage to water supplies, crops and hunting grounds wrought by mining, logging and oil and gas extraction" from [[Alan Garcia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CARLA SALAZAR, Associated Press|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jxuJMSknTbtqA3FtTGs4PrHI8P1g?docId=da3f9d1f2ec54995a517af1452cc226e |title=Peru's Garcia leaves conflicts unresolved |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-30}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he promised the "poor and disenfranchised" Peruvians a bigger stake in the rapidly growing national economy, his "mandate for change...[was seen as] a mandate for moderate change"; his moderation was reflected in his "orthodox" cabinet appointees and his public oath on the Bible to respect investor rights, rule of law and the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mapstone |first=Naomi |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0e847712-b84e-11e0-8d23-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1TJrlThv6 |title=Peru’s president to face rebalancing act for rural poor |publisher=FT.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Peruvian general election, 2011#Inauguration|sworn-in]] on 28 July 2011.

As part of his "social inclusion" rhetoric during the campaign, his government, led by Prime Minister [[Salomon Lerner Ghitis]], established the [[Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (Peru)|Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion]] in order to coordinate the efficacy of his social programmes.

====Ideology====
Ollanta Humala expressed sympathy for the regime of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], which took power in a bloodless military coup on October 3, 1968, and nationalized various Peruvian industries whilst pursuing a favorable foreign policy with [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Tisdall [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1746226,00.html "Another angry neighbour for Bush"] April 4, 2006 ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Foreign policy of Ollanta Humala}}
During his presidential candidacy in 2006 and his run for the presidency that he ultimately won in 2011, Humala was closely affiliated with other [[pink tide]] leaders in Latin America in general and South America in particular. Prior to taking office in 2011 he toured several countries in the Americas where he notably expressed the idea of re-uniting the [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation]]. He also visited Brazil, Colombia, the United States, and Venezuela.

== Arrest ==
{{Details|topic=|Operation Car Wash||}}During the Peruvian presidential election in February 2016, a report by the [[Brazilian Federal Police]] implicated Humala in bribery by Odebrecht for public works contracts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55093">The '''Polish Anti-Religious Campaign''' was initiated by the [[communist]] government in [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] which, under the doctrine of [[Marxism]], actively advocated for the disenfranchisement of religion and planned atheisation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated118"&gt;Zdzislawa Walaszek. An Open Issue of Legitimacy: The State and the Church in Poland.

Nuns also stood trials in communist courts, becoming victims of the fight of the atheist state against the Catholic Church. The majority of trials from the first decade of the Polish People's Republic in which nuns were in the dock had a political character. A mass propaganda campaign, saturated with hate, led in the press and on the radio, measured up against defendants, was their distinctive feature.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most other Communist countries, religion was not outlawed as such (an exception being [[Albania]]) and was permitted by the constitution, but the state attempted to achieve an atheistic society.

The Catholic Church, as the religion of most [[Poles]], was seen as a rival competing for the citizens' allegiance by the government, which attempted to suppress it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"&gt;Frank Dinka. Sources of Conflict between Church and State in Poland. The Review of Politics, Vol. 28, No. 3 (Jul., 1966), pp. 332-349&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church in Poland]] provided strong resistance to the Communist regime and Poland itself had a long history of dissent to foreign rule.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Ediger, Ruth M. "History of an institution as a factor for predicting church institutional behavior: the cases of the Catholic Church in Poland, the Orthodox Church in Romania, and the Protestant churches in East Germany." East European Quarterly 39.3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish nation rallied to the Church, as had occurred in neighbouring [[Lithuania]], which made it more difficult for the regime to impose its antireligious policies as it had in the USSR, where the populace did not hold mass solidarity with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. It became the strongest opponent of the regime throughout the rule of Communism in Poland, and provided a more successful resistance than had religious bodies in most other Communist states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;

The Catholic Church unequivocally condemned communist ideology.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Clark, Joanna Rostropowicz. "The Church and the Communist Power." Sarmatian Review 30.2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the antireligious activity in Poland being compelled to take a more cautious and conciliatory line than in other Communist countries, largely failing in their attempt to control or suppress the Polish Church.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;
{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}

==Communist takeover (1944–1956)==
The predecessor to the Communist government in Poland was the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which first took office in Soviet-occupied Lublin in 1944. It initially gave favourable promises to the Church in Poland, including restoration of property that the Nazis had taken and exempting Church property from agrarian reform.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;Tadeusz N. Cieplak. Church and State in People's Poland. Polish American Studies, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Autumn, 1969), pp. 15-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiences in and after [[World War II]], wherein the large [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish minority]] was [[The Holocaust in Poland|annihilated by the Nazis]], the large German minority was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|forcibly expelled from the country]] at the end of the war, along with the loss of [[Kresy|the eastern territories]] which had a significant population of Eastern Orthodox Belarusians and Ukrainians, led to Poland becoming more homogeneously Catholic than it had been.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

After Soviet troops occupied Poland at the end of World War II, the Soviet-backed government enacted a gradual approach aimed at gaining control of the Catholic Church in Poland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

After the war was finished the government permitted Catholic welfare services to resume work, and the government rebuilt damaged or destroyed churches at a substantial public cost.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; The Catholic Church in Poland during the first few years was treated much better than most other religious bodies in the newly liberated states of Eastern Europe. This more lenient approach came as a result of Communism's lack of popularity among Poles and the difficulty the new regime had in presenting itself as the legitimate government of Poland; attacking the Church at this time, which was well supported by most Poles, was considered too risky to attempt.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"&gt;James E. Will. Church and State in the Struggle for Human Rights in Poland. Journal of Law and Religion, Vol. 2, No. 1 (1984), pp. 153-176&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Karol Świerczewski]], who had fought in the international brigade in the [[Spanish Civil War]], was given [[Christian burial|Catholic funeral rites]], Polish radio broadcast [[Mass (Roman Rite)|mass]] until 1947, and Bierut's presidential oath in 1947 ended with the phrase '[[so help me God]]'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"&gt;Tighe, Carl. "Cultural pathology: roots of Polish literary opposition to Communism." Journal of European Studies 29.2 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy of isolation===
The Polish government made many concessions to the Church that antagonized Moscow; on the other hand, the campaign against the Church weakened their public support and made them dependent on the USSR.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; An important concession was the retention of religious instruction in schools, which was upheld from as early as 1945; at the same time, the state made manoeuvres to try to limit and eliminate such instruction through other means.

[[Boleslaw Bierut]], as part of a faction of the [[Polish Workers' Party]] (the Communist party in Poland) that favoured emulating the [[Soviet Union]] (Gomulka wanted to create a uniquely Polish system), took control in 1948 and attempted to turn Poland into a Stalinist state, wherein religion was actively discouraged in favour of Communism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated118"/&gt; This occurred during a general period of increasing control and repression in the [[Eastern bloc]] countries. The regime sought to eliminate the presence of Catholicism and religion from the culture, and to this effect it pursued a policy of isolation from the Vatican, creation of public opinion antagonistic to the Church, and provoking antagonisms within the Church itself by replacing religious leaders with others who worked with the regime.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"&gt;Richard F. Staar. The Church of Silence in Communist Poland. The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 42, No. 3 (Oct., 1956), pp. 296-321&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage was secularized in 1945, and civil records were removed from the clergy's jurisdiction in 1949.&lt;ref name="autogenerated118"/&gt;

Polish society was prepared for the persecutions post-1945 due to its long history prior to the Bolshevik revolution of operation under the rule of regimes that were hostile to it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Underground universities taught uncensored history and ethics lessons, and many people openly [[church attendance|attended Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Ediger, Ruth M. "History of an institution as a factor for predicting Church institutional behavior: the cases of the Catholic Church in Poland, the Orthodox Church in Romania, and the Protestant churches in East Germany." East European Quarterly 39.3 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter by the primate of Poland on elections, instructing Catholics not to support parties that were opposed to Catholic teaching, was suppressed in 1946.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"&gt;Post-War Poland and the Church. Edward Dolan. American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 14, No. 1 (Feb., 1955), pp. 84-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Patriot Priests''===
A notable feature of the antirelgious campaign in Poland included "Patriot Priests" who opposed the Church hierarchy and supported Communism. They were rewarded, and even sometimes allowed to travel to Rome. Some of them had experienced prison camps; some had been chaplains to the Red Army during World War II. The bishops often let them remain at their posts, although they were commonly ostracized by the laity; these priests failed to achieve much popular support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The state supported priests who collaborated with them; the remainder of the clergy was accused of reactionary activities, lack of solidarity with the nation and conspiracy with the Vatican.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;

The government achieved some success in these efforts; an estimated 1,700 out of 11,000 priests in Poland had attended conferences of the "progressives" by 1955.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; In 1949 the President of Communist Poland, Boleslaw Bierut, held a reception at the Belweder Palace in Warsaw for priests who were participating in a conference held by the Union of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). At the conference some of the priests told Bierut that a lack of agreement between the hierarchy and the government made the work of clergy difficult. Bierut blamed this problem on the hierarchy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the unfavourable attitude of higher Church authorities toward the People's state... In many cases one can hear from priests...words which are often simply criminal, anti-state.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bierut gave cooperative priests privileges including vacations, financial support, tax exemption and protection from punishments under canon law (which were not forbidden by the state).&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;

Following this conference, a Commission of Priests attached to [[ZBoWiD]] was created, which in the following year commenced publication of a bi-weekly entitled Citizen Priest (Ksiadz obywatel), superseded in the same year by Priests' Forge (Kuznica kaplanska). They held conferences in almost all provincial capitals. Young priests were forced to enroll in special classes on [[Marxism]], with the intention of causing a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the Church.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;

The state also attempted to penetrate the Church through the creation of several other organizations: the Polish Committee of Peace Partisans, the Catholic Social Club, and the Society of Children's Friends.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; The lay association, PAX, was founded under the leadership of [[Bolesław Piasecki]], a leader of a pre-war fascist organization, and tried to remove the obligation of obedience to the hierarchy from members of the Church; this organization supported the regime's [[antireligious]] efforts, and also an [[anti-Semitic]] campaign in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated48"&gt;Leopold Unger. The People Versus the Party. The Wilson Quarterly (1976-), Vol. 7, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 48-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZBoWiD priests' commission supported the Peace Campaign, supported the government's protests against the remilitarization of West Germany, supported the planned economy, and said that the new constitution was fully in conformance with moral principles and Christian conscience.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; They gained  mass popularity by supporting Poland's retention of the western territories which had been part of Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;

The government failed to produce a schism in the Church due to lack of popular support, so they disbanded the organization in 1955 and called on people to instead join the movement for peace partisans.

===Bureau for Religious Affairs===
In 1950 the Polish government created the Bureau for Religious Affairs, which had jurisdiction over personnel decisions and organisational functions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"&gt;Wynot, Edward, D., Jr. "Captive faith: the Polish Orthodox Church, 1945-1989." East European Quarterly 36.3 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Main Commission of Intellectuals and Catholic Activists attached to the Peace Committee of Polish Partisans, was founded in 1950 and originally comprised members of theological faculties, representatives from the catholic university in Lublin and active Church workers. In 1950, this group participated in the second International Peace Congress in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; In 1951, this organization sponsored the first national conference of clergy and laymen representing Catholic public opinion. This organization attempted to mould public opinion and formulate principles pertaining to the behaviour of Catholics. It actively promoted the peace campaign, as well as government protests against remilitarization in West Germany and for support of holding the western territories. It criticized the Catholic Church in West Germany for allegedly being exploited for anti-Polish purposes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;

Another organization, called the Catholic Social Club, that supported the regime and even had representation in the Polish parliament, however, it lacked popular support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; It attempted to reconcile [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic teaching]] with [[dialectical materialism]].

The Society of Children's Friends (TPD) was created by the Communist Party in 1949 to secularize the public school system, and it established kindergartens, primary schools, teachers' colleges, camps and recreation centers for youth. A principle aim of the Society was to educate the youth as atheists and supporters of the regime.  By 1950, the TPD had established more than 500 schools.  The Catholic Church actively opposed the attempts to remove religious instruction, and Church influence, from public schools, and encouraged the faithful to support the church in its opposition.  By 1956, religious education in public schools had been almost completely eliminated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; The Soviet-style propaganda campaign created museums, associations and publications devoted to atheism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated48"/&gt;

The official press launched a campaign to safeguard Poland from subversion (this was in reference to the Vatican). The government conducted a propaganda campaign in the early years that depicted the Vatican and Polish hierarchy as germanophiles; the Vatican refused to change Poland's diocesan boundaries to mark the state's new territory.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;

The Vatican was often attacked in Polish propaganda as a negative influence on Poland, and claimed that Poland ceased to exist in the 18th century because the Vatican had weakened it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt; Propaganda also tried to link the Vatican with fascism, and claimed Pius XII was responsible for Franco's coup in Spain and the Vichy regime. Polish clergy loyal to the Vatican were also considered as fascists in the propaganda.

The Church signed an agreement with the government in 1950, after the old 1925 concordat was thrown away by the government on grounds that the Vatican had violated it by supporting Germany in World War II (the Vatican had allowed a German bishop in Danzig to have jurisdiction over Germans living in Poland).&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; This agreement was not approved by the Vatican.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"/&gt; This agreement contained some features favourable to the Church (which the government would not always observe in the following years), including the right to teach religion in schools and to allow children to receive religious instruction outside of the school, permitting the [[Catholic University of Lublin]] to continue operating, Catholic organizations still being permitted to exist, allowing the Catholic press to exist, allowing public worship in churches to continue to exist, allowing pilgrimages, allowing religious processions, allowing religious care in the armed forces, allowing monastic orders to continue to function and continuing to allow the Church to conduct charity work (many of these things had been outlawed in the neighbouring USSR, in great contrast). In return the state required the Church to submit to it politically and condemn Catholic activities that the state did not permit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt;

===Communist constitution===
In 1952 the new Polish constitution was created, which did not include previously given protections to religion and the position of the Church in the country was worded ambiguously enough to allow for almost any new law of the Seym to not be in contradiction with it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

Persecutions of individuals for religion in the first few years were rare, because the state initially was concerned strictly with suppressing armed political resistance. From 1947-1953, the Catholic Church in Poland became the primary target for persecution in Communist Poland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; All social and charitable organizations affiliated with the church were made illegal ('Caritas' was taken over by the government in 1950&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;), Catholic schools were closed, [[Christian cross|crosses]] were removed from classrooms and hospitals, and a terror campaign was enacted against parishes and monasteries; clergy began to be arrested and put on trial (this included the notable arrest of a group of Jesuits headed by Father Tomasz Rostworowski).&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Many bishops were arrested or removed from their positions, with government approved administrators then taking over the dioceses; in some cases the government sent people loyal to it to "assist" the bishop in running his diocese.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; About 900 priests were imprisoned.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt; Nine priests were sentenced to death in 1949; in 1950 the Bonifratres Order and the Catholic charity [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] were put on trial (the latter trial led to the government seizure in the same year).&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt;

When the Vatican published its order excommunicating Catholics who actively supported communism in July 1949, the government called it an act of interference in Polish internal affairs and that clergy found trying to enforce the order (e.g. denying communion to excommunicated persons) would be punished by Polish law.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; The new law passed for this purpose in 1949 guaranteed the right of antireligious propaganda and also declared a penalty ranging from three years imprisonment to death, for those who abused the right of freedom of religious for 'purposes hostile to the system of the People's Republic'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt;

The already stressed relations between the Vatican and the Polish government deteriorated after that point, and the Polish government began to more actively strike the church; members of religious orders were required to register and give accounts of their activities as well as assets, and Catholic publications were more greatly suppressed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

The Minister of Justice commenting on the new legislation claimed he resented,

&lt;blockquote&gt; the negative attitude of the hierarchy towards the People's Democracy, who during the five years of the existence of the regime, had shown not a single sign of appreciation of the achievements of the regime.... (the Church) had declined to combat capitalism, and had endeavored to undermine the enthusiasm for socialism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Salesian schools]] and [[orphanage]]s were closed. All Church private schools were closed by 1950; this was accomplished by the authorities simply refusing to grant work permits to the [[Catholic schools]] that applied for them (as religious instruction was still officially permitted, these means were instead used to eliminate Catholic education).&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; Government-run private schools, of course, did not possess religious instruction; despite the provision in the 1950 agreement permitting religious instruction in schools, this right was being eroded. Marxism became an obligatory subject in the school system. Priests were dismissed from instructor positions for refusing to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and nuns were barred from teaching in public schools, thereby leading to a common situation where other teachers were not available to give religious instruction; in some places the religious instruction was taken away on account of alleged demands of parents. By 1955 the only Catholic institution of higher learning still existent in Poland was the Catholic University of Lublin, which was being slowly liquidated by the regime.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; A total of 59 seminaries were closed between 1952–1956 and restrictions were imposed on training new priests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; The Rozanystok seminary, which was created in 1949, was brutally liquidated in 1954.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; It had been moved from Wilno and had been run by Salesians for training candidates for the priesthood as well as for giving Catholic education for boys. The seminary was situated in Eastern Poland, it employed former residents of the territory annexed by the USSR in 1939, and it had arisen great concern to the government, provoking its brutal closure.

Much landed property was confiscated from the Church and affiliated organisations(the only land that was not taken away was the farmholdings of parish priests, provided this land did not exceed 50 hectares, or 100 hectares in some parts of the country&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;), severe limitations were placed on charitable activities associated with the Church, and the government took control of the recording of vital statistics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; In 1950, all Church property was nationalized without compensation, except that which was used by parish priests for their own subsistence (but such land could not exceed 50&amp;nbsp;hectares, and any income from such land had to be used religious and charitable purposes).&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; This nationalization was accompanied by a promise from the state that it would set aside resources for the upkeep of parishes and clergy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt; The Church did not provide much resistance to this confiscation, thereby denying the communists the opportunity to attack the Church as an institution chiefly concerned with protecting its property (as Lenin had attempted with the Russian Orthodox Church). The government's confiscation led to the Church becoming even more popular among the lower classes.

Two priests who were sentenced in 1951 for being part of an underground organization opposed to the state provided ammunition for a new campaign in which the government began liquidating the temporary ecclesiastical administration in the western (former German) territories and removed apostolic administrators from these areas. The vatican began to appoint Polish bishops to these bishoprics after this point.

In May 1951 the clergy and government signed the "National Charter for Peace Plebiscite", following which subsequent trials were conducted, including notably against the Jesuit Order and St Bernard Order (leading to two death sentences). Three Salesian bishops, who were under heavy fire in the official propaganda, disappeared in 1952; in the same year several priests in Cracow were arrested on charges of espionage and sabotage. In January 1953, five dignitaries, including Archbishop Baziak in Cracow were arrested; public protests in Cracow were suppressed with violence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt;

In February 1953, four priests and three laymen were charged with espionage and put on trial. The government announced that, under the supposed pressure of public opinion aroused by the trial, they had to take control of the Church. Therefore, the government required all ecclesiastical posts to receive government approval.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; The government used this power, as well as other measures aimed at controlling the Church's activities in these years, to weaken the Church in order to aid in helping to remove it from society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated296"/&gt; Cardinal Primate of Poland, Stefan Wyzynski, attempted to manoeuvre around this obstacle by gaining permission from the Vatican to relax canonical rules in order to appoint parish administrators instead of pastors, since parish administrators were not subject to this government veto. The government claimed that it seldom used its power of veto, although Cardinal Wysynski in his role in appointing bishops reported that he found himself largely obstructed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;

Wyszynski attempted to publish a letter protesting the government's treatment of the Church, and he was secretly arrested and put under house arrest (confined to a convent) in 1953; this followed from the arrest of a number of other bishops prior to his arrest (including the primate, 11 bishops were arrested in that year&lt;ref name="autogenerated48"/&gt;) including the trial of Bishop of Kielce Kaczmarek before the military tribunal in Warsaw (on charges of espionage).&lt;ref&gt;Religion, Constitutional Courts, and Democracy in Former Communist Countries. James T. Richardson. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 603. Law, Society, and Democracy: Comparative Perspectives (Jan., 2006), pp. 129-138&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the free bishops agreed to cooperate with the government's decree in February.&lt;ref name="autogenerated84"/&gt; This arrest later became public knowledge; the government offered to release him in 1955 if he stepped down from resuming his post as cardinal-primate.

The state tried to take control of the Polish Orthodox Church (with a membership of about half a million) in order to use it as a weapon against the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, and it attempted to control the person who was named as Metropolitan for the Polish Orthodox Church; Metropolitan Dionizy (the post-war head of the POC) was arrested and retired from service after his release.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt;

After the government's coming to power the prewar press legislation was abolished, the printing industry and plants were nationalized, and prepublication censorship was imposed. In July 1946, a government decree created the Central Office For Control of the Press, Publications and Public Performances under which all press and printing activities were controlled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; Poland's vast and diverse Catholic press network from the pre-communist era was mostly eradicated, with the exception of some publications that continued to exist under heavy censorship, a reduction of their circulation and a requirement to only speak on purely religious matters (as opposed to political or social).&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; Catholic publications that still existed included Tygodnik Warszawski (which was defiant to the regime and closed in 1949), Tygodnik Powszechny (whose editors resigned under pressure in 1953 after they failed to produce a correct obituary for Stalin, and pro-regime Catholics took over, but its old editors returned in 1956), and Dzi's i Jutro (a publication that attempted to promote coexistence of Catholicism and communism). This was a liberty that was not allowed to other places in the Soviet bloc (including the USSR most notably, which had banned church publications in 1929). The founders of Tygodnik Warszawski were incarcerated, of which Father Zygmunt Kaczynski and Antoni Antczak both died in prison. Cardinal Wyszynski attempted to intervene on behalf of Father Zygmunt.

Following with the forcible conversion of [[Eastern Catholic victims of Soviet persecutions|Eastern Catholics in the USSR]] to Orthodoxy, the Polish government called on the Orthodox church in Poland to assume '[[pastoral care]]' of the eastern Catholics in Poland. After the removal of Metropolitan Dionizy from leadership of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Macarius was placed in charge. He was from western Ukraine (previously eastern Poland) and who had been instrumental in the compulsory conversion of eastern Catholics to orthodoxy there. Polish security forces assisted him in suppressing resistance in his taking control of [[Eastern Catholic]] parishes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt; Many eastern Catholics who remained in Poland after the postwar border adjustments were resettled in Western Poland in the newly acquired territories from Germany. The state in Poland gave the POC a greater number of privileges than the Roman Catholic Church in Poland; the state even gave money to this Church, although it often defaulted on promised payments, leading to a perpetual financial crisis for the POC.

==Period of political thaw (1956–1970)==
A period of [[de-stalinization]] occurring in the 1950s in the Eastern Bloc, as well as the recognition of the problems Communism was facing when faced with the unique situation in Poland, led to Wladyslaw Gomulka returning to power (he had earlier been the leader before he was replaced by Bierut in 1948).&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; The state lightened its restrictions on the eastern Catholic churches which began to grow back, partly with assistance from the rest of the Catholics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt; The state moved away from its attempt to control and manipulate the Church for state purposes, as it had earlier planned in its first years of existence, and moved more towards a strategy of combatting it through legislation and force.

During the events of the [[Polish October|October revolution in 1956]], the government was criticized by parts of the secular press and the loyalty of the Catholic press during these days, was returned in favour by Gomulka who lifted some restrictions placed on it. Cardinal Wyzsynski and other bishops were released from prison, five Catholic deputies were allowed to enter the [[Sejm]], and monks and nuns were allowed to return to their monasteries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt; A new agreement was formed between the government and the Church, which resolved to remove previous anti-religious measures and once again renewed the Church's allegiance to the state.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; This was reneged, however, when within a few years Gomulka tightened his control and began restricting the Catholic press again.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt; The Catholic press was then made incapable of responding to arguments against the Church in the secular press.

In 1957, Cardinal Wyszynski attempted to publish a Vatican decree condemning Catholics who collaborated with the government, but he was prevented by censorship. The Church also was unable to voice any opposition to birth control or abortion in its press.

Abortion had initially remained restricted (as it had been in the prewar period, and for most of Poland's history), but was legalized in 1956 and further executive provisions were passed in 1959 that broadened access to abortions. This move contradicted the state's own obvious economic goals in regard to the massive labour shortage that continued to exist in the decades following the war (in which 22% of Poland's population died), but the legalization was used as an ideological weapon to strike the Church with, in order to undermine its influence in public society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;Zajicek, Anna M., and Toni M. Calasanti. "Patriarchal struggles and state practices: a feminist, political-economic view." Gender &amp; Society 12.5 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The state encouraged women to take a more active role in the paid labour force and in social life, partly as an attempt to undermine Church attitudes about a woman's role in family life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

Catholic education came back to some extent in public schools after 1956, but was no longer compulsory (before when it was compulsory, school authorities usually did not make it compulsory) and only existed in schools where a majority of parents requested it, and it was regarded as an extracurricular activity outside of class hours; just as before, however, the state immediately took measures aimed at eroding this concession. All members of religious orders teaching in schools had their teaching licenses suspended and many lay teachers were also suspended from teaching, thus leaving many schools without teachers of religion and other indirect means were used to eliminate the legally permitted religious instruction in public schools.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; Approved teachers were subject to state inspection, and the curricula needed to have state approval.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; As the situation progressed, however, the state came to officially legally eliminate religious instruction in 1961.

Gomulka stated during the seventh plenary sessions of the Central Committee of that year: &lt;blockquote&gt; The school in People's Poland is a lay school. Its task is to train enlightened, superstition-free and rationally thinking citizens. The state authorities will not create obstacles for parents who want their children to receive [[religious education]]. However, in the interest . . . of all parents - believers and non-believers alike - these children should receive religious instruction outside the school.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Gomulka's statement, the state also created obstacles for teaching religion outside of the schools. The government frequently declared that buildings that held religious classes were unsafe and therefore were not granted permits. The government also issued legislation to limit such instruction to no more than 2 hours per week, that the religious instructors would be made state employees (the Church told the clergy not to register and accept salary to fulfill [[Jesus]]' commandment of teaching) and that local school boards would be in control of the education. These restrictions were initially reluctantly enforced, but in 1964 new legislation allowed all such buildings for religious instruction to be inspected for hygiene by the government, which reserved the right to shut them down on such grounds. Cardinal Wyzsynski protested the way this was carried out, and the government rebutted that it was only concerned with protecting students' health and safety.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;

Discriminatory policies were introduced against Catholics in both public and professional life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated283"&gt;John M. Kramer. The Vatican's "Ostpolitik". The Review of Politics, Vol. 42, No. 3 (Jul., 1980), pp. 283-308&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 new tax laws were approved that limited the definition of what was included by the term 'worship' and sums given for things such as the primate's secretariat, seminaries or Catholic charities were no longer tax exempt. This led to the taxing of church donation money at the same level as private enterprise (65%).&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; At some point, church buildings in the western territories were nationalized as post-German assets, and high rents were charged for their use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

Also in 1959, members of religious orders were no longer permitted to become parish priests or administrators, and they were also discharged from service at hospitals, public nurseries, dispensaries and kindergartens.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; Beginning in 1960, nuns were no longer permitted to study at universities or colleges. Many members of religious orders did also not have their declarations of residence accepted by the state. They generally had their civil rights eroded as the state discriminated against them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

The antireligious propaganda failed to find much popularity among the Polish masses. Despite the pressure placed on the church, the number of priests leaving seminaries actually attained higher levels in the 1950s than it had been in the pre-war years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;

From the 1960s onward Poland developed an increasingly vocal Catholic intelligentsia and an active movement of young Catholics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The "Oasis" movement, was created in the 1960s by Father Franciszek Blachniki, and it consisted of Church activities including [[religious pilgrimage|pilgrimages]], retreats and various [[ecumenical]] endeavours. Intense efforts by the state to undermine it failed.

During [[Pope John XXIII]]'s pontificate, the regime successfully bypassed the Polish [[episcopate]] by being allowed to directly negotiate with the vatican, which allowed the government to isolate the Polish episcopate. When [[Paul VI]] succeeded him, the new pope required further negotiations to go through the Polish episcopate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated283"/&gt;

In 1965, on the eve of Poland's 1000 year anniversary of its [[conversion to Christianity]], the Polish episcopate made preparation for the event by inviting foreign guests including [[Pope Paul VI]]. In its letter to the German bishops, it controversially asked to forget about the past, grant forgiveness to Germans for occurrences during [[World War II]] and also asked for Poles to be forgiven for these occurrences too, and stated the Poland had been a bulwark of [[Christianity]]; the state took issue with the contents of the letter and it had not been cleared with the state when it was sent. It was declared opposed to the interests of Polish foreign policy.  Gomulka stated that declaring Poland as the bulwark of Christianity was at odds with Poland's relationship with the Soviet Union and struck at the foundations of Poland's foreign policy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

In the midst of this crisis, the Polish episcopate was also criticized in the press for making no progressive contribution to the Second Vatican Council and Cardinal Wyszynski was reproached for supposedly calling "for the condemnation of atheism, the preservation of the
old, anti-socialist and pro-fascist social doctrine of the Church in all spheres of social life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; "

To punish the Church for its behaviour, several seminaries were closed and [[seminarians]] were made subject to the military draft, Wyszynski was denied privilege to travel to Rome and Paul VI was barred from coming to the Millennium celebrations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; The government staged rival secular celebrations at the same time as the religious celebrations took place, in order to blunt enthusiasm in the religious celebrations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"/&gt;

Despite all of this (and in contrast to the USSR), the number of parishes, priests and nuns reached higher figures than it had prior to the coming of Communism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; The postwar church had 20,000,000 regular communicants.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1999"/&gt;

In 1968, following the student uprisings, the Church was criticized for providing moral support to anti-Polish forces on account of its speaking up for human rights.

==Edward Gierek's decade in office (1970–1981)==
Beginning in the early 1970s the Church moved from a defensive stance to a more aggressive stance in speaking in defence of human rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Anderson, John B. "Catholicism and democratic consolidation in Spain and Poland." West European Politics 26.1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Edward Gierek became the new leader of Poland, and he embarked on more relaxed policies with regard to anti-religious activity than his predecessors had. He established a personal working relationship with Stefan Wyszynski, authorized the building of new Churches and the resumption of instruction for priests in seminaries. In October 1977, he became the first Polish Communist leader to go to the Vatican and meet the pope (then Paul VI).&lt;ref&gt;Tad Szulc. Foreign Policy, No. 72 (Autumn, 1988), pp. 210-229&lt;/ref&gt;

The security apparatus in Poland, as in other Communist nations, recruited members of the clergy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The security service used blackmail, [[psychological manipulation]] and a variety of material rewards (e.g. needed medicines for ill relatives) in order to secure the cooperation of clergy.  In a reversal, the security service and Polish government had also members in its ranks who were secretly providing beneficial information to the Church

Catholic youth were forced to enroll in Communist Youth organizations.  Unlike in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] (which was staunchly atheist), believers formed the majority of the membership of the Polish United Workers' Party, wherein almost 50% of party members practiced their faith at church (statistic from 1980).&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"/&gt;

The state encouraged the migration from rural areas towards cities, partly as an attempt to weaken the Church's influence. School curricula was modified to include more [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideas, new superintendents sympathetic to the party were appointed and later afternoon classes were created to hinder children from going to receive religious instruction.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

The state came to increasingly change it approach to gender relations (earlier used to strike the Church with) in the later decades when woman's role in the family became more strongly emphasized in official propaganda and legislative measures were introduced to make it harder for women to find employment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt;

Atheism never became widely accepted in Poland (as it had been in the USSR), and vast numbers of Poles continued to believe and even to attend Mass. Religious indifference became more common than atheism, but never achieved numbers larger than a small minority. However, at the same time, among believing Catholics, Catholic moral beliefs were eroded, with increasing numbers of people not accepting [[Catholic Church and abortion|Church teaching on abortion]] or [[Catholic social teaching|matrimonial/familial relations]], and many Catholic Christians began thinking of morality being independent from religion as well as rejected the clergy's authority to issues directions regarding conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Wladyslaw Piwowarski. Industrialization and Popular Religiosity in Poland. Sociological Analysis, Vol. 37, No. 4 (Winter, 1976), pp. 315-320&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Primate of Poland, [[Stefan Wyszynski]], believed that Poland had a special role to play in human history and he supported Polish nationalism as a precursor to the liberation of Eastern Europe from Soviet role. Such ideas were popular among many Polish Catholics as well. Wyszynski was brought into sharp conflict with the Communist authorities on account of this (he also experienced some conflict with the Vatican). He was very popular in Polish society, and he was defiantly referred to as '[[interrex]]' (when Poland was an electoral monarchy, during the period when one monarch had died and before another was elected, the supreme power in the country was held by the Roman Catholic primate who was called 'interrex', this title therefore meant that there was no other legitimate government in Poland at the moment except the primate).&lt;ref name="autogenerated118"/&gt; He was both a critic of the regime and a mediator between the regime and the rest of civil society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;Byrnes, Timothy A. "The Catholic Church and Poland's return to Europe." East European Quarterly 30.4 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Wyszynski provided a significant obstacle to the Communists taking control of the church in Poland; he died in 1981 and was replaced by Cardinal Josef Glemp.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

After Cardinal Wojtyla of [[Kraków]] became [[Pope John Paul II]], his election was greeted in Poland with great enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; He visited Poland from June 2–10 in 1979. During his visit he bluntly challenged Communist ideology by declaring that Christianity was the route to true human freedom (as opposed to [[Marxism]]) and called people to non-conformance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Over thirteen million people went into the streets to greet him in his visit, in direct defiance to the Polish government. Dissidents in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe took great notice to this fact. Radoslaw Sikorski in his memoir later said: "We realized for the first time that 'we' were more numerous than 'them'."&lt;ref&gt;Caryl, Christian.

When visiting the satellite town of Mogila (location of the [[Mogiła Abbey]]) in Kraków, the Pope said: &lt;blockquote&gt; [[Christ]] never wants Man to be considered merely as a means of production. . . This should be remembered by the worker and the employer, by the work system as well as by the system of remuneration. It must be remembered by the State, the nation and the Church. . . For the sake of humanity the Church would like to reach an understanding with every work system, asking only to be permitted to speak to the individual human being about Christ and to love him according to his human dignity. . . In the spirit of fraternal solidarity and on the foundation of Christ's cross I, too, have shared in the building of the huge Polish works known as '[[Nowa Huta]]' together with you, managers, engineers, miners, labourers, minister&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"&gt;Church and Pope in the Polish Crisis. Hansjakob Stehle. The World Today, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Apr., 1982), pp. 139-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a year the independent trade union 'Solidarity' was formed, which was initially based on economic concerns, but soon became a political movement affiliated with the Church. Jerzy Urban, government spokesman claimed: "All the people's grievances against the power of the state were channelled into the Church and the election of a Pole as the Pope strengthened this religious propensity even further; when He came to Poland, I knew that this meant the end of a political epoch."&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt;

==Solidarity movement and its aftermath (1981–1990)==
The [[Pope John Paul II]] promoted Poland's cause as well as the cause of Christians behind the Iron Curtain on an international level, to the great discomfort of the communist governments in the Warsaw pact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; He rejected [[liberation theology]], however, and kept the Church away from becoming too directly involved with politics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt; The church in Poland, nevertheless, played a key role in the revolution against the regime in the 1980s and provided symbols (the Black Madonna, the suffering Christ, etc.) that gave spiritual depth to the struggle against Communism; John Paul II's portrait with Mary became a popular icon in the struggle.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; It also provided spiritual and material comfort to striking workers, and acted as a mediator between the solidarity movement and the government.

It also held back the striking workers from excesses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; The government allowed the broadcasting of Cardinal Wyzsynski's sermon to the striking workers broadcast on radio and television (although the cardinal's condemnation of the propagation of atheism was censored), wherein the cardinal called on the workers to end the strike.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt; On many occasions, the primate (both Wyszynski and Glemp), as well as the Pope, called on Solidarity to be more cooperative and reasonable, and even criticized the trade union for actions taken.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt;

In December 1981 martial law was imposed on Poland. This caused great trouble to the church, and many were rounded up by the military. Many in the Church defended the people who were arrested.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; The government nevertheless found that it required the church as a mediator in the crisis; General Jaruzelski in his first address to the Seym in 1982 stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Cooperation between the state and the Catholic Church and other beliefs belongs to permanent principles. The government, enabling the fulfillment of the pastoral mission of the Catholic Church and other beliefs, preserves in accordance with the constitution, the lay character of the state. The dialogue continues. We are sincerely interested in it. Differences of opinion should not hide the supreme goal, which is for all Poles the strengthening of the sovereign state. We constantly declare readiness for constructive cooperation. &lt;ref name="autogenerated153"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1982 the Joint Committee of Episcopate and Church was reactivated, and began negotiations between the state and the church on its position in Poland. As a result of these negotiations, the state gave into some church demands including an improvement of status for diocesan seminaries, exemption of seminarians from military service, increased circulation of church newspapers, the return of the organization '[[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]]' to Church control, the broadcasting of the Sunday Mass and allowing the import and uncensored distribution of L'Osservatore Romano.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt;

The Pope held great influence in the developing crisis in Poland; the Soviet press denounced the clergy in Poland during the crisis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt; An unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on the pope in 1981 in St Peter's square.

The [[Polish Orthodox Church]] hierarchy, which had had their position in society strengthened since 1945, spoke out against the Solidarity movement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt; They refused to send delegates to meetings about human rights issues. Some exceptions occurred, such as Fr Piotr Poplawski, an Orthodox priest openly sympathetic to Solidarity who "killed himself" in 1985; several doctors asked to confirm his suicide refused to certify this as the cause of death.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt; A Roman Catholic priest named [[Jerzy Popiełuszko]] had been murdered by the police the previous year,&lt;ref name="autogenerated118"/&gt; and the doctor who performed his autopsy was brought in and also confirmed that Fr Piotr had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt;

During the government's problems with Solidarity, many parishes were used to help the grass-roots opposition to the regime, which occurred alongside growing attacks on [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] by the state including brutality against priests (some of whom where murdered), breaking into [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[desecration]] as well as [[Sacrilege|theft of religious objects]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated118"/&gt;

Communist authorities blamed nationalist Catholics for fanning strife between Catholic and Orthodox populations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt;

In the [[Gdańsk Agreement|Gdańsk accords]], the Church was given permission to perform radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1945"/&gt; As the 80s progressed, the Church became increasingly critical of the regime and in the last years of the decade it played a critical role in the transition to democracy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

==Resistance==
In Poland, [[Lech Wałęsa]], Chairman of the Solidarity movement, then [[President of Poland]] summed up the contrasting Polish view of the Soviets and of Religion (specifically Catholicism) this way:
{{Quote box |quote = If you choose the example of what we Poles have in our pockets and in our shops, then… communism has done very little for us. But if you choose the example of what is in our souls, I answer that communism has done very much for us. In fact our souls contain exactly the opposite of what they wanted. They wanted us not to believe in God, and our churches are full. They wanted us to be materialistic and incapable of sacrifice. They wanted us to be afraid of the tanks, of the guns, and instead we don't fear them at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crozier|first=Brian|title=The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire|year=1999|publisher=Prima Publishing|location=Rocklin, CA|isbn=0-7615-2057-0|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; |source = Lech Wałęsa |width = 50% |align = center}}
Thus, it is clear that Polish nationalists linked their struggle against the Soviet Union with a struggle against atheism.
 
In [[Hungary]], following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], one of the first actions of the resistance was to retrieve imprisoned Cardinal [[József Mindszenty]]; a large crowd took him to the episcopal palace in the city, and his first free action was to celebrate mass in honor of the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crozier|first=Brian|title=The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire|year=1999|publisher=Prima Publishing|location=Rocklin, CA|isbn=0-7615-2057-0|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[Czechoslovakia]], the 1968 [[Prague Spring]] provided a renewed Catholic resistance to the Soviets and the Soviet-led Orthodox control of Catholic lands, churches, and institutes. This inspired Ukrainian Greek-Catholics to renew their efforts to achieve official recognition from the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Nathaniel|title=A Long Walk to Church|year=2003|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=0-8133-4067-5|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was one of Prussia's prime instruments in the official policy of [[Germanization]] of the historically Polish lands of [[West Prussia]] (the former [[Royal Prussia]]) and the dissolved [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]. The Commission ultimately purchased 613 estates from German owners and 214 from Poles, functioning to more often bail out German debtors rather than fulfilling its declared national mission. By the end of its existence, a total of 21,886 German families (154,704 persons) out of a planned 40,000 had been settled.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The Commission's activities had a countereffect in Poles using what has been termed "defensive nationalism",&lt;ref name=Zim/&gt; unifying "Polish nationalism, Catholicism and cultural resistance"&lt;ref name=Bideleux/&gt; and triggered Polish countermeasures, climaxing after [[World War I]], when the [[Second Polish Republic]] was established, in the expropriation of Commission-owned lands and reversing Germanization.&lt;ref name=Bideleux/&gt; Some of the German colonists still remaining in Poland in 1939 were active in a Nazi campaign of genocide against Poles during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Szymon Datner, 55 dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce.

The majority of Polish sources translate the title as Colonization Commission rather than Settlement Commission, which is more politically charged.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt;
The issue of translation is also connected to the fact that in 1904 the legal difference between [[Human settlement|settlement]] and [[colony]] was abolished in Prussia.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt;

==Background==

===Kingdom of Prussia===
[[File:Preussische Ansiedlungskommision Map (1905) (Photo of the Map).jpg|thumb|Land bought by the Preussische Ansiedlungskommision in Westprussia and the Province Posen in 1905 (shown in green)]]
The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[partitions of Poland]] acquired [[West Prussia]] ({{lang-de|Westpreußen}}, {{lang-pl|Prusy Zachodnie}}) and the later [[Province of Posen]] (''{{lang|de|Provinz Posen}}'', ''{{lang|pl|Prowincja Poznańska}}''). The Polish language was abolished as an official language and the German language was introduced. Frederick the Great hoped to replace Poles with Germans, placing Germans in most of the administration as well. Poles were portrayed as "backward Slavs" by Prussian officials who acted to spread the German language and culture.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The lands of Polish nobility were confiscated and given to German nobles.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The Prussian hold on Polish areas was somewhat weakened after 1807 when parts of its partition were restored to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The power status of Prussia was dependent on hindering any form of Polish statehood and it didn't support Polish attempts at restoration of Poland during [[Congress of Vienna]], when Prussia tried to obtain the Duchy of Warsaw or at least its western provinces.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; In 1815 the Prussian king made several guarantees in his speech to Poles in the newly formed [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] (created out of territories of Duchy of Warsaw) in regards to rights of the Polish language and cultural institutions.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; However, in practice, the right to use Polish in courts and institutions was respected only until 1830.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; While the Poles constituted the majority of population in the area, they held only 4 out of 21 official posts of high level.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; Despite the colonizing actions between 1793 and 1806, in 1815 in Poznań only 11.1 per cent of the population was German.&lt;ref&gt;Życie gospodarczo-społeczne w Poznaniu, 1815-1918, Czesław Łuczak Wydawnictwo Poznańskie, page 283, 196&lt;/ref&gt; 5 After 1832 Poles could no longer hold high posts at the local administrative level (landrat).&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; At the same time the Prussian government and Prussian King pursued Germanization of the administrative and judicial systems, while local officials enforced Germanization of the educational system and tried to eradicate the economic position of Polish nobility.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The provincial parliament issued calls to ensure the right of use of the Polish language and called for the creation of Polish educational institutions as well as autonomy, but those requests were rejected by the Prussian state.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; In 1847 two hundred fifty seven Polish activists were imprisoned upon charges of conspiracy and eight of them were sentenced to death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/32810,,,,berlinski_proces,haslo.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
the [[Spring of Nations]] however stopped their execution. The Frankfurt Parliament showed that the German delegates refused to accept the rights of non-German peoples and, while the Prussian government declared itself ready to discuss Polish concerns, it soon ordered the Prussian military to crush the freedom movement of Polish activists and peasants.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; Afterwards, the victorious Prussian government retreated from its earlier declarations of autonomy in the Wielkpolska region.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

====Earlier settlement attempts by the Kingdom of Prussia====

Prior to the Settlement Commission the Kingdom of Prussia had made a number of attempts to settle ethnic Germans in regions inhabited by Poles.

[[Frederick the Great]], who treated Poles with contempt and called them 'slovenly Polish trash', settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of [[Prussia]] and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Ritter| first = Gerhard| authorlink = Gerhard Ritter| title = Frederick the Great: A Historical Profile| year = 1974| publisher = University of California Press| location = Berkeley| isbn = 0-520-02775-2| pages = 179–180| quote = It has been estimated that during his reign 300,000 individuals settled in Prussia.... While the commission for colonization established in the Bismarck era could in the course of two decades bring no more than 11,957 families to the eastern territories, Frederick settled a total of 57,475.... It increased the German character of the population in the monarchy's provinces to a very significant degree.... in West Prussia where he wished to drive out the Polish nobility and bring as many of their large estates as possible into German hands. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In fact from Hitler to Hans we find frequent references to Jews as Indians. This, too, was a long standing trope. It can be traced back to Frederick the Great, who likened the 'slovenly Polish trash' in newly reconquered West Prussia to Iroquois". ''Localism, Landscape, and the Ambiguities of Place: German-speaking Central Europe, 1860–1930''
David Blackbourn, James N. Retallack University of Toronto 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[colonization]] attempt aimed at Germanisation was pursued by Prussia after 1832.&lt;ref&gt;''Wielka historia Polski'' t. 4 Polska w czasach walk o niepodległość (1815-1864). Od niewoli do niepodległości (1864–1918) Marian Zagórniak, Józef Buszko 2003 page 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Empire===
In 1871, the German Empire was founded with Prussia being the leading and dominating state. The advent of the [[Kulturkampf]] marked a period, when the Prussian government attempted to Germanise the Poles through language, schooling, and religious restrictions. Later, the increase in the sheer numbers of Poles led the government to a direct anti-Polish demographic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Scott M. Eddie, "Ethno-nationality and property rights in land in Prussian Poland, 1886-1918, Buying the land from under the Poles' feet?" in S. Engerman, ''Land rights, ethno-nationality and sovereignty in history'', 2004, p.56, [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=107982863]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Poles|Polish]] population in the province of Posen (Poznań) made up for nearly 60% (1,049,000 Poles vs 702,000 Germans in 1890), and in West Prussia for one third of the population (484,000 Poles vs 949,000 Germans in 1890).&lt;ref name="Scott M. Eddie 1918, p.60"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Engerman| first1 = Stanley| last2 = Metzer| first2 = Jacob| title = Land Rights, Ethno-nationality and Sovereignty in History| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm7QwQbe_SsC&amp;pg=PA7| year = 2004| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-203-07371-1| page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1885, Prussia still faced difficulties digesting her "Polish provinces", and the "Polish Question"  was one of the [[German Empire|Reich's]] most pressing problems.&lt;ref&gt;Scott M. Eddie citing Grzesś 1979:202, "Ethno-nationality and property rights in land in Prussian Poland, 1886-1918, Buying the land from under the Poles' feet?" in S. Engerman, ''Land rights, ethno-nationality and sovereignty in history'', 2004, p.56, [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=107982863]&lt;/ref&gt; The state itself was led by German [[nationalism]] and Bismarck viewed Poles as one of the chief threat to German power; as he declared ''The Polish question is to us a question of life and death'' and wanted Polish nation to disappear&lt;ref&gt;"He has taught that it is the duty of Germany to use all the power of the State for crushing and destroying the Polish language and nationality; the Poles in Prussia are to become Prussian, as those in Russia have to become Russian. A hundred years ago the Polish State was destroyed; now the language and the nation must cease to exist." ''Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire'' by James Wycliffe Headlam 1899&lt;/ref&gt; in private going as far as expressing his wish to exterminate Poles&lt;ref&gt;"If we want to exist, we have to exterminate them; the wolf can also not help if he was created by God and nevertheless he is being shot whenever one sees the opportunity" ''The Immigrant Threat'' Leo Lucassen University of Illinois Press, 2005 page 60&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Polish population faced economic, religious and political discrimination the Germanisation of their territories was promoted&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt; and in places where Poles and Germans lived a virtual apartheid existed.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin Kitchen, A History of Modern Germany, 1800-2000 Blackwell Publishing 2006, page 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, an east-to west migration ([[Ostflucht]]) took place, in which parts of the population of the eastern provinces migrated to western, more prosperous territories. 
The German government was concerned that Ostflucht would lower the percentage of Germans in the eastern regions. This event was used as pretext and justification presented to the international community for actions aiming at Germanisation of those provinces.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"&gt;[[Andrzej Chwalba]] - ''Historia Polski'' 1795-1918 pages 175-184, 461-463&lt;/ref&gt; In reality both Poles, Jews and Germans moved to richer western German provinces [https://web.archive.org/web/20090609135325/http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/katalog/skarb,Pokwitowanie_dotyczace_zakupu_wozu_mieszkalnego_dla_Michala_Drzymaly_z_1908_roku,gid,197554,cid,2443.htm?body=desc]

==Goals==

The goals of the Commission were the financial weakening of Polish landowners, and ensuring Germanisation of Polish cities as well as rural areas.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The destruction of Polish landownership combined with the fight against the Polish clergy ([[Kulturkampf]]) was to achieve the elimination of a Polish national identity. Polish landowners were regarded by Bismarck as the principal agitators for Polish nationalism, purchasing their estates and parceling them out to Germans in family-sized farms was intended to both disestablish this group and significantly increase the numbers of Germans in these areas.&lt;ref name="Scott M. Eddie 1918, p.60"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Engerman| first1 = Stanley| last2 = Metzer| first2 = Jacob| title = Land Rights, Ethno-nationality and Sovereignty in History| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm7QwQbe_SsC&amp;pg=PA7| year = 2004| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-203-07371-1| page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on land ownership was motived by the [[Romantic nationalism|German "''völkisch''" idea]] that "where the German plough will plow, there German fatherland will arise".&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The settlement was to isolate Polish settlements in German inhabited areas by surrounding them with German settlements and spread German ones into Polish dominated areas to isolate specified Polish villages from the rest.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The German settlements were to be always concentrated to provide a "barrier" to Polishness. While the Commission bought mostly German land, this was not interfering with the goal of increase of German presence, and buying a large tract of land from a single German owner to distribute it among many German colonists was perceived as beneficial to the goal. Of the colonists, 96.9% were [[Protestants]] as the Prussian authorities believed that ‘the true German is a Protestant".&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The whole practice was new and unheard in Europe.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; Besides Ostflucht, the German government justified its action to the international community by labeling Poles as internal enemies of the state.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; Those attempts didn’t achieve much success. Bismarck himself said that the Poles who find themselves without land should "move to [[Morocco]]".&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

==Funding==

The funding for the Commission was:
* 1886 100 million [[German gold mark|marks]]
* 1898 100 million marks
* 1908 150 million marks
* 1913 500 million marks.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

By 1914 the overall funding for the Commission was 955 million marks. Additional funds were awarded to assistance projects such crediting bankrupt German estates (125 million marks in 1908&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt;).

Due to operations of the Commission the price of land in Polish territories rose in response. The economical attempt to Germanise those areas failed and with the beginning of World War I German authorities and leading members of Commission started to look for new ways to secure German foothold on Polish territory.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

==Acquisitions settlement and land purchase==

While the commission planned to settle up to 40,000 families in Posen and West Prussia,&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; it only managed to settle a total of 21,866 families until 1914, bringing the number of German colonists to 154,000.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

===Acquisitions by 1901===

From 26 April 1886 until 1 January 1901, the Settlement Commission purchased 147,475 ha (3.64% of the Province of Posen and 1.65% of West Prussia), and settled 4,277 families (about 30,000 persons). A publication from German Empire named ''Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon'' claimed that in 1905-1906 that only 2,715 families were not native to these provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Ansiedelung?hl=ansiedelungskommission Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, 6. Auflage 1905-1909, online at]&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the original budget of 100,000,000 marks was exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Ansiedelung?hl=ansiedelungskommission]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prussian Settlement Commission.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Acquisitions of the Prussian Settlement Commission]]

===Acquisitions by 1913===

By 1913, the SC had bought up about 5.4% of the land in West Prussia and 10.4% in Posen.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt; By then, 450 new villages were founded, a total area of 438,560 ha was purchased, of which 124,903 ha were purchased from Poles.&lt;ref name="Volker Rolf Berghahn p. 106"&gt;{{cite book| author = Volker R. Berghahn| title = Imperial Germany, 1871-1918: Economy, Society, Culture, And Politics| year = 2005| publisher = Berghahn Books| isbn = 978-1-84545-011-3| page = 106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Germans owned 59% of land in Province of Posen, while making up for about 40% of population in 1890.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt;

===Overall===

Throughout its 32 years of existence the Commission was able to buy 8% of the total land in Posen and West Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Blanke| first = Richard| title = Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939| year = 1993| publisher = University Press of Kentucky| isbn = 978-0-8131-1803-1| page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, about 22,000 families were settled,&lt;ref name="Volker Rolf Berghahn p. 106"/&gt; bringing the number of German colonists to 154,000.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Chwalba - ''Historia Polski 1795-1918'' page 461&lt;/ref&gt; 5,400 families were German arrivals taken from other parts of the partitioned Poland, [[Congress Poland]] ([[Russian Empire]] province) and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (Austrian province).&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Oltmer, ''Migration und Politik in der Weimarer Republik'', p.142, 2005, {{ISBN|3-525-36282-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the commission bought 828 estates (430,450 ha) for 443 million marks, 214 of those (115,525 ha) from Poles for 96,4 million marks, and the other 614 (314,926 ha) from Germans for 346,7 million marks.&lt;ref name = "Scott M.

Eddie 1918, p.60"/&gt; Of the total of 955 million marks spent, about half (488 million marks) was spent for the actual land purchase, while the rest was spent for administration, parcellisation, infrastructure etc.&lt;ref name="Scott M. Eddie 1918, p.60"/&gt;

==Origin of the settlers==
To Germanise the region predominantly German military units were sent&lt;ref&gt;Alabama in Africa:Booker T. Washington, the German Empire, and the Globalization of the New South
Andrew Zimmerman, page 100&lt;/ref&gt; and later included in the region's population figures.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Chwalba - Historia Polski 1795-1918 page 461&lt;/ref&gt;
Germans from West Prussia and [[Greater Poland]] region who took part in the settlement process declined over time, while the number of Germans from the [[Russian Empire]] increased. In the first years (1886–90), locals from [[Greater Poland]] and West Prussia constituted 48% of the settlers while the proportion of [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans from Russia]] was below 1%, however in the years 1902-1906, locals only made up for 17% and Germans from Russia for 29% of the settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Walter de Gruyter, ''Gesamtausgabe: Innere Kolonisation in Preussen; soziologische Studien und Kritiken erste Sammlung; Schriften 1923'', 2006, p.20, {{ISBN|3-11-015847-7}}, {{ISBN|978-3-11-015847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of those settled until the end of 1906, a quarter originated in Posen and West Prussia, another quarter in the neighboring provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]] and [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]], 30% from other parts of the German Empire and 20% from outside the empire, especially from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Walter de Gruyter, ''Gesamtausgabe: Innere Kolonisation in Preussen; soziologische Studien und Kritiken erste Sammlung; Schriften 1923'', 2006, p.19, {{ISBN|3-11-015847-7}}, {{ISBN|978-3-11-015847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the ethnic composition==

One of the chief aims of the Commission was to stop the restoration of Polish population in Germanised territories of Greater Poland which was restoring its numbers after drastic fall during initial Prussian takeover.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; While the Commission never fully realised its goals, it managed to weaken Polish influence.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
In Greater Poland the Polish share of the population didn't reach its pre-1815 levels:

According to [[W. W. Kulski|Władysław Kulski]] the Commission was only a part of the German efforts to eradicate Poles from territories conquered by Prussia from Poland;in addition to 154,000 colonists, Germany also settled 378,000 German military personnel and officials in Polish territories.&lt;ref&gt;Germany and Poland: from war to peaceful relations, Władysław Wszebór Kulski, page 24, Syracuse University Press, 1976
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

As the economic approach showed to be a failure, various laws were enacted to promote the Settlement Commission's aims.

* 1896: Land acquired from the commission could be sold freely only to the settler's next of kin: the commission's approval was required for any other sale.
* 1904: The [[Prussia|Prussian Government]] sought to restrict Poles from acquiring land, if this would interfere with the goals of the commission. Any new settlement required a building permit, even if it were only for renovation of an existing building to make it habitable. Local officials routinely denied these permits to Poles. The law faced international criticism and opposition from liberal groups concerned about private property rights. The [[Prussian Administrative High Court]] ended this legislation&lt;ref name="Volker Rolf Berghahn p. 106"/&gt;
* 1908: The Prussian diet passed a law permitting the forcible expropriation of Polish landowners by the Settlement Commission. In 1912, four Polish large estates of 1,656 ha were expropriated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = John Komlos|author2=Scott McNeil Eddie | title = Selected Cliometric Studies on German Economic History: Edited by John Komlos and Scott Eddie| year = 1997| publisher = Franz Steiner Verlag| isbn = 978-3-515-06899-4| page = 156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law faced criticism from international community and liberals concerned about the free market rights. Additionally, the Austrian State Council, upon the request of the Poles, who enjoyed considerable autonomy and influence in Austro-Hungary, condemned the actions of German government.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; [[Rota (The oath)|Rota]], a patriotic poem by [[Maria Konopnicka]] was created as response to this law.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; According to historian [[Andrzej Chwalba]], more than one newspaper in Europe wrote that Prussia was becoming a police state.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; In part due to those protests, the law's execution was delayed until 1914.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
* 1913: To prevent Poles redistributing their land to other Poles, a law was passed that forbade the dividing of private land without the agreement of the state.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

Other measures in support of the Germanisation policy included:
* Ethnic Germans were favoured in government contracts and only they won them, while Poles always lost.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
* Ethnic Germans were also promoted in investment plans, supply contracts.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
* German craftsmen in Polish territories received the best locations in cities from authorities so that they could start their own business and prosper.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
* Soldiers received orders that banned them from buying in Polish shops and from Poles under the threat of arrest.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
* German merchantmen were encouraged to settle in Polish territories.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
* Tax incentives and beneficial financial arrangements were proposed to German officials and clerks if they would settle in Polish inhabited provinces.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;

==Polish countermeasures==

The creation of the Commission stimulated Poles to take countermeasures, that gradually turned into a competition of the Polish minority against the German state with Poles running their own settlement banks and settlement societies, resulting in a "battle for soil" (''Kampf um den Boden'').&lt;ref name="Scott M. Eddie 1918, p.60"/&gt; In 1888 Teodor Kalkstein founded Bank Ziemski, supported by Poles from Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] region.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; 1894 saw Polish intellectuals in cooperation with Polish farmers founding ''Spólka Rolników Indywidualnych''. Ignacy Sikorski founded ''Bank Parcelacyjny'' in 1896. From 1890 till 1912 Polish enterprises, banks and associations grew in number and strength providing Poles with defence against the Germanisation of their land.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; The efforts to Germanise the region in fact strengthened the Polish nationalist movement&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Epstein| first1 = Catherine| title = Model Nazi| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z3Q9Va1J5fAC| accessdate = 6 March 2012| year = 2010| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-161384-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and united Polish nationalism, Catholicism and cultural resistance among the Poles in Pomerania, Masuria and Silesia.&lt;ref name="Bideleux"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Bideleux| first1 = Robert| last2 = ´Jeffreys| first2 = Ian| title = Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_ef4mAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA293| accessdate = 6 March 2012| year = 2007| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-36626-7| page = 293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Settlement Commission, these countermeasures led to a decreasing availability of purchasable Polish-owned land, in 1895 and all years following 1898, the vast majority of estates was purchased from Germans instead of Poles, and since 1902, the commission was able to acquire land from Poles "only rarely and only through a middleman".&lt;ref name="Scott M. Eddie 1918, p.60"/&gt;

Numerous initiatives proved to be more elastic and efficient then the large centralised German [[bureaucracy]]. A social understanding has risen among the Polish population that led to abandoning the class differences in order to defend national existence - the rich helped the poor to perform better in economy and were supported by the clergy in their actions. Rich nobility often sold their artistic heritage to invest in banking and financial enterprises, or to buy more land for Poles. This was viewed as moral and ethical behavior among the Polish population. Some Polish nationalists accused the Settlement Commission of being run by Germans and Jews, and distributed a leaflet in 1912 that warned "any Pole who buys from Jews and Germans undermines the existence of the Catholic Church and the Fatherland." Local newspapers attempted to intimidate residents who purchased goods from German and Jewish merchants by publishing their names in the paper and accusing them of "betray[ing]...their country."&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Zimmerman| first1 = Andrew| title = Alabama in Africa: Booker T. Washington, the German Empire, and the Globalization of the New South| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EcI4mAEACAAJ| accessdate = 6 March 2012| year = 2010| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-12362-2| pages = 93, 94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the German initiative created the very thing it tried to eliminate in the first place, a Polish national awakening in the [[Greater Poland]] region (province of Posen) and feeling of Polish national unity.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt;
Thus, faced with the inability to Germanise the Polish provinces by economic means led the German leaders and thinkers to consider pursuing extraordinary means.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"/&gt; Catherine Epstein named Polish resistance to German methods as strengthening Polish nationalism and notes the similarity of Commission actions to the Nazis&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

==First World War==

Even before the First World War some Germans like Hans Delbrück or Chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]] proposed expelling Poles from eastern territories of Germany.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hostages of Modernization'', ed. Herbert A. Strauss, 1993 page 35&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the war, those ideas begun to take real and determined form in the shape of plans to be realised after German victory and as consequence hegemony of Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Geiss"&gt;Imannuel Geiss, ''Der polnische Grenzstreifen 1914-1918. Ein Beitrag zur deutschen Kriegszielpolitik im Ersten Weltkrieg'', Hamburg/Lübeck 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of extraordinary measures was the result of the failed economic attempt to Germanise Polish provinces.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt; Heads of the Settlement Commission were among the architects and supporters of those plans. The president of the Settlement Commission, Gense, was one of the chief supporters and planners of the so-called "[[Polish Border Strip]]" that envisioned expelling circa 2 million non-Germans (chiefly Poles and Jews) from 30,000 square kilometers of the would-be annexed territories from [[Congress Poland]], which would then become Germanised.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt; The Poles remaining in Germany who would refuse to become Germanised were to be "encouraged" to move to a planned German-run Polish puppet state established from the remains of Congress Poland.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

Other notable names of Settlement Commission activists include Friedrich von Schwerin and industrialist [[Alfred Hugenberg]] who worked for and represented the [[Krupp]] family.&lt;ref name="Geiss"/&gt;

==Outcome==

The Settlement Commission's goal to Germanise Polish territories failed and with the fall of German Empire in 1918 (at the end of World War I), the Commission ceased to function by 1924. In 1919 its headquarters were taken over by Polish state as well as most of its territory.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt; 3.9% (18,200 ha.) of all the land purchased remained in the hands of the Germans within the new borders of Germany.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt; The Germanisation policies resulted in strong measures against the German settlers by the Polish state after World War I.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt; The Polish state refused to recognize the ownership rights of most of the German settlers, about half of whom fled or were driven out of Poland.&lt;ref name="Eddie"/&gt; These actions of the Polish state were condemned by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], ruling out in 1923 "''that the position adopted by the Polish Government [...] was not in conformity with its international obligations.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcourts.com/pcij/eng/decisions/1923/1923.09.10_german_settlers.htm Settlers of German Origin in Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1923 P.C.I.J.

==Influence on Nazism==
Prussian policies of settlement and forced assimilation were an influence for German Nazi thinkers during their war in the East &lt;ref&gt;German Colonialism: Race, the Holocaust, and Postwar Germany Volker Langbehn, Mohammad Salama page 60
 Columbia University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Their plans were a renovation of the idea, this time however rather than colonize just the land purchased by Prussian Settlement Commission, Poles would be ethnically cleansed and murdered, and German colonists would occupy their place.
The Nazis planned also to form a Reich Settlement Commission to coordinate all internal colonization within German Reich, which was to be based on Prussian Settlement Commission.&lt;ref&gt;The SS: A History 1919-45 Robert Lewis Koehl
Tempus, page 134, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was laid out by Nazi official [[Curt von Gottberg]], who presented it to Himmler, and as reward was appointed as Land Registry Chief in Prague in June 1939&lt;ref&gt;[[RKFDV]]: German resettlement and population policy, 1939-1945: a history of the Reich Commission for the Strengthening of Germandom, page 43, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''push poll''' is an [[interactive marketing]] technique, most commonly employed during [[political campaigning]], in which an individual or organization attempts to manipulate or alter prospective voters' views/beliefs under the guise of conducting an [[opinion poll]].

In a push poll, large numbers of voters are contacted with little effort made to actually collect and analyze voters' response data. Instead, the push poll is a form of [[telemarketing]]-based propaganda and [[rumor]] mongering, masquerading as an opinion poll. Push polls may rely on [[innuendo]], or information gleaned from [[opposition research]] on the political opponent of the interests behind the poll.

Push polls are generally viewed as a form of [[negative campaigning]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollster.com/blogs/so_what_is_a_push_poll.php Pollster.com: So What *Is* A Push Poll?]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the term is commonly (and confusingly) used in a broader sense to refer to legitimate polls that aim to test negative political messages.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, K.G. (2000). "What are push polls, anyway?" ''Campaign &amp; Elections'', 21(4): 62–63, 70. In: ''Winning Elections'' (R. A. Faucheux, editor), pp. 184–89. New York: M. Evans &amp; Co. {{ISBN|1590770269}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Future usage of the term will determine whether the strict or broad definition becomes the most favored definition. However, in all such polls, the pollster asks [[leading question]]s or [[suggestive question]]s that "push" the interviewee towards adopting an unfavourable response towards the political candidate in question.

Legislation in [[Australia]]'s [[Northern Territory]] defined push-polling as any activity conducted as part of a telephone call made, or a meeting held, during the election period for an election, that: (a) is, or appears to be, a survey (for example, a telephone opinion call or telemarketing call); and (b) is intended to influence an elector in deciding his or her vote.&lt;ref name ="nterr"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/ea103/s271.html / Northern Territory Electoral Act, Section 271: Offence relating to push-polling.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Push polling has been condemned by the [[American Association of Political Consultants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaapc.org/about/pushpolling/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922091328/http://www.theaapc.org/about/pushpolling/ |archivedate=2008-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Statements_on_Push_Polls1.htm AAPOR | AAPOR Statement on "Push" Polls&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104200808/http://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Statements_on_Push_Polls1.htm |date=2013-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Richard Nixon was one of push polling's pioneers. In his very first campaign, a successful 1946 run for the U.S. House against Democrat incumbent Jerry Voorhis, Democratic voters throughout the district reported receiving telephone calls that began: "This is a friend of yours, but I can't tell you who I am. Did you know that Jerry Voorhis is a communist?" (he wasn't) – at which point the caller hung up. A citizen later came forward admitting that she worked for Nixon for $9 a day, in a telephone-bank room where the attack calls were made.&lt;ref&gt;Sabato, Larry J. (1996). "When push comes to poll". ''Washington Monthly'', June, vol. 28 (6): 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types and their effects ==
The mildest forms of push polling are designed merely to remind voters of a particular issue. For instance, a push poll might ask respondents to rank candidates based on their support of an issue in order to get voters thinking about that issue.

Many push polls are negative attacks on other candidates. These attacks often contain suggestions not stated as facts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} They ask questions such as "If you knew that Candidate Smith was being investigated for corruption, would you be more likely to vote for him, or less likely?" The question does not state that any investigation has taken place, so it is not a lie, but it puts in the respondent's mind the idea that Candidate Smith may be corrupt.

True push polls tend to be very short, with only a handful of questions, to maximise the number of calls that can be made. Any data obtained (if used at all) is secondary in importance to negatively affecting the targeted candidate. Legitimate polls are often used by candidates to test potential messages. They frequently ask about either positive and negative statements about any or all major candidates in an election and always include demographic questions.

The main advantage of push polls is that they are an effective way of maligning an opponent ("pushing" voters towards a predetermined point of view) while avoiding direct responsibility for the distorted or false information suggested (but not directly alleged) in the push poll.  They are risky for this same reason: if credible evidence emerges that the polls were directly ordered by a campaign or candidate, it could do serious damage to that campaign. Push polls are also relatively expensive, having a far higher cost per voter than radio or television commercials.  Consequently, push polls are most used in elections with fewer voters, such as [[primary election|party primaries]], or in close elections where a relatively small change in votes can make the difference between victory or defeat.

== Examples ==

=== {{anchor|Political push polls: [[Australia]]}} Australia ===
In March 2011, [[Daily Telegraph|''The Daily Telegraph'']] reported that the [[Australian Labor Party]] was referred to the [[New South Wales]] Electoral Commission after it was alleged to have used "push polling" in Newcastle to discredit independent candidate [[John Stuart Tate]]. Labor Party officials employed a market research firm to conduct the polling, telling voters that Tate was the Labor mayor of Newcastle, when in fact he was not. It has been suggested that Labor was worried its brand was so damaged in one of its traditional seats that it branded the popular independent as one of its own to discredit him. Labor polling firm Fieldworks Market Research admitted to the ''Telegraph'' reporter that the script used when calling voters branded Tate a "Labor" candidate, but said the script was provided by the Labor Party.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Simon (March 16, 2011). Labor accused of smear candidate's name. http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/labor-accused-of-smear-candidates-name/story-fn6b3v4f-1226022099138&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known, at least in public, whether the Electoral Commission responded to this referral.

=== {{anchor|Political push polls: United States}} United States ===

[[George W. Bush]] had used push polls in his 1994 bid for Texas Governor against incumbent [[Ann Richards]]. Callers asked voters "whether they would be more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if they knew that lesbians dominated on her staff."&lt;ref&gt;''Test by Fire: the War Presidency of George W. Bush'' by Robert H. Swansbrough (2008), p. 47. {{ISBN|978-0-230-60100-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2000|2000 United States Republican Party primaries]], it was alleged that George W. Bush's campaign used push polling against the campaign of Senator [[John McCain]]. Voters in [[South Carolina]] reportedly were asked "Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?" This hypothetical question seemed like a suggestion, although without substance. It was heard by thousands of primary voters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/ "The anatomy of a smear campaign"]. ''The Boston Globe''&lt;/ref&gt; McCain and his wife had in fact adopted a girl from Bangladesh.

In the 2008 presidential election, Jewish voters in several states were targeted by various push polls that linked [[Barack Obama]] to various anti-[[Israel]] positions. For example, various push polls suggested that Obama was a Muslim; Obama's church was anti-American and anti-Israel; Obama often met pro-Palestinian leaders in Chicago (and had met [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] leaders); a [[Hamas]] leader had endorsed an Obama victory; and that Obama had called for a summit of Muslim nations excluding Israel if elected president. The Jewish Council for Education &amp; Research, an organization that endorsed Obama, denounced the push polls as disinformation and lies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ben (September 15, 2008).

Amid widespread controversy over the Trump administration's executive order restricting immigration from the [[middle east]], the GOP sent out a poll to supporters on February 17, 2017 titled "Mainstream Media Accountability" which included such questions as "Do you believe that the media unfairly reported on President Trump’s executive order temporarily restricting people entering our country from nations compromised by radical Islamic terrorism?" and "Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump's temporary restriction executive order?" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/trump-media-accountability-survey-democrats-liberals/|title=Donald Trump is upset that Democrats are taking his biased survey on media bias|date=2017-02-18|newspaper=The Daily Dot|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://action.donaldjtrump.com/mainstream-media-accountability-survey/|title=Mainstream Media Accountability Survey|website=GOP|language=en|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political terms "[[Left-wing politics|Left]]" and "Right" were first used during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) and referred to seating arrangements in the [[French parliament]]: those who sat to the right of the chair of the parliamentary president were broadly supportive of the institutions of the monarchist [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]].&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"&gt;Goodsell, Charles T., "The Architecture of Parliaments: Legislative Houses and Political Culture", British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 18, No. 3 (July 1988), pp. 287–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linski, Gerhard, ''Current Issues and Research In Macrosociology'' (Brill Archive, 1984) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Barry ''Political Economy: A Comparative Approach'' (Praeger Paperback, 1998), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The original Right in France was formed as a reaction against the "Left" and comprised those politicians supporting hierarchy, tradition and [[clericalism]].&lt;ref name="Carlisle"/&gt;{{rp|693}} The use of the expression {{lang|fr|la droite}} ("the right") became prominent in France after the [[Bourbon Restoration#Second Restoration|restoration of the monarchy in 1815]], when it was applied to the [[Ultra-royalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, Marcel, "Right and Left" in Nora, Pierre, ed., ''Realms of Memory: Conflicts and Divisions'' (1996) pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms "right" and "left" to their own politics until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The English Ideology: Studies in the Language of Victorian Politics'', George Watson Allen Lane, London, 1973, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the right-wing originated with [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatives]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] and reactionaries, the term extreme right-wing has also been applied to movements including [[fascism]], [[nazism]] and [[racial supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', ''Right(-wing)...and for extreme right parties racism and fascism.'', p. 465, Oxford, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920780-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1830s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the [[Western world]] of [[social class]] structure and the economy, moving away from [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]] towards [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Kahan. ''Mind Vs. Money: The War Between Intellectuals and Capitalism''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: [[Transaction Publishers]], 2010. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This general economic shift toward capitalism affected [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] movements such as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]], which responded by becoming supportive of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams. ''Political Ideology Today''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: [[Manchester University Press]], 2001. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Right includes both economic and [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome L. Himmelstein, ''To the right: The transformation of American conservatism'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, economic conservatives are usually considered liberal and the Right includes [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[opposition to immigration]], religious conservatives and historically a significant presence of right-wing movements with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] sentiments including conservatives and fascists who opposed what they saw as the selfishness and excessive [[materialism]] inherent in contemporary capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard V.

==History==
{{See also|Left–right politics}}
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|5 May 1789, opening of the Estates-General in Versailles in 1789, as the conservatives sat on the right]]

The political term right-wing was first used during the [[French Revolution]], when [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a custom that began in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] of 1789. The nobility, members of the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]], generally sat to the right. In the successive [[Legislative Assembly (France)|legislative assemblies]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] who supported the [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]] were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was [[Joseph de Maistre]], who argued for an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of [[conservatism]]. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the republic (often secularists) and supporters of the monarchy (often Catholics).&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=https://books.google.com/?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the right, the [[Legitimists]] and [[Ultra-royalist]]s held [[counter-revolutionary]] views, while the [[Orléanist]]s hoped to create a [[constitutional monarchy]] under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 [[July Revolution]]. The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of [[social democracy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In British politics, the terms "right" and "left" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars: 1918–1940'' (1955), p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Right has gone through five distinct historical stages: (I) the reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion; (II) the moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government; (III) the radical right favored a romantic and aggressive nationalism; (IV) the extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism; and (V) the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Ball, T. and R. Bellamy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought'', pp. 610–612.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
The meaning of right-wing "varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augoustinos|first1=Martha|last2=Walker|first2=Iain|last3=Donaghue|first3=Ngaire|title=Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction|date=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=9780761942191|page=320|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYjEwFRPEQgC&amp;pg=PA230}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', in liberal democracies, the political right opposes socialism and social democracy. Right-wing parties include conservatives, Christian democrats, classical liberals, nationalists and on the far-right; racists and fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Iain|last2=McMillan|first2=Alistair|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|page=465|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199205165|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Eatwell and Neal O'Sullivan divide the right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme and new.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Chip Berlet argues that each of these "styles of thought" are "responses to the left", including liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"&gt;Berlet, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The reactionary right looks toward the past and is "aristocratic, religious and authoritarian".&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"/&gt; The moderate right, typified by the writings of [[Edmund Burke]], is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical ''laissez-faire'' and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies.&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 1999, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical right is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as [[McCarthyism]], the [[John Birch Society]], [[Thatcherism]] and the [[Republikaner Party]]. Eatwell stresses that this use has "major typological problems" and that the term "has also been applied to clearly democratic developments".&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The radical right includes [[right-wing populism]] and various other subtypes.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"/&gt; Eatwell argues that the extreme right' has four traits: "1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state".&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, p. 8, "Today four other traits feature most prominently in definitions: 1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; 4) the strong state".&lt;/ref&gt; The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets and individual initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vincent|first1=Andrew|title=Modern Political Ideologies|date=1995|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-631-19507-8|edition=2nd|quote=Who to include under the rubric of the New Right remains puzzling. It is usually seen as an amalgam of traditional liberal conservatism, Austrian liberal economic theory ... extreme libertarianism (anarch-capitalism) and crude populism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;Betz &amp; Immerfall 1998; Betz 1994; Durham 2000; Durham 2002; Hainsworth 2000; Mudde 2000; Berlet &amp; Lyons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communism. By contrast, the phrase "far-right" is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and often to criminalize other ethnic groups or religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YYdTvMmSYpEC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-415-21495-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR7,M1|title=The Christian Right, the Far Right and the Boundaries of American Conservatism|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-7190-5486-0|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sVZ8EUvJjJ4C&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR5,M1|title=Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=30 June 2000|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-7146-5182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JcJ5nr2MZfUC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Western Democracies and the New Extreme Right Challenge|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-415-36971-8|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1857918.stm|title=Pim Fortuyn: The far-right Dutch maverick|publisher=BBC News|date=7 March 2002|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are: [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]], [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6069233|title=A Dictator's Legacy of Economic Growth|date=14 September 2006|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/05/04/politico_funding/|title=Glenn Greenwald|publisher=Salon.com|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canovan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canovan|first1=Margaret|title=Populism|date=1981|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=978-0151730780|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Hans-Georg|title=Radical Right-Wing Populism in Western Europe|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1994|isbn=978-0-312-08390-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines right-wing extremism in the United States as "broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups), and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf|title=Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|format=PDF|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social stratification===
Right-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of some [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] objectives of [[left-wing politics]], claiming either that [[Social inequality|social]] or [[economic inequality]] is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 68, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing ideologies and movements support [[social order]]. The original French right-wing was called "the party of order" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; British conservative scholar R. J.

===Anti-communism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The original use of "right-wing" in reference to communism had the conservatives on the right, the liberals in the centre and the communists on the left. Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly anti-communist. The history of the use of the term "right-wing" to mean anti-communist is a complicated one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Anti-Communism and Popular Culture in Mid-Century America|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786414406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', which began "[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many monarchists (except [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.

By [[World War I]], in most European monarchies, the divine right of kings had become discredited and replaced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads or accepted a lesser degree of powers while elected governments held the day-to-day power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1922. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. In this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the fading of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually [[Colonialism|colonial authorities]] and the term right-wing came to be applied to [[colonialism]].

After [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values and nationalism. Throughout the [[Cold War]], colonial governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term "[[McCarthyism]]". While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists; leftist.

===Economics===
In France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism and industrialism and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appleby"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R. Scott|title=Fundamentalisms Observed|date=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-50878-1|page=91|edition=2nd|quote=Reactionary right-wing themes emphasizing authority, social hierarchy, and obedience, as well as condemnations of liberalism, the democratic ethos, the "rights of man" associated with the legacy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and the political and cultural ethos of modern liberal democracy are especially prominent in the writings and public statements of Archbishop Lefebere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe's history, there have been strong [[Collectivism|collectivist]] right-wing movements, such as in the [[Catholic social teaching|social Catholic right]] that has exhibited hostility to all forms of [[liberalism]] (including [[economic liberalism]]) and has historically advocated for paternalist class harmony involving an organic-hierarchical society where workers are protected while hierarchy of classes remain.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Catholic Social Teaching: The Popes Confront the Industrial Age'', 1740–1958. Paulist Press, 2003, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements, such as [[Carlism]] in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, there are still a few right-wing movements today, notably the French [[Nouvelle Droite]], [[CasaPound]] and American [[paleoconservatives]], that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.&lt;ref name="Fascism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Stanley G.|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisc.|isbn=978-0-299-08064-8|page=19|quote=Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, "right-wing" is sometimes used to describe [[Laissez-faire|''laissez-faire'' capitalism]]. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism can be traced to the late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The so-called [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Right, popularised by [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], combines support for [[free markets]], [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]] with traditional right-wing support for social conformity.&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt; [[Right-libertarianism|Right-wing libertarianism]] (sometimes known as [[libertarian conservatism]] or [[conservative libertarianism]]) supports a decentralised economy based on [[economic freedom]] and holds [[property rights]], [[free markets]] and [[free trade]] to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt; Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism "can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations". Gregory holds that the issue is neither right or left, but "whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory127.html|title=Left, Right, Moderate and Radical by Anthony Gregory|publisher=Archive.lewrockwell.com|date=21 December 2006|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative authoritarians and those on the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] have supported [[fascism]] and [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name="Fascism"/&gt;

===Nationalism===
In France, [[nationalism]] was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote="An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|the period of ''boulangisme'']] and the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism became a trait of the right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a "true" national identity from elements deemed to be corrupting that identity.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; Some were [[Supremacism|supremacists]], who in accordance with [[social Darwinism]] applied the concept of "[[survival of the fittest]]" to nations and races.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian ''Political Ideology Today'' (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalism was influenced by [[Romantic nationalism]], in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those it governs. This generally includes the language, race, culture, religion and customs of the nation, all of which were "born" within its culture. Linked with right-wing nationalism is [[cultural conservatism]], which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramet|first1=Sabrina|last2=Griffin|first2=Roger|title=The Radical Right in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989|date=1999|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park|isbn=978-0271018119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

===Natural law and traditionalism===
Right-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society on the basis of [[natural law]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref name="T. Alexander Smith 2003. p. 30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan Cameron pg. 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs, D. 1990. p. 203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"/&gt;

Traditionalism was advocated by a group of United States university professors (labeled the "New Conservatives" by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of [[individualism]], [[liberalism]], [[modernity]] and [[social progress]], seeking instead to promote what they identified as cultural and educational renewal&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Frohnen, Jeremy Beer and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and a revived interest in what [[T. S. Eliot]] referred to as "the permanent things" (concepts perceived by traditionalists as truths that endure from age to age alongside basic institutions of western society such as the church, the family, the state and business).

===Populism===
{{Main article|Right-wing populism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|Tea Party protesters walk towards the [[United States Capitol]] during the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], 12 September 2009]]
[[Right-wing populism]] is a combination of civic/ethno-nationalism with [[anti-elitism]], using populist rhetoric to provide a radical critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is "a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians' populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums".&lt;ref name="Canovan"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

In Europe, right-wing populism often takes the form of distrust of the [[European Union]] and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayward|first1=Jack|title=Elitism, Populism, and European Politics|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198280354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} In the United States, the [[Tea Party movement]] states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution of the United States, small federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and balancing the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teaparty.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=Tea Party|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Government support for an established religion was associated with the original French Right.&lt;ref name="Appleby"/&gt; [[Joseph de Maistre]] argued for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments founded upon a Christian constitution, implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies and especially in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Europe]]an monarchies, could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] political programs, as in the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Church of England]] was established by [[Henry VIII]] and some churchmen are given seats in the [[House of Lords]], but are considered politically neutral rather than being specifically right or left-wing.

Religious fundamentalists frequently feel that governments should enact laws supporting their religious tenets.&lt;ref name="Appleby"/&gt; The [[Christian right]] is a major force in North America. They generally support laws upholding what they consider religious values, such as [[pro-life movement in the United States|opposition to abortion]], contraception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Groch-Begley|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/26/this-conservative-myth-about-birth-control-coul/198623|title=This Conservative Myth About Birth Control Could Sway A Supreme Court Case|publisher=Mediamatters.org|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sex outside marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20110323/sex-outside-marriage-should-be-illegal-says-parnell-nominee|title=Sex outside marriage should be illegal, says Parnell nominee|work=Alaska Dispatch News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to same-sex marriage and reject scientific positions on [[evolution]] and other matters where science disagrees with the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Diana|last=DeGette|title=Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Wing Assault on Reason|publisher=[[The Lyons Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59921-431-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, ''The Republican War on Science: Revised and Updated'', ASIN: B001OQOIPM&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the West, some other religious and ethnicity based political groups are considered right-wing.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In India, [[Hindu nationalism]] is sometimes considered a part of the Right.

The term "[[family values]]" has been used as a buzzword by right-wing parties such as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the United States, the [[Family First Party]] in Australia, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in India to describe support for traditional families and opposition to the changes the modern world has made in how families live.

The policy of '''Russification of Finland''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''sortokaudet/sortovuodet'' - times/years of oppression) was a governmental policy of the [[Russian Empire]] aimed at limiting the special status of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and possibly the termination of its political autonomy and cultural uniqueness in 1899–1905 and in 1908–1917. It was a part of a larger policy of [[Russification]] pursued by late 19th–early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non-Russian minorities within the empire.

The two Russification campaigns evoked widespread Finnish resistance, starting with [[Great Petition|petitions]] and escalating to strikes, passive resistance (including draft resistance) and eventually active resistance. Finnish opposition to Russification was one of the main factors that ultimately led to [[Finland's declaration of independence]] in 1917.

== Under Tsarist Russia ==

Russia attacked Sweden in 1808, in what became later known as the "[[Finnish War|War of Finland]]". In 1809 the lost territory of Sweden became the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Grand Duchy of Finland]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809 the Finnish [[Diet of Finland|Diet]] recognized [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] as Grand Duke. For his part, Alexander confirmed the rights of the Finns, in particular, promising freedom to pursue their customs and religion and to maintain their identity:

:"''Providence having placed us in possession of the Grand Duchy of Finland, we have desired by the present act to confirm and ratify the religion and the fundamental laws of the land, as well as the privileges and rights which each class in the said Grand Duchy in particular, and all the inhabitants in general, be their position high or low, have hitherto enjoyed according to the constitution. We promise to maintain all these benefits and laws firm and unshaken in their full force''."&lt;ref name=Cyclopedic_JohnsonEtAl&gt;Johnson, A.; Bickford, C., Hudson, W., Dole, N. ''Cyclopedic Review of Current History. Volume 9. Garretson, Cox &amp; Co. 1899'' page 198 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First period of Russification ===
This promise was maintained; indeed, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] amplified the powers of the Finnish diet in 1869. Having enjoyed prosperity and control over their own affairs, and having remained loyal subjects for nearly a century,&lt;ref name=Cyclopedic_JohnsonEtAl /&gt; the manifesto which [[Nicholas II]] issued on 15 February 1899 was cause for Finnish despair.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedic_JohnsonEtAl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.histdoc.net/history/keisarik.html | title = 1899. The Collection of Decrees of the Grand Duchy of Finland. No 3. | access-date = 2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was forced through the Finnish senate by the deciding vote of the senate president, an appointee of the tsar—and after the [[Governor-General of Finland|governor-general of Finland]], [[Nikolay Bobrikov]], had threatened a military invasion and siege.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedic_JohnsonEtAl /&gt; While ostensibly affirming the Finns' rights in purely local matters, the manifesto asserted the authority of the state in any and all matters which could be considered to "come within the scope of the general legislation of the empire."&lt;ref name=Cyclopedic_JohnsonEtAl /&gt;

As a response to manifesto, a petition with 523,000 names was gathered and a delegation of 500 people were sent to deliver it to the tsar. A separate petition called ''Pro Finlandia'' that contained the names of 1,050 prominent foreign people was also gathered few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.histdoc.net/pro/valinta.html | title = Pro Finlandia. | access-date = 2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russification policies enacted included:

* The above-mentioned ''[[February Manifesto]] of 1899'', the decree by Emperor [[Nicholas II]] which asserted the imperial government's right to rule Finland without the consent of local legislative bodies, under which:&lt;ref name=Cyclopedic_JohnsonEtAl /&gt;
** the Orthodox Russian Church's status was strengthened; including, for example, criminalizing the act of subjecting a follower of the Orthodox church to a [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Lutheran church service]];
** the press was subjected to tighter Russian censorship than before;
** the [[Finnish army]] was made subject to Russian rules of [[military service]].
* The ''Language Manifesto of 1900'', a [[ukase|decree]] by Nicholas II which made [[Russian language|Russian]] the language of administration of Finland (in 1900, there were an estimated 8,000 Russians in all of Finland, of a population of 2,700,000)—the Finns saw this as placing the Russian minority in charge.
* The [[conscription]] law, signed by Nicholas II in July 1901 incorporating the [[Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland|Finnish army]] into the imperial army and forcing Finns to serve in Russian units.
* Finnish stamps were abolished and Russian stamps became the only allowed in January 1901.
* Some Finnish government offices, such as the Railway and Lighthouse Boards got new, Russian staff.

From April 1903 until the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the governor-general was granted dictatorial powers. Bobrikov used these powers by personally abolishing several newspapers and deporting notable Finnish political leaders. In June 1904 [[Eugen Schauman]] assassinated Bobrikov, the incumbent. The imperial government responded with a purge of opponents of Russification within the Finnish administration and more stringent [[censorship]]. However the passive resistance campaign also had some successes, notably a ''de facto'' reversal of the new [[conscription]] law.

The Russification campaign was suspended and partially reversed in 1905&amp;ndash;07 during [[Russian Revolution of 1905|a period of civil unrest]] throughout the Russian empire following Russian defeats in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

=== Second period of Russification ===

The program was reintroduced in 1908 on, costing Finland much of its autonomy and again causing further Finnish resistance, including the [[Finnish Jäger troops|Jäger movement]]. During 1909&amp;ndash;1917 the Finnish politicians in the [[Senate of Finland]] were replaced by Finnish-born officers of the Russian army who were formally subjects of the Grand Duchy, creating the so-called ''admiral-senate'' or ''saber-senate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haaste.om.fi/fi/index/lehtiarkisto/haaste20084/historiaaamiraalisenaatinoikeusosasto.html | title = Historiaa: Amiraalisenaatin oikeusosasto | author = Markku Tyynilä | accessdate = 2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia demanded higher payments for not conscripting Finns (issue of ''sotilasmiljoonat'', "Military millions"). The 1910 "Law of all-Empire legislation procedures" removed most of Finnish legislation from the newly established [[Finnish Parliament]] to the Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]] and [[State Council (Russian Empire)|State Council]]. In 1912 they passed "Law of equality" which opened all Finnish government and civil service offices to Russians.

Many measures were again suspended in 1914&amp;ndash;17 during the [[World War I|First World War]], but secret government documents published in the Finnish press in November 1914 suggested that the imperial government still harbored plans for the complete Russification of Finland.

Second wave halted due to [[February Revolution]] in Russia.

===Japanese involvement===
During the [[Russo-Japanese War|Russo–Japanese War]] with the financial aid from Japan the rebels bought a shipment of thousands of rifles with the aim of creating an uprising and forming an independent state. However, the ship was wrecked off the coast of Finland and the plan fell apart. During the First World War when Russia and Japan were allies fighting against Germany, the Japanese handed to the Russian government a list of leading men in the freedom movement (now in World War I working with Imperial Germany).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Shi Tao''' ({{zh|s=师涛|t=師濤|p=Shī Tāo}}; born July 25, 1968) is a [[Mainland China|mainland Chinese]] journalist, writer and poet, who in 2005 was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years for releasing a document of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] to an overseas Chinese democracy site.

[[Yahoo! China]]  was later discovered to have facilitated his arrest by providing his personal details to the Chinese government. Yahoo! was subsequently rebuked by a panel of the [[U.S. Congress]], settled a lawsuit by Shi's family out of court, and pledged to reform its practices.

Following Shi's arrest, he won two major international journalism awards: the [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards|International Press Freedom Award]] of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and the [[World Association of Newspapers]]' [[Golden Pen of Freedom Award]].

As of September 5, 2013, Shi Tao was released from the prison.  He received an 18-month reduction in sentencing.  He had spent 8 years and 6 months in the prison.  He is now living in [[Yinchuan]], [[Ningxia]] with his mother.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.de/2013/9/18/china-journalist-shi-tao-vorzeitig-aus-haft-entlassen  Report in german Amnesty Int. website] (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Shi Tao was born in [[Yanchi County]], [[Wuzhong, Ningxia|Wuzhong]], [[Ningxia]] in China in 1968.&lt;ref name=PEN /&gt; According to [[Liu Xiaobo]], Shi became active in the [[Chinese democracy movement|democracy movement]] in 1989 around the time of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/14.htm |title=Liu Xiaobo's letter to Yahoo! |author=Liu Xiaobo |date=October 7, 2005 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |deadurl=no |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BF1u0DAz?url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/14.htm |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1991, he received a degree from [[Shanghai]]'s [[East China Normal University]]. He married the following year.&lt;ref name=PEN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/shi-tao-2/ |title=Shi Tao |date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=English PEN |deadurl=no |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BEyAv7UD?url=http://www.englishpen.org/shi-tao-2/ |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his arrest, Shi was an editor at ''Dangdai Shang Bao'' ("Contemporary Trade News"), a newspaper in [[Changsha]], in [[Hunan Province]].&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt;

==Arrest and imprisonment==
{{Weiquan_Lawyers}}
On April 20, 2004, Shi received a document from [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] authorities which instructed journalists not to report on the upcoming fifteenth anniversary of the "June 4th event", the [[Tiananmen Square massacre]].&lt;ref name=PEN/&gt; The document warned of infiltration and sabotage by foreigners and Falun Gong, and stated that media members must "correctly direct public opinion" and to "never release any opinions that are inconsistent with central policies".&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Shi used an [[Yahoo! Mail]] account to send an anonymous post to Chinese-language website based in New York that described the communication.&lt;ref name=NYT98 /&gt; 

At the request of the Chinese government, Yahoo! provided records confirming that Shi's account had sent the e-mail.&lt;ref name=NYT98 /&gt; Shi was unofficially detained on 24 November 2004,&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; and on December 14, he was officially arrested under state security laws on a charge of revealing state secrets.&lt;ref name=NYT98 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CPJ2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/2005/08/imprisoned-journalist-shi-taos-family-files-for-re.php |title=Imprisoned journalist Shi Tao's family files for review of appeal |date=August 25, 2005 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPbly4ER?url=http://cpj.org/2005/08/imprisoned-journalist-shi-taos-family-files-for-re.php |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During Shi's trial, his lawyer contended that his punishment should be light as the disclosure of the information had not caused great harm to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/11.htm |title=Appendix III: Details of Shi Tao's case |publisher=Human Rights Watch |deadurl=no |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BR4IdQPO?url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/11.htm |accessdate=15 October 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=NYT98&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-yahoo.html |title=Yahoo helped Chinese to prosecute journalist |author=Joseph Kahn |date=September 8, 2005 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=no |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BF1JnnxJ?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-yahoo.html?_r=0 |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shi's appeal to the Hunan Province High People's Court was rejected without a hearing. Shi's mother Gao Qinsheng filed a request for a review of the appeal on his behalf in August 2005.&lt;ref name=CPJ2 /&gt; The appeal was unsuccessful, and Shi was meanwhile sent to Chishan Prison and assigned to [[forced labor]]. He began to suffer from respiratory problems, and in April 2006, also developed an ulcer and heart problems. In June 2007, he was given a medical transfer to Deshan Prison, where he worked in the machinery plant, and his health reportedly improved.&lt;ref name=PEN /&gt; According to Amnesty International, Shi's mother, brother and uncle were also harassed following his arrest, and his wife was repeatedly interrogated and pressured to divorce him, which she eventually did.&lt;ref name=NS /&gt;

Shi's imprisonment was protested by several international NGOs. [[Amnesty International]] designated him a [[prisoner of conscience]] and called for his immediate release.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA17/017/2008 |title=China: Legacy of the Beijing Olympics: Free Shi Tao: China's choice, your voice |date=February 1, 2008 |publisher=Amnesty International |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BQuK1VrK?url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA17/017/2008 |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] describes him as a political prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, [http://ppd.cecc.gov/QueryResultsDetail.aspx?PrisonerNum=5488 Political Prisoner Database:Shi Tao] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017004708/http://ppd.cecc.gov/QueryResultsDetail.aspx?PrisonerNum=5488 |date=October 17, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] launched a petition calling for his release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/shi-tao-01-04-2010,36862 |title=Shi Tao |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BQubFyUj?url=http://en.rsf.org/shi-tao-01-04-2010,36862 |accessdate=15 October 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] described itself as "outraged" by the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpj.org/2004/12/journalist-imprisoned-6.php |title=Journalist imprisoned |date=8 December 2004 |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BQuoBBps?url=http://cpj.org/2004/12/journalist-imprisoned-6.php |accessdate=15 October 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] called him an imprisoned "human rights defender" and campaigned for his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/Chinas-rights-defenders |title=China's Rights Defenders |publisher=Human Rights Watch |deadurl=no |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BR4Y5JP3?url=http://www.hrw.org/Chinas-rights-defenders |accessdate=15 October 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yahoo!'s role ==
The incident sparked a controversy about the business practices of Yahoo!, the [[Hong Kong]] arm of which provided technical information connecting the message and email account with Shi Tao's computer. Yahoo! was criticized by [[Reporters Without Borders]] for acting as a "police informant".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4221538.stm |title=Yahoo 'helped jail China writer' |date=September 7, 2005 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPawYVsa?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4221538.stm |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo! was first called to testify about the incident to the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]] of the [[United States Congress]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=MSNBC /&gt; 

In August 2007, Congress began an investigation into Yahoo!'s handling of the case,&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20167503/ |title=Yahoo faces scrutiny in China case |accessdate=August 17, 2007 |author=Stephanie Kirchgaessne and Richard Waters |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 8, 2007|deadurl=no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817195706/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20167503/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Yahoo! co-founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] testifying in another hearing before Congress.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt; The congressional panel found that Yahoo!'s 2006 testimony, in which a Yahoo! executive had wrongly claimed the company had been unaware of the reason for China's request for information, had been "inexcusably negligent behaviour at best, and deliberately deceptive behaviour at worst".&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7081458.stmv |title=US rebukes Yahoo over China case |date=November 6, 2007 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPc9ulDw?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7081458.stm |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman [[Tom Lantos]] told Yang to "beg the forgiveness" of Shi's mother, who was attending the hearing,&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt; and stated that "Much of this testimony reveals that while technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are pygmies".&lt;ref name=NYT711&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-yahoo.1.8226586.html |title=Yahoo chief apologizes to Chinese dissidents' relatives |date=November 7, 2007 |work=The New York Times |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPcfOznP?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-yahoo.1.8226586.html?_r=0 |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[Christopher H. Smith]] stated that there was a "parallel" between Yahoo's actions in the case and businesses that helped [[Nazi Germany]] locate Jews during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10203424.html |title=Searching for an Explanation: No Results Found |author=Dana Milbank |date=November 7, 2007 |work=The Washington Post |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yang apologized to Shi's mother and stated that he didn't think any Yahoo! employee "was trying to do anything wrong" and that the company was committed to "protecting and promoting free expression and privacy". He testified that the company was also collaborating with human rights organizations on an industry code of conduct to protect human rights.&lt;ref name=NYT711 /&gt; Yang later met with Shi's family.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;

Also in 2007, the [[World Organization for Human Rights]] filed a lawsuit in [[San Francisco]] against Yahoo! for allegedly providing information (emails and [[IP address]]es) to the Chinese government that caused the arrests of journalists Shi Tao and [[Wang Xiaoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm |title=Yahoo plea over China rights case |date=August 28, 2007 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BPdOc4wZ?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6966116.stm |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP2 /&gt; After unsuccessfully seeking to have the suit dismissed,&lt;ref name=AP2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-109844381.html |title=Yahoo seeks to dismiss China case |date=August 28, 2007 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo! settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D8ST2N780.html |title=Yahoo settles lawsuit by jailed journalists over decision to give info to Chinese government |author=Paul Elias |date=November 13, 2007 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to a trip by U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] to China in February 2008, Yang appealed to her to "actively pursue the release of Shi Tao, Wang Xiaoning and other Chinese dissidents who have been imprisoned for exercising internationally recognized rights of expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D8UV0HB82.html |title=Yahoo Asks US Gov't to Help Dissidents |author=Dibya Sarkar |date=February 21, 2008 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
On October 18, 2005, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] announced that Shi was one of four winners of the 2005 [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards]].&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/awards05/shi_tao.html|title=IPFA 2005 - Shi Tao|accessdate=January 21, 2007|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BQrjn8D3?url=http://cpj.org/awards/2005/shi-tao.php|deadurl=no|archivedate=October 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's website stated that he would be officially presented with the award when he is released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/awards05/awards_release_05.html|title=IPFA awardees 2005|accessdate=January 21, 2007|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BQskKV86?url=http://cpj.org/awards/2005/awards-release-05.php|deadurl=no|archivedate=October 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, he was given the [[Vasyl Stus]] Award, named for the Ukrainian dissident and awarded for "talent and courage".&lt;ref name=PEN/&gt; On November 28, 2006, he was named the winner of the [[Golden Pen of Freedom Award]] of the [[World Association of Newspapers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wan-press.org/article12609.html |title=Jailed Chinese Journalist Wins WAN Golden Pen of Freedom |date=November 28, 2006 |publisher=World Association of Newspapers |deadurl=no |archivedate=October 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BF2Aw6pV?url=http://www.wan-press.org/article12609.html |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was accepted on his behalf by his mother.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1322839511.html |title=It could have been me: Guido Fawkes on Shi Tao |author=Guido Fawkes |date=August 20, 2007 |work=The New Statesman |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Human Rights Watch awarded Shi a Hellman/Hammett grant, which recognizes "commitment to free expression" and "courage in the face of political persecution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/11/banned-censored-harassed-and-jailed |title=Banned, Censored, Harassed, and Jailed |date=October 11, 2009 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BR4iIb0v?url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/11/banned-censored-harassed-and-jailed |accessdate=15 October 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original action was subsequently decided against Sinn Féin, on the basis that the pre-1923 party was separate from the 1940s party. Most of the disputed funds were consumed by legal costs.

==The funds==
{{see also|History of Sinn Féin}}
Sinn Féin was established in 1905 as an [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] political party. In 1917, it was reconstituted under leader [[Éamon de Valera]] with a more radical separatist agenda, incorporating members and ideas from the [[Irish Volunteers]] who had organised the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. It set about raising funds for its campaign of [[civil disobedience]], which by 1919 escalated into the [[Anglo-Irish War]] when Sinn Féin proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]] independent of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Sinn Féin funds were for party-political purposes and were smaller than and separate from the [[Dáil funds]], which the Republic treated as [[government bond]]s to fund its administration and its army, the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|IRA]]. The party's Central Fund was held in bank accounts controlled by its honorary treasurers, [[Eamonn Duggan]] and [[Jennie Wyse Power]].&lt;ref name="p68"/&gt; The war ended with a truce in July 1921, followed by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in December, which provided for an [[Irish Free State]]. Sinn Féin split over the terms of the treaty, leading to the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922–23, won by the supporters of the Free State over those who sought to maintain the Irish Republic.

On either 9 December 1921 or 17 January 1922,&lt;ref name="eirenua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~eirenua/oct98/50yrsago.htm|title=50 Years Ago: The Sinn Féin Funds case|date=6 October 1998|work=Saoirse – Irish Freedom|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Sinn Féin standing committee resolved to make de Valera the party's sole trustee.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"&gt;Laffan 1999, p.417&lt;/ref&gt; At the February 1922 [[Ard Fheis]], the officer board became the standing committee.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt;  The party was in abeyance from the [[Irish general election, 1922|general election in June 1922]], when it rubber-stamped the nomination of a combined slate of pro- and anti-treaty candidates in a failed attempt to stop the descent into civil war.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt; In October 1922, after the Civil War had started, de Valera, who was anti-Treaty, wrote asking Duggan and Wyse Power, who were pro-Treaty, to transfer the funds to him in conformance to the old standing committee's resolution.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt; They refused to comply unless the new officer board/standing committee ordered them to do so.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt; The officer board/standing committee met on 26 October 1922; pro-Treaty members had an eight–five majority and the board voted not to allow further expenditure without its approval.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt;  It never met again.&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt;

After the 1923 ceasefire, supporters of the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Free State Executive Council]] founded the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] party and anti-Treaty activists reconstituted Sinn Féin. In February 1924 Duggan and Wyse Power lodged the balance of the Central Fund in a [[Trust law|trust]] in the High Court under the provisions of the Trustee Act, 1893;&lt;ref name="p68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laffan417"/&gt; the balance was £8,663 12s. 2d., from which administrative costs were deducted.&lt;ref name="p68"/&gt;

==1942–46 proceedings==
The Sinn Féin party lost support when [[Fianna Fáil]] was founded in 1926 by its most prominent members, including de Valera; it stopped contesting elections after [[Irish general election, September 1927|September 1927]]. In 1938 it ceded [[Irish republican legitimatism|symbolic control of the notionally still-extant Irish Republic]] to the [[IRA Army Council]].

When Eamonn Duggan died in 1936, Jennie Wyse Power became sole trustee of the Sinn Féin funds.&lt;ref name="p68"&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dail19470311"/&gt; Wyse Power died in 1941, and her son, Charles Stewart Power, a judge, inherited the position of trustee.&lt;ref name="dail19470311"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1947/03/11/00040.asp|title=Sinn Féin Funds Bill, 1947—First Stage.|date=11 March 1947|work=Dáil Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|nopp=Y|pages=Vol.104 No.13 p.40 cc.1752–57|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested to Éamon de Valera, then [[Taoiseach]], that the money could be used to support needy veterans of the [[Irish revolutionary period|revolutionary period]].&lt;ref name="dail19470311" /&gt; While de Valera began planning enabling legislation to effect this, Power approached surviving members of the pre-Treaty standing committee of Sinn Féin for their consent, and all but one agreed.&lt;ref name="dail19470311" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1947/03/19/00028.asp#N5|title=Sinn Féin Funds Bill, 1947—Second Stage.|date=19 March 1947|work=Dáil Éireann debates|pages=Vol.104 No.17 p.28 cc.2371–72|nopp=Y|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of the contemporary Sinn Féin became aware of the proposals,&lt;ref name="dail19470311" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028"/&gt; and on 19 January 1942, brought a High Court action by originating plenary [[summons]] against Power and the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] seeking a declaration that the funds were the property of the party, and the payment of the funds to its honorary treasurers.&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p77"&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time the funds amounted to £18,200 19s. 6d., invested in Irish Free State 4% Conversion Loan, 1950–70 (£13,041 1s. 5d.), Irish Free State Second National Loan (£4,927 14s. 8d.), and cash (£616 3s. 9d.).&lt;ref name="p77"/&gt;

The proceedings were formally called ''[[Margaret Buckley]], Séamus Mitchell, Séamus O'Neill, Padraig Power, Mairéad McElroy, Séamus Russell, Diarmuid Ó Laoghaire, Seán Poole, Joseph H. Fowler and [[John J. O'Kelly|Seán Ua Ceallaigh]], on behalf of themselves and all other Members of the Sinn Féin Organisation established in the year, 1905, and reconstituted in the year, 1917 Plaintiffs v. The Attorney General of Éire and Charles Stewart Power Defendants''.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no further action from the plaintiffs for several years and the respondents applied to have the case dismissed.&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028" /&gt; On 21 November 1945 the High Court gave Sinn Féin a month to proceed and notice of trial was issued on 19 December 1945.&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028" /&gt; In October 1946 the hearing was fixed for 26 November.&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028" /&gt; On 11 November, the plaintiffs sought an order that their original solicitor release to their new solicitor papers which he was holding in [[lien]] for unpaid fees; the High Court refused and the case was adjourned pending an appeal of this decision to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="dail1947031900028" /&gt;

==Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947==
The Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947 was an [[act of parliament|act]] of the [[Oireachtas]] introduced in the [[12th Dáil]] by the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, on 11 March 1947.&lt;ref name="dail19470311" /&gt; His justification was that "unless there is action taken by the Legislature, these funds will be frittered away in legal costs".&lt;ref name="dail19470311" /&gt; The Act provided for a seven-person board, Bord Cistí Sinn Féin,&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, sec.2&lt;/ref&gt; with a chairman nominated by the [[Chief Justice of Ireland|Chief Justice]] and the others by the [[Government of Ireland|Government]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, secs.3–5&lt;/ref&gt; De Valera had first confirmed that the Chief Justice, [[Conor Maguire]], was willing to make the nomination.&lt;ref name="MacCormaic2016p68"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mac Cormaic|first=Ruadhán |title=The Supreme Court |chapter=Separating Powers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfSpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68|accessdate=2 February 2017|date=2016-09-05|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9781844883417|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act directed the High Court to pay the Sinn Féin funds to the board;&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, secs.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; it could also accept donations from others.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, sec.14&lt;/ref&gt; The  board could invest its funds in the same manner as [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|Post Office savings]],&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, sec.9&lt;/ref&gt; and could make payments to needy veterans of [[Physical force Irish republicanism|Irish republican paramilitary groups]] in 1916–21.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, sec.13&lt;/ref&gt; It would be dissolved when its funds were exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin Funds Act 1947, sec.16&lt;/ref&gt; Section 10 of the act purported to [[stay of proceedings|stay the proceedings]] started in 1942, and to require the High Court to [[motion to dismiss|dismiss]] the action upon an [[ex-parte]] application from the Attorney General.

The act was [[signed into law]] on 27 May 1947. On 10 June 1947, [[Aindrias Ó Caoimh (attorney general)|Aindrias Ó Caoimh]], junior counsel for the Attorney General, made an ex-parte application under Section 10 of the act to dismiss the case.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. 69&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Gavan Duffy]], the President of the High Court, rejected the application on the basis that Section 10 of the act violated the [[Constitution of Ireland]], on two grounds: it violated the [[separation of powers]], in that the [[legislature]] was attempting to prevent the [[judiciary]] hearing a case as provided under Articles 34 to 37 of the Constitution;&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. pp.70,84&lt;/ref&gt; and it violated Article 43's protection of [[private property]], by requisitioning the funds without sufficient cause.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. 83&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June, the Attorney General's appeal was heard in the Supreme Court, before justices [[James Murnaghan]], [[James Geoghegan]], [[John O'Byrne]], [[William Black (judge)|William Black]] and [[Martin Maguire]], with senior counsel [[John A. Costello]] and [[Seán MacBride]] appearing for Sinn Féin.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. pp.71,74&lt;/ref&gt; Conor Maguire [[recusal|recused]] himself because of his prior involvement in the legislative process.&lt;ref name="MacCormaic2016p68"/&gt; The Supreme Court's judgment, delivered by O'Byrne on 31 July 1947, upheld both grounds of the High Court ruling.&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 I.R. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==1948 proceedings==
After the Sinn Féin Funds Act had been found unconstitutional, the original 1942 case recommenced. It was adjourned after the [[Irish general election, 1948|February 1948 general election]] to allow Sinn Féin to appoint new counsel, because Costello and MacBride were now ministers in [[Government of the 13th Dáil|the new coalition government]].&lt;ref name="McCullagh2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCullagh|first=David|title=The Reluctant Taoiseach: A Biography of John A.

'''The Tillman Act of 1907''' (34 Stat. 864) (January 26, 1907) was the first legislation in the United States prohibiting monetary contribution to national political campaigns by corporations.

==Background==

Following the presidential election of 1904, charges were made against the victor, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], regarding his acceptance of corporate contributions to his campaign.  In response, Roosevelt in his annual address to Congress in 1905 called for the prohibition of such contributions:

{{quote|All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Not only should both the National and the several State Legislatures forbid any officer of a corporation from using the money of the corporation in or about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money in connection with any legislation save by the employment of counsel in public manner for distinctly legal services.}}

Roosevelt repeated his call in the report to Congress for 1906, saying "I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already passed one House of Congress. Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or indirectly."

==Contents==
[[File:Benjamintillman.jpg|thumb|upright| [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Benjamin Tillman]].]]

In response to Roosevelt's call, Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of South Carolina sponsored the bill that became known as the Tillman Act. The bill passed the Senate on June 9, 1906.  On June 17, 1906, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "One 'great financial authority who is a Republican' gave assurance that 'he and all the financial men with whom I have talked have welcomed this legislation with very much the same emotions with which a serf would hail his liberation from a tyrannous autocrat'."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' of June 17, 1906 on page 8, the bottom of column 2, continuing to the top of column 3&lt;/ref&gt;   The article further stated that if the bill passes the House, "it will not bring about the millennium, but will lessen a very mean and sordid practice of blackmail... the great number of corporations that have suffered extortion through weakness and cowardice will have their backbones stiffened, and parties will be put to it to fill their coffers by really voluntary contributions."

The Senate bill was subsequently amended to add a minimum fine provision and the possibility of a prison term for officers and directors.  It was signed into law by President Roosevelt on January 26, 1907.  The Act provided in full as follows:

{{quote|An Act to prohibit corporations from making money contributions in connection with political elections. Be it enacted, that it shall be unlawful for any national bank, or any corporation organized by authority of any laws of Congress, to make a money contribution in connection with any election to any political office. It shall also be unlawful for any corporation whatever to make a money contribution in connection with any election at which Presidential and Vice-Presidential electors or a Representative in Congress is to be voted for or any election by any State legislature of a United States Senator. Every corporation which shall make any contribution in violation of the foregoing provisions shall be subject to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, and every officer or director of any corporation who shall consent to any contribution by the corporation in violation of the foregoing provisions shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not exceeding one thousand and not less than two hundred and fifty dollars, or by imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.}}

The language of the Act provided for penalties but no actual enforcement method; no [[Federal Election Committee]] or similar body yet existed to enforce the provisions.  There were no existing disclosure requirements for candidates accepting contributions, and so there was no effective way to enforce the new law.  The Act applied to general elections, but not primary elections.  In the South, the grip of the Democratic Party was absolute, and so the primary election was the most important contested race.  Further, a corporation could circumvent the law by directing its officers or directors to make personal contributions to a candidate, which were not prohibited, and then simply give them bonuses at year end to effectively reimburse them for those contributions.  The Tillman Act was therefore simply a first step towards regulation of campaign finance.  Additional steps would be taken by Congress in the disclosure provisions of the Publicity Act of 1910 (also known as the [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act]]), and the extension of the Tillman Act to primary elections in the 1911 amendments to the Tillman and Publicity Acts.

The '''Tolerance Monument''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] '''פסל הסובלנות''') is an outdoor sculpture located in a park near Goldman Promenade in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greer Fay |last=Cashman |title=Grapevine: More than just an olive branch |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193324398&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=Jerusalem Post |date=2006-09-06 |accessdate=2007-04-11 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==History==
The monument was designed by  Polish sculptor [[Czesław Dźwigaj]], known for his [[religious art]], in collaboration with sculptor Michal Kubiak. The project was funded by Polish businessman [[Aleksander Gudzowaty]] to promote peace and tolerance in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Isabel |last=Kershner |title=Symbol of Peace Stands at Divide Between Troubled Jerusalem's East and West |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/world/middleeast/18jerusalem.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=tolerance%20monument&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin |work=New York Times |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Etched on a [[stone]] at the entrance to the park are the following words: "The monument is in the form of two halves of a broken column, which stand divided but still linked, on the ruins of a nameless and ageless [[temple]]. An [[olive tree]] grows in the middle of the split [[column]] and with its leaves seeks to encompass and shade both halves. The tree enables the two parts of the column to link together in symbolic coexistence. It cannot be known when the break will heal, when the two sides will grow back together but it can be seen that between the branches of the olive tree a new seed is sprouting, a golden grain of tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1029306.html Choked by unrealistic messages], [[David Kroyanker]], ''[[Haaretz]]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The monument is situated on a hill marking the divide between [[Jewish]] [[Armon HaNetziv]] and [[Arab]] [[Jabel Mukaber]], just outside the [[United Nations]] headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greer Fay |last=Cashman |title=Monumental tolerance |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=1&amp;cid=1159193336672&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=Jerusalem Post |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2007-04-11 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2016 she began recording her eighth studio album, which had begun work in 2015, announcing her departure from the electronic scene for a more commercial pop radio direction for the radio, focusing on Portuguese-language lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|URL=http://epoca.globo.com/colunas-e-blogs/bruno-astuto/noticia/2015/03/e-doloroso-ve-los-separados-mas-apenas-quero-que-se-respeitem-diz-bwanessab-sobre-separacao-de-zeze-e-zilu.html|title ="É doloroso vê-los separados.

According to Wanessa, the decision to change the musical genre was based on the personal identification of the country music: "The way of pop I do not identify myself, it is not my beach, my footprint is romanticism and the sertanejo is a strong mark of my I'm doing what I believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://portalpopline.com.br/nao-me-identifico-com-o-caminho-do-pop-no-brasil-diz-wanessa-camargo/|title=“Não me identifico com o caminho do pop no Brasil”, diz Wanessa Camargo|published=Popline|accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same week she breaks with [[Sony Music]] and signs with Work Show, producer responsible for releases of the sertanejo market.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://portalpopline.virgula.uol.com.br/apostando-em-nova-sonoridade-wanessa-camargo-quebra-contrato-com-sony-music/|title=Apostando em nova sonoridade, Wanessa Camargo quebra contrato com Sony Music|published=Popline|accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, she released the first single from the album, "Coração Embriagado", which reached the nineteenth position on [[Billboard Brasil|''Billboard'' Brasil]], being the best result of her career until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|URL=https://ia601509.us.archive.org/15/items/billboardbrasilhot10020160815/Billboard_Brasil_Hot_100_20160815.pdf|title=Billboard Brasil - Hot 100 Airplay|published=[[Billboard Brasil]].

==Personal life==
In 1998, at age 16, she was the initial target of the [[kidnapping]] that ended up by mistake with her Uncle Welington Camargo, who mobilized the country when they cut a piece of her ear and sent it to the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombeirosanjosdavida.com.br/segunda_entrada/revista/6edicao/conteudo/teoriaesfericadaprotecao.php Sequestro de Wellington Camargo tinha como foco inicial Wanessa] Bombeiros Anjos da Vida&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, even with security hired, suffered a new attack when its college was assaulted.&lt;ref name="Veja 2003"/&gt; After the raid her family moved to the city of [[Plantation, Florida]], in the [[United States]], to protect herself of future attacks, where she remained for a year.&lt;ref name="Veja 2003"/&gt; In 2003 Wanessa revealed in an interview for ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'' magazine that she had not been a virgin for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://origin.veja.abril.com.br/260203/entrevista.html|title="Sou o oposto da Sandy"|work=Veja|archivedate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; But her parents still did not know and, days later, Zezé was questioned in an interview about this and said he was surprised by the news to know immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.terra.com.br/exclusivo/noticias/2003/02/24/009.htm|title=Zezé di Camargo descobre que Wanessa não é mais virgem lendo revista|work=Terra|archivedate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, during adolescence, Wanessa dated the singer Leandro Scornavacca, member of [[KLB]], finishing a year later when it moved to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.oocities.org/faclubedoklb/entrevista.htm|title=Entrevista: Aqui você saberá mais sobre os meninos KLB , kiko 21 , Leandro 19 e Bruno 16 .

==Activism==
Wanessa is also the ambassador of the [[NGO]] [[Fundação SOS Mata Atlântica]], which is fighting for the preservation of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. Due to her efforts to promote the NGO and its goals, and also to work for the clean-up of the [[Tietê River]] in São Paulo, Wanessa was awarded the 2007 Pro-Social Prize at the My Nick Awards event,&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://mundonick.uol.com.br/canal/especiales/meus_premios/07/|title=Wanessa na Uol|archivedate=2013-12-31|publisher=Uol}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some time then received the title of Personality of the Year and JK Jewel from Cicesp. In 2012, the singer received a cache of $150,000 from an advertisement that was entirely donated to [[Unicef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.tribunahoje.com/noticia/14429/entretenimento/2012/01/11/wanessa-doa-r-150-mil-recebidos-por-propaganda-na-revista-com-foto-do-filho.html|title=Wanessa doa R$ 150 mil recebidos por propaganda na revista com foto do filho|archivedate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2014, Wanessa donated the $50,000 fee she received from ''[[Caras (magazine)|Caras]]'' magazine to display her second child exclusively in the publication for social projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.purepeople.com.br/noticia/wanessa-doa-cache-de-r-50-mil-recebido-de-revista-para-projetos-da-unicef_a22342/1#lt_source=external,manual|title=Wanessa doa cachê de R$ 50 mil recebido de revista para projetos da Unicef|archivedate=2013-12-31|publisher=Uol}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18, 2014, Wanessa makes a virtual pocket show with old songs and never sung before to lure fans into a campaign on behalf of a boy named Ryan, who suffers from [[Ondine syndrome]]. During the presentation, netizens could make their donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://portalpopline.com.br/wanessa-faz-pocket-show-virtual-com-musicas-antigas/|título=Wanessa faz pocket show virtual com músicas antigas e nunca cantadas antes|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=Popline}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Wanessa was appointed UN ambassador, committing herself to UNAIDS actions in the response to HIV and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://odia.ig.com.br/diversao/celebridades/2015-12-03/wanessa-e-nomeada-embaixadora-da-onu-em-brasilia.html|title=Wanessa é nomeada embaixadora da ONU, em Brasília|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=O Dia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT advocacy===
In 2009, Wanessa became involved in [[LGBT]] causes and the fight for equal rights for all: "Every human being has the option of loving whoever he or she wants, regardless of their sexual choice." I think it's great, I do not see anything against. being against people who make love, is ridiculous. It is a posture of society that no longer fits in today's time."&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/musica/pop/ser-contra-gente-que-faz-amor-e-ridiculo-diz-wanessa-sobre-gays-e-daniela-mercury/#img=1&amp;galleryId=590276|title=‘Ser contra gente que faz amor é ridículo’, diz Wanessa sobre gays e Daniela Mercury|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=UOL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Wanessa made a show at the 15th [[São Paulo Gay Pride Parade]] for an audience of 1 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.riomusicconference.com.br/mercado/cantora-wanessa-faz-show-de-encerramento-na-parada-gay-de-sao-paulo/|title=Cantora Wanessa faz show de encerramento na “Parada LGBT”|archivedate=2013-12-31|work=Rio Music Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having her first child with businessman Marcus Buaiz, the singer was asked how she would handle if her son was gay: "I look the best I can."&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://paroutudo.com/2012/wanessa-entrevista-glad/|title=Wanessa responde como reagiria se tivesse um filho gay|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=Parou Tudo}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also celebrated in 2013 in her social networks the approval of law 4277, which recognized same-sex marriage in Brazil and has already criticized Marco Feliciano's 'Gay Cure' project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.ibahia.com/detalhe/noticia/no-instagram-wanessa-camargo-mostra-apoio-ao-casamento-gay/?cHash=656838413a63b7095685accd90388eab|title=No Instagram, Wanessa Camargo mostra apoio ao casamento gay|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=iBahia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Wanessa criticized the unfavorable for adopting children by homosexual couples: "A human being who says in the name of God that it is better for a child to be abandoned than to have two parents can not speak in the name of God. , the lack of education and the prejudice dictate what you are, God is in our hearts, in our actions, in the love of our neighbor, in the compassion, love is God, love is greater than everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www.opovo.com.br/app/divirta-se/2015/04/28/noticiasdivirtase,3429580/wanessa-camargo-defende-o-publico-lgbt-e-ganha-apoio-de-daniela-mercur.shtml|title=Wanessa Camargo defende o público LGBT e ganha apoio de Daniela Mercury|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=O Povo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the singer made a show at the 19th LGBT Pride Parade in São Paulo for an audience of 1 million people again.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/cidades/parada-gay-2015-1-dia-de-festa-para-364-de-opressao-diz-apoglbt,53bc34716c0ef66cc03c93bcfb87d57buzxpRCRD.html|title=Parada Gay: 1 dia de festa para 364 de opressão, diz APOGLBT|archivedate=2013-12-31|published=Terra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
