The '''[[2001–02 NHL season|2001–02]] [[Calgary Flames]] season''' was the [[Calgary Flames seasons|22nd]] [[National Hockey League]] [[season (sports)|season]] in Calgary.  It began with wholesale changes, as second year General Manager [[Craig Button]] continued to change the look of the team.  In two separate draft-day trades, the Flames dealt goaltender [[Fred Braithwaite]] and forwards [[Valeri Bure]] and [[Jason Wiemer]] away, gaining back [[Roman Turek]] and [[Rob Niedermayer]].

The changes appeared to pay off, as the Flames stormed out to a 13–2–2–2 record, and first place in the division.  The result prompted the Flames to sign Turek - a pending unrestricted free agent - to a long-term deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/11/19/turek011119.html Flames ink Turek long-term], cbc sports, November 20, 2001, accessed December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The team, however, collapsed, winning only 19 of their remaining 63 games, finishing 4th in the [[Northwest Division (NHL)|Northwest Division]], and out of the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season.

The season ended with head coach [[Greg Gilbert]] and top forward [[Marc Savard]] in a bitter, public feud that included the latter demanding a trade late in the season and into the summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/11/15/flames021115.html Flames ship Savard to Thrashers], cbc sports, November 15, 2002, accessed December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individually, [[Jarome Iginla]] broke into the spotlight, leading the NHL in goals (52) and points (96).  His season would land him the [[Rocket Richard Trophy]], the [[Art Ross Trophy]] and the [[Lester B. Pearson Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://proicehockey.about.com/library/bltrophywin2002.htm NHL Awards 2002], proicehockey.about.com, accessed December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Iginla also finished second in [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] voting, tied with winner [[José Théodore|Jose Theodore]] on points (434), but behind Theodore in first place votes (26–23).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/06/20/nhlawards020620.html Jose Theodore named NHL MVP], cbc sports, June 27, 2002, accessed December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iginla was also a member of [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada's]] team at the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Salt Lake Olympics]].  He recorded two goals in the gold medal game against the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]], which Canada won 5–2 to claim their first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/24/usa_canada_ap/ Stand on guard for thee], CNNSI.com, February 24, 2002, accessed December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular season==
The Flames were involved in a tragic incident during their March 16, 2002, game in Columbus against the [[Columbus Blue Jackets|Blue Jackets]].  During the second period of the contest, a slapshot by Columbus' [[Espen Knutsen]] was deflected into the crowd off the stick of Flames defenceman [[Derek Morris (ice hockey)|Derek Morris]].  The puck struck a fan, 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil, who was at her first NHL game.  Though she was able to leave the game under her own power, the blow tore a vertebral artery and resulted in a blood clot.  [[Death of Brittanie Cecil|She died]] two days later; she was the first fan to die at a game in the NHL's 85-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacFarlane |first=Steve |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/03/14/10-years-after-the-death-of-brittanie-cecil |title=Death of Brittanie: Cecil 10 years later |work=Calgary Sun |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months after the incident, the NHL instituted a policy requiring that protective netting be placed around the ends of each rink prior to the start of the [[2002–03 NHL season|2002–03 season]], a decision which both the Flames and Blue Jackets advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacFarlane |first=Steve |title=Net reaction |work=Calgary Sun |date=2012-03-15 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Tennis Centre''', also known as '''Abu Dhabi International Tennis Complex''', is a sports [[arena]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]].

The complex opened in 2004 as part of the [[Zayed Sports City]]. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 5,000 on Centre Court and 600 on Court 2. The sports city features three other major sporting and leisure facilities.

==Construction==
The idea for a sporting complex in Abu Dhabi was brought up by Sheikh [[Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], the late former UAE president and Sheikh [[Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], the incumbent president. Abu Dhabi Municipalities and Town Planning Department were given the task of building a Tennis Complex to rival all other venues.


==Tournaments==
The first tournament held at the venue was the ''Abu Dhabi Professional Tennis Tournament2006'' which was part of the ATP futures series in 2006. In 2009 a professional exhibition event, the [[Capitala World Tennis Championship]] was held for the first time, with six of the world's top ten players in attendance.

'''Albert–Daly Field''' is a [[Soccer-specific stadium|soccer-specific]] and multi-use sports facility located in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] on the campus of the [[College of William and Mary]]. It is home to the [[soccer]] and [[lacrosse]] teams for the College.

The facility was paid for thanks in large part to a sizable challenge grant made by Jim and Bobbie Ukrop.  The Ukrops suggested that the field be named in honor of long time soccer coaches [[Al Albert (soccer coach)|Al Albert]] and [[John Daly (soccer coach)|John Daly]].  Opened in 2004, the original venue consisted of a natural grass playing surface, lighting, and temporary bleacher seating.&lt;ref name="tribe1345"&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Family Stadium at Albert-Daly Field|url=http://www.tribeathletics.com/story.php/1345|website=tribeathletics.com|accessdate=June 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128202239/http://tribeathletics.com/story.php/1345|archivedate=November 28, 2010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the College broke ground on a new 1,000-seat spectator pavilion at Albert–Daly Field.  The structure, '''Martin Family Stadium''', is named in honor of Eff and Patty Martin, and their children.  In addition to spectator seating, the building boasts a state-of-the-art press box, filming positions, and restroom facilities. The project was completed in the spring of 2011.&lt;ref name="tribe1345"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Family Stadium at Albert-Daly Field|url=http://www.tribeathletics.com/news/2011/1/7/205073195.aspx|publisher=College of William and Mary|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Canteen 0002.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Covered military canteen (right) with nested canteen cup (left)]]
[[Image:Alamannic Canteen.JPG|thumb|Wooden canteen from Oberflacht, Germany (7th century)]]

A '''canteen''' is a drinking water bottle designed to be used by hikers, campers, soldiers and workers in the field.  It is usually fitted with a shoulder strap or means for fastening it to a belt, and may be covered with a cloth bag and padding to protect the bottle and insulate the contents.  If the padding is soaked with water, [[Evaporative cooler#Physical principles|evaporative cooling]] can help keep the contents of the bottle cool.  Many canteens also include a nested canteen cup.

Primitive canteens were sometimes made of hollowed-out gourds, such as a [[calabash]], or were bags made of [[Waterskin|leather.]]

Later, canteens consisted of a glass bottle in a woven basket cover.  The bottle was usually closed with a cork stopper.

Designs of the mid-1900s were made of metal&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; [[tin]]-plated steel, [[stainless steel]] or [[aluminum]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; with a [[screw cap]], the cap frequently being secured to the bottle neck with a short chain or strap to prevent loss.  These were an improvement over glass bottles, but were subject to developing pinhole leaks if dented, dropped or bumped against jagged rocks.

Contemporary designs are almost exclusively made of one of several types of [[plastic]]s, especially [[polyethylene]] or [[polycarbonate]].  They are typically as light as, or lighter than, their metal equivalents and are quite resistant to developing leaks, even when dropped or severely bumped.

[[Hunter-gatherer]]s in the [[Kalahari]] use ostrich eggshell as water containers in which they puncture a hole to enable them to be used as canteens. The presence of such eggshells dating from the [[Howiesons Poort]] period of the [[Middle Stone Age]] at [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] in [[South Africa]] suggests canteens were used by humans as early as 60,000  years ago.&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6295">In [[baseball]], a '''corked bat''' is a specially modified [[baseball bat]] that has been filled with [[cork (material)|cork]] or other lighter, less dense substances to make the bat lighter. A lighter bat gives a hitter a quicker swing and may improve the hitter's timing. In [[Major League Baseball]], modifying a bat with foreign substances and using it in play is illegal and subject to ejection and further punishment.

==Construction of corked bats==
To cork a bat, a hole approximately 1/2-inch (12.5&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter is drilled down through the thick end of the bat roughly six inches deep. Crushed cork, [[bouncy ball]], sawdust, or other similar material is compacted into the hole and the end is typically patched up with glue and sawdust. However, this weakens the bat's structural integrity and makes it more susceptible to breakage, even more so if the cork is placed beyond roughly six inches into the bat. Corked bats are typically discovered when they break during play.

Corked bats were tested in the [[MythBusters (2007 season)#Episode 83 – "Baseball Myths"|2007 season of MythBusters]] where it was found that the cork was detrimental to the bat's performance.

==Corked bats in Major League Baseball==
Using a corked bat in Major League Baseball is in violation of Rule 6.06 (d), which reads in full:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp MLB Official Rules, Section 6]", ''MLB.com'' (accessed June 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A batter is out for illegal action when:

(d) He uses or attempts to use a bat that, in the umpire's judgment, has been altered or tampered with in such a way to improve the distance factor or cause an unusual reaction on the baseball. This includes, bats that are filled, flat surfaced, nailed, hollowed, grooved or covered with a substance such as paraffin, wax, etc. No advancement on the bases will be allowed and any out or outs made during a play shall stand. In addition to being called out, the player shall be ejected from the game and may be subject to additional penalties as determined by his League Punishment advisor.

While filling a bat with cork makes it lighter, there is no rule that prevents a player from using a lighter, uncorked bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=MythBusters Baseball Special|episodelink=MythBusters (2007 season)#Episode 83 – Baseball Myths|series=MythBusters|serieslink=MythBusters|airdate=2007-08-08|season=6|number=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lighter wood bats are shorter than heavier bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/The-Physics-of-Cheating-in-Baseball.html |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, former player and Major League manager [[Phil Garner]] admitted in January 2010 on a Houston radio station that he used a corked bat against [[Gaylord Perry]] and "hit a home run" with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://67.72.16.166/kilt2/2154640.mp3|title=2154640}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, ''[[Deadspin]]'' reported that [[Pete Rose]] used corked bats during his 1985 pursuit of [[Ty Cobb]]'s all-time hits record. Two sports memorabilia collectors who owned Rose's game-used bats from that season had the bats [[x-rayed]] and found the telltale signs of corking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petchesky|first1=Barry|title=This Is Pete Rose's Corked Bat|url=http://deadspin.com/5555714/this-is-pete-roses-corked-bat|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[Deadspin]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littmann|first1=Chris|title=Corked Bats Reportedly Belonging to Pete Rose Come to Light|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2010/6/8/1647180/corked-bats-reportedly-belonging|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[SBNation]]|date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose had previously denied using corked bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pete Rose interview|url=http://reds.enquirer.com/2004/01/13/red2qa.html|accessdate=16 June 2016|work=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=January 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doak Field''' (or '''The Doak''') is a [[baseball]] venue in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[United States]].  It opened in 1966 and is home to the [[North Carolina State University]] [[North Carolina State Wolfpack|Wolfpack]] [[college baseball]] team of the [[NCAA]]'s [[List of NCAA Division I baseball programs|Division I]] [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC).&lt;ref name=bd&gt;{{cite web|title=Doak Field at Dail Park|url=http://www.ballparkdigest.com/200903101548/college-baseball/visits/doak-field-at-dail-park-north-carolina-state-wolfpack|work=Ballpark Digest|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named for [[Charles Doak]], who was the head coach of the NC State baseball team from 1924&amp;ndash;1939.&lt;ref name=yearbook12&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 NC State Baseball Yearbook |url=http://www.packyearbooks.com/2011-12-baseball-yearbook/files/2.html |work=PackYearbooks.com |publisher=NC State Sports Information |accessdate=2 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68rfHLNqO?url=http://www.packyearbooks.com/2011-12-baseball-yearbook/files/2.html |archivedate=2012-07-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium is located on NC State's [[North Carolina State University Main Campus#Central Campus|West Campus]], behind Lee and Sullivan residence halls.&lt;ref name=campusmap&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Campus Precinct Map|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/campus_map/central.htm|work=NCSU|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diamond is in the north/northwest corner of its block, which is bounded by Thurman Drive (third base, north/northeast); Dail Park and the residence halls (left field, east/southeast); Sullivan Drive (right field, south/southwest); and Varsity Drive (first base, west/northwest).  Its seating capacity is 2,500 spectators, with an overflow capacity of 3,000.

Prior to 1966, the Wolfpack played their home games at [[Riddick Stadium]], which was primarily a football facility.&lt;ref name=riddick&gt;{{cite web |title=Riddick Stadium |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/buildings/ridd-sta.html |work=NCSU.edu |accessdate=2 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/687vR7K64?url=http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/buildings/ridd-sta.html |archivedate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doak Field at Dail Park Press Box.JPG|thumb|Doak Field at Dail Park]]

In May 2004, the stadium underwent a [[USD|$]]6 million renovation which included leveling the playing field, a new drainage system, new grandstands, a new [[press box]], and new concessions and bathroom facilities.&lt;ref name=facil /&gt;

Since the renovation was completed in 2004, the dimensions at Doak Field are asymmetrical at 320 feet down the left-field line, 370 feet to the left-field power alley, 400 feet to straightaway center field, 375 feet to the right-field power alley, and 330 down the right-field line. The wall from the left-field line to deep left-center field is 16 feet high, then drops to eight feet high all the rest of the way around to right field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doak Field |url=https://projects.ncsu.edu/facilities/buildings/doak.html |website=projects.ncsu.edu |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Coast Barbarians''' is a Norwegian [[Rugby union|rugby]] team. They currently compete in the [[Norway Rugby Championship]]. The team is not a club as such, as it contains players from different clubs that have too low player numbers to compete individually. The club contains players from Tønsberg, Horten, Høyskolen i Vestfold and NMBU (Ås).

'''Ecua-volley''' is a [[Volleyball variations|variant of volleyball]] invented and played in [[Ecuador]]. Its official name is '''Ecuavoley''', however it can be informally be called '''ecuavolley''', '''ecuavoly''', '''ecuabol''', or simply '''boly'''.  Its popularity has also spread to [[Colombia|Colombians]], the United States, and Europe.

==History==
The beginning of this variant volleyball game is unclear. It is believed that some type of game similar to this already existed prior to European contact. &lt;ref&gt;http://tuecuavoley.com/ecuavoley-detalle-breve-historia.html&lt;/ref&gt; While it is adherent that [[Volleyball]] was invented in 1895, and the first world tournaments were held 1949, organized tournaments of Ecuavolley were held in 1958, suggesting it could not have spread throughout the world that quickly, which would mean that the national volley game was developed independently and had a [[convergent evolution]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://tuecuavoley.com/ecuavoley-detalle-breve-historia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ecuavoley tournaments in neighborhoods were held by different organization since 1944.

== Rules of the game ==
The setup of the game is similar to volleyball, with a few key differences:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.plazadeportiva.com.ec/frontEnd/images/objetos/Reglamentos%20Ecuavolley%20.docx {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526102558/https://www.plazadeportiva.com.ec/frontEnd/images/objetos/Reglamentos%20Ecuavolley%20.docx |date=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fedenaligas.org/dp/index.php/reglamentos/ecuavoley&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each team is made up of three players: the setter (Spanish: ''colocador''), the flyer (''volador''), and the server (''servidor'').
* The net is higher and tighter: 2.80 meters high and 60 centimeters wide.
* The court is made of cement and has the same dimensions: 18 meters long and 9 meters wide.
* The game is played with a ''mikasa ft-5'' soccer ball.
* Games consist of two sets of 15 points. If both teams agree, they can alternatively play two sets of 12 points with the option of a third tie-breaking set.
* The ball can be held each time it is received, as long as the holding lasts less than one second.

== Gameplay ==
The flyer plays behind the setter and server, and runs quickly from one side to another recovering balls. Usually the flyer recovers the ball for the server. The server sets the ball in the air so that the setter can pass the ball over the net. The setter places the ball on the opposite court in a strategic manner, in an attempt to deceive the other team of where it will land. The referee is called the judge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2137">The '''Korbut flip''' is a [[gymnastics]] skill performed on either of two different apparatuses. Both are extremely difficult and were first performed internationally by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[gymnast]] [[Olga Korbut]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1054998/Korbut-flip|title=Korbut flip|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skill used to be able to be performed on the [[uneven bars (gymnastics)|uneven bars]], where the gymnast, from a stand on the high bar, performs a back [[somersault|flip]] and regrasps the bar.&lt;ref name = "Wimp.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wimp.com/unevenbars/|title=Original Olympic Video|accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korbut performed the move at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], where it was the first backward release move performed on the uneven bars in international competition. In 1977, Soviet gymnast [[Elena Mukhina]] modified the flip by adding a full twist. The movement was later modified in the 1980s when it was performed towards the low bar; that is, the gymnast's flip takes place above the low bar. The [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] was later modified to make it illegal to stand on top of the bars. This move is considered highly dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Michael|title=The Korbut Flip: Dangerous move, now illegal|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/olympics-2012/korbut-flip-move-dangerous-today-olympic-gymnasts-aren-allowed-attempt-article-1.1134730|accessdate=15 September 2016|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skill is also performed on the [[balance beam]]. The move is performed from a standing position and is landed in a straddled position on the beam. This movement has been modified to include twists and piked or tucked legs and is performed in sequence with other movements.

{{New Zealand NBL Awards}}
The '''National Basketball League Most Valuable Player (MVP)''' is an annual [[National Basketball League (New Zealand)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) award given since the [[2003 New Zealand NBL season]] to the best performing player of the regular season. At the end of each season, the player with the most votes is awarded the Most Valuable Player for that season. Prior to the 2003 season, imports were deemed ineligible for receiving MVP honours, with the league instead awarding a [[New Zealand NBL Kiwi MVP Award|Kiwi MVP]] each season as a way of recognising the best performing New Zealander. However, since 2003, only five imports have managed to claim the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Bartercard NBL Handbook|work=Basketball.org.nz|url=http://www.basketball.org.nz/Portals/26/2015%20Bartercard%20National%20Basketball%20League%20Handbook.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015|page=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''North Arm Speedway''' was the first dedicated [[motorcycle speedway]] ever built in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] and was located in the [[industrial suburb]] of [[Gillman, South Australia|Gillman]]. It was run by the Speedway Riders' Association of South Australia and ran from 1981 until its forced closure in 1997.

==History==
===Early Years===
North Arm Speedway was South Australia's first dedicated senior Solo and Sidecar track. Previous tracks (other than the [[Adelaide Showgrounds|Wayville Showgrounds]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s which ran before car speedway became popular) in both Adelaide and around the state had generally catered to both bikes and cars.

The speedway was opened on Sunday 26 July 1981, by the Speedway Riders' Association on land owned by the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]]. Following the closure of [[Rowley Park Speedway]] in April 1979, the only [[Dirt track racing]] venue in Adelaide was the new [[Speedway City|Speedway Park]], which has a clay surface, something that suited the increasingly popular car racing, but not motorcycle speedway. Despite the bikes racing in the early years at Speedway Park, the nearest speedway to Adelaide which suited bike racing was some 80&amp;nbsp;km away at the [[Riverview Speedway]] in [[Murray Bridge]], which during the speedway season (generally October to April) only ran meetings every second Saturday night. With many of South Australia's riders based in Adelaide, the decision was made to build a motorcycle only venue in Adelaide with a [[Dolomite]] surface where weekly meetings could be run.

The track itself was approximately {{convert|280|m|yd|abbr=off}} in length, which while considered small by Australian track standards (when it was built, most Aussie speedways were usually 350-550m in length as most run cars as well as bikes with Speedway Park itself being {{convert|430|m|yd|abbr=off}} long), it was roughly the same length as most tracks in [[Speedway in the United Kingdom|Britain]] where most of the top riders rode professionally. The safety fence was a 2m high chain mesh fence on top of a 1&amp;nbsp;ft high wooden retaining fence. Lights were eventually installed for night meetings in 1985, although spectator capacity was only around 5,000 (more with extra seating for Australian Championship meetings).

Due to North Arm's relatively small spectator capacity, and its lack of lights for night racing, both the [[Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship|Australian Sidecar Championship]] and the [[Australian Individual Speedway Championship|Australian Solo Championship]] were awarded to Speedway Park with its capacity to comfortably hold over 10,000 spectators in both 1982 and 1983 respectively.

===Move to Friday Nights===
When it first opened North Arm Speedway held regular Sunday afternoon meetings so as not to compete with Speedway Park which ran Friday nights and had the bikes on the program, and also to avoid clashing with meetings at the Riverview Speedway. South Australian riders would regularly race three days per week at home, something most experienced when racing in the British Leagues during the Australian winter months.

After the 1984/85 season, bikes were off the program at Speedway Park following safety concerns after the death of rider Kevin O'Connell on 25 January 1985. O'Connell had been killed after he hit the speedway's concrete retaining wall which offered no protection to riders or passengers. With the bikes no longer competing at Speedway Park, lights were installed at North Arm in 1985 and the speedway began holding regular Friday night meetings from 1985/86 which lasted until the speedway's closure. During the winter of 1986 the pits at North Arm were also re-located. Originally they were outside the back straight but were moved to outside of the front straight behind the control tower (which also incorporated the announcers box). The old pits became car parking while Turn 3 for the solo's (Turn 2 for the sidecars) became known as the Old Pits Corner.

===Championships and International Meetings===
From 1983 until it closed in 1997 North Arm became the regular host of the [[South Australian Individual Speedway Championship|South Australian Solo]] and [[Sidecar speedway|Sidecar]] championships, hosting the Solo title 10 times. The only other tracks to host the SA Solo title during this period were the [[Westline Speedway]] in [[Whyalla]] (1986/87) and Riverview Speedway (1984/85, 1987/88, 1990/91).

North Arm hosted the [[1992 Australian Individual Speedway Championship|1992 Australian Solo Championship]], where a capacity crowd of over 6,000 fans saw [[Leigh Adams]] from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] win the first of a record 10 national championships (a temporary grandstand was erected on the outside of turn 1 for the expected attendance). Adams set a track record in the 2nd heat of the night with a time of 58.74 seconds for the 4 lap race. The record he broke had been set in Heat 1 of the championship by reigning South Aussie Champ [[Craig Hodgson]] who won in a time of 59.11 seconds. Leigh Adams won with 14 points from North Arm's own [[Shane Parker (speedway rider)|Shane Parker]] on 13 and [[Queensland]]'s [[Mark Carlson (speedway rider)|Mark Carlson]] third on 11 points. This meeting also saw the crash which almost ended the career of Australia's former World #3 from [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship|1990]], [[Todd Wiltshire]] who suffered a multiple back injuries and broken pelvis which force him to retire at age 23 though he did make a successful comeback in 1997. Wiltshire, battling with [[Jason Lyons]] for the lead going into the last turn of Heat 3, tried a pass on the outside and went down, sliding into the wooden safety fence which broke around a light pole (placed outside the fence) on impact in the old pit corner.

Unfortunately during its 16-year life span, North Arm was never awarded the right to host the Australian Sidecar Championship, although it did host some of Australia's richest Sidecar meetings.

North Arm Speedway's spectator capacity was pushed to the limit on a number of occasions including test Matches between [[Australia national speedway team|Australia]] with riders such as [[Phil Crump]], Todd Wiltshire, Leigh Adams and local riders Shane Parker, Scott Norman and [[Shane Bowes]] taking on visiting 'teams' such as a "Rest of the World" team in 1990 including [[Gary Havelock]] of [[England]], [[Mitch Shirra]] of [[New Zealand]], and [[Shawn Moran]] of the [[United States]] (while the injured [[Sam Ermolenko]] was guest commentator on the night). In 1991 Australia faced a powerful [[Sweden national speedway team|Swedish]] team led by [[1990 Individual Speedway World Championship|1990 World Champion]] [[Per Jonsson]], former dual [[Individual Ice Racing World Championship|Ice Racing World Champion]] Erik Stenlund, as well as 1990 World finalists [[Jimmy Nilsen]] and [[Henrik Gustafsson]] and [[1988 Individual Speedway Junior World Championship|1988 World Under-21 Champion]] [[Peter Nahlin]] (who was the Swedish reserve on the night). The Swede's also had in their riding lineup a young rider who was not only the reigning [[Speedway Swedish Individual Championship|Swedish Champion]], but the rider would go on equal [[Ivan Mauger]]'s six [[Speedway World Championship]]s, the great [[Tony Rickardsson]]. Both the 1990 and 1991 test matches attracted 4,000 and 4,800 fans respectively, well up on previous crowd figures for the speedway. It was the success of those two international meetings which led to the speedway being awarded the 1992 Australian Solo Championship.

The 1990/91 season also saw the first, and so far only tour of Australia by the official [[Russia national speedway team|USSR]] team, who while not facing Australia in a test, faced state teams and various other 'select' teams while on tour. They faced a South Australian Select team in their visit to North Arm on 28 December 1990 with the locals, strengthened by 'ring-ins' Dennis Löfqvist from [[Sweden]] and [[David Norris (speedway rider)|David Norris]] from [[England]] (resident North Arm international riders) defeating the Russians 53-37 in a match closer than the score suggests. Actual local riders Shane Bowes (team captain) and Shane Parker top scored for the 'SA' with 13 and 8 points respectively while [[Oleg Kurguskin]] with 11 and the late Rif Saitgareev  with 10 points top scored for the Russians.

During its lifetime North Arm was also the Australian base for various international riders racing in the Australian Speedway season with riders such as [[Shawn Moran]] ([[United States of America|USA]]), Vesa Ylinen of [[Finland]], Dennis Löfqvist from Sweden and David Norris from England all basing themselves in Adelaide. North Arm was also the Australian base for two future [[Speedway World Championship|Speedway World Champions]]. Twenty-year-old Gary Havelock from England (the [[1992 Individual Speedway World Championship|1992 World Champion]]) spent the 1987/88 Australian season based at North Arm, while [[2010 Speedway Grand Prix|2010 World Champion]] [[Tomasz Gollob]] from [[Poland]] (along with his brother [[Jacek Gollob|Jacek]] who made a number of appearances), made North Arm his Aussie home during 1994/95.

While North Arm had its fair share of accidents, sometimes resulting in serious injury, no competitor was ever killed at the speedway or later as the result of a crash.

==Closing==
Following the 1996/97 Australian Speedway season (generally run between October and April), North Arm Speedway was closed when the South Australian Government reclaimed the land that the speedway was located on. This left Adelaide without an operating motorcycle speedway for the first time since 1926 when racing was first held at the [[Adelaide Showgrounds|Wayville Showground]]. Most of North Arm's track surface was then moved less than 2&amp;nbsp;km away to the new [[Gillman Speedway]] to form the base of a {{convert|213|m|yd|abbr=off}} track that was used for daytime practice meetings until a larger {{convert|400|m|yd|abbr=off}} track was built for race meetings before the current {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=off}} track was opened in 2000.

Even though Friday night meetings at the track were held in summer, North Arm could actually be cold when the wind was blowing from the north or west (the track was located close to the marshlands and adjacent to the [[Port River]] and the [[Gulf St Vincent]]). The speedway also had spectator facilities which could be described average at best. Despite this, North Arm Speedway is fondly remembered by those who either rode there or were regular spectators.

==Present Day==
Today the site of North Arm Speedway shows nothing of its past as a speedway as industrial buildings now occupy the land. The last remnants of the speedway were removed in mid-2004 when what was left of the track itself was cleared and building starting in mid-2005. When looking on [[Google Earth]] at historic photos the start/finish line of the speedway was on the Grand Trunkway (road) side of the track, with the pit area located between the front straight and the road. Car parking for the speedway was in the area to the north of the track.

'''Panamá Viejo F.C.''' was a [[Panamanian]] [[association football|football]] team founded in 1978 and based in [[Panamá Viejo]], [[Panama]].  The club was a regular participant in  the [[ANAPROF]] (now [[Liga Panameña de Fútbol]]), and in their final season the ''Cangrejeros'' won the [[ANAPROF 2000-01|2000–01]] championship.  They succumbed to financial problems at the end of 2001.

==History==
Panamá Viejo was founded in 1978,&lt;ref name=critica/&gt; and become a frequent participant in the [[ANAPROF]].  During the [[ANAPROF 2000-01|2000–01]] season, they enjoyed their most memorable success, reaching the championship final for the very first time. There, they met [[Tauro F.C.]], the defending champions and aiming at their fourth championship in five years.  Panama Viejo, however, entered with one of their strongest teams ever.  Theirs was a lineup that featured [[Panama national football team|Panamanian internationals]] like tall striker [[Anel Canales]], winger [[Víctor Herrera Piggott|Víctor Herrera]], attacking midfielder [[Ricardo Phillips]], midfielder [[Blas Pérez]], young defensive midfielder [[Juan de Dios Pérez]], and keeper [[Óscar McFarlane]].  They were managed by [[Gary Stempel]].

The final match between Panamá Viejo and Tauro FC went down as one of the greatest finals in the history of [[ANAPROF]]. 
 Tauro scored first, but thanks to two Erick Martinez goals Panamá Viejo was able to go ahead 3-1.  Tauro rallied to equalize the tie at 3-3, but Rodney Ramos's extra time penalty won the match for Panamá Viejo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsiglo.com/deportes/malos-recuerdos/23452499 Malos recuerdos]&amp;nbsp;– El Siglo {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Panamá Viejo's only title.  The club was family owned, and when they were unable to find a sponsor for the ensuing season, the owners decided to seek a merger.  Ironically, they merged with Tauro FC.
Unfortunately for the ''Cangrejeros'', in 2001 they suffered financial problems and they were forced to merged with [[Tauro F.C.|Tauro]] whereby they ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=critica&gt;[http://www.critica.com.pa/cangrejeros-de-panama-viejo-gloria-del-futbol-286493 ‘Cangrejeros’ de Panamá Viejo: Gloria del fútbol]&amp;nbsp;– Crítica {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://impresa.prensa.com/deportes/Finalmente-Panama-Viejo-decidio-Tauro_0_587191282.html Finalmente Panamá Viejo se decidió por el Tauro]&amp;nbsp;– La Prensa {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''quarterback keeper''' or '''keeper''' in [[American football]] is a designed play in which the [[quarterback]] does not [[Forward pass|pass]] or [[Handoff (American football)|hand off]] the ball to another player and instead rushes forward with it in an effort to gain yardage. The play typically is run in instances where only a few yards are needed to gain a first down or [[touchdown]], due to the threat of injury to the quarterback and most quarterbacks' ineffectiveness at running the ball when compared with a [[running back]] or [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]. This play differs from a [[quarterback scramble]] in that a scramble is an improvised play, while the keeper is a designed running play.

The '''Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility''' is a public [[leisure centre]] that is located in the [[Ravenscraig]] area of [[Motherwell]], [[North Lanarkshire]], Scotland.

==History==

The sports facility first came to attention when plans were being drawn up to form a new town on the site of the former [[Ravenscraig steelworks]], which closed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6183713.stm |title=£1.2bn Ravenscraig project starts |work=[[BBC News]] |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sports facility project was given the go-ahead on November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/38461-new-sports-centre-to-be-built-at-ravenscraig/ |title=New sports centre to be built at Ravenscraig |work=[[STV (TV network)|STV Sport]] |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the new facility got underway in mid-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motherwelltimes.co.uk/sport/New-year-start-for-Ravenscraig.4802497.jp |title=New year start for Ravenscraig sports facility |work=Motherwell Times |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the project was at the centre of serious funding issues between different companies and councils, and thus delayed the beginning of construction by one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7352416.stm |title=Fears over Ravenscraig Commitment |work=BBC News |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has been fully completed and was opened to the public on 4 October 2010. Before opening, there was a 24-hour charity football event on 30 September 2010. On 16 February 2011, [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] Tom Curley officially opened the facility, and it was estimated that over 100,000 people had used the facility for the first five months in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12495604 |title=New Ravenscraig sports centre attracts 100,000 people |work=BBC News |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/229155-ravenscraig-centre-hosts-official-opening-ceremony/ |title=Ravenscraig centre hosts official opening ceremony |work=[[STV News]] |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

Some of the amenities that the facility includes are:

A mobile [[tennis court]] has been added for indoor and outdoor use, the first of its type in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://local.stv.tv/motherwell/sport/21058-boost-for-tennis-with-unique-pop-up-courts-at-ravenscraig/ |title=Boost for tennis with unique pop up courts at Ravenscraig |work=[[STV News]] |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==

The facility has, even before opening, received several positive commendations. One in particular was from the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish football team]] manager [[Craig Levein]], who said that the facility would benefit football and the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-11436406 |title=Levein backs new sports facility at Ravenscraig |work=BBC News |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Henry McLeish]] also admitted in part one of his report of [[Scottish football]] that facilities like Ravenscraig are important for the future of the national game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/8638920.stm |title=Major report demands changes to Scottish football |work=BBC Sport |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, former [[Commonwealth Games]] [[gold medalist]] [[Yvonne Murray]] says that the facility will benefit sport in Scotland, saying that it will boost the nations medal tally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-sport/2010/10/06/ravenscraig-will-boost-our-medal-tally-says-murray-76495-27406383/ |title=Ravenscraig will boost our medal tally, says Murray |work=[[Wishaw Press]] |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] praised the facility, admitting that it will deliver a real and lasting legacy for Scotland and North Lanarkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonadvertiser.co.uk/hamilton-lanarkshire-sport/other-sport/2011/06/09/first-minister-visits-ravenscraig-facility-51525-28845097/ |title=First Minister visits Ravenscraig facility |work=Hamilton Advertiser |date=9 June 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 October 2011, over a year after opening, it was revealed that the facility had attracted over 500,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2011/10/12/ravenscraig-sports-centre-celebrates-500-000-visitors-in-first-year-76495-29576086/ |title=Ravenscraig sports centre celebrates 500,000 visitors in first year |work=Wishaw Press |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 27 June 2012, the visitor count had past the million mark.&lt;ref name="Facility Success"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://local.stv.tv/motherwell/news/108020-making-steps-towards-a-bright-new-future-for-ravenscraig/ |title=Making steps towards a bright new future for Ravenscraig |work=STV News |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major events==

The facility is being strongly considered as a training facility for the [[2012 Olympics]] in [[London]] and the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/10/30121839 |title=£29m for Ravenscraig sports complex |work=Scotland.gov.uk |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravenscraig regional facility was also the main facility for the 2011 [[International Children's Games]] that took place in [[Lanarkshire]], hosting the [[badminton]] and the [[athletics events]]. The facility has also been host to several major sporting events, such as the British Lightweight Boxing Title Fight and the [[2011 Premier League Snooker|Premier League Snooker tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motherwelltimes.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ravenscraig_goes_potty_for_snooker_1_1831361 |title=Ravenscraig goes potty for snooker |work=Motherwell Times |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several other events involving big names in British Sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://local.stv.tv/motherwell/news/27495-television-programme-recorded-at-ravenscraig/ |title=Television programme recorded at Ravenscraig |work=STV Sport |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stadium Mackay''', currently known as its [[Naming rights|sponsored name]] '''BB Print Stadium Mackay''', is a rectangular [[football]] stadium situated in [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The stadium is home to the Intrust Super Cup's Absolute Enterprises's [[Mackay Cutters]] and [[Queensland State League (association football)|Queensland State League]]'s [[Whitsunday Miners FC|Whitsunday Miners]].

The 2016 to 2020 naming rights deal is the first time a local business has been given naming rights to the stadium and was one of the deciding factors by Mackay Regional Council and CAS Ltd (the board overseeing BB Print Stadium Mackay). BB Print Stadium Mackay was previously known as Virgin Stadium Australia.

==Stadium==
The 12,200 capacity stadium was funded by the [[Australian Government]] at a cost of 11.3 million and opened on 20 August 2011 at a [[Mackay Cutters]] home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Tom|title=It's game on for Miners|url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/08/02/its-game-on-stadium-gates-to-open-early-for-miners/|accessdate=2 August 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium consists of a western grandstand that can accommodate 2,000 people including 10 corporate boxes, 6 corporate suites and broadcast box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bastable|first=Kate|title=Countdown is on for kickoff|url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/06/08/countdown-is-on-for-kickoff/|accessdate=8 June 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.5 million of the total 11.3 million cost of the stadium was spent on installing lighting that is of [[National Rugby League|NRL]] and television standard so that the stadium could possible host regular season [[National Rugby League|NRL]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newborn|first=Jamie|title=Light towers go up at stadium|url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/04/19/light-towers-go-up-at-stadium-mackay/|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2016 it was announced that the grounds would be renamed to BB Print Stadium Mackay after BB Print purchased the naming rights to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virgin sponsors Stadium Mackay|url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2011/08/18/virgin-sponsors-stadium-mackay/|accessdate=18 August 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday 24 June 2012, BB Print Stadium Mackay hosted its first NRL game when the 2nd placed [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] played a 'home' game at the venue against the ladder leading [[Melbourne Storm]] in Round 16 of the [[2012 NRL season]], the NRL's '''Women in League Round'''. In front of a ground record crowd of 11,876 the Bulldogs defeated the Storm 20-4 with Mackay product [[Ben Barba]] setting up one of the tries of the season for Bulldogs team mate [[Josh Morris (rugby league)|Josh Morris]]. Barba fielded a Storm kick only one metre from the dead ball line, then evaded his opposition and ran 70 metres down field before centre kicking for Morris to score next to the posts for what was a 109-metre try.

The stadium hosted its second NRL game on 7 July 2013 when the Bulldogs hosted the [[Newcastle Knights]] in Round 17 of the [[2013 NRL season]].

The stadium hosted a pre-season match between [[A-League]] clubs [[Brisbane Roar]] and [[Sydney FC]] on 16 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brisbane to roar into our stadium|url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/story/2012/08/01/brisbane-to-roar-into-our-stadium-soccer-football/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=The Daily Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 15th of September 2018 BB Print Stadium hosted professional Rugby Union when [[Queensland Country]] defeated [[Fijian Drua]] 52-22 in a [[National Rugby Championship]] match in front of 1200 fans. 

BB Print Stadium Mackay is home to the Intrust Super Cup's Absolute Enterprises Mackay Cutters and has also hosted; NRL games, the internationally televised Professional Bull Riders (PBR) events, Nitro Circus and Monster Trucks along with the highly successful Kiss concert.

[[File:Glitter Super Ball.jpg|thumb|A Super Ball containing particles of glitter, resting on a base. The transparent rubber has yellowed with age.]]

A '''Super Ball''' (a.k.a. '''SuperBall''') is a [[toy]] [[bouncing ball]] based on a type of [[synthetic rubber]] invented in 1964 by chemist [[Norman Stingley]].  It is an extremely [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[ball]] made of [[Zectron]]&lt;ref name="afads" /&gt; which contains the [[synthetic polymer]] [[polybutadiene]] as well as [[hydrated silica]], [[zinc oxide]], [[stearic acid]], and other ingredients.&lt;ref name="sci&amp;golf"/&gt;  This compound is  [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] with [[sulfur]] at a temperature of {{val|165|ul=degC}} and formed at a pressure of {{val|3500|ul=psi}}. The resulting Super Ball has a very high [[coefficient of restitution]],&lt;ref name="cross1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacInnes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="basics of phys"/&gt; and dropped from shoulder level, a Super Ball bounces nearly all the way back; thrown down by an average adult, it can leap over a three-story building.

Toys similar to Super Balls are more generally known as [[bouncy ball]]s, a term that covers other balls by different manufacturers with different formulations.

==History==
[[File:Black Super Ball.jpg|thumb|left|A branded Wham-O Super Ball from 2001]]
Stingley sought uses for his [[Polybutadiene]] synthetic rubber, as well as someone to manufacture it. He first offered his invention to the Bettis Rubber Company, for whom he worked at the time,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/superball.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but they turned it down because the material was not very durable.&lt;ref&gt;Wham-O Super Book Celebrating 60 Years Inside the Fun Factory  By Tim Walsh {{ISBN|978-0-8118-6445-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Stingley took it to toy company [[Wham-O]]; they worked on developing a more durable version which they still manufacture today.&lt;ref name="toys-amaz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg-toy story"/&gt;

"It took us nearly two years to iron the kinks out of Super Ball before we produced it," said [[Richard Knerr]], President of Wham-O in 1966.&lt;ref name="pop sci-invent" /&gt; "It always had that marvelous springiness…. But it had a tendency to fly apart. We've licked that with a very high-pressure technique for forming it. Now we're selling millions." &lt;ref name="pop sci-invent" /&gt;

Super Ball became a [[fad]] when it was introduced.&lt;ref name="kallen-ae"/&gt; Peak production reached over 170,000 Super Balls per day.&lt;ref name="rielly-60s"/&gt; By December 1965, over six million had been sold, and U.S. Presidential adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]] had five dozen shipped to the [[White House]] for the amusement of the staff.&lt;ref name="afads"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rielly-60s" /&gt;&lt;ref name="life-boom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="f&amp;mf"/&gt; Wham-O Executive Vice-president Richard P. Knerr knew that fads are short-lived. "Each Super Ball bounce is 92% as high as the last," he once said. "If our sales don't come down any faster than that, we've got it made."&lt;ref name="f&amp;mf" /&gt; Initially, the full-sized Super Ball sold for 98¢ at retail; by the end of 1966, its colorful miniature versions sold for as little as 10¢ in vending machines.&lt;ref name="bb-calif happy"/&gt;
 
In the late 1960s, Wham-O made a giant Super Ball roughly the size of a bowling ball as a promotional stunt.&lt;ref name="toys-amaz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg-toy story"/&gt; It fell from the 23rd story window (some reports say the roof) of an Australian hotel and destroyed a parked convertible car on the second bounce.&lt;ref name="toys-amaz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bg-toy story"/&gt;

Composer [[Alcides Lanza]] purchased several Super Balls in 1965 as toys for his son, but soon he started experimenting with the sounds that they made when rubbed along the strings of a piano.&lt;ref name="lanza1" /&gt; This resulted in his composition ''Plectros III'' (1971), in which he specifies that the performer should use a pair of Super Balls on sticks as mallets with which to strike and rub the strings and case of a piano.&lt;ref name="lanza1"/&gt;

[[Lamar Hunt]], founder of the [[American Football League]], watched his children playing with a Super Ball and then coined the term [[Super Bowl]]. He wrote a letter to NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] dated July 25, 1966: "I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon." The leagues' owners decided on the name "AFL-NFL Championship Game," but the media immediately picked up on Hunt's "Super Bowl" name, which became official beginning with the third annual game.&lt;ref name="toys-amaz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacCambridge, Michael. ''America's Game''. New York: Random House, 2004, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huppke-lotb"/&gt;

==Physical properties==
According to one study "If a pen is stuck in a hard rubber ball and dropped from a certain height, the pen may bounce to several times that height."&lt;ref name="harter1"/&gt; If a Super Ball is dropped without spin onto a hard surface, with a small ball bearing on top of the Super Ball, the bearing rebounds to a great height.&lt;ref name="browne"/&gt;

High school physics teachers use Super Balls to educate students on usual and unusual models of impacts.&lt;ref name="nonsmooth"/&gt;

The "rough" nature of a Super Ball makes its impact characteristics different from otherwise similar smooth balls.&lt;ref name="Garwin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dynsb"/&gt; The resulting behavior is quite complex.&lt;ref name="dynsb"/&gt; The Super Ball has been used as an illustration of the principle of [[T-symmetry|Time Reversal Invariance]].&lt;ref name="Crawford1"/&gt;

A Super Ball is observed to reverse the direction of spin on each bounce.&lt;ref name="bridges1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aston1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cup-im"/&gt; This effect depends on the tangential compliance and frictional effect in the collision.  It cannot be explained by rigid body impact theory, and would not occur were the ball perfectly rigid.&lt;ref name="cup-im" /&gt; Tangential compliance is the degree to which one body clings to rather than slips over another at the point of impact.&lt;ref name="cup-im2"/&gt;

Part of the fun of a super ball is a result of the high friction between the rubber of the ball and the surface it bounces against. This friction places moments on the ball that cause it to spin after bouncing. The exchange of energy between rotational and translational forms that occurs at each collision makes the super ball’s behavior difficult to predict.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine was established in 1922 and has named a '''Fighter of the Year''' since 1928, which this list covers. The award, selected by the magazine editors, is based on a boxer's performance in the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/182653-past-winners-of-the-ring-year-end-awards|title=Past winners of THE RING year-end awards|date=December 19, 2013|work=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]|accessdate=June 23, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116162409/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/182653-past-winners-of-the-ring-year-end-awards|archivedate=January 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War Memorial Stadium''' (nicknamed '''The Rockpile''') was an outdoor [[stadium]] in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] United States in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It hosted [[Minor League Baseball]] and professional [[American football|football]] teams, most notably the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), and later [[National Football League]] (NFL).

The stadium was on a rectangular block near the downtown area and its baseball diamond had an unorthodox southeast alignment (home plate to center field).&lt;ref name=hsaerl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historicaerials.com/?layer=0&amp;zoom=11&amp;lat=42.906&amp;lon=-78.857 |publisher=Historic Aerials |title=42.906 N, 78.857 W |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main entrance was in the left field corner at Jefferson Avenue to the east and Best Street to the south (behind right field). Its other boundaries were Dodge Street to the north (behind third base) and Masten Park to the west (behind first base) with Masten Avenue farther west. The east-west alignment of the football field was also unorthodox, running along the third base line. The [[elevation]] at street level is approximately {{convert|650|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

War Memorial Stadium was built as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project in 1937. It was originally named '''Roesch Memorial Stadium''', though the name was changed to '''[[Grover Cleveland]] Stadium''' later in 1937 (honoring the former President and Buffalo public official) and then to '''Civic Stadium''' in 1938. The name was changed to '''War Memorial Stadium''' in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2006/civic_stadium/civic_stadium.htm Western New York Heritage Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium originally sat 35,000, but expansions raised the capacity to over 46,500. Despite this, by the time of the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in [[1970 Buffalo Bills season|1970]], it was one of the league's smallest stadiums (below the league's new 50,000-seat minimum). After considering&lt;ref name=bbnmts&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cOVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5-ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1870%2C2203803 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |title=Buffalo Bills nearing move to Seattle |date=January 12, 1971 |page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejecting a move to [[Seattle]], the Bills left after the [[1972 Buffalo Bills season|1972]] season for Rich Stadium (now [[New Era Field]]) in suburban [[Orchard Park, New York|Orchard Park]], which had a capacity of over 80,000 in [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|1973]].

==History==

===Professional tenants===
The stadium hosted the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[American Football League]], and later the [[National Football League]] from {{nowrap|[[1960 Buffalo Bills season|1960]] to [[1972 Buffalo Bills season|1972]],}} the unrelated [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]] of the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] from {{nowrap|1946 to 1949}}  ("Bisons" in 1946), the [[Buffalo Indians]] and [[Buffalo Indians|Chiefs]] of the [[AFL III|third American Football League]] in 1940 and 1941, [[Canisius Golden Griffins|Canisius College]]'s [[Canisius Golden Griffins baseball|baseball]] and [[Canisius Golden Griffins football|football teams]], and baseball's [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[International League]] during the 1960s and again from 1979 to 1987 (as part of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] and [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]).

===Postseason games hosted===
The stadium hosted three postseason professional football games, all in the [[American Football League]].

*[[1963 American Football League playoffs|1963 AFL Eastern Division playoff]]: [[1963 Boston Patriots season|Boston Patriots]] 26, [[1963 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 8 on December 28, 1963
*[[1964 American Football League Championship Game|1964 AFL Championship Game]]: [[1964 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 20, [[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 7 on December 26, 1964
*[[1966 American Football League Championship Game|1966 AFL Championship Game]]: [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 31, [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 7 on January 1, 1967

===Final years===
In its later years, War Memorial Stadium was poorly maintained. [[Ron Fimrite]], writing in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1984&lt;!--(May 7, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;100)--&gt;, quoted another writer, [[Brock Yates]], as having once said this stadium "looks as if whatever war it was a memorial to had been fought within its confines."&lt;ref name=fonfimnat&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/07/626594/a-star-with-real-clout# |magazine=Sports Illustrated |last=Fimrite |authorlink=Ron Fimrite |first=Ron |title=A Star with Real Clout |date=May 7, 1984 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; That look contributed to the oft-used nickname Buffalo residents gave it: ''The Rockpile''. Ironically, that worn-down look worked perfectly for the [[1984 in film|1984]] film ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'', about which Fimrite was writing. All of the baseball scenes in that movie were filmed here in 1983,&lt;ref name=nbnyk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JXhGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xSwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1435%2C1816180 |newspaper=Evening News |location=Newburgh, New York |agency=Associated Press |title=Redford movie being filmed in Buffalo |date=June 16, 1983 |page=8B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spims&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2LdaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=glkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4535%2C992417 |newspaper=St. Petersburg Independent |location=Florida |last=Mulcahy |first=Susan |title=Buffalo wins out for Redford flick |date=July 20, 1983 |page=18B }}&lt;/ref&gt; except for the one scene set at [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]], which was filmed at Buffalo's [[All-High Stadium]]. The movie was set in the late 1930s, when the stadium was new.

The stadium was deemed unsuitable for [[National Football League]] play after the [[AFL–NFL merger]].  As part of a deal with Congress clearing the way for the merger, the NFL declared stadiums seating fewer than 50,000 people were not suitable for league needs. War Memorial Stadium only seated 46,500 people at its height, and could not be expanded. This led to the Bills constructing what was then called Rich Stadium (now called [[New Era Field]]) in suburban [[Orchard Park, New York|Orchard Park]] and vacating War Memorial Stadium after the [[1972 Buffalo Bills season|1972]] season.

After the Bills' departure, the stadium sat dormant from 1973 to 1978. The last tenant of War Memorial Stadium was the [[Buffalo Bisons]], a franchise revived in 1979 before moving to a new downtown stadium, known as [[Sahlen Field|Pilot Field]], in [[1988 in sports|1988]]. The last major event at War Memorial Stadium was a Bisons game against the [[Nashville Sounds]] (the Sounds won, 7–5) on August 30, 1987; the game drew a capacity crowd of nearly 40,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Mike (August 30, 2012). [http://blogs.buffalonews.com/insidepitch/2012/08/bisons-rockpile-finale.html Bisons' Rockpile finale was 25 years ago today]. ''The Buffalo News''. Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Following after the game was a slowpitch softball match between members of the Buffalo media. Doug Smith, a freelance newspaper columnist and [[WIVB-TV]] personality, led the winning team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/20/doug-smith-81-colorful-newsman-sportswriter-tv-personality/ Doug Smith, 81, colorful newsman, sportswriter and TV personality]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Johnnie B. Wiley Amateur Athletic Sports Pavilion==
[[Image:War Memorial Stadium Rockpile field.JPG|thumb|210px|Baseball diamond and football field]]
War Memorial Stadium was demolished shortly after the Bisons moved downtown to [[Sahlen Field|Pilot Field]]. A high school athletic field (Johnnie B. Wiley Amateur Athletic Sports Pavilion – c. 1997) remains at the old site and serves as one of Buffalo's three major high school football fields (the others being [[All-High Stadium]] and the field at [[Riverside Institute of Technology]]); the field also was the home of the Buffalo Gladiators, an adult amateur football team.

The northwest and southwest entrance to the old stadium was demolished, but the northeast and southeast entrance was saved and preserved. A small baseball diamond is on the former field's southwest corner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">The '''World Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation''' ('''WDFPF''') is an international powerlifting federation with 22 member countries. Specifically as a drug-free alternative international platform – in order to provide fair competition world-wide for those powerlifters who wish to train and compete without performance-enhancing drugs. This remains as important today as it was when the Federation came into being. In pursuit of this objective the '''WDFPF''' has adopted the most rigorous drug control procedures in the world. That same rigor is demanded of all those national organizations affiliated to the '''WDFPF''', as a pre-condition of their registration with the world body. It is the only international organization which makes such demands of its members, and this is the true measure of their dedication to the drug-free principle. The '''WDFPF''' was founded in 1988, its current president is Wim Backelant.

"The '''WDFPF''' offers both '''equipped''' and '''unequipped''' lifting. In the equipped division single ply bench shirts are allowed in polyester or denim. Canvas and open backed shirts are not allowed. Single ply lifting suits are allowed in polyester. Canvas and denim are not allowed. Briefs are not legal. Knee wraps are fine up to 2m".

'''[[Powerlifting]]''' '''-''' is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: [[Squat (exercise)|squat]], [[bench press]], and [[deadlift]].

'''Equipped Competing -''' equipped lifters compete separately from raw lifters. Equipped lifters will wear a squat suit, knee wraps, a bench shirt, and a deadlift suit. These four things are the things that separate equipped lifters and raw lifters.

'''Unequipped Competing or "RAW"-''' maintains strict guidelines regarding tools and accessories competitors may use during competition. The only equipment that is allowed in raw meets are wrist wraps, knee sleeves, and a weightlifting belt.

The '''World Police and Fire Games''' (WPFG) is a biennial athletic event, open to active and retired law enforcement and fire service personnel throughout the world. The WPFG Federation is an arm of the California Police Athletic Federation (CPAF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Police &amp; Fire Games At A Glance|url=http://www.cpaf.org/wpfg|publisher=CPAF|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American non-profit organization.

The Games attract approximately 10,000 entrants, slightly fewer than the Summer [[Olympic Games]], and exceeding the third position holder, the [[Commonwealth Games]]. In the early 2010s, [[The United Kingdom]] hosted all three events consecutively; the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], [[England]], followed by the 2013 World Police and Fire Games in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], and ending with [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], hosting the 2014 [[Commonwealth Games]] - the first time all three events have been hosted by the same nation consecutively.

The host city of the 2015 World Police and Fire Game was [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], in the United States, with venues located around the [[Washington metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Police &amp; Fire Games, Fairfax 2015|url=http://fairfax2015.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pier 95 Irene France WPFG jeh.jpg|thumb|French team in New York on a day [[Hurricane Irene|a hurricane]] cancelled competition in 2011]]
The California Police Olympics were first held in 1967. The concept evolved over the years and led to the creation of the World Police &amp; Fire Games Federation—a non-profit organization, run by the Californian Police Athletics Federation—in 1983. Two years later, in 1985, the first World Police &amp; Fire Games were held in [[San Jose, California]], USA, with nearly 5,000 competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2011wpfg.org/WPFGHistory/tabid/56/Default.aspx History of the World Police &amp; Fire Games]. 2011 World Police &amp; Fire Games. Retrieved 2011-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest WPFG games to date was held in New York, New York, USA with over 16,000 athletes in attendance, from 59 nations.&lt;ref name=2015Fairfax/&gt;

The most successful and best organised was in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23589848 BBC News - In pictures: World Police and Fire Games 2013]. Bbc.co.uk (2013-08-08). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It was described, by the President of the World Police and Fire Games Federation, Mike Graham, as "the friendliest and best Games ever".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23649271 BBC News - WPFG 'best and friendliest ever', says president of games].

The Montreal Firefighters Association has called for a boycott of the 2017 Games, which are to be held in their own city, in protest against forced changes to their collective agreements and pension funds by the City of Montreal and the Quebec provincial government. Labor unions representing over 100,000 firefighters and civil servants have joined Montreal's firefighters in this boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/firefighters-boycotting-2017-world-firefighters-games-in-montreal-1.3149582 | title=Firefighters boycotting 2017 World Firefighters Games in Montreal | publisher=CBC News | work=Kate McKenna | date=15 July 2015 | accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wpfg2017.com/ | title=Montreal World Police and Fire Games Boycott | publisher=Montreal World Police and Fire Games | accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
