There were 82 arrests.

==Background==

[[Brixton]] in [[South London]] was an area with serious social and economic problems.{{sfn|Brain|2010|p=65}} The whole United Kingdom was affected by a [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] by 1981, but the local [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean community]] was suffering particularly high unemployment, poor housing, and a higher than average crime rate.{{sfn|Kettle|Hodges|1982|pages=100-101}}

In the preceding months there had been growing unease between the police and the inhabitants of Lambeth.&lt;ref name="hibbert" /&gt; On 18 January 1981 a number of black youths died in a [[New Cross house fire|fire]] during a [[house party]] in [[New Cross]]. Although authorities have claimed it may have been accidental and that the fire started from inside the house, it was widely suspected to have been a racially motivated arson attack by someone outside the property, and the police investigation was criticised as inadequate for not exploring that possibility.  Black activists, including [[Darcus Howe]], organised a march for the "Black People's Day of Action" on 2 March.&lt;ref name=Cornish-18-Feb-2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Cornish|first=Winsome-Grace|title=Honouring talent: The Black People's Day of Action|url=http://www.obv.org.uk/node/3873|work=Operation Black Vote: News,18 Feb 2011|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of turnout vary from 5,000&lt;ref name=Anim-Addo-1995&gt;{{cite book|last=Anim-Addo|first=Joan|authorlink=Joan Anim-Addo|title=Longest Journey: A History of Black Lewisham|year=1995|publisher=Deptford Forum Publishing Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-898536-21-5|pages=137|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Longest-Journey-History-Black-Lewisham/dp/189853621X| accessdate= 3 November 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to 20,000&lt;ref name=Szymanski-08-2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Szymanski|first=Jesse|title=Darcus Howe, the British Black Panther|url=https://www.vice.com/read/darcus-howe-the-british-black-panther|work=Vice Beta, Stuff, August 2011|publisher=Vice Media, Inc.|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 25,000.&lt;ref name=Bowman-August-15th-2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowman|first=Andy|title=A violent eruption of protest’: Reflections on the 1981 Moss Side ‘riots’ (part one)|url=http://manchestermule.com/article/%E2%80%98a-violent-eruption-of-protest%E2%80%99-reflections-on-the-1981-moss-side-%E2%80%98riots%E2%80%99-part-one|work=Manchester Mule, Monday, 15 August 2011|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marchers walked 17 miles from [[Deptford]] to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], passing the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Fleet Street]].&lt;ref name=Szymanski-08-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Back-2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Back|first=Les|title=Written in Stone: Black British Writing and Goldsmiths College|year=2007|publisher=Goldsmiths University of London|location=London|pages=7|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/back_booklet.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214110855/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/back_booklet.pdf|archive-date=14 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of the march finished in Hyde Park without incident, there was some confrontation with police at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]].  [[Les Back]] wrote that "While the local press reported the march respectfully, the national papers unloaded the full weight of racial stereotyping."&lt;ref name="hibbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Back-2007/&gt; ''[[The Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s front-page headline was a photo of a policeman with a bloody face next to a quote from Darcus Howe referring to the march as "A good day".  A few weeks later, some of the organizers of the march were arrested, charged with the offence of ''[[Riot#England and Wales|Riot]]''. They were later acquitted.&lt;ref name=Szymanski-08-2011/&gt;

In 1980 the number of crimes recorded in the Lambeth Borough was 30,805. The Brixton Division was responsible for 10,626 of those crimes.  Between 1976 and 1980 Brixton accounted for 35% of all crimes in the Borough, but 49% of all robbery and violent theft offences.  The police recognised that there was a problem and that they needed a solution to a growing crime trend.  Robbery and violent crime was on the increase.  At the beginning of April, the Metropolitan Police began ''Operation Swamp 81'', a [[Undercover#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] operation to reduce crime and uniformed patrols were increased in the area.  Officers from other Metropolitan police districts and the [[Special Patrol Group]] were dispatched into Brixton, and within five days, 943 people were stopped and searched, and 82 arrested, through the heavy use of what was colloquially known as the "[[Sus law]]."&lt;ref name=met /&gt; This referred to powers under the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]], which allowed police to search and arrest members of the public when it was believed that they were acting suspiciously, and not necessarily committing a crime.  The African-Caribbean community claimed that the police were disproportionately using these powers against black people.{{sfn|Kettle|Hodges|1982|pages=91-93}}

==10–11 April==
Public disfavour came to a head on Friday 10 April. At around 5:15{{nbsp}}pm a [[police constable]] spotted a black youth named Michael Bailey running towards him, apparently away from three other black youths. Bailey was stopped and found to be badly bleeding, but broke away from the constable. Stopped again on Atlantic Road, Bailey was found to have a four-inch stab wound.&lt;ref name="waddington" /&gt; Bailey ran into a flat and was helped by a family and the police constable there by putting kitchen roll on his wound. A crowd gathered and, as the police then tried to take the wounded boy to a waiting minicab on [[Railton Road]], the crowd tried to intervene thinking the police did not appear to be providing or seeking the medical help Bailey needed quickly enough. As the minicab pulled away at speed a police car arrived and stopped the cab. When an officer from the police car realised Bailey was injured he moved him into the back of the police car to take him to hospital more quickly, and bound his wound more tightly to stop the bleeding. A group of 50 youths began to shout for Bailey's release thinking the police were arresting him. "Look, they’re killing him," claimed one. The crowd descended on the police car and pulled him out although the officers were trying to take him to hospital. The youths dispatched him to hospital and told officers: "Let us look after our own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1377495/Heroes-anarchists-The-1981-Brixton-riots-hailed-Left-heroic-uprising-The-truth-different.html|title=Heroes or anarchists? The 1981 Brixton riots are now being hailed by the Left as a heroic uprising. The truth is rather different|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumours spread that a youth had been left to die by the police, or that the police looked on as the stabbed youth was lying on the street. Over 200 youths, black and white with predominantly Afro-Caribbean heritage reportedly turned on the police. In response the police decided to increase the number of police foot patrols in Railton Road, despite the tensions, and carry on with ''Operation Swamp 81'' throughout the night and into the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW6kY6HfAqk&amp;NR=1|title=Battle 4 Brixton pt2 of 6|first=|last=theicha|date=10 April 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==11–12 April==

It was believed by the local community that the stabbed youth died as a result of police brutality, fuelling tensions throughout the day as crowds slowly gathered. Tensions first erupted around 4{{nbsp}}pm, as two police officers stopped and searched a mini cab in Railton Road. By this time Brixton Road (Brixton High Street) was reportedly{{By whom|date=May 2010}} filled with angry people and police cars were pelted with bricks. At around 5{{nbsp}}pm the tension escalated and spread, and the 9{{nbsp}}pm [[BBC News]] bulletin that evening reported 46 police officers injured, five seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CH5RLEZhXs&amp;feature=related |title=Battle 4 Brixton pt3 of 6 |publisher=YouTube |date=13 April 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shops were looted on Railton Road, [[Mayall Road]], [[Leeson Road]], [[Acre Lane]] and [[Brixton Road]]. The looting in Brixton reportedly started at around 6{{nbsp}}pm. At 6.15{{nbsp}}pm the fire brigade received their first call, as a police van was set on fire by rioters in Railton Road, with the fire brigade being warned "riot in progress". As the fire brigade approached the police cordon, they were waved through without warning, driving down Railton Road towards 300 youths armed with bottles and bricks. The fire brigade met the crowd at the junction between Railton Road and Shakespeare Road and were attacked with stones and bottles.

The police put out emergency calls to police officers across London, asking for assistance. They had no strategy,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and only had inadequate helmets and non-fireproof plastic shields to protect themselves with while clearing the streets of rioters. The police reportedly{{By whom|date=May 2010}} also had difficulties in radio communication. The police proceeded in clearing the Atlantic-Railton-Mayall area by pushing the rioters down the road, forming deep shield walls. The rioters responded with bricks, bottles, and [[Molotov cocktail|petrol bombs]].

At 5.30{{nbsp}}pm the violence further escalated. Non-rioting members of the public attempted to mediate between the police and the rioters, calling for a de-escalation by withdrawing police out of the area. The destructive efforts of the rioters peaked at around 8{{nbsp}}pm, as those attempts at mediation failed. Two [[pubs]], 26 businesses, schools and other structures were set alight as rioters went on a rampage. Hundreds of local residents were trapped in their houses, locked in by either police or rioters.

By 9.30{{nbsp}}pm, over 1,000 police were dispatched into Brixton, squeezing out the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa9r25f1yWY&amp;feature=related |title=Battle 4 Brixton pt5 of 6 |publisher=YouTube |date=19 April 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1{{nbsp}}am on 12 April 1981, the area was largely subdued, with no large groups – except the police – on the streets. The [[London Fire Brigade|fire brigade]] refused to return until the following morning. Police numbers grew to over 2,500, and by the early hours of Sunday morning the rioting had fizzled out.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Aftermath==
During the disturbances, 299 police were injured, along with at least 65 members of the public. 61 private vehicles and 56 police vehicles were destroyed. 28 premises were burned and another 117 damaged and looted. 82 arrests were made.&lt;ref name=met /&gt;

Between 3 and 11 July of that year, there was more unrest fuelled by racial and social discord, at [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] in Birmingham, [[Southall]] in London, [[Toxteth riots|Toxteth]] in Liverpool, [[Hyson Green]] in [[Nottingham]] and [[Moss Side]] in Manchester. There were also smaller pockets of unrest in [[Leeds]], [[Leicester]], [[Southampton]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Bedford]], [[Gloucester]], [[Wolverhampton]], [[Coventry]], [[Bristol]], and [[Edinburgh]]. Racial tension played a major part in most of these disturbances, although all of the riots took place in areas hit particularly hard by unemployment and recession.

===Scarman Report===
{{Main|Scarman report}}
The Home Secretary, [[William Whitelaw]], commissioned a public inquiry into the riot headed by [[Leslie Scarman|Lord Scarman]]. The [[Scarman report]] was published by Susana De Freitas on 25 November 1981.

Scarman found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of 'stop and search' powers by the police against black people. As a consequence, a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the ''[[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]''; and the act also created an independent [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]], established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police.&lt;ref name=untold&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/U/untold/programs/riot/timeline.html ''1981 riots timeline''] ''Untold History'' (Channel Four Television) accessed 6 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Scarman concluded that "complex political, social and economic factors [created a] disposition towards violent protest".&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3631579.stm ''Q&amp;A: The Scarman Report''], 27 April 2004 (BBC News) accessed 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 Macpherson Report, an investigation into the murder of [[Stephen Lawrence]] and the failure of the police to establish sufficient evidence for the prosecution of the charged suspects, found that recommendations of the 1981 [[Scarman Report]] had been ignored. The report concluded that the police force was "[[Institutional racism|institutionally racist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 May 2004| title = Q&amp;A: Stephen Lawrence murder|publisher=BBC News| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3685733.stm| accessdate =4 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080209011159/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3685733.stm| archivedate= 9 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report, which did not cover the events of the Brixton Riots, disagreed with the conclusions made by Scarman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Q&amp;A: The Scarman Report|publisher=BBC News| date = 27 April 2004| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/bbc_parliament/3631579.stm| accessdate =28 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2011, BBC Radio 4 broadcast reminiscences of participants including police and black Brixton residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =
https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zl4dq/The_Reunion_Brixton_Riots/ | title=The Reunion: Brixton Riots | accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other rioting===
On 13 April, [[Margaret Thatcher]] dismissed the notion that unemployment and racism lay beneath the Brixton disturbances claiming  "Nothing, but nothing, justifies what happened" – although figures showed high unemployment amongst Brixton's black population. Overall unemployment in Brixton stood at 13 percent, with 25.4 percent for ethnic minorities. Unemployment among black youths was estimated at 55 percent. Rejecting increased investment in Britain's inner cities, Thatcher added, "Money cannot buy either trust or racial harmony." [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] leader, [[Ted Knight (politician)|Ted Knight]], complained that the police presence "amounted to an army of occupation" that provoked the riots; Thatcher responded, "What absolute nonsense and what an appalling remark ... No one should condone violence. No one should condone the events ... They were criminal, criminal."

Small-scale disturbances continued to simmer throughout the summer. After  four nights of rioting in [[Liverpool]] during the [[Toxteth riots]], beginning 4 July, there were 150 buildings burnt and 781 police officers injured. [[CS gas]] was deployed for the first time on the British mainland to quell the rioting. On 10 July, there was fresh rioting in Brixton. It was not until the end of July that the disturbances began to subside.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

The recommendations of the Scarman Report to tackle the problems of racial disadvantage and inner-city decline were not implemented&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A/&gt; and rioting would break out again in the [[1985 Brixton riot|1985]] and [[1995 Brixton riot|1995]] Brixton riots.

'''Anne Morelli''' (born in 1948, also known as Anne Mettewie-Morelli) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] historian of [[Italy|Italian]] origins, specialized in the history of religions and minorities. She is currently assistant director of the Interdisciplinary center for study of religion and secularism ("Centre interdisciplinaire d'étude des religions et de la laïcité") of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB), where she is a teacher.

==Career==
She directed in 1995 a book about ''The Great myths of the history of Belgium, Flanders and Wallonia'' ("Les grands mythes de l'histoire de Belgique, de Flandre et de Wallonie"), a global attempt by [[new historians]] of Belgium to deconstruct [[nationalist]] myths e.g. created by the official [[historiography]] for [[nation-building]] purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Jean-Pierre Stroobants, [http://archives.lesoir.be/sur-les-mythes-de-l-histoire-de-belgique_t-19950617-Z09NF8.html Anne Morelli. Sur les mythes de l'histoire de Belgique], [[Le Soir]], 17 June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Morelli claims she is [[atheist]] and considers herself as belonging to the [[far left]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "J'estime être d'extrême gauche, mais je pense que l'immobilisme que nous vivons aujourd'hui est dû en grande partie aux divisions de l'extrême gauche", Éric Guillaume, ''Les 175 ans de la Belgique vus par Anne Morelli (ULB)'', Solidaire, 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Morelli is particularly known for her opinions on [[cult]]s or new religious movements. Like other [[sociologist]]s and historians, she believes that churches are different from cults only through their relationship to power, and that they are "[[totalitarian]] institutions" as well as prisons, hospitals, barracks, boarding houses and some companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} "La secte, comme la communauté charismatique, le couvent, la prison, l'hôpital, la caserne, le pensionnat (et peut-être aussi certains partis ou entreprises lorsqu'il s'agit de [[Disney]] ou [[McDonald's|MacDo]]) est l'une des institutions totalitaires qui prend, marque, change de nom ou immatricule, imprime dans un moule et déguise pour donner l'impression d'uniformité des corps et des esprits." Anne Morelli, ''Lettre ouverte à la secte des adversaires des sectes'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, during the 36th annual conference of the International Association of Labour History Institutions in [[Ghent]], she said at the international conference of [[anti-globalism]] that no movement has ever achieved a change without using violence.&lt;ref&gt;"At an international conference in Ghent in 2005 on the anti-globalisation movement, Anne Morelli told the astounded audience that not one single movement in history had ever enforced change without use of violence." Francine Mestrum, ''The World Social Forum of Porto Alegre: what future?'', 2006 [http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/dinamic.php?pagina=bal_francine_2006_in Forumsocialmundial.org.br] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112160437/http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/dinamic.php?pagina=bal_francine_2006_in |date=January 12, 2008 }}. Retrieved 22 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Morelli was part of a group which welcomed [[Pierre Carette]], the main leader of a terrorist group active in 1984-1985, [[Communist Combatant Cells]], when he was released from prison after 17 years, an unusual long imprisonment in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} RTBF, "Manifestation de soutien à Pierre Carette", le 25 February 2003 [https://archive.is/20070422110226/http://foot2004.rtbf.be/rtbf_2000////bin/view_something.cgi?id=0117715_article&amp;header=none&amp;file=print.html RTBF.be]. Retrieved 22 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Morelli has summarized and systematized the contents of [[Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Arthur Ponsonby]]'s classic in "ten commandments of [[propaganda]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morelli|first1=Anne|title=Principes élémentaires de propagande de guerre|date=2001|publisher=éditions Labor|location=Brussels|isbn=2-8040-1565-3|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural conservation''' describes the process through which the material, historical, and design integrity of any [[Cultural heritage|built heritage]] are prolonged through carefully planned interventions. The individual engaged in this pursuit is known as an architectural [[conservator-restorer]]. Decisions of when and how to engage in an intervention are critical to the ultimate [[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage]]. Ultimately, the decision is value based: a combination of artistic, contextual, and informational values is normally considered. In some cases, a decision to not intervene may be the most appropriate choice.

==Definitions==

===Narrow definition===
The Preservation Architect must consider factors that deal with issues of prolonging the life and preserving the integrity of architectural character, such as form and style, and/or its constituent materials, such as stone, brick, glass, metal, and wood. In this sense, the term refers to the "professional use of a combination of science, art, craft, and technology as a preservation tool"&lt;ref&gt;Weaver and Matero 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and is allied with - and often equated to - its parent fields, of historic environment conservation and [[art conservation]].

===Broad definition===
In addition to the design and art/science definition described above, architectural conservation also refers to issues of identification, policy, regulation, and advocacy associated with the entirety of the cultural and [[built environment]]. This broader scope recognizes that society has mechanisms to identify and value historic cultural resources, create laws to protect these resources, and develop policies and management plans for interpretation, protection, and education.  Typically this process operates as a specialized aspect of a society's planning system, and its practitioners are termed built or historic environment conservation professionals.

===Functional definition===
Architectural conservation is the process by which individuals or groups attempt to protect valued buildings from unwanted change.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Richard(2010) 'Listed building control? A critique of historic building administration', CulturalTrends, 19: 3, p.192&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the architectural conservation movement==
[[File:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|thumb|Windows, c.1270, on the carefully preserved [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue, Erfurt]] in Germany]]
As a movement, architectural conservation in general, and the preservation of ancient structures specifically, gained momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a response to [[Modernism]] and its corresponding architectural perspective, which eschewed sentimental attachment to old buildings and structures in favor of technological and architectural progress and change. Prior to this time most of the ancient buildings that were still standing had only survived because they either had significant cultural or religious import, or they had yet to be discovered.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Art conservation and restoration |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=29 April 2010 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36477/art-conservation-and-restoration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of the architectural conservation movement took place at a time of significant archaeological discovery and scientific advancement. Those educated in the field began to see various examples of architecture as either being "correct" or "incorrect".&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; Because of this, two schools of thought began to emerge within the field of building conservation.

'''Preservation/Conservation''' were used interchangeably to refer to the architectural school of thought that either encouraged measures that would [[Historic Preservation|protect and maintain]] buildings in their current state, or would prevent further damage and deterioration to them. This school of thought saw the original design of old buildings as correct in and of themselves. Two of the main proponents of preservation and conservation in the 19th century were art critic [[John Ruskin]] and artist [[William Morris]].

'''Restoration''' was the conservationist school of thought that believed historic buildings could be improved, and sometimes even completed, using current day materials, design, and techniques. In this way it's very similar to the Modernist architectural theory, except it does not advocate the destruction of ancient structures. One of the most ardent supporters of this school of thought in the 19th century was the French architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]].  [[Victorian restoration]] of medieval churches was widespread in England and elsewhere, with results that were deplored at the time by [[William Morris]] and are now widely regretted.

==Current treatments==
The [[Department of the Interior]] of the United States defined the following treatment approaches to architectural conservation:

*'''Preservation''', "places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair. It reflects a building's continuum over time, through successive occupancies, and the respectful changes and alterations that are made."&lt;ref name= FourRs&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction: Choosing an appropriate treatment|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Rehabilitation''' "emphasizes the retention and repair of historic materials, but more latitude is provided for replacement because it is assumed the property is more deteriorated prior to work. (Both Preservation and Rehabilitation standards focus attention on the preservation of those materials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships that, together, give a property its historic character."&lt;ref name=FourRs /&gt;  See also [[adaptive reuse]].
*'''[[Building restoration|Restoration]]''' "focuses on the retention of materials from the most significant time in a property's history, while permitting the removal of materials from other periods."&lt;ref name=FourRs /&gt;
*'''[[Reconstruction (architecture)|Reconstruction]]''', "establishes limited opportunities to re-create a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure, or object in all new materials."&lt;ref name=FourRs /&gt;

Other nations recognize some or all of these as potential treatments for historic structures. Canada recognizes preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration. The [[Burra Charter]], for Australia, identifies preservation, restoration, and reconstruction.

==Common architectural conservation/preservation problems==
[[File:HospitalSantPau.jpg|thumb|left|Conservation patches on mosaics wall of Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau ([[Barcelona]])]]
[[File:VeniceLead1.jpg|thumb|left|Punched lead cast in a [[Venice]] bridge wall fixing the hard-metal connecting bar]]
The earliest building materials used by ancient peoples, such as wood and mud, were organic.&lt;ref name="Rebano-Edwards, Susan 2010"&gt;Rebano-Edwards, Susan. "Conservation of Stone Buildings - Simple Preservation Techniques for Ancient Buildings." Suite101.com. 20 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic materials were used because they were plentiful and renewable. Unfortunately, the organic materials used were also very susceptible to the two most significant impediments to preservation and conservation: the elements and life (both human and animal).&lt;ref name="Rebano-Edwards, Susan 2010"/&gt; Over time inorganic materials like brick, stone, metal, concrete, and terra cotta began to be used by ancient people instead of organic ones, due to their durability.&lt;ref name="Rebano-Edwards, Susan 2010"/&gt; In fact, we know that these materials are durable because many ancient structures that are composed of them, even some built as far back as the [[Bronze Age]], like Egypt's [[Great Pyramids]], still stand today.

Ancient buildings such as the Egyptian pyramids, the Roman Colosseum, and the Parthenon face common preservation issues.  The most prominent factors affecting these structures are the environment, pollution, and tourism.

As the Earth's climate patterns change, so too do the environmental conditions governing these buildings.  For example, the Colosseum has already faced lightning, fire, and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/colosseum/qanda/ |title=www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/colosseum/qanda/ |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changing climate increases the accumulation of salt crystals on the outside of monuments like the Colosseum and the Parthenon.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=David |first=Ariel |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2007-06-08-colosseum_N.htm |title=www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2007-06-08-colosseum_N.htm |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon increases the deterioration of these buildings.

The salt crystals further contribute to the black effect that man-made pollution has on these buildings.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; The Parthenon is especially exposed and many of the remaining marbles are eroding to the point that they may no longer be identifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/13/2215521.htm |title=www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/13/2215521.htm |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2008-04-13 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pollution from corrosive agents in the air has also attributed to this deterioration.

The third factor affecting ancient building conservation is tourism. While tourism provides both economical and cultural benefits, it can also be destructive. The Egyptian tomb of Seti the 1st is currently off limits to the public due to the deterioration that has been caused by tourists.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The pyramids in Giza have also encountered problems due to large numbers of tourists; more tourists mean greater humidity and water presence, which can lead to erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/egypt.htm |title=www1.american.edu/TED/egypt.htm |publisher=.american.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the above factors complicate the conservation options available to treat these buildings.

==Conservation process==

===Assessment===
The first step in any building conservation project is a sensitive assessment of its history and merits.  As noted architect Donald Insall states, "Every building has its own biography.  A knowledge of the whole life of a building brings an essential understanding of its features and its problems.&lt;ref&gt;Art conservation and restoration,"   ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''.  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.  Web. 26 Apr. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  He gives the Parthenon in Athens as an example; built between 447 and 432 BCE to serve as a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, its purpose over time changed to Christian church, mosque, and powder magazine before it became one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world.

Once the assessment is complete, the next step is a thorough measured survey with a tape, rod and level.  Modern measuring techniques, such as photogrammetry (the use of aerial photographs to make maps and surveys) and stereophotogrammetry, are also used today to increase accuracy.  Once the measurements are complete, there is an analysis of the structural stability of the building and its living pattern of movement.  No building is permanently still; soil and wind can affect building stability and need to be documented.  Finally, the architect or surveyor tests the electrical connections, plumbing, and other utilities present in the building (this is more for historic and re-purposed buildings).  For both ancient and historic buildings, lightning conductors and fire-fighting equipment are checked to make sure they can provide sufficient protection.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2010"&gt;"Art conservation and restoration," ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''.  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.  Web. 26 Apr. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of this assessment process, the conservator will analyze all the collected data and decide on a conservation plan based on available funding sources..

===Treatment===
&lt;!--begin copied section from restoration - may be totally bunk, but not too harmful; needs a thorough looking over by one more expert than I--&gt;
The phrase covers a wide span of activities, from the cleaning of the interior or exterior of a building — as took place at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] — to the rebuilding of damaged or derelict buildings, such as the restoration of the Windsor Great Hall in [[Windsor Castle]] after a destructive fire in 1992. The 1985–1989 removal of 38 layers of paint and the cleaning and repair of the exterior sandstone walls of the [[White House]] in the United States are an example of building restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uacwater.com/flood-restoration.php|title=Building restoration from flood project|publisher=UAC Water Restoration Division|date=2006-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings are structures which have, from time to time, particular purposes. They require ongoing maintenance to prevent them falling into disrepair as a result of the ravages of time and use. Building restoration can be thought of as that set of activities which are greater than year-to-year maintenance, but which by retaining the building are less than a [[demolition]] and the [[construction]] of a new building.
&lt;!--Gets really questionable here, but I don't have my sources on the topic with me to verify or not, but I'm 80% sure this is off, as it is essentially unsourced:
The scope of restoration depends upon the need, and other circumstances, such as the status of the building, and the affordability of the work required. There are three main types of restoration:

* '''Building cleaning''' — most especially cleaning the external façade of a building, and typically needed in cities that have suffered from [[smoke]] pollution. Many [[granite]], [[sandstone]], and [[limestone]] buildings in the UK, for example, have for most of their existence been black in colour owing to smoke and [[smog]]. Many, in turn, have been cleaned after air pollution legislation diminished the incidence of airborne particulate matter. Any building that has suffered from fire and/or water damage, needs to be restored as well. Fire and water restoration specialists can help speed repairs, whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.randrmagonline.com/CDA/Archives/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000156172 | title=Restoration With a Capital E-P-A: A Case Study | publisher=Restoration &amp; Remediation | date=August 23, 2007 | first=Bill | last=Begal | accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Major repair''' — especially to [[stonework]] affected by [[acid rain]] and other [[pollutant]]s, and which has weathered or decayed to a structurally unsound or aesthetically displeasing condition.
*'''Rebuilding''' to replace severely damaged or missing parts of a building. Here, in all cases, a balance is to be struck between recreation of the original building using materials and techniques similar to the original construction, as happened at very great expense at Windsor Castle; and the use of more modern techniques and materials.--&gt;

Not all building conservation seeks to follow the original design of the building. It is reasonably commonplace for the shell of a building — its external walls — to be retained whilst an entirely new building is constructed within. This approach is also referred to as [[adaptive reuse]].

Although techniques of architectural conservation are improving, the action of cleaning or repairing buildings can, with hindsight, be seen to cause problems that at the time were unforeseen. A good example is the unrestrained use of [[sandblasting]] to clean smog deposits from soft-stoned buildings — a technique employed in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s — which has damaged the external faces of stonework to the extent that in some cases, later, the stonework has needed to be replaced. Contemporary building codes recognize such problems, and (it is to be hoped) mitigate poor outcomes.

====Case example: Ancient stone structures====
Most ancient buildings are constructed of stone and have survived from antiquity as a result of the stability of this building material.  However, stone can deteriorate rapidly without protection, particularly in our modern era of pollution and climate change.

==Public awareness and outreach to promote architectural conservation==
There are many organizations that work to raise public awareness of the necessity to preserve ancient and historic buildings and areas, across communities, users and government.  In addition to promoting the cultural value of these buildings, and encouraging appropriate policies and strategies for conservation, the organizations can help in raising the required funding to implement conservation initiatives and plans, and often serve as a link between the community and local/federal governments to advance conservation projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">When the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] was united with France by the marriage of [[Philip IV of France]] with [[Joan I of Navarre|Joan I]] Queen Regnant of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Count of Champagne|Countess of Champagne]] on 16 August 1284, it kept the long existing '''Chancery of Navarre''' ''(French: Chancellerie de Navarre)''. The [[Kings of Navarre]] had private [[Chancellors]] dating back to ancient kings. [[Theobald II of Navarre]] had a Vice-Chancellor, according to letters dated 1259.

In 1512, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand the Catholic]], [[King of Aragon]] and son of [[John II of Aragon and Navarre]], invaded the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], beginning the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre]], during the reign of [[John III of Navarre|Jean III d'Albret]] and [[Catherine of Navarre|Catherine de Foix-Béarn]], and quickly conquered all of [[Upper Navarre]] and part of [[Lower Navarre]]. [[John III of Navarre|Jean III d'Albret]] tried to retake his kingdom, first in 1512, but failed despite French support, then again in 1516. Depressed by the defeats and adverse diplomatic results, he died at the castle of Esgouarrabaque in [[Monein]], in [[Béarn]], on 14 June 1516. His son, [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]], attempted to reconquer the kingdom, again with French help, but this time supported by a popular revolt, however, despite some initial success, he was defeated at the [[Battle of Noáin]] on 30 June 1521 and lost all he had reconquered.

[[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] moved his capital to [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]]. In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Quint]] invaded [[Guyenne]] and [[Lower Navarre]]. [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] was taken prisoner during the [[Battle of Pavia]], in French-controlled [[Lombardy]], on 24 February 1525, and married [[Marguerite d'Angoulême]], the sister of [[Francis I of France|François I of France]] the following year. A new attempt by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Quint]] to reconquer [[Lower Navarre]]  in 1527 was only partially successful, after which he abandoned the idea of reconquering the country.

The deconsecrated St. Paul's Church housed the ''Chancery of Navarre'' for the century of its existence [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], from 1524–1624. The 1522–23 meetings of the Estates of Navarre were also held in the building.

== Chancellors of Navarre: 1512–1624 ==

''Pierre de Biaix'' was already ''Chancellor of Navarre'' in 1512&lt;ref name="La Boulinière (1825), pp. 323–324"&gt;La Boulinière (1825), pp. 323–324 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4LI9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA323 (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; when the kingdom was invaded and remained loyal to [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] following the death of [[John III of Navarre|Jean III d'Albret]]. He remained ''Chancellor of Navarre'' until at least 11 August 1526,&lt;ref name="Bascle de Lagrèze (1851), p. 342"&gt;Bascle de Lagrèze (1851), p. 342 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QOtAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA342 (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps longer.

The position of ''Chancellor of Navarre'' was eliminated at the time of the formation of the ''Parliament of Navarre and Béarn'' in 1624.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des Sciences, des Arts et des Métiers, Tome 3 CH=CONS, Paris, 1753 p. 102 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zkkJxqFkC-AC&amp;pg=PA102]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris McGreal''' is a reporter for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the newspaper's [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chrismcgreal|title=Chris McGreal|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=19 August 2012|location=London|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
McGreal is a foreign correspondent for ''[[The Guardian]]'' who has covered Africa, the Middle East and Central America. He is now based in the US. He has won a series of awards for his coverage of Africa, Israel and the U.S. A former merchant seaman, he began his career in journalism in 1982 with BBC local radio. He worked as a producer at the BBC World Service in London before moving to Latin America in 1985 where he was a reporter on the Daily Journal in Venezuela and a correspondent for the BBC. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1987 McGreal moved to Mexico City to cover Mexico and Central America for the BBC and, later, ''The Independent''. In 1990, he became ''The Independent on Sunday''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first South Africa correspondent following the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. In 1992 he joined ''The Guardian'' and remained based in Johannesburg. For the next decade, McGreal travelled widely in Africa, sometimes covering conflicts including the civil war in Angola, the Rwandan genocide, the invasion of Zaire and fall of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], and military rule in Nigeria. He won the [[Amnesty International UK Media Awards|1995 Amnesty International national print award]] for an article about the organisers of the Rwandan genocide.

He reported on the transition from apartheid in South Africa and the consequences of [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s denial that [[HIV]] causes [[AIDS]]. McGreal won the 2002 James Cameron Prize for his coverage of Africa and "work as a journalist that has combined moral vision and professional integrity". The judges praised his "even-handed reporting and analysis of sub-Saharan Africa - without allowing his judgment to be affected by sentimentality or historical guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Awards for Guardian journalists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/26/theguardian.pressandpublishing|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|date=26 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGreal became ''The Guardian''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Jerusalem]] correspondent in 2002 at the height of the second Palestinian uprising. In 2004 he won the Martha Gellhorn Award (London), for reporting of Israel &amp; Palestinian territories that "penetrated the established version of events and told an unpalatable truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism|url=http://www.marthagellhorn.com/previous.htm|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, McGreal returned to South Africa. He made repeated undercover trips to [[Zimbabwe]] to report on the political violence of President [[Robert Mugabe]]'s regime. He was runner up in the 2006 British Media Award by the Foreign Press Association in London for his Zimbabwe coverage. In 2009 he was appointed ''The Guardian'''s Washington correspondent. He was runner up in the Foreign Press Association award for Print/Web Feature Story of the Year for a series retracing route of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' to report on economic depression in modern America. He has continued to report from the Middle East at times, including the Egyptian and Libyan revolutions in 2011. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A '''decade''' is a period of 10 [[year]]s. The word is derived (via French and Latin) from the {{lang-grc|δεκάς|dekas}}), which means ''a group of ten''.  Other words for spans of years also come from Latin: [[wikt:biennium|biennium]] (2 years), triennium (3 years), [[quadrennium]] (4 years), [[lustrum]] (5 years), [[century]] (100 years), [[millennium]] (1000 years).

== Distinctions ==

Although any period of ten years is a decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dev_dict&amp;field-12668446=decade&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score%2Cname|title=Oxford Dictionaries|work=askoxford.com|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/decade Webster dictionary definition of "decade"]&lt;/ref&gt; a convenient and frequently referenced interval is based on the tens digit of a calendar year, as in using "1960s" to represent the decade from 1960 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/621/01/ The OWL at Purdue: Apostrophe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/1960s |title=1960s |work=Memidex/Wordnet Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, for brevity, only the tens part is mentioned (''60s'' or ''sixties''), although this may leave it uncertain which century is meant. These references are frequently used to encapsulate [[popular culture]] or other widespread phenomena that dominated such a decade, as in ''The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s'' or "The [[Roaring Twenties]]".

However, the [[Gregorian calendar]] begins with the year 1. (There is no year "zero", and the year before AD 1 is 1 BC with nothing in between.) Therefore, its ''first'' decade is from [[AD 1]] to [[AD 10]], the ''second'' decade from [[AD 11]] to [[AD 20]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Passim'', i.a. Spencer, Donald D. 1989. ''Invitation to number theory with Pascal''. Ormond Beach: Camelot. 46: "The first decade is from one to ten inclusive, the second decade from eleven to twenty inclusive, and so on."&lt;/ref&gt; So, although "the 1960s" comprises the years 1960 to 1969, "the 197th decade" spans 1961 to 1970.

A decade may also refer to an arbitrary span of ten years. For example, the statement "during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time", merely refers to the last ten years of Mozart's life without regard to which calendar years are encompassed.

Particularly for the 20th century, a nominal decade is often used to refer not just to a set of ten years but rather to a period roughly approximating those ten years - for example, the phrase ''the sixties'' often refers to events that took place between c. 1964 and 1972, and to memories of the [[counterculture]], [[flower power]], [[protests of 1968]] and other things happening at the time. Often, such a nominal decade will come to be known by a title, such as the "Swinging Sixties" (1960s), the "Warring Forties" (1940s) and the "Roaring Twenties" (1920s).  This practice is occasionally also used for decades of earlier centuries, for example references to the 1890s as the "[[Gay Nineties]]" or "Naughty Nineties".

'''Dietrich''', also known as '''Dietrich of Ringelheim''', was a [[Saxon]] count of the [[Middle Ages]].

== Biography ==
Dietrich (Theodoric), sometimes called ''Dietrich of [[Salzgitter-Ringelheim|Ringelheim]]'' in later literature, was a medieval [[Saxon]] count in the [[Germany|German]] region of [[Westphalia]]. According to contemporary chronicles, his [[Immedinger]] family stemmed from the House of the Saxon duke [[Widukind]]. Dietrich was probably born in the second half of the 9th century, a few decades after the Saxons were brought under the control of [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish empire]]. His date of death remains uncertain, but might have been after the 910s according to the ''Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Letters''. According to ''genealogieonline'', Dietrich died between 916 and 920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-homs/I6000000003937155459.php|title=Dietrich (Theodoric) von Ringelheim (± 858-± 920) » Stamboom Homs » Genealogie Online|last=Homs|first=George|website=Genealogie Online|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietrich was the father of [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Matilda]], who married the [[duke of Saxony]] and later king of [[East Francia]], [[Henry the Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Althoff |first=Gerd |year=1990 |title=Mathilde |work=NDB Volume 16 |page=371 |url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz70643.html |publisher=Historische Kommission, [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences|Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] (BAdW) |language=German}}

Prof '''Duncan MacLaren Young Sommerville''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]]}} (1879–1934) was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer. He compiled a bibliography on [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and also wrote a leading textbook in that field. He also wrote ''Introduction to the Geometry of N Dimensions'', advancing the study of [[polytope]]s. He was a co-founder and the first secretary of the [[New Zealand Astronomical Society]].

Sommerville was also an accomplished watercolourist, producing a series New Zealand landscapes.

==Early life==
Sommerville was born on 24 November 1879 in [[Beawar]] in [[India]], where his father the Rev Dr James Sommerville, was employed as a missionary by the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]. His father had been responsible for establishing the hospital at [[Jodhpur]], [[Rajputana]].

The family returned home to [[Perth, Scotland]], where Duncan spent 4 years at a private school, before completing his education at [[Perth Academy]]. His father died in his youth. He lived with his mother at 12 Rose Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Perth Post Office Directory 1895&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his father's death, he won a scholarship, allowing him to continue his studies to university level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Sommerville.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He then studied Mathematics at the [[University of St Andrews]] in [[Fife]], graduating MA in 1902. He then began as an Assistant Lecturer at the university. In 1905 he gained his doctorate ([[Doctor of Science|DSc]]) for his thesis, ''Networks of the Plane in Absolute Geometry'' and was promoted to Lecturer. He continued teaching Mathematics at St Andrews until 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[projective geometry]] the method of [[Cayley–Klein metric]]s had been used in the 19th century to model [[non-euclidean geometry]]. In 1910 Duncan wrote "Classification of geometries with projective metrics".&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society'' 28:25–41&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is described  by Daniel Corey&lt;ref&gt;{{MR|id=550670}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
:He classifies them into 9 types of plane geometries, 27 in dimension 3, and more generally 3&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; in dimension n. A number of these geometries have found applications, for instance in physics.

In 1910 Sommerville reported&lt;ref&gt;D. Sommerville (1910) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/94115#page/694/mode/1up On the Need of a Non-Euclidean  Bibliography], ''Report'' of the [[British Association]]&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[British Association]] on the need for a [[bibliography]] on [[non-euclidean geometry]], noting that the field had no International Association like the [[Quaternion Society]] to sponsor it.

In 1911 Sommerville published his compiled bibliography of works on non-euclidean geometry, and it received favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B. Halsted]] (1912) "Duncan M.Y. Sommerville", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 19:1–4, includes portrait, {{MR|id=1517626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B. Mathews]] (1912) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v89/n2220/pdf/089266a0.pdf Bibliography of Non-Euclidean Geometry] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 89:266 (#2220)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 [[Chelsea Publishing]] issued a second edition which referred to [[Anthology|collected works]] then available of some of the cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{MR|id=270890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommerville was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1911. His proposers were [[Peter Redford Scott Lang]], [[Robert Alexander Robertson]], [[William Peddie]] and [[George Chrystal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In 1912 he married Louisa Agnes Beveridge.

==Work in New Zealand==
[[File:Duncan MacLaren Young Sommerville 2.jpg|thumb|280px|Duncan MacLaren Young Sommerville]]In 1915 Sommerville went to [[New Zealand]] to take up the Chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria College]] of Wellington.

Duncan became interested in [[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]]s and wrote "Division of space by congruent triangles and tetrahedra" in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'' 43:85–116&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he extended results to ''n''-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sommerville (1924) "The regular divisions of space of ''n'' dimensions and their metrical constants", [[Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] 48:9–22&lt;/ref&gt;

He also discovered the [[Dehn–Sommerville equations]] for the number of faces of [[convex polytope]]s.

Sommerville used geometry to describe the [[voting theory]] of a [[preferential ballot]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Sommerville (1928) "Certain hyperspatial partitionings connected with preferential voting", [[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]] 28(1):368 to 82&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed [[Nanson's method]] where ''n'' candidates are ordered by voters into a sequence of preferences. Sommerville shows that the outcomes lie in ''n'' ! [[simplex]]es that cover the surface of an ''n'' &amp;minus; 2 dimensional spherical space.

When his ''Introduction to Geometry of N Dimensions'' appeared in 1929, it received a positive review from B. C. Wong in the [[American Mathematical Monthly]].&lt;ref&gt;B.C. Wong (1931) "Recent publications", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 38(5):286–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommerville was co-founder and first secretary of the [[New Zealand Astronomical Society]] (1920). He was President of Section A of the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting, Adelaide (1924). In 1926 he became a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].

He died in New Zealand on 31 January 1934.

An '''Economuseum''' is small-scale production of goods in a [[workshop]] environment focusing on the [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and perpetuation of traditional skills and craftsmanship. The function of the economuseum is to promote the products of local craftspeople, create employment and in the end, promote immaterial, [[cultural heritage]].
 
Shop owners provide the visiting public with information on techniques, skills, and production processes. In addition to products for sale, all economuseums have developed educational information material: historic product exhibits, present-day production samples and archive material.

==Concept==
The concept of the 'économusée' was born in 1992 in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and is a registered trademark of the International Economuseum Network Society.

'''Sir Edward Dyer''' (October 1543&amp;nbsp;– May 1607) was an [[English people|English]] [[courtier]] and [[poet]].

==Life==

The son of Sir Thomas Dyer, Kt., he was born at [[Sharpham]] Park, [[Glastonbury]], [[Somerset]].  He was educated, according to [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], either at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] or at Broadgates Hall (later [[Pembroke College, Oxford]]), and left after taking a degree.  After some time abroad, he appeared at [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s court. His first patron was [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]], who seems to have thought of putting him forward as a rival to Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] for the queen's favour. He is mentioned by [[Gabriel Harvey]], along with Sir [[Philip Sidney]], as one of the ornaments of the court. Sidney, in his will, bequeathed his books equally between [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke|Fulke Greville]] and Dyer. He was made steward of Woodstock in 1570.

He was employed by Elizabeth on a mission (1584) to the [[Low Countries]], and in 1589 was sent to [[Denmark]]. In a commission to inquire into manors unjustly alienated from the crown in the west country he did not altogether please the queen, but nevertheless received a grant of some forfeited lands in Somerset in 1588. He was returned the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|Somerset]] in 1589 and 1593.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/dyer-edward-1543-1607|title=DYER, Edward (1543-1607), of Sharpham, Weston, Som., Leicester House, London and Winchester House, Southwark.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate= 10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was knighted and made [[Chancellor of the Order of the Garter]] in 1596. [[William Oldys]] said of him that he "would not stoop to fawn," and some of his verses seem to show that he disliked the pressures of life at court. Under James I he lost the stewardship of Woodstock around 1604.

He died in 1607 and was buried in the [[chancel]] of [[Southwark Cathedral|St Saviour's]], [[Southwark]], on 11 May 1607 (21 May N.S.). Administration of his estate was granted to his sister Margaret.

Wood says that many thought Dyer to be a [[Rosicrucian]], and that he was a firm believer in [[alchemy]], although it is doubtful that an organised Rosicrucian movement existed during Dyer's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosicrucianism]]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a great reputation as a poet among his contemporaries, but very little of his work has survived. [[George Puttenham]], in the ''Arte of English Poesie'' speaks of "Maister Edward Dyar, for Elegie most sweete, solemne, and of high conceit." One of the poems once universally accepted as his is "My Mynde to me a kingdome is", which [[Steven W. May]] considers as possibly written by [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;May, Steven. "The Authorship of 'My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is'". ''RES'' New Series XXVI (1975) pp. 385-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the poems in ''England's Helicon'' (1600), signed S.E.D., and included in [[Alexander Balloch Grosart|Dr A.B. Grosart]]'s collection of Dyer's works (''Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library'', vol. iv, 1876) is the charming pastoral "My Phillis hath the morninge sunne," but this comes from the ''Phillis'' of [[Thomas Lodge]]. Grosart also prints a prose tract entitled ''The Prayse of Nothing'' (1585). The ''Sixe [[idyll|Idillia]]'' from [[Theocritus]], reckoned by [[John Payne Collier]] among Dyer's works, were dedicated to, not written by, him.

In 1943 Alden Brooks proposed Sir Edward Dyer as a candidate in the [[Shakespearean authorship question]] in his book ''Will Shakspere and the Dyer’s Hand''.&lt;ref&gt;Alden Brooks - ''Will Shakspere and the Dyer's Hand''. New York, Scribner, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guido Karl Anton List''', better known as '''Guido von List''' (5 October 1848 &amp;ndash; 17 May 1919), was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[occultism|occultist]], journalist, playwright, and novelist. He expounded a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] known as [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Wotanism]], which he claimed was the revival of the religion of the ancient German race, and which included an inner set of [[Ariosophy|Ariosophical]] teachings that he termed Armanism.

Born to a wealthy middle-class family in [[Vienna]], List claimed that he abandoned his family's [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god [[Odin|Wotan]]. Spending much time in the Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a ''[[völkisch]]'' emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were survivals of pre-Christian, [[paganism|pagan]] religion. He published three novels, ''Carnuntum'' (1888), ''Jung Diethers Heimkehr'' (1894), and ''Pipara'' (1895), each set among the German tribes of the [[Iron Age]], as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing ''völkisch'' articles, now largely for the nationalist ''Ostdeutsche Rundschau'' newspaper, with his works taking on an [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the [[Literarische Donaugesellschaft]] literary society, and involved himself in [[German nationalism in Austria|Austria's Pan-German nationalist]] movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the [[German Empire]].

During an 11-month period of blindness in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming under the influence of the [[Theosophical Society]], resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate [[Runology]] and the [[Armanen Futharkh]]. The popularity of his work among the ''völkisch'' and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.
Through these ventures he promoted the [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] view that modern society was degenerate, but that it would be cleansed through an apocalyptic event resulting in the establishment of a new Pan-German Empire that would embrace Wotanism. Having erroneously prophesied that this empire would be established by victory for the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], List died on a visit to [[Berlin]] in 1919.

During his lifetime, List became a well-known figure among the nationalist and ''völkisch'' subcultures of Austria and Germany, influencing the work of many others operating in this milieu. His work, propagated through the List Society, influenced later ''völkisch'' groups such as the [[Reichshammerbund]] and [[Germanenorden]], and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning [[Nazi Party]] and the [[SS]]. After [[World War II]] his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathen]] practitioners in Europe, Australia, and North America.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1848&amp;ndash;77===

Guido Karl Anton List was born on 5 October 1848 in [[Vienna]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} Born to a prosperous middle-class family, he was the eldest son of Karl Anton List, a leather goods dealer who was the son of Karl List, a publican and vintner.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1pp=33&amp;ndash;34|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=108}} Guido's mother, Marian List, was the daughter of builder's merchant Franz Anton Killian.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} List was raised in the city's second ''[[bezirk]]'', on the eastern side of the [[Danube]] canal.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Like most Austrians at the time, his family were members of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] denomination of [[Christianity]], with List being [[Infant baptism|christened]] into this faith at [[Peterskirche, Vienna|St Peter's Church]] in Vienna.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Reflecting the family's wealth and [[bourgeoisie]] status, in 1851 a [[watercolour]] portrait of List was painted by the artist [[Anton von Anreiter]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}}

[[Image:Carnuntum Heidentor.jpg|thumb|left|Heidentor, the Pagan Gate at Carnuntum where List buried wine bottles in 1875]]

Accounts suggest that List had a happy childhood.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} Developing a preference for rural areas rather than urban ones,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=35}} he enjoyed family visits to the countryside of [[Lower Austria]] and [[Moravia]], and &amp;ndash; encouraged by his father &amp;ndash; he began to sketch and paint the castles, prehistoric monuments, and natural scenery of these areas.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} According to his later account, he developed an early interest in the pre-Christian religions of Austria, coming to believe that the catacombs beneath [[Stephansdom|St. Stephen's Cathedral]] in Vienna had once been a shrine devoted to a [[paganism|pagan]] deity. He claimed that on an 1862 visit to the catacombs with his father, he knelt before a ruined altar and swore that when an adult he would construct a temple to the ancient god [[Odin|Wotan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=108}}

Although List wanted to become an artist and scholar, he reluctantly agreed to his father's insistence that he enter the family's leather goods business.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=34}} During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and sketching as well as rambling, riding, or rowing in the countryside, becoming both a member of the Viennese rowing club Donauhort and the secretary of the [[Austrian Alpine Club|Austrian Alpine Association]] (Österreichischer Alpenverein).{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1pp=34&amp;ndash;35|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=109}} He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps, and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend [[Midsummer]] night alone atop the [[Geiselberg hillfort]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=35}} On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night at the site of the ancient Roman fortification of [[Carnuntum]] to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the [[Battle of Carnuntum]], in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army. List later claimed that while his friends caroused, he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight bottles of wine in the shape of a [[swastika]] beneath the arch of the monument's Pagan Gate.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=35|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=109}}

===Early literary endeavours: 1877&amp;ndash;1902===

[[Image:List1878.JPG|thumb|200px|A photograph of List in 1878]]

In 1877, List's father died.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=36}} List soon abandoned the leather goods business that he inherited, intent on devoting himself to literary endeavours as a journalist, even if this meant a significant reduction in his income.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=110}} On 26 September 1878 he married his first wife, Helene Förster-Peters.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=36}} From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines ''[[Neue Welt]]'' ("New World"), ''[[Heimat]]'' ("Homeland"), ''[[Deutsche Zeitung]]'' ("German Newspaper"), and the ''[[Neue Deutsche Alpenzeitung]]'' ("New German Alpine Newspaper"), with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=36}} His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place-names, customs, and legends, describing the landscape as being embodied by ''[[genius loci]]'', and expressing clear German nationalist and ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' sentiment.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=36}}

In 1888, he published his first novel, ''Carnuntum'', in two volumes. Set in the late fourth century [[Common Era|CE]], the narrative focused on a romance set against the background of the conflict between Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire around the area of the eponymous Roman fort.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=110}} The novel established List as a recognised figure within [[German nationalism in Austria|Austria's Pan-German community]], a movement of individuals unified in their belief that the majority German-speaking areas of the multi-linguistic and multi-ethnic [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian state]] should cede and join with the newly established [[German Empire]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=37}} The book also brought him to the attention of [[Friedrich Wannieck]], a wealthy industrialist who was the chairman of both the Prague Iron Company and the First Brno Engineering Company. Wannieck was also president of the Verein 'Deutsches Haus' ("'German House' Association"), a nationalist organisation of linguistically German inhabitants of [[Brno]] who felt encircled by the largely Czech population of [[South Moravia]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=37}} List and Wannieck began corresponding, resulting in a lifelong friendship between the two men.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=37}} The Verein 'Deutsches Haus' subsequently published three of List's works in its series on German nationalist studies of history and literature.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=37}}

List began regularly writing for a weekly newspaper, the ''[[Ostdeutsche Rundschau]]'' ("East German Review"), which had been established in 1890 by the Austrian Pan-German parliamentary deputy [[Karl Wolf (Austrian politician)|Karl Wolf]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=38}} In 1891, List anthologised many of the magazine articles that he had written over the previous decades in his book ''[[Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder]]'' ("German Mythological Landscape Scenes"), extracts of which were then published in the ''Ostdeutsche Rundschau''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=38}} Further ''völkisch'' articles on various topics pertaining to Austria's folk culture and to its ancient Germanic tribes followed during the 1890s, although midway through that decade his work took on an explicitly [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] nature with articles such as "Die Juden als Staat und Nation".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=38}} Other Austrian German nationalist newspapers which published his articles during this period included the ''Bote aus dem Waldviertel'' ("The Waldviertel Herald") and ''Kyffhäuser''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=38}}

[[Image:Deutsch Mythologische Landschaftsbilder2Page523.jpg|thumb|left|A scenic view of [[Höllental (Lower Austria)|Höllental]] from List's ''Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder'']]

List began lecturing on these subjects; for instance, in February 1893 he spoke to the nationalist [[Verein 'Deutsches Geschichte']] ("'German History' Association) on the ancient priesthood of Wotan.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} He also worked as a playwright, and in December 1894 his play ''Der Wala Erweckung'' ("The Wala's Awakening") was premiered at an event organised by the [[Bund der Germanen]] (Germanic League) which was devoted to the German nationalist cause, with Jews being explicitly banned from attending the event.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} Alongside his affiliation with the Bund, List was also a member of the Deutscher Turnverein (Germanic Gymnastic League), a strongly nationalistic group to whom he contributed literary works for their events.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}}

In 1893, List and Fanny Wschiansky founded a [[Belles-lettres|belletristic]] society devoted to encouraging German nationalist and neo-romantic literature in Vienna, the [[Literarische Donaugesellschaft]] ("Danubian Literary Society").{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} The group was partly based upon the 15th-century Litteraria Sodalita Danubiana created by the Viennese humanist [[Conrad Celtes]], about whom List authored a brief biography in 1893.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} He also authored two further novels during the 1890s, both of which were historical romances set in Iron Age Germany.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} The first appeared in 1894 as ''Jung Diethers Heimkehr'' ("Young Diether's Homecoming"), which told the story of a young Teuton living in the fifth century who has been forcefully converted to Christianity but who returns to his original solar cult.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} The second was ''Pipara'', a two-volume story published in 1895 which told the story of an eponymous [[Quadi]] maiden who escaped captivity from the Romans to become an empress.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=39}} In 1898, he then authored a [[catechism]] exhibiting a form of pagan [[deism]] titled ''Der Unbesiegbare'' ("The Invincible").{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=40}}

List's activities had made him a celebrity within the Austrian Pan-German movement, with the editors of the ''Ostdeutsche Rundschau'' convening a Guido List evening in April 1895 and South Vienna's Wieden Singers' Club holding a List festival in April 1897.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=40}} Having divorced his previous wife, in August 1899 List married Anna Wittek, who was from [[Stecky]] in [[Bohemia]]. Despite List's modern Pagan faith, the wedding was held in an evangelical [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, reflecting the growing popularity of Protestantism among Austria's Pan-German community, who perceived it as a more authentically German form of Christianity than the Catholicism that was popular among Austria-Hungary's other ethnic and linguistic communities.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=40}} Wittek had previously appeared in a performance of List's ''Der Wala Erweckung'' and had publicly recited some of his poetry.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=40}} Following their marriage, List devoted himself fully to drama, authoring the plays ''König Vannius'' ("King Vannius") in 1899, ''Sommer-Sonnwend-Feuerzauber'' ("Summer Solstice Fire Magic") in 1901 and ''Das Goldstück'' ("The Gold Coin") in 1903.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=40&amp;ndash;41}} He also authored a pamphlet titled ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' ("The Reconstruction of Carnuntum") in 1900, in which he called for the reconstruction of the ancient Roman [[amphitheatre]] at Carnuntum as an open-air stage through which Wotanism could be promoted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=41}}

===Later life: 1902&amp;ndash;19===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="List... belonged to an older generation than most of his pre-war fellow ideologues and thus became a cult figure on the eastern edge of the German world. He was regarded by his readers and followers as a bearded old patriarch and a mystical nationalist guru whose clairvoyant gaze had lifted the glorious Aryan and Germanic past of Austria into full view from beneath the debris of foreign influences and Christian culture. In his books and lectures List invited true Germans to behold the clearly discernible remains of a wonderful theocratic Ario-German state, wisely governed by priest-kings and gnostic initiates, in the archaeology, folklore, and landscape of his homeland."|source=— Historian of esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=33}} }}

According to the historian [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], 1902 marked "a fundamental change in the character of [List's] ideas: occult ideas now entered his fantasy of the ancient Germanic faith."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=41}} This began when he received an operation to remove a [[cataract]] from his eye, after which he was left blind for eleven months. During this period of rest and recuperation, he contemplated questions surrounding the origins of the German language and the use of [[runes]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=23|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=41|3a1=Rudgley|3y=2006|3pp=111&amp;ndash;112}} He subsequently produced a manuscript detailing what he deemed to be a proto-language of the Aryan race, in which he claimed that occult insight had enabled him to interpret the letters and sounds of both runes and emblems and glyphs found on ancient inscriptions.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=41}} Terming it "a monumental pseudo-science", Goodrick-Clarke also noted that it constituted "the masterpiece of his occult-nationalist researches".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=41}} List sent a copy to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]] in Vienna, but they declined to publish it.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=41}} In 1903 List published an article in ''Die Gnosis'' magazine, which reflected a clear influence from the ideas of the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=41}}

List had occasionally used the title of ''[[von]]'' in his name from 1903 onward, but began using it permanently in 1907. The term was used to denote that an individual was a member of the nobility, and when the nobility archive ordered an official enquiry into List's use of the term, he was called before magistrates in October 1907. He defended his usage of the term with the claim that he was the descendant of aristocrats from [[Lower Austria]] and [[Styria]], and that his great-grandfather had abandoned the title to become an inn keeper.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=41&amp;ndash;42}} Goodrick-Clarke noted that whatever the legitimacy of List's unproven claims, claiming the title of ''von'' was "an integral part of [List's] religious fantasy" because in his mind it connected him to the ancient Wotanist priesthood, from whom he believed Austria's aristocrats were descended.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=42}} It is possible that List decided to adopt the usage of the term after his friend, the fellow prominent Ariosophist [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], had done so in 1903.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=42}}

[[Image:Deutsch MythologischeLandschaftsbilder2ndVolume.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An 'Armanist pilgrimage' to the Pagan Gate, June 1911. List is third from left.]]

List's popularity among the Pan-Germanist movement resulted in suggestions that a society devoted to the promotion of List's work be established.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=42&amp;ndash;43}} This materialised as the Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft in March 1908, which was largely funded by the Wannieck family but which also included many prominent figures from middle and upper-class Austrian and German society.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=43&amp;ndash;44|3a1=Rudgley|3y=2006|3p=114}}
At Midsummer 1911, List founded the High Armanen Order (Hoher Armanen-Ordem), or HAO, as an inner group of Armanist practitioners within the List Society with whom he went on pilgrimages to various places that he believed had been ancient cultic sites associated with the worship of Wotan.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=46&amp;ndash;47|3a1=Rudgley|3y=2006|3p=114}} He operated as leader of this group, using the title of Grand Master.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=64|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=114}} The List Society also produced six booklets authored by List himself between 1908 and 1911. Titled "Ario-Germanic research reports", they covered List's opinions on the meaning and magical power of runes, the ancient Wotanic priesthood, Austrian folklore and place-names, and the secret messages within heraldic devices.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=44}} In 1914, the Society then published List's work on runes and language that the Imperial Academy had turned down.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=44}} The first three of these publications furthered List's reputation across both the ''völkisch'' and nationalist subcultures within both Austria and Germany.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=44}} Many other writers were inspired by List, with a number of works being specifically dedicated to him.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} The editor of ''Prana'', [[Johannes Balzli]], authored a biography of List that was published in 1917.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}}

During [[World War I]], List erroneously proclaimed that there would be victory for the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria-Hungary, claiming to have learned this information from a vision that he experienced in 1917.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=47}}
By 1918, List was in declining health, furthered by the food shortages experienced in Vienna as a result of the war.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=47}}
In the spring of 1919, at the age of 71, List and his wife set off to recuperate and meet followers at the manor house of [[Eberhard von Brockhusen]], a List Society patron who lived at {{Interlanguage link multi|Langen, Fehrbellin|de|3=Langen (Fehrbellin)|lt=Langen}} in [[Brandenburg]], Germany.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=47&amp;ndash;48}}
On arrival at the [[Anhalter Station]] at [[Berlin]], List felt too exhausted to continue the journey. After a doctor had diagnosed a lung inflammation his health deteriorated quickly, and he died in a Berlin guesthouse on the morning of 17 May 1919.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=48}} He was cremated in [[Leipzig]] and his ashes laid in an [[urn]] and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery, [[Zentralfriedhof]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=48}} An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist [[Philipp Stauff]] then appeared in the ''[[Münchener Beobachter]]''.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=48}}

List promoted a religion termed "Wotanism", which he saw as the [[Exotericism|exoteric]], outer form of pre-Christian Germanic religion, while "Armanism" was the term he applied to what he believed were the esoteric, secret teachings of this ancient belief system.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=24|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=52|3a1=Rudgley|3y=2006|3p=112}} He believed that while Wotanism expounded [[polytheism]] for the wider population, those who were members of the Armanist elite were aware of the reality of [[monotheism]].{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=94}} List's Armanism would later be classified as a form of "[[Ariosophy]]", a term which was coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=227|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=111}} Goodrick-Clarke considered List's ideas to be a "unique amalgam of nationalist mythology and esotericism".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=44}} Religious studies scholar [[Olav Hammer]] noted that List's Wotanism "increasingly came to consist of an original synthesis of his reading of Germanic mythology with Theosophy".{{sfn|Hammer|2015|p=352}} List's early Theosophical influence came largely from the writings of German Theosophist [[Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth]], who had combined Theosophical ideas with his own interpretations of Germanic mythology and emphasis on racial doctrines, thus anticipating Ariosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=51}} In later work, this Theosophical influence over List's thinking grew, and he began referencing works such as [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s ''Die Geheimlehre'' and [[William Scott Elliot]]'s ''[[The Lost Lemuria]]'' in his publications.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=52}} He expressed the view that Norse mythology accorded with &amp;ndash; and thus proved &amp;ndash; the [[cosmogony|cosmogonical]] teachings of Theosophy.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=23}}

Much of List's understanding of the ancient past was based not on empirical research into historical, archaeological, and folkloric sources, but rather on ideas that he claimed to have received as a result of [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] illumination.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=67}} Later writer [[Richard Rudgley]] thus characterised List's understanding of the "pagan past" as an "imaginative reconstruction".{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=109}}
List's Wotanism was constructed largely on the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', two [[Old Norse]] textual sources which had been composed in Iceland during the late Middle Ages; he nevertheless believed that they accurately reflected the belief systems of Germany, having been authored by "Wotanist" refugees fleeing Christianity.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=49}} He believed that prior to the spread of Christianity into Northern Europe, there had once been a culturally unified German civilisation that had been spread across much of Europe, which came to be degraded and divided under the impact of Christianity.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=77}} He believed that the Danubian region of modern Austria had thus been part of this unified German civilisation before the growth of the Roman Empire, an idea in contrast to the view accepted by historians of the time that linguistically German communities only settled in the area during the reign of the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] in the ninth century CE, pushing out the pre-existing linguistically Celtic groups.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=66}}

===Runes and the Armanenschaft===

List believed that the basic teachings of Wotanism were found in the runic alphabet, believing that they could be deciphered by linking these letters with particular runic spells which appear in the Old Norse ''[[Havamal]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=50|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=115}} He claimed to have deciphered these secret meanings himself, translating them as statements such as "Know yourself, then you know everything", "Do not fear death, he cannot kill you", "Marriage is the root of the Aryan race!", and "Man is one with God!"{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=50}} List emphasised the importance of a [[mysticism|mystical]] union between humans and the universe,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=50}} viewing divinity as being [[immanence|immanent]] in nature, with all life being an emanation of it.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=50|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=42}} Connected to this, he believed in a close identification between the racial group &amp;ndash; the ''[[Volk (German word)|volk]]'' or folk &amp;ndash; and the natural world.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=50}} List believed that human beings had an immortal soul, and that it would be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] according to the laws of [[karma]] until eventually uniting with divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=24|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=52}}

[[Image:Armanenrunor i cirkel med siffror vector.svg|thumb|left|180px|"Runic Circle of the [[Armanen runes|Armanen Futharkh]].]]

In the 1890s, List initially devised the idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the ''Armanenschaft'', an idea which had developed into a key part of his thinking by 1908.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=56}} List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of [[Freemasonry]]. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=57|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=112}} He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=57}} In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=68&amp;ndash;69}} He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as ''kala''.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=24|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=70}}

List claimed that after the Christianisation of Northern Europe, the Armanist teachings were passed down in secret, thus resulting in their transmission through later esoteric traditions such as Freemasonry and [[Rosicrucianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=58|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=115}} He also claimed that the Medieval [[Knights Templar]] had been keepers of these Armanist secrets, and that they had been persecuted by the Christian establishment as a result of this; he believed that the deity they were accused of worshiping, [[Baphomet]], was actually a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] of the [[Maltese Cross]] representing Armanist  teachings.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=61&amp;ndash;62}} According to List, a number of prominent [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] &amp;ndash; including [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Johannes Trithemius]], [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]], and [[Johann Reuchlin]] &amp;ndash; were also aware of this ancient Armanist teaching, with List claiming that he was actually the reincarnation of Reuchlin.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1pp=62&amp;ndash;63|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2p=114}} In addition, List claimed that in the eighth century, Armanists had imparted their secret teachings to the Jewish [[rabbi]]s of [[Cologne]] in the hope of preserving them from Christian persecution; he believed that these teachings became the [[Kabbalah]], which he therefore reasoned was an ancient German and not Jewish innovation, thus legitimising its usage in his own teachings.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=63|2a1=Rudgley|2y=2006|2pp=113&amp;ndash;114}} Rudgley stated that this "tortuous argument" was used to support List's anti-semitic agenda.{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=113}}

===Millenarian views===

List generally saw the world in which he was living as one of degeneration,{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} comparing it with the societies of the Late Roman and Byzantine Empires.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=83}} He bemoaned the decline of the rural peasantry through urbanisation, having witnessed how Vienna's population tripled between 1870 and 1890, resulting in overcrowding, a growth in diseases like [[tuberculosis]], and a severe strain on the city's resources.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=82&amp;ndash;83}} A staunch monarchist, he opposed all forms of [[democracy]], [[feminism]], and modern trends in the arts, such as those of the [[Vienna Secession]]ists.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} Influenced by the Pan-Germanist politician [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] and his [[Away from Rome!]] movement, List decried the growing influence of linguistically Slavic communities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=81}} He was opposed to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] and large-scale enterprise, instead favouring an economic system based on small-scale artisans and craftsmen, being particularly unhappy with the decline in tradesmen's [[guilds]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=81&amp;ndash;82}} He was similarly opposed to the modern banking sector and financial institutions, deeming it to be dominated by Jews; in criticising these institutions, he expressed anti-semitic sentiments.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} Such views of the country's economic situation were not uncommon in Austria at the time, having become particularly widespread following the [[Panic of 1873]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=82}} The later Heathen and runologist [[Stephen Flowers|Edred Thorsson]] noted that List's "theories were to some degree based on the anti-semitic dogmas of the day",{{sfn|Thorsson|1984|p=15}} while Hammer stated that the Ariosophic tradition promulgated by List and others was "unambiguously racist and anti-semitic".{{sfn|Hammer|2015|p=352}}

List believed that the degradation of modern Western society was as a result of a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party,{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=83}} an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=25}} Adopting a [[millenarianism|millenarianist]] perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=85}} In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a [[golden age]] for the new Ario-German Empire.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=86}} Toward the war's end, he believed that the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society.{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1p=25|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2pp=88&amp;ndash;89}} For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=78&amp;ndash;79}} Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the [[House of Habsburg]],{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=65}} with a revived [[feudalism|feudal]] system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=64}} In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|pp=63&amp;ndash;64}} He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=51}}

==Influence and legacy==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="[It was] Guido von List, [a] Viennese mythomaniac who, more than anyone else, laid the foundations for the romantic blend of ideas that links these proto-Nazis uncannily with the [[Green politics|Greens]] and [[New Age|New-Agers]] of today: an interest in natural living, vegetarianism, anti-industrialism, an appreciation of prehistoric monuments and the wisdom of those who built them; a feeling for astrology, earth energies, and natural cycles; a religious outlook vaguely resembling that of Theosophy."|source=— Historian of esotericism Joscelyn Godwin, 1996.{{sfn|Godwin|1996|p=49}} }}

Writing in 2003, the historian of religion [[Mattias Gardell]] believed that List had become the "revered guru of Ariosophic paganism".{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=23}} Gardell considered the Austrian esotericist to have been "a legend in his lifetime",{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=25}} with List's ideas being embraced by many ''völkisch'' groups in Germany.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} German members of the List Society included [[Philipp Stauff]], [[Karl Hellwig]], [[Georg Hauerstein]], [[Bernhard Koerner]], and [[Eberhard von Brockhusen]], who were founding members of the [[Reichshammerbund]] and [[Germanenorden]]; through the Germanenorden's [[Munich]] offshoot, the [[Thule Society]], a lineage can be drawn between the List Society and the early [[Nazi Party]] as it was established after World War I.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} 
Goodrick-Clarke opined that "this channel of influence certainly carries most weight in any assessment of List's historical importance."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} The scholar of Western esotericism [[Joscelyn Godwin]] expressed the view that List was one of the "three godfathers of Nazi Thule" alongside Liebenfels and [[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]],{{sfn|Godwin|1996|p=48}} while Rudgley went further by claiming that List's vision of a future German Empire constituted "a blueprint for the Nazi regime".{{sfn|Rudgley|2006|p=115}}

Other German ''völkisch'' figures promoted Listian ideas to the wider public during and after the First World War.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=45}} Further individuals &amp;ndash; notably [[Rudolf John Gorsleben]], [[Werner von Bülow]], [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]], [[Herbert Reichstein]], and [[Frodi Ingolfson Werhmann]] &amp;ndash; took List's Ariosophical ideas alongside those of Liebenfels and built upon them further, resulting in a flourishing Ariosophical movement in the late 1920s and 1930s, with some of these individuals being within the coterie of prominent Nazi [[Heinrich Himmler]] and influencing the symbolism and rituals of the [[SS]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=46}} His was also exerted an influence on the Australian Odinist and Ariosophist [[Alexander Rud Mills]].{{sfn|Asbjørn Jøn|1999|p=78}}

Both Goodrick-Clarke and later the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein described List as "the pioneer of ''völkisch'' rune occultism",{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2004|1p=50|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=42}} with the latter adding that "the roots of modern esoteric runology are found in Guido List's visions."{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=114}} In 1984, Thorsson expressed the view that List's impact was such that he was "able to shape the runic theories of German magicians (although not necessarily their ''political'' ones) from that time to the present day."{{sfn|Thorsson|1984|p=15}} In 1976, two longstanding activists in the ''völkisch'' and far-right milieu, Adolf and Sigrun Schleipfer, established the Armanen-Order in order to revive List's ideas, adopting a strong anti-modernist stance and a desire to revive pre-Christian religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2015|1p=353|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=55}} It was through the Armanen-Order that Thorsson, who joined it, learned about List's work.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=81}} Thorsson then spearheaded "the post-war runic revival",{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=116}} founding an initiatory organisation known as the Rune Gild in 1980.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=116}} Thorsson was responsible for translating a number of List's works into English, alongside those of other ''völkisch'' mystics like [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gardell|1y=2003|1pp=162, 322|2a1=Schnurbein|2y=2016|2p=82}} These publications brought awareness of List to an English-speaking readership,{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=81}} with his 1988 translation of List's ''The Secret of the Runes'' initiating a surge of interest in Ariosophy among the Heathen community of the United States.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=117}} List's runology also made an appearance in [[Stephan Grundy]]'s 1990 book ''Teutonic Magic''.{{sfn|Schnurbein|2016|p=118}}
List's Armanist ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the American Odinist militant [[David Lane (white nationalist)|David Lane]],{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=201}} with [[Wotansvolk]], a group that List was involved in establishing, viewing their own activism as a continuation of that begun by List.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodrick-Clarke|1y=2003|1p=275|2a1=Gardell|2y=2003|2p=208}} List was also of interest to the Heathen [[Michael C. Moynihan|Michael Moynihan]], who spent time visiting the places in Austria that are associated with List's life.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=300}}

'''Herminio Wenceslao Chávez Guerrero''' (1918–2006) was a Mexican teacher, historian, man of letters, and playwright. His works and teaching activities earned him many awards nationally and internationally.

He began writing novels while working as a teacher at the [[Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College]], now named Escuela Normal Rural Raúl Isidro Burgos after the Mexican poet, and Chávez's mentor, [[Raúl Isidro Burgos]]. One of Chávez's outstanding works was ''Suriano'', which earned him a Rockefeller Literature Grant for 1951–1952, placing him among the first generation of grant winners, along with such other Mexican writers as [[Juan José Arreola]], [[Emilio Carballido]], [[Rubén Bonifaz Nuño]], and [[Sergio Magaña]], all under the guidance of the writer [[Alfonso Reyes]], who served as the first president of the Literary Council of the Mexican Writers' Center. Also noteworthy among Chávez's novels are ''El Río Balsas tiene sed'', published in 2005,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fallece Herminio Chávez Guerrero|url = http://www.diario21.com.mx/?cmd=displaystory&amp;story_id=3332&amp;format=html|website = Diario 21|accessdate = 2015-05-26|first = Alejandro|last = Aparicio|date = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Montañeros'', published in 1964.

Born in [[Tepecoacuilco de Trujano]], [[Guerrero]], [[Mexico]] on 28 September 1918, Chávez died in [[Mexico City]] on 20 November 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today he is considered a distinguished son of Guerrero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27208">The art of [[juggling]] has existed in various cultures throughout history. The beginning is uncertain. The first depictions were found in ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome, as well as medieval and modern societies.

== Ancient Egypt ==
[[File:Illustrerad Verldshistoria band I Ill 013.jpg|thumbnail|250px|This [[Egypt]]ian wall painting from the wall of Tomb 15 at Beni Hassan appears to depict [[Toss Juggling|toss jugglers]].]]

The earliest  record of [[toss juggling]] is a painting on the wall of Tomb 15 in Egypt's [[Beni Hasan]] cemetery complex. This tomb belonged to [[Baqet III]], a provincial governor of Menat-Khufu (present day [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]]) during the later years of the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt]].&lt;ref name=CAH&gt;[http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139054256&amp;cid=CBO9781139054256A015], [[William C. Hayes]], in ''[[The Cambridge Ancient History]]'', vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-077915}}, p.&amp;nbsp;471.&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts female dancers and acrobats juggling up to three balls, and one of the girls is juggling with her arms crossed.

In another Beni Hasan painting, four girls are playing a juggling game in which two girls throw and catch a ball while being carried on the backs of the others. Arthur Watson, in his 1907 article for ''The Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist'', suggests that if a player dropped the ball in this game, it became that player’s turn to become the bearer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SA7OAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=XAfa6kJ4Ci&amp;dq=%22Jugglers.%22%20The%20Reliquary%20and%20Illustrated%20Archaeologist&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Watson, Arthur. "Jugglers." ''The Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist.'' Volume 13, January 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brooklyn Museum]] associate curator Dr. Robert Bianchi suggests that the appearance of jugglers in the Beni Hassan tomb may be "an analogy between balls and circular mirrors, as round things were used to represent solar objects, birth and death." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juggling.org/jw/86/2/egypt.html], Gillen, Billy. "Remember the Force, Hassan!" ''Juggler's World'', Volume 38 Issue 2, Summer 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient China ==

References to jugglers in Chinese literature from the [[Spring and Autumn period]] indicate that toss juggling was a well-developed form of ancient Chinese art.

Xiong Yiliao ({{zh|t=熊宜僚|p=Xióng Yiliáo}}), was a Chu warrior who fought under [[King Zhuang of Chu]] (ruled 613-591 BC) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. Ancient Chinese annals state that he practiced nòngwán, "throwing multiple objects up and down without dropping".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdic.net/cd/ci/7/ZdicE5ZdicBCZdic84322888.htm] Zdic.net: 弄丸&lt;/ref&gt; During a battle in about 603 BC between the states of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Song (state)|Song]], Xiong Yiliao stepped out between the armies and juggled nine balls, which so amazed the Song troops that all five hundred of them turned and fled, allowing the Chu army to win a complete victory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=rmErT7njDI2I2gXG6qH1Dg&amp;id=k0MMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=chinese+acrobatics+through+the+ages&amp;q=xiong+yiliao#search_anchor] Chinese Acrobatics Through the Ages, by Fu Qifeng&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/4376749.htm] 熊宜僚:　楚庄王时勇士&lt;/ref&gt; As Xu Wugui recounts in Chapter 24 of the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]], “Yiliao of Shinan juggled balls, and the conflict between the two states was ended.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/zhuangzi/xu-wu-gui#n2917] Zhuangzi, translated by James Legge, Xu Wu-gui, verse 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/39-1/39-1,p42.htm] All our Yesterdays: Juggle Magazine, Spring 1987, pg 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanzi ({{zh|t=蘭子|p=Lánzi}}), another juggler from the Spring and Autumn period who is mentioned in the Chinese annals, lived during the reign of Duke Yuan of [[Song (state)|Song]] (531-517 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-song.html], Song history listing dates for Duke Yuan&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly translated, Chapter 8 of the [[Liezi]], an ancient collection of [[Daoist]] sayings, reads as follows:
:In the State of Song there lived a man named Lanzi, who sought favor from Lord Yuan of Song for his skills. Lord Yuan of Song summoned him, and he performed on stilts that were twice as long as his body and attached to his legs. He walked and ran on them, and he also juggled seven swords, alternately throwing them and always keeping five swords in the air. Lord Yuan was amazed, and at once he granted Lanzi gold and silk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=37533] Liezi: Shuofu (列子說符), Chapter 8, paragraph 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Independent translation adapted from ''Zhang, Z. "Liezi Zhu (列子注)." Shijiazhuang: Hebei Renmin Chubanshe, 1986.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage states that Lanzi juggled the [[jian]], a straight, double-edged sword which was used during the Spring and Autumn period.  According to Jian Zhao in ''The Early Warrior and the Birth of the Xia'', Lanzi was a general term for itinerant entertainers in pre-Qin and Han times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nucba.ac.jp/themes/s_cic@cic@nucba/pdf/njlcc032/02ZHAO.pdf] Jian Zhao, ''The Early Warrior and the Birth of the Xia'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Greece ==
[[File:Juggling MAR Palermo NI2097.jpg|thumb|Seated girl juggling. Fragmented tondo of an [[Attica|Attic]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], 470–460 BCE, Regional Archaeological Museum "Antonio Salinas", Palermo, 3d floor, Greek ceramics.]]

Guhl and Koner, in ''The Life of the Greeks and Romans'', describe the jugglers of [[ancient Greece]]:
:Jugglers of both sexes, either single or in gangs, were common all over Greece, putting up their booths, as Xenophon says, wherever money and silly people could be found. These frequently amused the guests at drinking-feasts with their tricks. The reputation of this class of people was anything but above suspicion, as is proved by the verse of [[Manetho]] (“Apotheles,” iv., 276), in which they are described as the “birds of the country, the foulest brood of the city.” Male and female jugglers jumped forward and backward over swords or tables; girls threw up and caught again a number of balls or hoops to the accompaniment of a musical instrument; others displayed an astounding skill with their feet and toes while standing on their hands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2c1PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Guhl, Ernst Karl, and Koner, Wilhelm David. ''The Life of the Greeks and Romans: Described from Antique Monuments'' 1896, pg 270-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juggling, acrobatics, and other games of skill appear frequently in Greek and Etruscan tomb reliefs, coins, and vases. A [[terracotta]] statuette from [[Hellenistic]] [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] shows a man balancing balls on his knee and head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=20jTBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=terracotta+juggler+thebes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N_l64OMFCP&amp;sig=OhyvuTK0-Trrf-sGrNuAQGKgtz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlu_HC7-7JAhXC0h4KHc-KAyEQ6AEIETAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Masseglia, Jane. Body Language in Hellenistic Art and Society. Oxford University Press, 2015. Fig. 4.8, pg 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example, a vase from Nola in the British Museum dating to 430 BC, shows a seated woman juggling two balls.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In his ''Symposium'', set in 421 BC, the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] describes the appearance of a dancing girl at a dinner presided over by [[Socrates]]. Xenophon writes:
:And at the instant her fellow with the flute commenced a tune to keep her company, whilst someone posted at her side kept handing her the hoops till she had twelve in all. With these in her hands she fell to dancing, and the while she danced she flung the hoops into the air - overhead she sent them twirling - judging the height they must be thrown to catch them as they fell in perfect time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/Xenophon-sym.asp], Xenophon, ''Symposium'', Chapter II, translated by H. G. Dakyns.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman Empire ==
Many archaeological depictions of juggling in [[ancient Rome]] have been discovered. A monument with an inscription to Septumia Spica in the collection of the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]] depicts two relief carvings of a man toss juggling five balls while manipulating two more with his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lombardiabeniculturali.it/stampe/schede/M0230-00059/], Lombardia Beni Culturali, Monumento di Settimia Spica&lt;/ref&gt; A similar relief carving in Maffei’s Museum Veronense of a consul giving the signal for the circus games to begin includes a detail showing a [https://archive.org/stream/museumveronenseh00maff#page/110/mode/2up boy toss juggling five balls].

In addition to images depicting juggling, several Roman writers mention jugglers. For example, [[Marcus Manilius]] described jugglers in an astrological calendar, writing that a juggler's "quick hands supplied a constant stream of balls to his feet with which he played and ball after ball poured over the limbs of his body.”{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

A second century AD epitaph honors a juggler named Ursus. (Note: Although many juggling history sources refer to this man as Ursus Togatus, the word [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/togatus ''togatus''] in this case merely indicates that Ursus was a [[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]] who could wear a [[toga]].) As opposed to the “pilarii” (toss jugglers), Ursus was a “pilecrepus,” apparently performing body bounces and catches with a single ball.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His inscription reads:
:Ursus, the first Roman citizen to play properly with a glass ball with my players, to the great clamoring of the approving crowd in the baths of Trojan, Agrippa and Titus and especially in the baths of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/to-play-properly-with-a-glass-ball/], CIL Vol. 6, Inscription 9797, lines 1-6, translated in C. McClellan, Murray. “To Play Properly With A Glass Ball” ''Expedition Magazine'' 27.2 August 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist Murray McClellan describes a [[millefiori]] glass ball on display at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Penn Museum]] which was probably used in a juggling game called [[Trigon (game)|trigon]], and it may have been the same game described in the Ursus inscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/to-play-properly-with-a-glass-ball/], McClellan, Murray. "“To Play Properly With A Glass Ball”" ''Expedition Magazine.'' Penn Museum, August 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rules of trigon are not fully understood, it appears to have involved three players posted at the corners of a triangle throwing multiple balls back and forth as fast as possible, catching them with one hand and tossing them back with the other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/jstor-282704], McDaniel, "Some Passages concerning Ball-Games"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quintilian]], in his ''Institutes of Oratory'', draws a parallel between the skill of an orator who scans ahead in his reading to that of a juggler, writing:  
:Hence the possibility of those wonderful tricks of performers on the stage with balls and of other jugglers, whose dexterity is such that one might suppose the things which they throw from them to return into their hands of their own accord, and to fly whithersoever they are commanded to go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhetoric.eserver.org/quintilian/10/chapter7.html], Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'', Book 10, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidonius Apollinaris]], a Roman officer leading a legion in the French province of Niemen, wrote in his letters that he enjoyed juggling three or four balls as a hobby for his own satisfaction and to entertain his companions in the legions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Roman poet [[Martial]] describes a juggler named Agathinus who performed a unique shield manipulation routine:
:The skill of Agathinus, the master juggler, is overwhelming. With swift limbs he hurls the shield up in the air and catches it on his foot, on his back, on his head and on his fingertips, although the stage is slippery from sprinkles of perfume and the wind blows hard; it seems as though he is trying to avoid the shield, which is seeking his body of its own accord. To keep the shield in constant motion is child’s play for Agathinus; to drop it would take practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TgPJfgToMpMC&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=The%20skill%20of%20Agathinus%2C%20the%20master%20juggler%2C%20is%20overwhelming.&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Martial. ''Epigrams, Book 9, No 38''. Translated by Christer Henriksén, ''A Commentary on Martial''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tractate Sukkah of the Talmud says that [[Simeon ben Gamliel|Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel]] (10 BC to 70 AD) could “take eight fire torches and throw them in the air and catch one and throw one and they did not touch one another.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.53a?lang=en&amp;layout=block&amp;sidebarLang=all], Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 53a.&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention of torch juggling from around the third century AD appears in the letters of [[Alciphron]], where an incident is described involving a woman whose husband “was attached to the Ionian lass who tosses balls and juggles torches.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loebclassics.com/view/alciphron-letters_book_iii_letters_parasites/1949/pb_LCL383.237.xml], Aliciphron, Letters of Parasites, Letter 36. Translated by A. R. Benner, F. H. Fobes. Loeb Classical Library 383. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ancient mention of knife juggling comes from the early Church father [[Chrysostom]], who in [[Antioch]] around AD 450 witnessed jugglers “tossing up knives in rapid succession into the air and catching them by the handle.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TJcHAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;ots=9W62zwXTPB&amp;dq=Christopher%20Wordsworth%2C%20A%20Church%20History%2C%20chrysostom%20juggler&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Christopher Wordsworth, ''A Church History'', pg 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval Europe ==
In the Middle Ages juggling was one of many skills performed by entertainers and buffoons. Representations of juggling in the Middle Ages may be found in illuminated manuscripts in the British Museum. One manuscript (Cotton MS. Tib. C. vi, folio 30 v.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=cotton_ms_tiberius_c_vi_f030v Digitized image, British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;), from an eleventh century book on the life of Christ, shows an attendant of King David juggling three balls with his right hand and three knives with his left.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SA7OAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=XAfa6kJ4Ci&amp;dq=%22Jugglers.%22%20The%20Reliquary%20and%20Illustrated%20Archaeologist&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Fig. 8, pg 9 of Watson, Arthur. "Jugglers." ''The Reliquary and Illustrated Archaeologist.'' Volume 13, January 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; William the Conqueror’s minstrel [[Taillefer]] is recorded as performing a simple juggling trick with his sword at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, throwing and catching it, and then killing an English soldier.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Boke of Saint Albans, published in England in 1486, mentions a “Neverthriving of Jugglers” as part of a list of collective nouns. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924031031184/page/n113?ref= Boke of Saint Albans, pg 115, digitized image]&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends and epic sagas from medieval folklore mention juggling. The Irish hero [[Cuchulainn]] is described “keeping nine apples, and his shield, and his sword in the air, that none of them fell to the ground.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cuch/lgc14.htm], Cuchulain of Muirthemme: The Story of the Men of the Red Branch of Ulster, translated by Lady Augusta Gregory, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Togail Bruidne Dá Derga|The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel]], a juggler named Tulchinne is described with “nine swords in his hand, and nine silvern shields, and nine apples of gold.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/49/3/16.html], Epic and Saga: The Destruction of Dá Derga’s Hostel. Charles W Eliot, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1528, [[Babur|Emperor Babur of Hindustan]] described in his memoir a group of jugglers simultaneously spinning seven rings on their forehead, thighs, fingers, and toes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ztbAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=1528%20jugglers%20wooden%20rings&amp;pg=PA395#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Memoirs of Zehir-Ed-Din Muhammed Baber: Emperor of Hindustan&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Aztec]] antipodist jugglers were brought to Europe by [[Hernán Cortés]] and painted by [[Christoph Weiditz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/vistas/vistas_web/gallery/detail/aztec-juggler.htm], Aztec Juggler, Trachtenbuch, 1529. Christoph Weiditz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart Culin in ''Games of the North American Indians'' lists examples of juggling among the [[Naskapi]], [[Eskimo]], [[Achomawi]], [[Bannock people|Bannock]], [[Shoshone]], [[Ute people|Ute]], and [[Zuni people|Zuni]] tribes of North America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v6kQAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA712&amp;ots=JeBWkJaZds&amp;dq=The%20sport%20or%20game%20of%20throwing%20two%20or%20more%20balls%20into%20the%20air%20at%20the%20same%20time%20has%20been%20observed%20among%20the%20Eskimo%20and%20an%20adjacent%20Algonquian%20tribe%2C%20among%20the%20Bannock%2C%20Shoshoni%20and%20Ute%20(Shoshonean)%2C%20and%20among%20the%20Zu%C3%B1i.%20There%20is%20no%20indication%20that%20it%20was%20borrowed%20from%20the%20whites%2C%20and%20further%20investigation%20will%20doubtless%20result%20in%20its%20discovery%20in%20other%20parts%20of%20the%20continent.&amp;pg=PA712#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Culin, Stewart. Games of the North American Indians, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; One example, quoted from George Dorsey, describes a game played by Shoshone women who juggled up to four balls made of mud, cut gypsum, or rounded water-worn stones. Dorsey describes betting contests in which the women raced toward an objective such as a tree or tipi while juggling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/533102?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents], Dorsey, George A.

[[Otedama]] is a traditional Japanese juggling game practiced by women throwing up to five balls in a [[Shower (juggling)|shower pattern]], often while singing rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juggling.org/jw/91/4/otedama.html], Henderson, Ed and Magoo, Poof.

== Modern Juggling ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir 047.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)'' (1879)]]

'''1680 &amp;ndash; [[Germany]]'''&lt;br&gt;
Town Council of [[Nuremberg]] hires a "ball-master" who juggled and taught others juggling and other skills.

'''1768 &amp;ndash; [[England]]'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Philip Astley]] opens the first modern [[circus]]. A few years later he employs jugglers to perform acts along with the horse and [[clown]] acts. From then until the modern day, jugglers have found work and have commonly been associated with circuses.

'''1793 &amp;ndash; [[North America]]'''&lt;br&gt;
[[John Bill Ricketts]] presents America's first circus. In the opening show, watched by [[George Washington]], Ricketts juggled on horseback.

'''1821 &amp;ndash; England'''&lt;br&gt;
[[William Hazlitt]] writes the essay "The Indian Juggler" describing a four ball juggling routine in detail, probably performed by [[Ramo Samee]], considered to be the first modern professional juggler. In his day Ramo Samee was a well-known [[United Kingdom|British]] celebrity.

'''Mid-Late19th century &amp;ndash; Europe and North America''' &lt;br&gt;
[[Variety show|Variety]] and [[music hall]] theatres become more popular, and jugglers are in demand to fill time between music acts, performing in front of the curtain while sets are changed. 
* Performers start specializing in juggling, separating it from other kinds of performance such as sword swallowing and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].
* The Gentleman Juggler style is established by German jugglers such as ''Salerno'' and ''Kara''.
* [[Rubber]] processing is developed and jugglers start using rubber balls. Previously juggling balls were made from balls of twine, stuffed leather bags, wooden spheres or various metals. Solid rubber balls meant that bounce juggling was possible. Inflated rubber balls lead to ball spinning.

'''1883 &amp;ndash; North America'''&lt;br&gt;
In [[Boston]] a new style of variety show is born. The format is a continuous show, the same 8-10 acts repeated over and over, the audience coming and going when they had seen all the acts. This was later known as [[Vaudeville]].

'''1885 &amp;ndash; England''' &lt;br&gt;
[[Paul Cinquevalli]] (1859 &amp;ndash; 1918) made his debut at a circus in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]. Cinquevalli was the first juggling super-star, and was referred to by the British press as the world’s greatest juggler.

'''Late 19th century &amp;ndash; Early 20th century &amp;ndash; North America'''&lt;br&gt;
In the USA the popularity of variety shows and vaudeville shows created great demand for professional jugglers. To distinguish them from other entertainers, jugglers were constantly developing new tricks, props, styles and characters, many of which survive to this day.

Here are some juggling "firsts" from America, based on anecdotal evidence.
* Jim Harrigan was the first tramp juggler, using cigar boxes and balls. He was also one of the first talking comedy jugglers, putting jokes into his routine.
* DeWitt Cook was the first to perform with "[[juggling club]]s". Previously jugglers had only used sticks, torches or knives. Instead Cook juggled 3 Indian Clubs, normally used for arm-swinging exercises. Indian Clubs were made from wood, were very heavy and were shaped like a modern bowling pin. This design is still recognizable in today’s specially manufactured, light, plastic juggling clubs.
* Charles Hoey was the first to juggle 4 clubs, though he could not stop juggling without dropping. When performing on stage the curtain had to be closed while he was still juggling so the audience wouldn’t see him drop.
* Ben Mowatt was the first to juggle 5 clubs.
* Pat McBann was the first to juggle six clubs. He did 4 in one hand and 2 in the other, but died before he had it ready to perform in public.
* John Breen juggled 7 clubs for 35 right-handed throws. Breen also managed other very technical tricks such as a 5 club shower, as well as 5 club cascade with a head balance. He performed 6 clubs on stage. He died aged only 21 in 1912.
* The first record of two-person club passing is in 1885 by the juggling team “The Murdock Bros”. They passed four clubs side-by-side them while standing on pedestals.
* The Devine Bros perform 6 club passing, facing each other, for the first time.
* The Three Mowatts were the first three-person club passing act, first performing in 1895. John Whitfield left the Mowatts to set up his own troupe called the Juggling Johnsons and created the first 4 and 5 person juggling.
* Jack Greene and Joe Piche were the first to pass 8 clubs.

'''1896 &amp;ndash; Siberia'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Enrico Rastelli]] is born. Rastelli (1896–1931) is considered to be one of the greatest jugglers who ever lived. He is recorded as juggling 10 balls (though never 9), 8 sticks (small clubs) and 8 plates. He was also one of the first jugglers to use footballs (soccer balls) and other large rubber balls.

'''1912 &amp;ndash; North America'''&lt;br&gt;
Glow-props are invented. Adolf Behrend, the German Gentleman juggler ''Salerno'' builds a set of clubs with electric lights inside which changed colors as he juggles them.

'''1930-1950 &amp;ndash; Europe and North America'''&lt;br&gt;
Variety and Vaudeville shows start to decline in popularity due to competition from [[motion picture]] theatres, [[radio]] and [[television]].

'''1947 &amp;ndash; North America'''&lt;br&gt;
The [[International Jugglers' Association]] is formed.

The {{nihongo|"Northern Expansion Doctrine"|北進論||'''Hokushin-ron''' or Northern Road}} was a pre-[[World War II]] political doctrine of the [[Empire of Japan]] which stated that [[Manchuria]] and [[Siberia]] were Japan's sphere of interest and that the potential value to Japan for economic and territorial expansion in those areas was greater than elsewhere. Its supporters were sometimes called the ''Strike North Group''. It enjoyed wide support within the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[interwar period]], but was abandoned in 1939 after military defeat on the [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolian]] front at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] (known in Japan as the [[Nomonhan]] incident). It was superseded by the diametrically-opposite rival policy, the {{nihongo|"Southern Expansion Doctrine"|南進論||''[[Nanshin-ron]]'' or Southern Road}}, which regarded [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Pacific Islands]] as Japan's political and economic sphere of influence and aimed to acquire the resources of European [[Colonialism|colonies]] while neutralising the threat of Western military forces in the Pacific.

== Origins ==
From the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in the 1890s, ''Hokushin-ron'' came to dominate Japanese foreign policy. It guided both the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)]] and the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]] which annexed [[Korea]] to Japan.&lt;ref name=Yenne&gt;{{cite book |last=Yenne  |first=Bill |date=2014 |title=The Imperial Japanese Army: The Invincible Years 1941-42 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9c7vCwAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing |pages=17–18, 38 |isbn= 978-1782009320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-5) Field Marshal Prince [[Yamagata Aritomo]], a political and military ideological architect of ''Hokushin-ron'', traced the lines of a defensive strategy against [[Russia]]. A February 1907 Imperial National Defence guideline envisioned two strategies: ''Nanshu Hokushin Ron'' (南守北進, defence in the South and advance in the North) and ''Hokushu Nanshin Ron'' (北守南進, defence in the North and advance in the South).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ramcharan |first= Robin |date=2002 |title=Forging a Singaporean Statehood, 1965-1995: The Contribution of Japan |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iiQuDHmTLk4C |location= |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |series= International Law in Japanese Perspective |volume=Volume 9 |page=75 |isbn=978-9041119520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was intense discourse within Japan on the two diverging theories. Following [[World War I]], Japanese troops were deployed as part of the [[Siberian Intervention]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], with the hope that Japan could be freed from any future Russian threat by detaching Siberia and forming an independent buffer state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Humphreys |first= Leonard |date=1995 |title=The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920's |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vlA3wijPak4C |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=25 |isbn=978-0804723756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese troops remained until 1922, encouraging discussion by Japanese strategic planners of the idea of permanent Japanese occupation of Siberia east of [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref name=Yenne/&gt;

== Japanese invasion of Manchuria ==
{{main|Japanese invasion of Manchuria}}
An essential step in the ''Hokushin-ron'' proposal was for Japan to seize control of Manchuria, so as to obtain an extensive ''de facto'' land border with the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Insubordination]] by rogue Japanese military personnel in the [[Kwantung Army]] in 1931 led to the [[Mukden Incident]] and provided a pretext for the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]]. As the [[Kwantung Army]] had 12,000 men available for the invasion of Manchuria at the time it needed reinforcements. War minister [[Sadao Araki]] was a solid supporter of the ''Hokushin-ron,'' and of a proposed attack on the [[Soviet Far East]] and Siberia. He arranged for [[Chosen Army of Japan|Chōsen Army]] forces to be moved from [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] north into Manchuria without permission from Tokyo in support of the Kwantung Army. The plot to seize Manchuria proceeded as planned, and when presented by the ''fait accompli'', all Prime Minister [[Reijirō Wakatsuki]] could do was weakly protest and resign with his cabinet. When the new cabinet was formed, Araki, as War Minister, was the real power in Japan. A puppet state was formed in [[Northeast China]] and [[Inner Mongolia]]. It was named [[Manchukuo]] and governed under a form of constitutional monarchy.

== Factionalism within the military ==

Hokushin-ron was largely supported by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. General [[Kenkichi Ueda]] was a strong believer in the ''Hokushin-ron'' policy, believing that Japan's main enemy was [[communism]] and that Japan's destiny lay in conquest of the natural resources of the sparely populated north Asian mainland. General [[Yukio Kasahara]] was also a major proponent of the ''Hokushin-ron'' philosophy, feeling strongly that the Soviet Union posed both a major threat and a major opportunity for Japan.

However, rival cliques of officers in the Army claimed to represent the "true will" of the Emperor. The radical [[ultranationalist]] ''[[Imperial Way Faction]]'' (''Kōdōha'') had many young activists who were strongly supportive of the ''Hokushin-ron'' strategy and a [[preemptive strike]] against the Soviet Union. They were opposed by the more moderate conservative ''Control Faction'' (''[[Tōseiha]]''), which favored a more cautious defence expansion and sought to impose greater discipline over the Army and war with [[China]] as a strategic imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Samuels |first=Richard |date=2008 |title=Securing Japan: Tokyo's Grand Strategy and the Future of East Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whqvYdDz3D4C |location= |series=Cornell Studies in Security Affairs |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=27 |isbn=978-0801474903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interservice rivalry#Japan|Relations between the Japanese Army and Navy]] were never cordial, and often marked by deep hostility, a situation whose origin can be traced back to the [[Meiji period]]. From the early 1930s the Army saw the Soviet Union as Japan's greatest threat and for the most part supported the ''Hokushin-ron'' concept that Japan's strategic interests were on the Asian continent. The Navy looked across the [[Pacific Ocean]] and saw the [[United States]] as the greatest threat, and for the most part supported the ''Nanshin-ron'' concept that Japan's strategic interests were in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.&lt;ref name=UNE&gt;{{cite paper |author1=Brian Dollery |author2=Zane Spindler |author3= Craig Parsons |title=Nanshin: Budget- Maximising Behavior, The Imperial Japanese Navy And The Origins Of The Pacific War |publisher=University of New England School of Economics |date=2003 |url= http://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/67850/econ-2003-8.pdf |format=PDF |pages=4 &amp; 12 |accessdate= 27 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s there was the serious possibility of a clash between the Army and Navy due to incompatible expansionist ideas.&lt;ref name=Nish&gt;{{cite book |last=Nish |first=Ian Hill |date=2000 |title=Japanese Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QJCybygKzJIC |location= |publisher=Praeger |series=Praeger Studies of Foreign Policies of the Great Powers |pages=112–113 |isbn=978-0275947910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events of 1936 ==

The Kōdōha faction, which favoured ''Hokushin-ron'', was dominant in the Army during Araki's tenure as Minister of War from 1931 to 1934, occupying most significant staff positions. However, many of its members were replaced by Tōseiha officers following Araki's resignation from ill health in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crowley |first=James B. |date=1962 |title=Japanese Army Factionalism in the Early 1930's |doi= 10.2307/2050676|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |location= |publisher= |issue=3 |volume=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Storry |first=Richard |date=1957 |title=The Double Patriots: A Study of Japanese Nationalism |url= |location= |publisher=Greenwood Press |page= |isbn=9780837166438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Kōdōha-affiliated young Army officers launched an unsuccessful [[coup d'état]] in the [[February 26 Incident]]. As a result, Kōdōha generals were purged from the Army, including Araki, who was forced to retire in March 1936.

The Imperial Defence Plan, formulated in June 1936, incorporated a balance of both ''Hokushin-ron'' and ''Nanshin-ron'', requiring that both the Army and the Navy take a peaceful and unprovocative approach to their "enemies".&lt;ref name=Nish/&gt; The plan's goal was to acquire territories which possessed the raw materials, particularly [[petroleum]], which Japan needed to sustain its growth and economy, but which it did not possess itself. Northward expansion (''Hokushin-ron'') would gain the [[Siberian natural resources|natural resources of Siberia]] by attacking the [[Soviet Union]] via Manchuria. Southward expansion (''Nanshin-ron'') would involve seizing the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and other colonies from the French and/or British.&lt;ref name=UNE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kos&gt;{{cite news |last=Flank |first=Lenny |date=25 Nov 2014 |title=Khalkhin Gol: The Forgotten War Between Japan and the USSR |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/11/25/1329459/-Khalkhin-Gol-The-Forgotten-War-Between-Japan-and-the-USSR |newspaper=Daily Kos |location= |access-date=28 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's supply of resources would eventually be assured by creating a "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]". However, European powers had been dominant in Southeast Asia for more than a century, and Japanese foreign policy had little experience there. In pursuing ''Nanshin-ron'' Japan would risk – and in some quarters even welcome – a large-scale war with the great powers from across the globe.&lt;ref name=Yenne/&gt;

In November 1936 the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] was concluded between Japan and [[Nazi Germany]]. It agreed that in case of an attack by the Soviet Union against Germany or Japan, the two countries agreed to consult on what measures to take "to safeguard their common interests". They also agreed that neither of them would make any political treaties with the Soviet Union, and Germany also agreed to recognize Manchukuo.

== Soviet–Japanese border conflicts ==

{{main|Soviet–Japanese border conflicts}}
A series of Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, without any formal [[declaration of war]], began in 1932. Aggressive actions initiated by Japanese staff and field officers on the Soviet border with Manchukuo and Mongolia led to the disastrous [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] (1939) which resulted in heavy casualties for Kwantung Army and severely challenged its much-vaunted reputation. Any farther expansion northwards into Siberia was shown to be impossible given the Soviet superiority in numbers and armour.&lt;ref name=Kos/&gt; However, General Ueda continued to support the actions of his officers and refused to discourage them from taking similar actions, remaining adamant in his support of the ''Hokushin-ron'' policy. He was recalled back to Japan in late 1939 and forced into retirement. The Kwantung Army was purged of both its more insubordinate elements and its proponents of ''Hokushin-ron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War  |last=Neeno |first=Timothy |date=16 January 2005 |website=Military History Online |publisher= |access-date=28 July 2015  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coox |first=Alvin | authorlink = Alvin Coox |date=1990 |title=Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIAwKiNRmrAC |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |page= |isbn=978-0804718356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abandonment of Hokushin-ron ==
{{main|Kantokuen}}
The Army lost prestige due to its failures in the [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts]]; as a result the Navy gained the ascendency. It was supported in this by a number of the powerful industrial [[Zaibatsu]]s, convinced that they could best serve their interests by fulfilling the needs of the Navy. The military setbacks on the Mongolian front, the ongoing [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and negative Western attitudes towards Japanese expansionist tendencies led to a shift towards ''Nanshin-ron'' in order to procure colonial resources in South East Asia and to neutralize the threat posed by Western military forces in the Pacific. Japan and the USSR signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, freeing Japan for preparations for the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref name=Kos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Till |first1= Geoffrey |last2= Bratton |first2= Patrick |date= 2013 |title= Sea Power and the Asia-Pacific: The Triumph of Neptune? |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |series= Cass Series: Naval Policy and History |page=101 |isbn=978-0415723862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Nazi Germany launched its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Japan did not join its [[Axis powers|Axis]] ally's invasion by opening a second front in the [[Far East]]. Indeed, Japan did not militarily engage with the Soviet Union again until the [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)|USSR declared war on Japan]] in August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;

In his first book, published in Hebrew, Zelkovitz argues that [[Fatah|fatah]] is not a secular political movement, but rather a traditional national liberation movement with religious background. Zelkovitz relates to the importance of Islam in the movement's political discourse and its cultural world.

In his second book, Zelkovitz explores the Palestinian Student Movement from an historical and sociological perspective. This book demonstrates how Palestinian national identity has been built in the absence of national institutions, whilst emphasizing the role of higher education as an agent of social change, capable of crystallizing patterns of national identity.  

The book, was the first one that focuses on the political and social activities of Palestinian students in two arenas—the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian diaspora in the years 1952-2000.&lt;ref name="TLV1 Podcasts 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Palestinian students and the struggle for nationhood: Past and present | website=TLV1 Podcasts | date=16 January 2015 | url=https://tlv1.fm/the-tel-aviv-review/2015/01/16/palestinian-students-and-the-struggle-for-nationhood-past-and-present/ | access-date=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book investigates the shared goal of the several movements in securing independence and the building a sovereign Palestinian state, comparing their development, social impact and the differing challenges each movement faced.

'''Jacinto Barrasa''' (or Barraza) (born at [[Lima]], Peru, early in the seventeenth century; died there, 22 November 1704) was a Peruvian [[Jesuit]] preacher and historian.

In the seventeenth century, the different [[religious order]]s appointed historiographers or official chroniclersnbvb of the work done in their American provinces. The Jesuits selected Father Ignacio Arbieto for their Peruvian missions, but as his account was not accepted, Father Jacinto Barrasa was appointed in his stead. 

==Works==

His fame was principally as a preacher, and two volumes of his "Sermones" were published, one at [[Madrid]] in 1678, the other at Lima in 1679. In the latter year he finished his voluminous history of the Society of Jesus in Peru, which is still at Lima in private hands, and comprises 1,350 pages of manuscript. Its title is: ''Historia de las fundaciones de los colegios y casas de la Compania de Jesus, con la noticia de las vidas y virtudes religiosas de algunos varones ilustres que en ella trabajaron''. No allusions are made in that chronicle to any other events than those of a religious or ecclesiastical nature. 

In addition to his "Sermones", a "Panegirico", pronounced by him in 1669 on the beatification of [[Rose of Lima]], was also printed.

The '''Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]-based corporation which assumes responsibility for maintaining, restoring, renovating and building [[Jews|Jewish]] heritage buildings and monuments on a global scale. It has [[501(c)(3)]] [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status. 

The organization's work is philanthropic in nature, and is focused on restoring and erecting Jewish public buildings and holy sites. Many of its activities are planned in disadvantaged communities, serving to benefit members of all faiths and creeds and promoting inter-racial tolerance and understanding of local heritage. Currently, its focus is set on projects within Romania and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jahf.org/about.asp] Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation - About us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic Undertakings==
===Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum===
[[Image:Simleu Museum Original Project Team.jpg|thumb|left|Original Project Team standing outside Synagogue.]]  
The [[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum]] is located in [[Șimleu Silvaniei]], [[Romania]] and was opened September 11, 2005. The museum is operated and maintained by the Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation of New York and Asociata Memoralia Hebraica Nusfalau - a Romanian [[NGO]], with the support of the [[Claims Conference]], [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], among other philanthropic and pedagogical partners, such as Oliver Lustig, Liviu Beris, Mihail E. Ionescu, Felicia Waldman, Lya Benjamin and Harry Kuller.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The old [[synagogue]] of [[Simleu Silvaniei]] was erected in 1876. In May/June 1944, the area's [[Jewish population]] was forced out of their homes into the brutal [[Cehei ghetto]] and from there packed into cattle cars and transported to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. Over 160,000 [[Jews]] from the region perished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/what_new/data_whats_new/pdf/english/1.10_The_Holocaust_in_Northern_Transylvania.pdf The Holocaust in Northern Transylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; Of those few remaining Jews who survived the Holocaust and remained in Romania, the last Jewish family emigrated from the region during the mid-1960s, while the country was still under Communist rule.  The loss of its congregation left the Synagogue to fate, decaying silently over time.

JAHF launched a vigorous campaign driving the restoration project forward.  Its efforts contributed to raising funds to complete construction, establishing educational criterion, and supported pedagogical training for the regional school systems.  The Museum now functions as an educational hub and essential resource for Holocaust Education in the region. Guided tours tailored to students are offered daily, The museum centerpiece is the synagogue originally built in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Sholam, Alex, [http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/world/?content_id=1452 Romania Opens Shoah Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221824/http://www.totallyjewish.com/news/world/?content_id=1452 |date=2007-09-27 }}, Totally Jewish&lt;/ref&gt;

===Şimleu Silvaniei Multicultural Holocaust Education and Research Center===
[[Image:Simleu Holocaust Education Center.gif|thumb|right|Şimleu Silvaniei Multicultural Holocaust Education and Research Center.]]
In the Spring of 2008, the Museum inaugurated the annex to the [[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum]]: the Şimleu Silvaniei Multicultural Holocaust Education and Research Center.  The facility is now used to host lectures and seminars about the Holocaust, with programs geared to students, teachers and academics. The teacher program encourages and helps teachers to sensitively incorporate the subject of the Holocaust into their curriculum, a discipline sorely lacking in Romania's school system. JAHF is devoted to maintaining operations at the Holocaust Education and Research Center and is a financial supporter of its pedagogical activities.

===Cehei Ghetto Memorial===
[[Image:Cehei ghetto marker.gif|thumb|left|Marker at the site of the makeshift Cehei Ghetto, a former brickyard owned by a local Jewish Family.]]   
The Jews of Sălaj County were concentrated in the Klein Brickyard of Cehei, in a marshy and muddy area about three miles from Şimleu Silvaniei. At its peak in May 1944, the ghetto held about 8,500 Jews.  Among these were the Jews from the communities in the districts of Crasna, Cehu Silvaniei, Jibou, Şimleu Silvaniei, Supuru de Jos, Tăşnad, and Zalău.  Since the brick-drying sheds were rather limited, many of the ghetto inhabitants were compelled to live under the open sky. The ghetto was guarded by a special unit of gendarmes from Budapest and operated under the command of Krasznai, one of the most cruel ghetto commanders in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2005-03-10/pdf/english/chapter_10.pdf Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania Presented to Romanian President Ion Iliescu]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of torture, malnutrition, and a totally inadequate water supply in the ghetto, the Jews of Sălaj County arrived at Auschwitz in such poor condition, so that an unusually large percentage were selected for gassing immediately upon arrival. The deportations from Cehei were carried out in three transports between May 31 and June 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2005-03-10/pdf/english/chapter_10.pdf Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania Presented to Romanian President Ion Iliescu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/cemetery/e-europe/rom-bo.html International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies - Cemetery Project, Romania]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elly Gross|Biography of Elly Gross]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although built structures no longer exist on the site of the former brickyard, the Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation has set up signposts commemorating the events that took place at what is now known as the [[Cehei Ghetto]].  Organized tours frequently visit the site, as scheduled by the [[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum]]  JAHF is currently negotiating the procurement of an Authentic [[Cattle Car]] that was used to transport Jews to the [[Death Camps]], for a permanent exhibit at the site of the former [[ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jahf.org/cehei1.asp Cehei Ghetto Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuşfalău Memorial===
[[Image:Nusfalau Holocaust Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|Nuşfalău Holocaust Memorial designed by Wapniak.]]
The Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation is planning on the construction of a Holocaust Memorial designed by Architect Adam Aaron Wapniak on the site of the old [[Nuşfalău]] Synagogue, directly adjacent to an existing War memorial.  The barren site aptly reflects the absence of the towns once vibrant Jewish population. Serving as a silent memorial to the Holocaust, the message is emboldened through sculptural suggestion and duplicitous abstractions.  Embracing dichotomous design; the steel tracks represent the grotesqueness of the holocaust, as well as the temporal journey of the Jewish people. Resembling a flower; the breach in the tracks is emblematic of incidents of persecution and repression - all the while rising forth, blooming like a lotus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jahf.org/nusfalau1.asp Nuşfalău Holocaust Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Jibou Cemetery Restoration Project===
JAHF has funded the Restoration of the Jewish Cemetery in Jibou, Romania - and has contributed to the care of other outlying cemeteries in the region.  Typical tasks include straightening or righting fallen tombstones, inscription reparation and landscaping of these holy sites.

==Holocaust Documentation==
The Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation has also completed a number of video documentaries, noting the personal accounts of individuals from around the [[Șimleu Silvaniei]] area.  The most notable documentary (currently in editing) features [[Elly Gross]] as she walks through the town of Simleu Silvaniei, giving an account of the Jews who once walked in its streets.

'''Irene Joan Thirsk''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FBA|FRHistS|size=100%|sep=,}} (''[[née]]'' '''Watkins'''; 19 June 1922 – 3 October 2013&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;) was a British [[Economic history|economic]] and [[Social history|social historian]], specialising in the [[history of agriculture]].&lt;ref name="G obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyer|first1=Christopher|title=Joan Thirsk obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/joan-thirsk|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the leading economic and social historians of the 20th century, greatly influencing the methodology and direction of research.  Her most prominent contribution was to pioneer the use of local manuscripts as a source.

==Life==
During the Second World War Joan Watkins worked as an intelligence analyst at [[Bletchley Park]], providing information that assisted Hut 6 in the breaking of the Enigma ciphers and added substantially to the substance of the subsequent intelligence reports. She worked in the Sixta traffic analysis group alongside her future husband Jimmy (30 May 1914 - 2 June 2018).&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;James Thirsk, ''Bletchley Park: An Inmate's Story'', M &amp; M Baldwin, Cleobury Mortimer, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|title=Obituary of Jimmy Thirsk
|date=11 June 2018
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jimmy and Joan married in September 1945 and moved to London, where Jimmy returned to his job as a librarian, initially in Hornsey, north London, and Joan resumed her studies. When Jimmy retired in 1974, they moved first to Oxford, and then, on her retirement, to Hadlow in Kent.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

Her academic career began with assistant lectureship in sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. She was later senior research fellow at the [[University of Leicester]]  from 1951 to 65, and reader in economic history at [[Oxford University]] between 1975 and 1983. She was the editor of ''[[The Agrarian History of England and Wales]]'' (for volumes 4–6) from 1964 to 1972  and in 1974 was appointed general editor of the series.&lt;ref name="Hallas"&gt;Christine S. Hallas, bio entry in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing]'' (edited by Kelly Boyd) pp. 1184-85&lt;/ref&gt;

She sat on the editorial board of ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'' from 1957 to 1992. She was appointed a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA) in 1974 and made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reisz|first=Matthew|title=Joan Thirsk, 1922-2013|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/people/joan-thirsk-1922-2013/2008103.article|newspaper=THE|date=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food history==
Although best known for her agrarian history, Joan Thirsk also had a strong interest in [[food history]], especially in her later years. In 1995 she gave a paper on preserving food to the [[C. Anne Wilson|Leeds Symposium on the History of Food]] which was subsequently published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=C. Anne|title=The Country House Kitchen Garden|date=1997|publisher=Sutton/National Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; She advised on the curation of an exhibition: ''Fooles and Fricasees: Food in Shakespeare’s England'' at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fooles and Fricasees: Food in Shakespeare’s England|date=1999|publisher=Folger Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing an essay: Food in Shakespeare’s England   to the catalogue. Her thought- provoking book Alternative Agriculture (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thirsk|first1=Joan|title=Alternative Agriculture|date=1997|publisher=OUP}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the demand for food in England but her fully-fledged ideas on food history formed the subject of her last major work ''Food in Early Modern England Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500-1760''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thirsk|first1=Joan|title=Food in Early Modern England Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500-1760|date=2007|publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Thirsk surveys the history of English food chronologically, taking information from scientific writers, cookery books, household accounts, and the food of the poor, followed by thematic sections looking closer at regional diets and individual foods. Throughout she tries to consider the diet of all social classes and is intent on dispelling the myth that the food of the bulk of the population at this time was dull and monotonous. Indeed, she argues the opposite- the range of plants and animals eaten at this time was much greater than commonly available today. The poor were diligent in gathering wild herbs and plants and at all levels of society food was discussed and appreciated.
  
Her interest in food history was long evident at a personal level. She baked her own bread and a colleague recalls going to dinner with her in the 1970s and being served barley rolls with the soup- she wanted to see how palatable was pure barley bread (the stable food of many in sixteenth-century [[Southern England]]). All at dinner agreed that it was hard and difficult to eat!

'''Johann Georg Turmair''' (or '''Thurmayr''') (4 July 1477&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 9 January 1534), known by the [[pen name]] '''Johannes Aventinus''' ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]] for "John of [[Abensberg]]"),&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=y |wstitle=Aventinus |volume=3|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Bavaria]]n [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] [[historian]] and [[philologist]]. He authored the 1523 ''Annals of Bavaria'', a valuable record of the early history of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, ed., [http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/a/aventinus.html ''The Nuttall Encyclopædia''], 1907; a modern biography in English is G. Strauss, ''Historian in an age of crisis: the life and work of Johannes Aventinus, 1477-1534'', 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tutor==
Having studied at Ingolstadt, Vienna, Cracow and Paris, he returned to [[Ingolstadt]] in 1507 and in 1509 was appointed tutor to Louis and Ernest, the two younger brothers of [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria]], all three the sons of [[Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria|Albert the Wise]], the late duke of Bavaria. Aventinus retained this position until 1517, wrote a Latin grammar (''Rudimenta grammaticae latinae''; 1512) and other manuals for the use of his pupils, and in 1515 travelled in Italy with Ernest.  In his zeal for learning, he helped found the Sodalitas litteraria Angilostadensis, the "literary brotherhood of Ingolstadt", under the auspices of which several old manuscripts were brought to light;&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; however, it soon ceased to exist (1520).&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt;

==Historian of Bavaria==
In 1517, William appointed him as Bavaria's official historian and commissioned him to write a history of the country.&lt;ref name="cathency"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Johannes Thurmayr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the important authorities which Aventinus collected for this purpose have been preserved only in his copies. He embodied a critical treatment of them in a complete history of Bavaria, ''Annales Bojorum'' ("Annals of Bavaria"). His condensed German version of it, the ''Bayerische Chronik'', is the first important history in the German language.&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt;

==The Reformation==
Aventinus remained a Catholic throughout his life, even though he sympathized with aspects of the Protestant reform.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He was in communication with [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Luther]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} He rejected auricular confession, objected to pilgrimages and indulgences, and opposed the claims of the hierarchy as excessive.&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; He showed a strong dislike for monks. On this account, he was imprisoned in 1528, but his friends soon effected his release. The remainder of his life was somewhat unsettled, and he died at Regensburg.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

==''Annals of Bavaria''==
The ''Annals'', which are in seven volumes, deal with the history of Bavaria in conjunction with general history from the earliest times to 1460, and the author shows sympathy for the Empire in its struggle with the Papacy. He took pains with his work, and to some degree anticipated the modern historiography.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Another result of his nonconformity was that the ''Annals'' were not published until 1554.&lt;ref name="cathency"/&gt; Many passages were omitted in this Ingolstadt edition, as they reflected on the Roman Catholics.&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

A more complete edition was published at Basel in 1580 by Nicholas Cisner. Aventinus, who has been called the "Bavarian Herodotus," wrote other books of lesser importance, and a complete edition of his works was published at Munich (1881–1886).&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

===Teutonic genealogy===
In his ''Chronik'', Aventinus  fabricated a  succession of Teutonic kings stretching back to the [[Deluge myth|Great Flood]], ruling over vast swathes of Germany and surrounding regions until the 1st century BC, and involving themselves in numerous events from Biblical and  Classical history.

These rulers and their exploits are mostly fictitious, though some are derived from mythological, legendary or historical figures. Examples of the latter are Boiger, Kels II and Teutenbuecher, whose joint reign is given as 127–100 BC, and who are based on King Boiorix of the Cimbri, the unnamed king of the Ambrones, and King Teutobod of the Teutons.

== Legacy ==
[[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] had Aventinus' bust erected in the [[Walhalla temple]].
There is a [[Aventinus (beer)|German wheat beer]] named after him, made by G. Schneider &amp; Son.

'''Joseph Maréchal''' (1 July 1878 &amp;ndash; 11 December 1944) was a Belgian [[Jesuit]] priest, philosopher, theologian and psychologist. He taught at the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University of Leuven]] and was the founder of the school of thought called [[transcendental Thomism]], which attempted to merge the theological and philosophical thought of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] with that of [[Immanuel Kant]].

==Life and thought==
Maréchal joined the Jesuits in 1895 and after a doctorate in [[biology]] at Leuven (1905) he first specialized in [[experimental psychology]], spending some time in [[Munich]] with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1911). Until the end of his life Maréchal would say that his real interest was more in psychology than in philosophy.

Prompted by the call of [[Pope Leo XIII]] to revitalize Thomist theology, he started studying in depth the works of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in order to understand the inner coherence of his system, along with the works of other [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers, modern philosophers and scientists of the day. From this, and in particular from Kant’s [[transcendental idealism]], emerged a new and more dynamic Thomism, recapturing the union of ‘act and power’ in Aquinas. The development of his thought can be grasped in the five ''cahiers'' (see bibliography) in which, after exposing the weaknesses of traditional Thomism, he evaluated Kant’s philosophy (3d cahier) with whose help he proposes a modernized Thomism in the 4th and 5th cahier. The work of Maréchal had a great influence on such contemporary theologians and philosophers as Andre Marc, Gaston Isaye, [[:fr:Joseph de Finance|Joseph de Finance]], [[Karl Rahner]], [[Bernard Lonergan]], [[:de:Johannes Baptist Lotz|Johannes Baptist Lotz]], [[Bernard O'Brien (Jesuit)|Bernard O'Brien]] and [[Richard De Smet]].

In the same way, he proceeded to study the psychology of the mystics. Until his death on 11 December 1944 he taught philosophy and experimental psychology at the Jesuit House of Studies in Leuven (St Albert of Leuven's Philosophical and Theological College). He was a great friend of [[Pierre Scheuer]], the Belgian Jesuit who has been described as a metaphysician and mystic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">'''José João da Conceição Gonçalves Mattoso''' (born at [[Leiria]], 1933) is a Portuguese medievalist and university professor.

Mattoso earned his doctoral degree in medieval history from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], in [[Belgium]], in 1966 (with a thesis on the abbey of Pendorada - "L'Abbaye de Pendorada  : des Origines à 1160"), while he was [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] at the Abbey of [[Singeverga]]. He returned to  secular life in 1970, and taught at the "University of Lisbon" and at the "New University of Lisbon". He was also a director of National Archives / Torre do Tombo.

He is recognized in Portugal and internationally as one of the most distinguished scholars of the history of medieval Portugal, and  much of his scholarly work is largely devoted to that period. His works include, among others, "Ricos homens, Infanções e Cavaleiros" (on the medieval society)," Fragments of a Medieval Composition "(in response to the arguments of Antonio Borges Coelho) and f" Identification of A country Essay on the Origins of Portugal (1096–1325) "(Vol. I-'Opposition' vol. II -" Composition "), with five editions constantly revised and updated between 1985 and 1995. Prof. Mattoso was awarded the Alfredo Pimenta prize of Medieval History, and the non-fiction Prize of Pen club for this work. He was also awarded the [[Prémio Pessoa|Fernando Pessoa]] Prize in 1987, among other important distinctions.

He acted as the scientific editor of a "History of Portugal" (1993–1995) in eight volumes.

'''Karl Korinek''' (December 7, 1940 – March 9, 2017) was an [[Austria]]n [[jurist|constitutional scholar]] and educator.
Korinek taught [[law]] at the [[University of Graz]], the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]], the [[University of Vienna]], and the [[Danube University Krems]].
In 1978, Korinek was appointed to the Austrian [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]]; he served as the president of the court from 2003 until his retirement in 2008.

Although a member of the [[Austrian People's Party]] and an outspoken conservative in private life, Korinek was considered non-partisan in his jurisprudence. He clashed with [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] on health care and immigration reform and with [[Jörg Haider]] on minority protection matters; he received praise from political opponents for his firm stance on [[human rights]] issues in general. Korinek has authored several books and more than 250 scholarly papers. Respected across party boundaries, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential legal scholars in recent Austrian history.

== Early life ==

Karl Korinek was born December 12, 1940 in [[Vienna]] as the son of [[Franz Korinek]], a lawyer and future politician, and his wife Viktoria.&lt;ref name="parlcv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parlament.gv.at/WWER/PAD_17148/| title=Dr. Dr. h.c. Karl Korinek| website=[[Austrian Parliament]]| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="danubecv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/imperia/md/content/studium/euro/law/cvfaculty/cv_korinek.pdf| title=Präs. o. Univ.-Prof. i. R. Dr. Karl Korinek: Lebenslauf in Stichworten| website=[[Danube University Krems]]| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korinek grew up [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The family was conservative; Korinek's father joined the [[Austrian People's Party]] after the end of [[World War II]] and went on to become General Secretary of the [[Austrian Economic Chamber]], the national entrepreneurs' and industrialists' advocacy group; he later also served as the [[Ministry of Finance (Austria)|minister of finance]] for a term.&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dirigent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://diepresse.com/home/innenpolitik/5181383/Karl-Korinek_Dirigent-des-VfGH-und-grosser-Staatsrechtsleher| title=Karl Korinek: "Dirigent" des VfGH und großer Staatsrechtsleher| website=[[Die Presse]]| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korinek received his secondary education at the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] [[Mariahilf]], a school with special emphasis on the classical humanities.&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;

== Career ==

Following his graduation from the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in 1958, Korinek enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]] to study [[law]], receiving his [[Doctor of Law|doctorate]] in 1963. He spent the next year working as a trainee at various Viennese courts. In 1964, he went to work as an in-house legal consultant for the [[Austrian Economic Chamber]]. In addition to his day job in the bureaucracy, Korinek continued to pursue an academic career. In 1970, he submitted his [[habilitation]] thesis to the Faculty of Legal and Political Science ({{lang-de|Rechts- und Staatswissenschaften}}) at the [[University of Salzburg]]. In 1973, he left the Chamber to accept an appointment to full professor of public law ({{lang|de|öffentliches Recht}}) at the [[University of Graz]]. After three years in Graz, Korinek returned to the capital to become a professor at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]], a position he held until he moved on to the [[University of Vienna]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steirische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommunikation.steiermark.at/cms/beitrag/11693797/374565/| title=Höchste steirische Auszeichnung für Korinek| website=[[Styria|Land Steiermark]]| date=August 31, 2006| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1997, he also taught at the [[Danube University Krems]].&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;

In addition to his academic commitments, Korinek held a considerable number of extramural positions. From 1986 to 1992, Korinek was president of the [[Austrian Standards Institute]]; from 1987 to 2002, he also sat on the board of the [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]].&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;
In 1999, he became a member of the board of directors of the [[Vienna State Opera]].&lt;ref name="staatsoper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wiener-staatsoper.at/die-staatsoper/aktuelles/detail/news/zum-tod-von-karl-korinek/| title=Zum Tod von Karl Korinek| website=[[Vienna State Opera]]| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecvcv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecv.at/Biolex/Detail/11600324| title=Karl Korinek| website=[[Cartellverband]]| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="komturkreuz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20060217_OTS0144/hoechste-auszeichnung-des-landes-fuer-prof-dr-karl-korinek| title=Höchste Auszeichnung des Landes für Prof. Dr. Karl Korinek| website=[[Austria Press Agency]]| date=February 17, 2006| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the boards of directors of a number of publicly traded companies and [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s,&lt;ref name="ggeab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.at/newsdetail/artikel/grosses-goldenes-ehrenzeichen-am-bande-an-praesident-univ-prof-dr-karl-korinek-und-praesident-dr/| title=Großes Goldenes Ehrenzeichen am Bande an Präsident Univ. Prof. Dr. Karl Korinek| website=[[President of Austria|Office of the President of Austria]]| date=December 13, 2006| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
most notably the [[Uniqa Insurance Group]] and the [[ERSTE Foundation]].&lt;ref name="oecvcv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unabhaengige"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/1277338475613/Unabhaengige-Kandidaten-haben-keine-Chance| title=Unabhängige Kandidaten haben keine Chance| date=July 19, 2010| accessdate=2018-06-07| website=[[Der Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he was invited to join the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vfghcv"/&gt;

In 1978, Korinek was appointed to the Austrian [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]]. He was promoted to vice president of the court in 1999, to president in 2003.&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vfghcv"/&gt; Korinek retired from his university positions and from most other responsibilities when he assumed the presidency. He kept his seat on the board of the State Opera, a side job that was particularly dear to him.&lt;ref name="ggeab"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quart"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.quart-online.at/pdf/quart_2006_02/q2006_02_25.pdf| title=Karl der Große?| magazine=Quart| issue=2| date=2016| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2003, the cabinet of then-[[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] launched the Austria Convention ({{lang|de|Österreich-Konvent}}), a conference of legal scholars and public intellectuals tasked with drafting a new constitution for Austria. The existing constitution, exceptionally bulky and difficult to navigate, had been posing serious technical challenges to legislators and constitutional justices for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv | author-last1=Berka| author-first1 = Walter | title=Verfassungsrecht| edition=6th| publisher=Österreich Verlag| place=Vienna| date=2016| isbn=978-3-7046-7281-0|pages=14−15, 21−22, 52, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention was charged with exploring reform.&lt;ref&gt;Berka (2016), pp. 14−16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://neuwal.com/2015/01/28/was-ist-bzw-war-der-oesterreich-konvent/| title=Was ist bzw. war der Österreich-Konvent?| website=Neuwal| accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Korinek was a member of the Convention from its launch to its conclusion in 2005.&lt;ref name="parlcv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="konventcv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konvent.gv.at/K/ZS/DE/PAD_17148/pad_17148.shtml| title=Dr. Dr. h.c. Karl Korinek| website=Österreich-Konvent| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective May 2008, Korinek retired from the court, citing health reasons.&lt;ref name="dirigent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/oesterreich/politik/261430_Das-Rennen-ist-eroeffnet.html| title=Das Rennen ist eröffnet| website=[[Wiener Zeitung]]| date=April 1, 2008| accessdate=2018-06-07| last=Hämmerle | first=Walter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his career, Korinek wrote several books and more than 250 scholarly articles.&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="staatsoper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ggeab"/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==

Korinek died on March 9, 2017, after a protracted struggle with heart disease.&lt;ref name="staatsoper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vfghcv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vfgh.gv.at/medien/Karl_Korinek_%281940-2017%29__Eine_Stimme_fuer_den_Recht.de.html| title=Karl Korinek (1940–2017): Eine Stimme für den Rechtsstaat| website=[[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Austrian Constitutional Court]]| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korinek is acknowledged as having been one of the Constitutional Court's most influential members during his tenure; he may in fact have been one of the court's most influential members in the institution's entire history.&lt;ref name="vfghcv"/&gt;
Even before he was appointed president of the court, Korinek has had more impact on the court's jurisprudence than would have been typical for a regular member.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tt.com/home/10855001-91/karl-korinek-wird-75---und-will-nicht-mehr-%C3%B6ffentlich-schimpfen.csp| website=[[Tiroler Tageszeitung]]| title=Karl Korinek wird 75 - und will nicht mehr öffentlich schimpfen| date=December 12, 2015| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orftrauer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2830325/| title=Trauer nach Tod von Karl Korinek| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07| website=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commentators credit Korinek with having played a significant role in modernizing the tribunal's jurisprudence on constitutional rights questions;&lt;ref name="jahresbericht"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wu.ac.at/fileadmin/wu/h/structure/about/publications/JB/jahresbericht2005.pdf| title=Jahresbericht der Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien 2005| accessdate=2018-06-06| website=[[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the court itself agrees.&lt;ref name="vfghcv"/&gt;
Korinek is also credited for the fact that the court, under his leadership, has softened its traditional commitment to [[judicial restraint]] and has grown more assertive, protecting [[human rights]] principles more energetically and striking down laws more often.&lt;ref name="quart"/&gt;

Korinek has also been noted for his impact as an educator. Commentators have called him "one of the greats" of Austrian legal instruction.&lt;ref name="dirigent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kleine"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kleinezeitung.at/politik/innenpolitik/5181341/Nach-Herzleiden_Frueherer-VfGHPraesident-Karl-Korinek-76-gestorben| title=Früherer VfGH-Präsident Karl Korinek (76) gestorben| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07| website=[[Kleine Zeitung]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korinek is said to have played a prominent role in shaping the minds of several generations of Austrian jurists.&lt;ref name="unigraz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rewi.uni-graz.at/de/neuigkeiten/detail/article/karl-korinek/| title=Karl Korinek| website=[[University of Graz]]| date=March 14, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been called the "doyen" of Austrian legal scholarship&lt;ref name="wko"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.wko.at/news/oesterreich/Leitl:-Oesterreich-verliert-mit-Karl-Korinek-einen-grosse.html| title=Leitl: Österreich verliert mit Karl Korinek einen großen Staatsrechtler und wertvollen Menschen| website=[[Austrian Economic Chamber]]| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and one of the most distinguished personalities in the country's legal history.&lt;ref name="orftrauer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurier"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kurier.at/politik/inland/frueherer-vfgh-praesident-karl-korinek-gestorben/251.042.329| title=Früherer VfGH-Präsident Karl Korinek gestorben| website=[[Kurier]]| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oeaw.ac.at/oesterreichische-akademie-der-wissenschaften/die-oeaw/article/verfassungsrechtler-karl-korinek-gestorben/| title=Verfassungsrechtler Karl Korinek gestorben| website=[[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]| date=March 13, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==

[[File:Gruppenfoto VfGH 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Austrian Constitutional Court in June 2007; Karl Korinek is seated front row center]]
Korinek was regarded as a committed conservative.
Like his father before him, he joined the [[Austrian People's Party]]; he remained a card-carrying supporter when he was appointed to the Constitutional Court and only withdrew from membership when he was promoted to president.&lt;ref name="dirigent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;
He also was a member of the [[Cartellverband]].&lt;ref name="oecvcv"/&gt;

Throughout his life, Korinek remained a devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.katholisch.at/aktuelles/2017/03/15/karl-korinek-war-vorbild-als-jurist-und-christ| title=Karl Korinek war Vorbild als Jurist und Christ| website=[[Catholic Church in Austria]]| date=March 15, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was active in the Vienna Catholic Academy ({{lang|de|Wiener katholische Akademie}}) and in the Association of Catholic Graduates ({{lang|de|katholischer Akademikerverband}}).&lt;ref name="quart"/&gt;
Korinek credited his [[Christianity]] in general and [[Thomas Aquinas]] in particular with having materially influenced his legal philosophy.&lt;ref name="kirchennet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirchen.net/kbw_intern/section.asp?sec=17&amp;menuopt=archiv&amp;apid=5208| title=Karl Korinek: Der Verfassungsgerichtshof-Präsident in Salzburg bei der Thomas-Feier| website=kirchen.net| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korinek's promotion to president of the Constitutional Court was part of an attempt by then-[[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] to move the court to the right.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.at/a/regierung-verfassungsgerichtshof-linie-15343| title=Regierung will Verfassungsgerichtshof auf Linie bringen| website=[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|NEWS]]| date=June 2, 2001| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His outspoken conservatism and the circumstances of his promotion nonwithstanding, Korinek quickly acquired a reputation for integrity and non-partisan jurisprudence; he came to be widely respected across party lines.&lt;ref name="kurier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kleine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gruene.at/ots/glawischnig-mit-karl-korinek-verliert-oesterreich-einen-vordenker-fuer-die-modernisierung-der-verfassung| title=Glawischnig: Mit Karl Korinek verliert Österreich einen Vordenker für die Modernisierung der Verfassung| website=[[The Greens – The Green Alternative|The Greens]]| date=March 10, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During Korinek's tenure as its president, the Constitutional Court overturned several key pieces of Schüssel's legislative agenda. Also during Korinek's presidency, the court sided with [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] minority right activists in the {{lang|de|Ortstafelstreit}}, a long-running dispute about Slovenian language rights that [[Jörg Haider]]'s [[Austrian Freedom Party|Freedom Party]] had been using to stoke populist resentment. The decision, easily the most controversial in the institution's history, earned Korinek Haider's and the Freedom Party's lasting enmity.&lt;ref name="dirigent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ooen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/politik/innenpolitik/Trauer-um-Spitzenjuristen-Karl-Korinek;art385,2507712| title=Trauer um Spitzenjuristen Karl Korinek| website=[[Oberösterreichische Nachrichten]]| date=March 11, 2017| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korinek became known for a number of signature positions that received praise from both sides of the political spectrum.
He advocated for transparency in government, called for an overhaul of Austria's outsized and convoluted constitution, and demanded that legislators put craftsmanship before ideology in drafting statutes.&lt;ref name="dirigent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurier"/&gt;
He also took a firm stance against government encroachments on constitutional rights.
After his retirement, he became a vocal critic of online surveillance, especially of government-mandated online [[data retention]].&lt;ref name="tt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="falter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.falter.at/archiv/FALTER_200711071704380010/karl-korinek| title=Hero der Woche: Karl Korinek| website=[[Falter]]| date=November 7, 2007| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bigbrother"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbrotherawards.at/2007/Preistraeger| title=Preisträger − Big Brother Awards 2007| website=[[Big Brother Awards]] Austria| accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His criticism of Austria's data retention program proved well founded when, in 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] declared it illegal under European [[human rights]] rules.&lt;ref name="ooen"/&gt;

Korinek supported [[Andreas Khol]] in the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 Austrian presidential election]].&lt;ref name="kleine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000033042316/Khols-Buergerkomitee-mit-Schuessel-Hengstschlaeger-und-Korinek| title=Khols Bürgerkomitee mit Schüssel, Hengstschläger und Korinek| website=[[Der Standard]]| date=March 16, 2016| accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Korinek was married for most of his adult life. He was survived by two children.&lt;ref name="danubecv"/&gt;

Korinek was passionate about music.&lt;ref name="kurier"/&gt; He sang in the [[Vienna State Opera]] choir in his student days; he remained involved in State Opera life throughout his career and well into retirement.&lt;ref name="staatsoper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opernfreunde.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Stretta_April2017_WEB.pdf| title=Im Gedenken an unseren ehemaligen Präsidenten Karli Korinek| website=Freunde der Wiener Staatsoper| date=April 2017| accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in 1999, he served on the board of directors of the opera, one of a handful of positions he did not retire from even when he was made the president of the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref name="oecvcv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ggeab"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurier"/&gt;
Korinek authored books on the relationship between government and the arts, on [[Joseph Haydn]], and on the {{lang|de|[[Der Rosenkavalier]]}}, a comic opera by [[Richard Strauss]].&lt;ref name="kurier"/&gt; In an interview, Korinek compared the work of a legislator to that of a composer: both are striving to combine clarity with harmony, a parallel that Korinek claimed used to be widely discussed and acknowledged in the past.&lt;ref name="komposition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://diepresse.com/home/spectrum/literatur/379681/Komposition-in-Paragrafen| archive-url=https://archive.is/m502| archive-date=2012-07-12| title=Komposition in Paragrafen| last=Ferk | first=Janko| website=[[Die Presse]]| date=April 25, 2008| accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korinek also published a book on the life and times of [[Julius Raab]], which became a local bestseller.&lt;ref name="komposition"/&gt;

The '''Kerma Museum''' is an archeological site museum located in front of the Western Deffufa on the archaeological site of [[Kerma]], in the [[Northern state, Sudan|Northern State]] of [[Sudan]].

==Architecture==
The building of the museum is inspired by the traditional [[Nubian vault]]ed roof. 

==Displays==
[[File:Beelden van Kerma.jpg|thumb|left|The statues of Nubian Pharaohs]]
The museum contains artefacts of the main periods of the Kerma culture: Prehistory, Kingdoms of [[Kerma culture|Kerma]], [[Napata]] and [[Meroë]]. 

The highlight of the ''Kerma Museum'' are seven black granite statues uncovered in a ditch at the nearby site of Dukki Gel in 2003 by an archaeological team headed by Charles Bonnet. Deliberately broken,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jebelbarkal.org/frames/B500statues.pdf The finding of the statue cache in 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; but in an excellent state of preservation, in the central room of the Museum are displayed the entirely reassembled statues portraying the so called Nubian Black Pharaohs [[Taharqa]], [[Tanwetamani]], [[Senkamanisken]], [[Anlamani]], and [[Aspelta]], who ruled Egypt in the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://kerma.ch/en/musee Web site of the Kerma Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of the largest empires''' in [[History of the world|world history]]. [[Rein Taagepera]] has defined an [[empire]] as "any relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign" and its size as the area over which the empire has some undisputed military and taxation prerogatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1979|title=Size and Duration of Empires: Growth-Decline Curves, 600 B.C. to 600 A.D.|jstor=1170959|journal=Social Science History|volume=3|issue=3/4|page=117|doi=10.2307/1170959|last1=Taagepera|first1=Rein}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these are the definitions used by this list.

== Largest empires by land area ==
For context, the total land area of the Earth is {{convert|148940000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|sigfig=5}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo|title=The World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empires at their greatest extent ===
Empire size in this list is defined as the dry land area it controls. Where estimates vary, entries are sorted by the ''lowest'' estimate.

[[File:GD-EG-Caire-AlManyal026.JPG|250px|thumb|Manial Palace, the throne room of [[Mohammed Ali Tewfik]].]]
The '''Manial Palace and Museum''', is a former [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Alawiyya dynasty]] era [[palace]] and grounds on [[Rhoda Island]] on the [[Nile]]. It is located in the Sharia Al-Saray area in the [[El-Manial]] district of southern [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. The palace and estate has been preserved as an Antiquities Council directed [[historic house museum]] and estate, reflecting the settings and lifestyle of the late 19th- and early 20th-century Egyptian royal prince and heir apparent. The residence compound, composed of five separate and distinctively styled buildings, is surrounded by [[Persian garden]]s within an extensive [[English garden|English Landscape garden]] estate park, along a small branch of the Nile.

'''Juan Manuel Martínez Ugarte''' (1 June 1735 – 30 April 1801), known as '''Manuel Risco''' or '''Padre Risco''', was a Spanish historian. Born at [[Haro, La Rioja|Haro]], he took the [[Augustinian]] habit at the [[Convento de Nuestra Señora del Risco]] in the [[Diocese of Ávila]]. He studied at the [[University of Salamanca]] and was a disciple of [[Enrique Flórez]], who took him along with him on his voyages of historical research. On Flórez's death Risco took over the unfinished [[Church history]] of Spain, ''[[España Sagrada]]''. By then he was Jefe de Estudios at the [[Convento de Doña María de Aragón]]. He published thirteen volumes of the ''España Sagrada'', from thirty to forty-two, inclusive. In 1800 ill health forced him to resign from the project and he ended his days at the [[Monasterio de San Felipe el Real]] in [[Madrid]]. He was replaced by [[Juan Fernández de Rojas]] from the same monastery.

'''Packet boats''' were medium-sized boats designed for domestic mail, passenger, and freight transportation in European countries and their [[Colony|colonies]], including North American rivers and canals.  They were used extensively during the 18th and 19th centuries and featured regularly scheduled service.

When such ships were put into use in the 18th century on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and its colonies, the services were called the [[packet trade]].

==History==
Packet craft were used extensively in European coastal mail services since the 17th century, and gradually added cramped passenger accommodation. As early as 1629, the [[Dutch East India Company]] was carrying some passengers on the ill-fated ''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' from [[Texel]] in Holland to [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/maritime-archaeology/batavia-cape-inscription/batavia | title=Batavia's History | publisher=Government of Western Australia | accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, scheduled services were offered, but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. They are even found to be a subject of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s 1724 novel ''[[Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The novel contains numerous references to packet boats, and includes a section entitled "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ObM6AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Sail in packet-boat to Rotterdam]".&lt;/ref&gt; In England the King maintained a weekly packet service with the continent and Ireland using 15 packet vessels.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rNCUMoRsikMC&amp;pg=A120 A Collection of Voyages and Travels, consisting of Authentic Writers in our own Tongue, which have not before been collected in English, or have only been abridged in other Collections]'' Vol I., 1745, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Their importance was evident in the [[Rose Hill Packet]] becoming the first craft built in the colony of New South Wales in 1789.

Over the two centuries of the sailing packet craft development, they came in various rig configurations which included: [[schooner]]s, [[Hermaphrodite brig|schooners-brigs]], [[sloop]]s, [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], [[brig]]s, [[brigantine]]s, [[lugger]]s, [[felucca]]s, [[galley]]s, [[xebec]]s, [[barque]]s and their ultimate development in the [[clipper|clipper ships]]. Earlier they were also known as [[dispatch boats]], but the service was also provided by privateers during time of war, and on occasion chartered private yachts. News of "record passages" was eagerly awaited by the public, and the craft's captain and crew were often celebrated in the press. Behind this search for [[sailing faster than the wind]] however lay the foundations for a development in naval architecture and its science which would serve until the appearance of the steam vessels.

In 1863, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the packet boat ''Marshall'' carried the body of Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson]] from [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] to his home in [[Lexington, Virginia]] for burial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarnews.com/archive/articles/packetboat.htm Deborah Fitts, "Hull of Packet Boat That Carried Jackson's Body Is Protected"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907230730/http://www.civilwarnews.com/archive/articles/packetboat.htm |date=2008-09-07 }}, Civil War News, Jan 2007, accessed 22 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canal packet boats===
The American canal packet boats were typically narrow (about 14 feet) to accommodate canals, but might be 70–90 feet long. When the [[Erie Canal]] opened in New York state in 1825 along the [[Mohawk River]], demand quickly rose for travelers to be accommodated. Canal packet boats included cabin space for up to 60 passengers. Unlike European and American sailing vessels, that sought to attain greater speed under sail, the canal packet boats were drawn through the Erie Canal by teams of two or three horses or mules. Compared to overland travel, the boats cut journey time in half and were much more comfortable. Travelers could get from New York City to Buffalo in ten days, with a combination of sailing and packet boats. Some passengers took the boats to see both the Erie Canal and the natural landscapes. Significantly, thousands of others used packet boats to emigrate to [[Ohio]] and other parts of the [[Midwest]]. These boats were also instrumental in the settling of and travel within [[Upstate New York]] through the branch canals such as the [[Chenango Canal]].
Packet boats were also popular along the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] in Virginia, allowing travel beyond the falls upriver.

==Mail steamer==
{{see also|J. W. Westcott II}}
[[File:18th-century packet boat used for postal service.jpg|thumb|An 1825 book plate depicting a typical packet boat]]

''Mail steamers'' were [[steamship]]s which carried the mail across waterways, such as across an ocean or between islands, primarily during the 19th century and early 20th century, when the cost of sending a letter was declining to the point an ordinary person could afford the cost of sending a letter across great distances. In addition to carrying mail, most mail steamers carried passengers or cargo since the revenue from the mail service, if any, was insufficient by itself to pay for the cost of its travel.

However, the advantage for a steamship carrying mail was that its arrival would be advertised in advance in the newspapers, thus giving it "free advertising" as a travel option for passengers or cargo. In most cases, mail carried by mail steamers was delivered to the post office to which it was addressed. In some cases, the incoming mail would be advertised in the local newspaper for pickup at the post office or at the steamship's office for a fee, if not already fee-paid.

Occasionally, because of political instability when a post office could not provide normal services, incoming mail from a mail steamer would be delivered to a local delivery service, which would deliver the mail and charge the addressee an extra fee for the service. When this occurred, the local delivery service would place its own local service stamp or mark on the envelope when the extra fee was paid.

=== Universal Postal Union regulations ===

Mail carried by these steamers – sometimes known as paquebot mail – was subject to various regulations by the governments involved as well as the [[Universal Postal Union]]'s (UPU) regulations stated at the UPU [[Vienna]] Conference of 1891.

==Aircraft namesake==
The [[Fairchild C-82 Packet|C-82 Packet]] twin-engined, twin-boom cargo aircraft designed and built by Fairchild Aircraft was named as a tribute to the packet boat.{{cn|date=July 2018}} It was used by the United States Army Air Forces and the successor United States Air Force following World War II.

[[Image:Countour gauge w pot.JPG|thumb|A contour gauge set to the profile of a little pot]]
[[Image:Contour gauge.JPG|thumb|A contour gauge]]

A '''profile gauge''' or '''contour gauge''' is a tool for recording the [[cross-section (geometry)|cross-sectional shape]] of a surface. Contour gauges consist of a set of [[steel]] or [[plastic]] pins that are set tightly against one another in a frame which keeps them in the same plane and parallel while allowing them to move independently, perpendicularly to the frame. When pressed against an object, the pins conform to the object. The gauge can then be used to draw the profile or to copy it on to another surface.

The '''Prophecy of Seventy Weeks''' is a passage in the Book of Daniel (chapter 9) in which the angel [[Gabriel]] explains to Daniel the meaning of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], who had written that the "desolation" of Jerusalem would be completed after 70 years (Jeremiah 29:10 and 25:11-12). Daniel turns to God and asks when Jeremiah's word is to be accomplished. Gabriel comes to explain that the 70 years of Jeremiah will in fact be 70 "sevens", and gives a cryptic summary of what will happen during this time. The prophecy has proved notoriously difficult for interpreters, leading to its reputation as the "dismal swamp" of critical [[exegesis]].{{sfn|Tanner|2009a|p=181}}

== Summary ==

In the first year of [[Darius the Mede]], Daniel reads in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] that the desolation of Jerusalem would be completed after seventy years (verses 1-2). He prays to God to end his anger and let his face shine upon the desolate sanctuary: "O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and act and do not delay!" (verses 3-19). The angel Gabriel appears and tells Daniel that he has come to give wisdom and understanding, for at the beginning of Daniel's prayer a "word" went out. (verses 20-23) The angel then gives this [[revelation]] (verses 24-27):

{{quote|{{sup|24}} Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city: to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.&lt;br&gt; {{sup|25}} Know therefore and understand: from the time that the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time of an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks; and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with streets and moat, but in a troubled time.&lt;br&gt; {{sup|26}} After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing, and the troops of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed.&lt;br&gt; {{sup|27}} He shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall make sacrifice and offering cease; and in their place shall be an abomination that desolates, until the decreed end is poured out upon the desolator.|{{bibleref2|Daniel|9:24-27|NRSV}} ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])}}

=== Chapter outline ===

The consensus among critical scholars is that chapters 1-6 of the [[Book of Daniel]] originated as a collection of [[Folklore#Folktales|folktales]] among the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the [[Persian period|Persian]]/[[Hellenistic period#Judea|Hellenistic periods]], to which the visionary chapters 7–12 were added during the persecution of the Jews under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] in 167–163 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=35-37, 60-61}} The authors of the tales apparently took the name Daniel from a legendary hero mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and the author of the visions in the second half in turn adopted him from the tales.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=1}}{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=220}}

[[Old Testament]] scholar [[John J. Collins]] observes that chapter 9 can be distinguished from the second half of the Book of Daniel by the following two facts: (1) the point of departure for the chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy as opposed to a visionary episode, and (2) more than half the chapter is devoted to a rather lengthy prayer.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} Accordingly, Collins divides the chapter into an introductory section that mentions Daniel's reading of Jeremiah's prophecy (verses 1-2), the penitential prayer given by Daniel (verses 3-19), and the prophecy given by the angel Gabriel following the aforementioned prayer (verses 20-27)—with a more detailed outline given below:{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}}

    }}
  }}
}}

=== Jeremiah's prophecy ===

The angelic revelation is a [[midrash]] or [[pesher]] (traditional Jewish interpretation of) a passage from the Jewish scriptures which Daniel has been reading.{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=91}} The author of Daniel does not identify the passage, but it is probably Jeremiah 29:10, in which Jeremiah, or rather God through the prophet, makes a promise of restoration for Israel after Babylon's 70 years: "When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place."{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=137-138}} Jeremiah 25:11-12 also refers to Babylon's seventy years: "This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years; then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, says the Lord, making the land an everlasting waste."{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=91}}

=== Daniel's prayer ===

Modern critical scholars have sometimes argued that Daniel's prayer in verses 3-19 is secondary to chapter 9,{{sfn|Gall|1895|pp=123-26}}{{sfn|Hartman|Di Lella|1978|pp=245-46}} as it contrasts sharply with the difficult Hebrew that is characteristic of Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} Still, it might be that the author(s) of the chapter incorporated (or adapted) a traditional prayer in the course of composition, in which case the prayer would not be a later addition.{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=362}} Proponents of the view that the prayer is secondary argue that (1) the context requires a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) the beginning and end of the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} However, these considerations have not proved decisive,{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=237}} and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced.{{sfn|Jones|1968}} In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20-27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by them.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=348}}

=== Gabriel's revelation ===

It has also been argued that there is a "pre-Maccabean core" to the prophetic revelation delivered by Gabriel in verses 24-27,{{sfn|Laato|1990}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|loc=p. 294 n. 32}} and that certain linguistic inconsistencies between the seventy weeks prophecy and other Danielic passages suggest that the second century BCE author(s)/redactor(s) of the Book of Daniel took over and modified a preexisting [[oracle]] that was already in circulation at the time of composition.{{sfn|Grabbe|1987}} These ideas have been further developed to suggest that the different [[redaction]]al layers represented in this text reflect different [[eschatology|eschatological]] perspectives,{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=97-107}} with the earliest one going back to a priest named Daniel who accompanied Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem in the fifth century BCE and the latest one to an unnamed redactor who edited this prophecy in the second century BCE so that it would function (along with other parts of the Book of Daniel) as part of "a prophetic manifesto for world domination."{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=110-111}} It is also argued that the prophecy exhibited a high degree of literary structure at an earlier stage of its development in such a way that the six infinitival clauses of verse 24 were [[Chiastic structure|chiastically]] linked to six divisions of verses 25-27 via an elaborate system of word counts, resulting in the following reconstruction of this earlier redactional stratum:{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=98-100}}

== Genre and themes ==

The seventy weeks prophecy is an [[Vaticinium ex eventu|''ex eventu'' prophecy]] in periodized form whose ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' is the [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes#Sacking of Jerusalem and persecution of Jews|Antiochene crisis]] in the second century BCE, with content analogous to the [[Book of Enoch|Enochic]] ''Apocalypse of Weeks'' as well as the ''Animal Apocalypse''.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} In this way, the prophecy puts the Antiochene crisis in perspective by locating it within an overview of history;{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}} the specificity of the prediction is significant for the psychological effect of the revelation, which has long been recognized as a distinctive characteristic of Daniel's prophecies (cf. ''Ant.'' 10.11.7 §&amp;nbsp;267).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|loc=p. 98 n. 15}} The prophecy is also an instance of [[Apocalyptic literature#Old Testament|Jewish apocalyptic literature]], as it belongs to the genre of revelatory literature in which a revelation is mediated to a human recipient in Daniel by an otherworldly being in the angel Gabriel that envisages [[Eschatology|eschatological]] salvation.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=54-55}} Within the macro-genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature, the prophecy further belongs to the subgenre known as the "historical apocalypse," which is characterized by the use of ''ex eventu'' prophecy and the presence of an interpreting angel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=54-55}}

The lengthy prayer in verses 3-19 is strongly [[Deuteronomist|Deuteronomic]] in its theology—Daniel's people are punished for their own sin and appeal to God for mercy.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} However, such theological overtones conflict with other aspects of the Book of Daniel, in which the primary sin is that of a gentile king and the course of history is arranged in advance.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}} Consequently, scholars have variously argued that the angel ignores Daniel's prayer and that the author(s) is making the point that "the calamity is decreed and will end at the appointed time, quite apart from prayers,"{{sfn|Jones|1968|p=493}} and/or that the prayer is not intended to influence God but is "an act of piety in itself."{{sfn|Towner|1971|p=213}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=359-60}} As Collins observes, "[t]he deliverance promised by the angel is in no sense a response to Daniel's prayer" since "[t]he word goes forth at the beginning of Daniel's supplication."{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=360}} In any case, the relationship between Daniel's prayer and the context in which it is placed, is a central issue in the contemporary scholarly interpretation of chapter 9.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}}

== Interpretation ==
=== Historical background ===

[[Nebuchadnezzar II]] defeated Egypt at the [[Battle of Carchemish]] in 605 BCE and established [[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylon]] as the dominant regional power, with significant consequences for the southern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Following a revolt in 597 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar removed Judah's king, [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]]; and after a second revolt in 586 BCE, he destroyed the city of Jerusalem along with the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]], carrying away much of the population to Babylon.{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=173}} Accordingly, the subsequent period from 586 BCE to 538 BCE is known as the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]],{{sfn|Levine|2010|p=36}} which came to an end when Babylon was conquered by the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great]], who allowed the Jewish exiles to return to Judah via his famous [[Cyrus's edict|edict of restoration]]. The Persian period, in turn, came to an end in the first half of the fourth century BCE following the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]], whose vast kingdom was divided upon his death among the [[Diadochi]]. The series of conflicts that ensued following Alexander's death in the [[Wars of the Diadochi|wars]] that erupted among the Diadochi mark the beginning of the Hellenistic period in 323/2 BCE. Two of the rival kingdoms produced out of this conflict—the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]] in Syria—fought for control of Palestine during the Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Levine|2010|pp=25-26}}

At the start of the second century BCE, the Seleucids had the upper hand in their struggle with the Ptolemaic kingdom for regional dominance, but the earlier conflicts had left them nearly bankrupt. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV attempted to recoup some of his kingdom's fortunes by selling the post of Jewish high priest to the highest bidder, and in 171/0 BCE the existing high priest (i.e. [[Onias III]]) was deposed and murdered. Palestine was subsequently divided between those who favored the Hellenistic culture of the Seleucids and those who remained loyal to the older Jewish traditions; however, for reasons that are still not understood, Antiochus IV banned key aspects of traditional Jewish religion in 168/7 BCE—including the twice-daily continual offering (cf. Dan 8:13; 11:31; 12:11).{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=672-73}}

=== Context within chapter 9 ===

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Jeremia treurend over de verwoesting van Jeruzalem - Google Art Project.jpg|200px|right|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt van Rijn]], "Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem", c. 1630.]]

The seventy weeks prophecy is internally dated to "the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede" (verse 1), elsewhere referred to within the Book of Daniel as "[[Darius the Mede]]" (e.g. Dan 11:1); however, no such ruler is known to history independently of the Book of Daniel and the widespread consensus among critical scholars is that he is a literary fiction of some kind.{{sfn|Rowley|1935|pp=12-66}} Nevertheless, within the fictionalized biblical account, the first year of Darius the Mede corresponds to the first year after the Babylonian kingdom is overthrown.{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=289}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=97}}

Chapter 9 can be distinguished from the other "visionary" chapters of the Book of Daniel by the fact that the point of departure for this chapter is another biblical text in Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and not a visionary episode.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=347}} The longstanding consensus among critical scholars has been that verses 24-27 is a paradigmatic example of inner-biblical interpretation, in which the latter text reinterprets Jeremiah's seventy years of exile as seventy weeks of years.{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=283}} On this view, Jeremiah's prophecy that after seventy years God would punish the Babylonian kingdom (cf. Jer 25:12) and once again pay special attention to his people in responding to their prayers and restoring them to the land (cf. Jer 29:10-14) could not have been fulfilled by the disappointment that accompanied the return to the land in the Persian period, hence the necessity to extend the expiration date of the prophecy to the second century BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|1987|pp=67-72}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=283}} And just as various elements of Daniel's visionary episodes are interpreted for him in chapters 7–8, so also Jeremiah's prophecy is interpreted for him in a manner similar to the ''[[pesher]]'' exegesis evidenced at [[Qumran]] in chapter 9.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=359}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=284}} However, this consensus has recently been challenged on the grounds that Daniel prays to God following the defeat of the Babylonian kingdom precisely because Jeremiah's seventy years of exile have been completed and God promised through the prophet that he would respond to such prayers at this time,{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=97}} in which case the seventy weeks prophecy is not a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy but a separate prophecy altogether.{{sfn|Bergsma|2006|pp=212-25}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|pp=288-92, 302}} And these considerations have been further refined along redactional lines to suggest that the latter holds relative to an earlier "pre-canonical" stage in the text, but that the seventy weeks prophecy is, in fact, a reinterpretation of Jeremiah's prophecy relative to the final form of the text.{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=97-107}}

=== The seventy weeks prophecy ===

The seventy "weeks" of years are divided into three periods of time: a seven-week period spanning forty-nine years, a sixty-two-week period spanning 434 years, and a final period of one week spanning seven years.{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=391}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=293}} The first period of seven weeks begins with the departure of a "word" to rebuild Jerusalem and ends with the arrival of an "anointed prince" (verse 25a). This "word" to rebuild Jerusalem has generally been taken to refer to Jeremiah's seventy years prophecy and dated to the fourth year of [[Jehoiakim]] (or the first year of [[Nebuchadnezzar]]) in 605/4 BCE.{{sfn|Koch|1980|p=150}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=354}} Collins objects to this identification on the basis that "[t]he word to rebuild Jerusalem could scarcely have gone forth before it was destroyed" and prefers to see this as a reference to the "word" that Gabriel came to give Daniel in verse 23;{{sfn|Collins|1993|pp=354-55}} other possible candidates suggested by critical scholars include the edict of Cyrus in 539/8 BCE,{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=317}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=100-101}} the decree of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] in 458/7 BCE,{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=100-101}} and the warrant given to [[Nehemiah]] in 445/4 BCE.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=260}}{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}} The "prince" in verse 25a may refer to either an actual prince or some other figure of authority and critical scholars have proposed various candidates here as well, including Cyrus (cf. Isa 45:1),{{sfn|Delcor|1971|p=144}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=106}} [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] [[Joshua the High Priest|Joshua]],{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=355}}{{sfn|Nel|2013|p=4}} [[Zerubbabel]],{{sfn|Redditt|2000|p=238}}{{sfn|Nel|2013|p=4}} [[Zerubbabel#Sheshbazzar|Sheshbazzar]],{{sfn|Athas|2009|p=16}} Ezra,{{sfn|Ulrich|2014|p=1071}} Nehemiah,{{sfn|Segal|2011|pp=297-302}} the angelic "prince" [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (cf. Dan 10:21b),{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=102}} and even the collective people of God in the Second Temple period.{{sfn|Meadowcroft|2001|pp=440-49}}

An "anointed one shall be cut off" (verse 26a) following the subsequent period of sixty-two weeks during which time the city is rebuilt (verse 25b); this "anointed one" is generally considered to refer to the murdered High Priest [[Onias III]],{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=355}}{{sfn|Redditt|2000|pp=238-39}} whose death at the hands of Seleucid officials outside Jerusalem in 171/0 BCE is recorded in 2 Maccabees 4:23-28.{{sfn|Athas|2009|pp=9-12}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=106}} Most critical scholars see another reference to Onias III's murder in Daniel 11:22,{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=382}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=150}} though [[Ptolemy VI Philometor|Ptolemy VI]] and the infant son of [[Seleucus IV Philopator|Seleucus IV]] have also been suggested.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=299}} On the other hand, the identification of the latter "anointed one" with Onias III raises the question of how 7 + 62 = 69 weeks of years (or 483 years) could have elapsed between the departure of the "word" in verse 25a—which is not earlier than 605/4 BCE—and the murder of Onias III in 171/0 BCE. Hence, some critical scholars follow Montgomery in thinking that there has been "a chronological miscalculation on [the] part of the writer,"{{sfn|Montgomery|1927|p=393}} who is then criticized for making "wrong-headed arithmetical calculations;"{{sfn|Porteous|1965|p=134}} while others like [[John Goldingay|Goldingay]] are not inclined to see this as a "chronological miscalculation" on the basis that the seventy weeks are not an exercise in literal chronology, but the more inexact science of "chronography."{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|pp=257-58}}{{sfn|Segal|2011|p=298}} Collins opts for something like a middle-ground position in saying that "the figure should be considered a round number rather than a miscalculation."{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=356}} And there are still others who see the calculations as being at least approximately correct so long as the initial seven-week period of forty-nine years can overlap with the sixty-two-week period of 434 years, with the latter period spanning the time between Jeremiah's prophecy in 605/4 BCE and Onias III's murder in 171/0 BCE.{{sfn|Athas|2009|pp=16-17}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=106}}

[[File:AntiochusIVEpiphanes.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Coin of Antiochus IV. Reverse shows the Greek god [[Apollo]] on an [[omphalos]]. The inscription ΑΝΤΙΟΧΟΥ ΘΕΟΥ ΕΠΙΦΑΝΟΥ ΝΙΚΗΦΟΡΟΥ reads, "Of Antiochus, God Manifest, Bearer of Victory."]]

The "prince who is to come" in verse 26b is typically seen by critical scholars as a reference to Antiochus IV,{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=150}} though [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]] have also been suggested.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=150}} Hence, the "troops of the prince" are either thought to be the Seleucid troops that settled in Jerusalem (cf. Dan 11:31; 1 Macc 1:29-40) or the Jewish [[hellenizer]]s.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}}{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=150}} In any case, the reference to "troops" that will "destroy the city and the sanctuary" in verse 26b is somewhat problematic on this view since neither Jerusalem nor the temple were actually destroyed during the Antiochene crisis,{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=328}} though the city was arguably rendered desolate and the temple defiled (cf. 1 Macc 1:46; 2 Macc 6:2).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}}{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=328}} Accordingly, it has been noted that the language of destruction "seems excessive" in this context.{{sfn|Towner|1984|p=143}}

The "covenant" in verse 27a most likely refers to the "covenant" reported in 1 Maccabees 1:11 between the Jewish hellenizers and Antiochus IV,{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|pp=106-107}} with the ban on regular worship for a period that lasted approximately three and a half years alluded to in the subsequent clause (cf. Dan 7:25; 8:14; 12:11).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}}{{sfn|Lust|2002|p=683}} In contrast, the reference to an "[[Abomination of desolation|abomination that desolates]]" in verse 27b (cf. 1 Macc 1:54) is another point of contention among critical scholars. One of the more popular older views was that this difficult phrase was a contemptuous deformation (or [[dysphemism]]) of the [[Phoenician religion|Phoenician deity]] [[Baalshamin|Baal Shamin]]—the "Lord of Heaven"—whom [[Philo of Byblos]] identified with the Greek [[sky god]] [[Zeus]].{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=674}} Moreover, the temple in Jerusalem was rededicated in honor of Zeus according to [[2 Maccabees]] 6:2, hence the tendency among older commentators to follow [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in seeing this "abomination" in terms of a statue of Zeus.{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=677-78}} More recently, it has been suggested that the reference is to certain sacred stones (possibly [[meteorite]]s) that were affixed to the great [[Altar (Bible)|altar]] of sacrifice for the purposes of pagan worship in the temple,{{sfn|Porteous|1965|p=143}}{{sfn|Goldstein|1976|pp=144-51}} since the use of such stones is well-attested in [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] and Syrian cults.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}} However, both sorts of proposals have been criticized on the basis that they are either too speculative, dependent on flawed analysis, or not well-suited to the relevant context in the Book of Daniel.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}}{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=675-82}} Increasingly, critical scholars tend to see the expression as being a reference to either the pagan offerings that were given during the Antiochene crisis instead of the twice-daily continual offering that had been forbidden (cf. Dan 11:31; 12:11; 2 Macc 6:5),{{sfn|Lust|2002|pp=682-87}}{{sfn|Waters|2016|p=107}} or the pagan altar on which such offerings were made.{{sfn|Goldingay|1989|p=263}}{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=358}}

== Christian interpretations==

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Die Kreuzigung Jesu Christi.JPG|thumb|''Crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth'', 12th-century medieval illustration from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] of [[Herrad of Landsberg]].]]
There is a long-standing tradition within Christianity of reading the 70 weeks as a prophecy of the coming of [[Jesus]], but Christian exegetes have differed widely over such details as which passages refer to the [[Messiah]], when the "sevens" begin and end, and how the final "week" relates to those preceding.{{sfn|Tanner|2009a|p=181}} Many denominations consider Antiochus IV Epiphanes to be irrelevant to the interpretation of the seventy weeks, whereas others recognise Antiochus' period as the literal interpretation with a secondary "typical" application to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|chapter=Book of Daniel|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04621b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various [[Christology|christological]] readings that have been proposed share a number of features: The "anointed prince" in verse 25a or the "anointed one" in verse 26a (or both) are understood to refer to Christ, who is also sometimes thought to be the "most holy" thing anointed in verse 24.{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=354}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009a|p=198}}&lt;ref&gt;Tim Meadowcroft. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3267901 "Exploring the Dismal Swamp: The Identity of the Anointed One in Daniel 9:24-27."] ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', Vol. 120, No. 3 (Autumn, 2001). ''Requires subscription for full content''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the early church fathers also associated Christ with the "prince who is to come" (verse 26b), but this figure is more often identified with either the [[Antichrist]] or one of the Roman officials who oversaw the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE (e.g. [[Titus]] or [[Vespasian]]).{{sfn|Collins|1993|p=357}} The "abomination that desolates" is typically read in the context of the New Testament use of the expression in the Olivet Discourse,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matt|24:15|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; with various interpretations.

The seven- and sixty-two-week periods are generally understood as consecutive, non-overlapping periods starting with an event during the reign of Artaxerxes I{{sfn|Payne|1978|p=101}}{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|pp=2-3}} and ending with the [[baptism of Jesus|Jesus' baptism]] and anointing with [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|pp=2-3}}{{sfn|Shea|1991|pp=136-37}}{{sfn|Payne|1978|p=101}} The specific event during the reign of Artaxerxes I that is said to mark the beginning of the 70 weeks varies by denomination. For example, some identify it with the decree given to Ezra by Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE,{{sfn|Payne|1978|p=101}}{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|pp=2-3}} and some specify the warrant given to [[Nehemiah]] in 445/4 BCE.{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=322}} In the latter case, the period is reduced to 476 years by applying 360-day "prophetic" (or "Chaldean"{{sfn|Lloyd|1690|p=i}}) years, based on biblical passages such as Revelation 12:6, 14.

Various Christian scholars have interpreted the Prophecy of 70 Weeks since around the third century CE.

===Futurist interpretation===
In the [[Futurism (Christianity)|futurist view]], the seventieth week is separated from the sixty-ninth week by a long period of time known as the [[Dispensationalism#Start of the Church Age|church age]].{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|p=2}}{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=322}} The seventieth week then begins at the end of the church age, at which point the church will be removed from the earth in an event called the [[rapture]]. The future Antichrist is expected to oppress the Jewish people and bring upon the world a period of tribulation lasting three and a half years, constituting the second half of the delayed seventieth week. This interpretation was first popularized by [[John Nelson Darby]].{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=84}}

===Historicist interpretation===
In the [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist view]], the seventieth week immediately follows the sixty-ninth week. The end of the 70th week is associated with the gospel being redirected from only the Jews to all the nations. Proponents of the historicist interpretation include theologian [[Francis Nigel Lee]],{{Sfn | Newport | 2000 | pages = 14–15}} and denominations derived the 19th century Millerite movement, including the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

The reference to an anointed one being "cut off" in verse 26a is identified with [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Christ]] 3½ years after his baptism, and has traditionally been thought to mark the midpoint of the seventieth week,{{sfn|Doukhan|1979|pp=2-3}} and associated with the confirmation of Jeremiah's new "covenant" (verse 27a) and making atonement for "iniquity" (verse 24).

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the 70 weeks begin with Nehemiah receiving permission to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem in the twentieth year of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]], which they assign to 455 BCE{{sfn|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society|1999|loc=chap. 11}}{{sfn|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society|2009}} (ten years earlier than his actual 20th year).&lt;ref name="DunnRogerson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James D. G. Dunn|author2=John William Rogerson|title=Eerdmans Commentary on the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&amp;pg=PA321|date=19 November 2003|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3711-0|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixty-ninth week ends at Jesus' baptism in 29 CE, he is executed in 33CE, and the final week ends with the conversion of [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] in 36 CE.{{sfn|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society|1988|pp=899-901}}

====Seventh-day Adventist Church====
In the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] interpretation, the 70 weeks begin with the decree by Artaxerxes I in 458/7 BCE to provide money to rebuild Jerusalem and its temple,{{cn|date=December 2018}} the 69th week ends in 27 CE with Jesus' baptism, he is 'cut off' (executed) in 31 CE, and the final week ends in 34 CE.&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;Based on {{harvnb|General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|2005|pp=358–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ross's niece [[Lindsay Hart]] who is a make up artist and wrestling personality is named after his middle name. In July 4, 1989 Hart was involved in an automobile accident near Jasper, Alberta together with [[Davey Boy Smith]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Jason the Terrible|Karl Moffat]] and [[Koki Kitahara|Tatsumi Kitahara]]. Hart who was in the driver's seat and wearing a seatbelt received minor injuries, Smith who was sitting next to him and not wearing a seabelt had his head smashed through the windsheld resulting in a wound which required one hundred stitches. Karl Moffat was injured the most, one of his ankles was crushed by the spare tire. After the incident Moffat attempted to sue Hart, claiming he had been crippled by the event, but he did not succeed in receiving any compensation since a moving company Moffat had worked for supplied evidence of him moving around reasonably well after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=39|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2004|isbn=1-58261-817-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titan Shattered: Wrestling with Confidence and Paranoia|last=Dixon|first=James|pages=105–106 pp|year=2015|publisher=History of Wrestling|ASIN=B0117TSB2G|isbn=1326355813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergiu Dan''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈserd͡ʒju dan}}; born '''Isidor Rotman''' or '''Rottman'''; December 29, 1903 – March 13, 1976) was a Romanian novelist, journalist, [[Holocaust]] survivor and [[political prisoner]] of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. Dan, the friend and collaborator of [[Romulus Dianu]], was noted during the [[interwar period]] as a contributor to Romania's [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernist literature|modernist]] scene, collaborating with poet [[Ion Vinea]] on ''[[Contimporanul]]'' review and ''[[Facla]]'' newspaper. He was also affiliated with the rival literary club, ''[[Sburătorul]]'', and noted for criticizing the [[Communism|communist]] sympathies of other avant-garde writers. His main works of the 1930s include contributions to the [[psychological novel]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and [[political novel]] genres, received with critical acclaim.

Of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] origin, Sergiu Dan was the subject of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] defamation, and, during [[World War II]], was deported to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]]. After his return home, Dan spoke about his experiences in the book ''Unde începe noaptea'' ("Where Night Begins"), which endures one of the few Romanian contributions to [[Holocaust literature]], and has for long been censored by dictatorial regimes. The writer's political stance also clashed with the post-1948 communist establishment, and, during the 1950s, he was interned at [[Aiud prison]]. Dan was eventually forced to adapt his writing style to the aesthetic requirements of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Romanian Socialist realism]], and spent the final decades of his life in relative obscurity. His work was rediscovered and reassessed following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]].

==Biography==

===Early decades===
The future writer was born in the town of [[Piatra Neamț]], in [[Moldavia]] region, the son of Simon Rotman.&lt;ref name="tgjironist"&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930080126/http://www.timpulgj.ro/arhiva/355/cultura.htm "Sergiu Dan - 'un ironist sentimental' "], in ''Timpul de Gorj'', Nr. 51 (355), December 22–28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His first steps in cultural journalism happened before 1926, when he was affiliated with the newspaper ''[[Cugetul Românesc]]''; his earliest poems were published in cultural magazines such as ''[[Chemarea]]'' and ''[[Flacăra]]'',&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Boris Marian, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr262_263/pagina19.pdf "Lăudabil demers: reeditarea unui roman al lui Sergiu Dan"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 262-263 (1062-1063), December 2006, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and a debut [[novella]], ''Iudita și Holofern'' ("[[Judith]] and [[Holofernes]]"), saw print in 1927.&lt;ref name="mosteniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_08.html# ''Moșteniri ale culturii iudaice.

In the late 1920s, Sergiu Dan and his friend Romulus Dianu were in [[Bucharest]]. It was there that Dan joined the literary circle of novelist [[Camil Petrescu]], and took part in the regular literary disputes at [[Casa Capșa]] and Corso restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr228/pagina6-7.pdf "''D. G. L. R.'' - siglă de patrimoniu (III). Solidari cu destinele literaturii române"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 228 (1028), April 2005, p.6-7&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, he had fallen out with Petrescu: ridiculing the "[[Noocracy|noocratic]]" philosophical project outlined by Petrescu, and calling its author "insane" and "poltroonish".&lt;ref name="aiacamil"&gt;{{ro icon}} Anton I. Adămuț, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/images/articole/eseu%20id%20camil%20petrescu.pdf "Camil Petrescu – istoria unui manuscris (Câte ceva despre eros și despre existențialism)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928063509/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/images/articole/eseu%20id%20camil%20petrescu.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }}, in ''[[Idei în Dialog]]'', October 2007 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ România Culturală] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }}'')&lt;/ref&gt; He later expressed regret for the incident, noting that he had been especially amused by Petrescu's eccentric decision to store his philosophical manuscript in the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref name="aiacamil"/&gt;

Dan and Dianu were also co-opted by [[Ion Vinea]] on his various journalistic ventures, beginning with the [[left-wing]] and modernist literary review ''[[Contimporanul]]'', where they published avant-garde prose and poetry with a political subtext.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.151, 194-197, 269&lt;/ref&gt; His texts were featured in various other venues: ''[[Vremea]]'', ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', ''Universul Literar'' (the literary supplement of ''[[Universul]]'' daily) and ''[[Bilete de Papagal]]'' (the satirical newspaper of poet [[Tudor Arghezi]]).&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mosteniri"/&gt; During the period, Dan underwent formal training in [[Economics]], graduating from the [[Nicolae Kretzulescu Superior Commercial School|Bucharest Commercial School]].&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt; With Dianu (who was also making his debut), Dan co-authored a [[Biographical novel|romanticized biography]] of the 19th century poet-storyteller [[Anton Pann]]: ''Viața minunată a lui Anton Pann'' ("The Wonderful Life of Anton Pann"; [[Editura Cultura Națională]], 1929)—this [[collaborative fiction]] piece was reissued in 1935 as ''Nastratin și timpul său'' ("[[Nasreddin]] and His Time").&lt;ref name="gc1021; oc605"&gt;Călinescu, p.1021; Crohmălniceanu, p.353, 605, 606&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Dan also joined the ''[[Sburătorul]]'' club, formed around the eponymous magazine of literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]], as one of the Jewish writers whom Lovinescu welcomed into his movement.&lt;ref name="vbcuvant"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vlaicu Bârna]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_cuvnt_nou_n_limba_romn "Un cuvânt nou în limba română"], in ''[[România Literarǎ]]'', Nr. 42/2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hzapropieri"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Henri Zalis]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ZALISaug4.html "Apropieri de o moștenire diferențiată"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

During his period at ''Contimporanul'', Dan embarked on a conflict with the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[far left]]ist group at ''[[unu]]'', the magazine of poet [[Sașa Pană]]. This controversy reflected the major discrepancies between ''Contimporanul'' and other avant-garde venues.&lt;ref name="pcsubterana"/&gt; By 1930, Sergiu's brother Mihail Dan had left ''Bilete de Papagal'' and had become involved with ''unu'', of which he was later editor in chief. However, documents first made public in 2008 show that he was secretly an [[informant]] for the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s intelligence agency, ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'', with a mission to supervise ''unu''{{'}}s ongoing flirtations with [[communism]].&lt;ref name="pcsubterana"/&gt; He had for long been suspected of this by the literary society at ''Sburătorul''.&lt;ref name="vbcuvant"/&gt; Also in 1930, shortly after the forceful return of [[King of Romania|Romanian King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to the throne, Sergiu Dan was working, as political editor,&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; on the staff of ''[[Dreptatea]]'', the platform of the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ). According to the later account of communist journalist [[Petre Pandrea]], Dan and Vinea together stole the original draft of an article by PNȚ economist [[Virgil Madgearu]], and forged it in such manner as to make it seem that Madgearu was an anti-Carlist; they then sold a copy to Madgearu's rival, the [[Corporatism|corporatist]] theorist [[Mihail Manoilescu]]. Manoilescu took a copy of this document to Carol, discrediting himself when the forgery was exposed.&lt;ref name="pp27"&gt;[[Petre Pandrea]], "Carol II-Madgearu-Manoilescu", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', April 2002, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea claimed that, between them, Dan and Vinea made off with 150,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] from the affair, whereas their victim Manoilescu fell into permanent disfavor.&lt;ref name="pp27"/&gt;

Sergiu Dan's actual editorial debut came in 1931, when [[Editura Cugetarea]] published his novel ''Dragoste și moarte în provincie'' ("Love and Death in the Provinces").&lt;ref name="gc1021; oc605"/&gt; In 1932, Dan and dramatist [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]] shared the annual prize of the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], of which they both became members.&lt;ref name="vdssr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=9830 "Societatea scriitorilor români"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218133843/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=9830 |date=2012-02-18 }}, in ''[[Dacia Literară]]'', Nr. 2/2008 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ România Culturală] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }}'')&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Sergiu Dan joined the staff of Vinea's gazette ''[[Facla]]'', with novelist [[Ion Călugăru]], poet [[N. Davidescu]], writer-director [[Sandu Eliad]], and professional journalists [[Nicolae Carandino]] and [[Henric Streitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], [http://www.romlit.ro/causeries_du_lundi "''Causeries du lundi''"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan resumed his writing career with ''Arsenic'', published by Cultura Națională in 1934, and ''Surorile Veniamin'' ("The Veniamin Sisters", Editura Vatra, 1935).&lt;ref name="gc1021; oc605"/&gt; The former volume received another cultural prize, granted by literary critics at the [[Eforie]] festival of 1934.&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; During 1934, Dan was one of 46 intellectuals who signed an appeal in favor of normalizing relations between Romania and its communist enemy to the east, the [[Soviet Union]]—the basis for a cultural and political association, ''[[Amicii URSS]]'', which was secretly maneuvered by the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Cioroianu]], ''{{lang|ro|Pe umerii lui Marx. O introducere în istoria comunismului românesc}}'', [[Editura Curtea Veche]], Bucharest, 2005, p.114-118.  {{ISBN|973-669-175-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Transnistria and Aiud===
Sergiu Dan became a victim of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] repression during the early stages of [[World War II]], when [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes took over (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''). Initially, he was expelled from the Writers' Society.&lt;ref name="rcura"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosașu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-centru-si-la-margine/articol/ura-in-toata-incultura-ei "Ura în toată incultura ei"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 118, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1940, writing for ''Universul Literar'', fascist author Ladmiss Andreescu proposed a boycott of Dan's work, and an overall ban on Jewish literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ladmiss Andreescu, [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/jspui/bitstream/123456789/19002/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_P3441_1940_049_0029.pdf "Iudeii în literatura noastră"], in ''[[Universul|Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 29/1940, p.2 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[National Legionary State]], some authors sympathetic to the ruling [[Iron Guard]] celebrated its enforcement of censorship as a revolution against modernist literature. In their magazine ''[[Gândirea]]'', Dan was referred to as an exponent of "Judaic morbidity".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} S[eptimiu] B[ucur], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1940/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1940_019_007.pdf "Cronica măruntă. ''Revista Fundațiilor Regale''"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 7/1940, p.519 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Dan escaped the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Pogrom of January 1941]], hidden and protected by his friend Vinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [[Corneliu Coposu]], [http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=2342 "Corneliu Coposu despre atitudinea lui Iuliu Maniu față de evrei"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705081408/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=2342 |date=2015-07-05 }}, in ''Caiete Silvane'', May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the new dictatorial government of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] listed Dan as one of the Jewish authors specifically banned, on a special inventory with nationwide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.174-175&lt;/ref&gt; Dan was also among the Jewish men and women who were deported to [[concentration camp]]s in Romanian-administered [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]] (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]''); he was eventually released and could return to Bucharest, where he was under treatment with the Jewish physician and fellow writer [[Emil Dorian]], before the [[King Michael's Coup|August 1944 Coup]] managed to topple Antonescu.&lt;ref name="lr176"&gt;Rotman, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Dealing with his Transnistrian deportation, the novel ''Unde începe noaptea'' was published by Editura Naționala Mecu in 1945.&lt;ref name="oc605"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.605&lt;/ref&gt; The book, written as a response to early signs of [[Holocaust denial]],&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; was reportedly taken out of circulation for unknown reasons; it was later suggested that it clashed with the Communist Party agenda, at a time when Romania was undergoing fast [[communization]].&lt;ref name="rehasefer"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr256_257/pagina4-5.pdf "Hasefer — ca de obicei, la înălțimea așteptărilor"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 256-257 (1056-1057), June–July 2006, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Naționala Mecu released another one of Dan's war-themed novels, ''Roza și ceilalți'' ("Roza and the Others").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1021&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1948, Sergiu Dan's political views collided with the agenda set by the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], and he was eventually arrested. Reportedly, Dan had first attracted political persecution upon himself when, in 1947, he spoke out as a defense witness at the trial of his friend, the PNȚ journalist Nicolae Carandino.&lt;ref name="idbalanta"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulia Deleanu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Epoca-interbelica-refolosirea-balantei*articleID_19031-articles_details.html "Epoca interbelică – refolosirea balanței"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 406, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securitate]] secret police confiscated his works in progress, which reputedly formed part of a special secret archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex.

Dan was eventually released around 1955, when, according to Zalis (a personal witness to the events, alongside novelist [[Zaharia Stancu]]), he confided to fellow members of the official Writers' Union about his time in prison.&lt;ref name="hzapropieri"/&gt; The Union later exposed Dan to sessions of "self-criticism", forcing him to comply with the demands of [[Socialist realism]] (''see [[Socialist realism in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name="hzapropieri"/&gt; His later bibliography includes: ''Taina stolnicesei'' ("The [[Stolnik]] Woman's Secret"), published by [[Editura de stat pentru literatură și artă]] (ESPLA) in 1958 and ''Tase cel Mare'' ("Tase the Great"), [[Editura pentru literatură]], 1964.&lt;ref name="oc605"/&gt;

In 1970, [[Editura Minerva]] republished ''Roza și ceilalți'' and ''Arsenic'', while [[Cartea Românească]] printed his last volume, ''Dintr-un jurnal de noapte'' ("From a Nightly Diary").&lt;ref name="oc605"/&gt; That year, in protest against [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], Dan refused to accept the ''[[Meritul Cultural]]'' medal.&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; He also concentrated on his translator's activity, being noted for his rendition of ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' and ''[[Salammbô]]'', the classical works of French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; His overall contribution also covers [[Romanian-language]] versions of works by [[Louis Aragon]], [[Michel Droit]], [[Maurice Druon]], [[Anatole France]], [[Boris Polevoy]], [[Elsa Triolet]] and [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt; In 1973, he was interviewed by the young literary critics Ileana Corbea and Nicolae Florescu for the volume ''Biografii posibile'' ("Possible Biographies").&lt;ref name="aiacamil"/&gt;

==Work==

===Early contributions===
The earliest literary contributions by Sergiu Dan are generally small-scale narratives about provincial life, which often lead to a fiery and unexpected [[Climax (narrative)|climax]].&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt; Those fragments published by ''[[Contimporanul]]'' in the 1920s have been included by researcher [[Paul Cernat]] in a special group of "iconoclastic" and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] short prose (with those of Dianu, [[F. Brunea-Fox]], [[Filip Corsa]] or [[Sandu Tudor]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Experimental literature|experimental prose]] fragment ''Rocambole'' was a [[parody]] of [[Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail]]'s [[Rocambole (character)|19th century series]] (and of literary conventions in general): although only covering half a page, it carried the subtitle "grand [[adventure novel]]", and showed its eponymous [[anti-hero]] as an [[incest]]uous [[kleptomania]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration behind this format, similar to those employed by Dianu and the others, was the avant-garde hero [[Urmuz]]. According to Cernat, the ''Contimporanul'' writers borrowed Urmuz's manner of toying with the expectations of traditional readers, but were less interested than him in preserving an implicit social message.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.195-197&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat illustrates this conclusion with Dan's [[free verse]] "diary-poem", published in Issue 71 of ''Contimporanul'', a sample of "cynical [[libertinism]]" and "absolute aesthetic freedom":
{{Verse translation|
mai plăcut: moartea pentru rochie
decât pentru steag&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;
|
more pleasant: a death for the skirt
than for the flag}}

A triple issue of ''Contimporanul'' (96-97-98 for 1931) featured Dan and Dianu's text for the stage, ''Comedie în patru acte'' ("A Comedy in Four Acts"). Cernat finds that it is a "timid" version of [[Futurism|Futurist]] writings by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], comparable to similar contributions by [[A. L. Zissu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan's style became more personal during his affiliation with ''[[Sburătorul]]'' and his earliest novels, although, Henri Zalis notes, he was more eclectic than other ''Sburătorists''.&lt;ref name="idbalanta"/&gt; Researcher and critic [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]] finds that Sergiu Dan was one of the [[psychological novel]]ists who, following ''Sburătorul''{{'}}s critique of [[social determinism]] and praise of the liberated urban intellectual, focused primarily (and, in Crohmălniceanu's opinion, excessively) on the refined "erotic obsessions" of exceptional individuals. He therefore places Dan in a group of ''Sburătorists'' which also includes [[Felix Aderca]], [[Isaia Răcăciuni]], [[Mihail Celarianu]] and [[Dan Petrașincu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1941 synthesis of [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], academic [[George Călinescu]] described the post-1931 novels written separately by Dianu and Dan as rather similar, with the exception that Dan's were the products of "a more organized industry"; both authors, he argues, remained "highly conventional" in applying to Romania the [[genre fiction]] equivalent of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]].&lt;ref name="gc797"&gt;Călinescu, p.797&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Crohmălniceanu notes, Sergiu Dan had an "offhand narrative style, moving around with ease, the same as [fellow novelist] [[Cezar Petrescu]], in quite varied environments. A certain analytical lucidity [of his] betrays [...] an additional interest for the mystery of psychological mechanisms within his heroes' actions".&lt;ref name="oc353"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.353&lt;/ref&gt; The shock value of avant-garde and libertinism is preserved in some of Dan's 1930s novels. Călinescu wrote that his characters generally lack "even the slightest notion of virtue", their "flimsy mentality" being the reason why Dan's novels always resemble "comedies".&lt;ref name="gc797"/&gt; However, according to Crohmălniceanu, Dan's "sharp intelligence", "delicate observation" and love of [[aphorism]] compensated for "the lack of any prolonged moral discretion."&lt;ref name="oc353"/&gt;

While the [[Anton Pann]] narrative earned appreciation for freely mixing [[picturesque]] elements into a [[historical novel]] framework, Dan's solo debut with ''Dragoste și moarte...'' takes direct inspiration from [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt; The book is seen by Ovid Crohmălniceanu as "a good reconstruction of a particular human ambiance, with a suggestion regarding the forms of [[Bovarysme]] that envelop [the provincial] setting."&lt;ref name="oc353"/&gt; The more complex ''Arsenic'' can be read, according to Crohmălniceanu, as both a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] populated with "dubious" figures and, "under careful reading", a study "on the petty cowardice of existence."&lt;ref name="oc353"/&gt; The protagonist is a physician who renounces his professional standard, assists his friend, the simple giant Bibi, in plotting the murder of a common enemy, and then lives to regret his deed, while, at the same time, he betrays Bibi's confidence by pursuing an affair with his wife Ana; Ana however cheats on both men with the president of an insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.797; Crohmălniceanu, p.353&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu remarks that the novel was constructed with an "intelligent" rhythm of [[suspense]] and humor, noting the "fantasy" invested in the secondary plots and characters: the colonel who dies obsessing about [[fodder]], his [[bourgeois]] daughters, or the [[coroner]] who constructs absurd theories about criminal behavior.&lt;ref name="gc797"/&gt; ''Arsenic'' received high praise from Crohmălniceanu: "The book is written with much confidence, it displays remarkable intellectual detachment, fine [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] irony and an ingenious, irreproachable, [[counterpoint]] construction."&lt;ref name="oc354"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.354&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Surorile Veniamin'', Dan's [[political novel]], the narrative follows the symmetrical lives of two sisters: Felicia, who rejects social conformity and braves a life of poverty; and Maria, who works in the thriving [[Oil industry in Romania|oil industry]] and then becomes a kept woman. The plot is complicated by Felicia's affair with agitator Mihai Vasiliu, a [[Romanian Communist Party]] member who is pursued by ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' agents, and who hides in Maria's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.797-798; Crohmălniceanu, p.354&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu rated the more "serious" book as inferior to the "flighty verve" of ''Arsenic''.&lt;ref name="gc797"/&gt; Crohmălniceanu believes the book displays qualities similar to ''Arsenic''{{'}}s, but notes that Vasiliu's ultimate arrest, which leaves both sisters unconsoled, leads the outcome into a "disappointingly inconsistent" solution.&lt;ref name="oc354"/&gt;

===''Unde începe noaptea'' and later works===
With ''Unde începe noaptea'', Sergiu Dan spoke about his own experience as a victim of [[Nazism]] and of [[Ion Antonescu]]'s regime, with additional detail on the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|January 1941 Pogrom]].&lt;ref name="idbalanta"/&gt; The book carries a [[motto]] from the [[Freethought|freethinker]] [[Léon Bloy]]: "Only Jewish tears are the heaviest. Theirs is the weight of many centuries."&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; Centered on Jewish industrialist David Bainer, the narrative progresses over the slow degeneration into [[racial antisemitism]], culminating in deportation.&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt;

Crohmălniceanu noted: "In grave pitch, the author manages, against previous expectations, to write a book as yet unparalleled in our literature, about [[Nazi extermination camps]]".&lt;ref name="oc354"/&gt; Literary critic John Neubauer and his co-authors listed Sergiu Dan among the few [[East-Central Europe]]an authors to have been caught up in wartime "carnage" and survived (their list also includes, for Romania, political prisoner [[Tudor Arghezi]] and Holocaust survivor [[Elie Wiesel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p.147&lt;/ref&gt; They describe ''Unde începe...'' as "a [[Non-fiction novel|documentary novel]] about life in the concentration camp", one of the first-generation East-Central European books to deal with the World War II tragedy. The category places Dan among [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavs]] [[Vladimir Dedijer]], [[Vladimir Nazor]] and [[Viktor Novak]]; [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovaks]] [[Ján Bodenek]], [[Jan Drda]], [[Miloš Krno]] and [[Jozef Horák]]; Polish [[Kazimierz Brandys]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Ernő Szép]] and [[Bulgaria]]n [[Iordan Velchev]].&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p.164&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contrasted by poet and critic Boris Marian, who finds that the narrative, which displays "impressive realism" and "alert style", is not documentary, but rather personal; according to him, although briefly showing communists at work, ''Unde începe...'' goes against its time by not presenting them in an ideal light.&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; According to Henri Zalis, Dan's account forms "an ample [[novella]]" about "the inferno of a Nazi camp".&lt;ref name="hzapropieri"/&gt;

In ''Roza și ceilalți'', the libertine daughter of a Jewish tailor is persuaded by her coreligionists into accepting the sexual advances of a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] officer. Called a "tragic buffoonery" by George Călinescu (in an updated version of his 1941 overview), the narrative culminates with the German retreat, after which Roza, branded a [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborator]], is tortured and raped by her own community.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.798&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially an [[anti-communist]], Dan refused to comply with the requirements imposed on literature by the [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist realist establishment]] during the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="hzapropieri"/&gt; However, giving in to political pressure after his return from jail, he produced ''Tase cel Mare'': called an "accessible" and "simplistic" novel by Zalis,&lt;ref name="hzapropieri"/&gt; it is thematically linked to the world depicted in ''Surorile Veniamin''.&lt;ref name="tgjironist"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Essayist and literary historian [[Barbu Cioculescu]] recalled that Dan, "an excellent writer and man of character", was vilified in the 1940s by a "wretched [[epigram]]".&lt;ref name="bcchinez"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/a_fi_chinez_lapon_hindus.. "A fi chinez, lapon, hindus..."], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2003&lt;/ref&gt; The antisemitic rhyme went as follows:
{{Verse translation|
După nume, Sergiu Dan
N-ai zice că e jidan.
După chip și-obrăznicie
Nu se poate să nu fie.&lt;ref name="bcchinez"/&gt;
|
With a name like Sergiu Dan
You wouldn't think he'd be a kike.
With his features and his sass
He couldn't be anything but.}}

During the antisemitic censoring and deportation of Sergiu Dan, George Călinescu still defied the political restrictions. His work still included literary profiles of Dan and other Jewish Romanian writers.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.175-177. See also [[Alexandru Piru]], preface to Călinescu, p.X-XI&lt;/ref&gt; This gesture of goodwill was acknowledged by Dan. He spoke to [[Emil Dorian]] about the Antonescu regime's attempt to circulate an alternative, antisemitic, Romanian literature tract, overseen by [[Ion Petrovici]].&lt;ref name="lr176"/&gt; Călinescu's defiance was perceived as an outrage by Romania's [[Fascism|fascist]] periodicals. The newspaper ''[[Porunca Vremii]]'' called for Călinescu to be punished for his attack on "the cleanliness of the Romanian soul". It asserted that Jewish writers, Dan included, had no part to play in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]].&lt;ref name="rcura"/&gt; The same was stated in ''[[Gândirea]]''. It argued that, in reviewing Dan and the others, Călinescu had soiled the "Romanian blood that was shed under the pointy claw of the [[Talmud]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Petru P. Ionescu, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1941/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1941_020_008.pdf "''Istoria literaturii române''"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 8/1941, p.442 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

After renewed [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], Sergiu Dan's work was again given consideration in Communist Romania during the 1960s [[liberalization]] episode. However, researcher [[Radu Ioanid]] notes, his references to the Holocaust were uncomfortable subjects for the [[National communism|national communist]] apparatus. Ioanid speaks about "selective censorship" on Romanian Holocaust literature, with Dan being one of the few authors whose works on the topic remained publishable.&lt;ref name="ri238"&gt;[[Radu Ioanid]], "Romania", in [[David S. Wyman]], Charles H. Rosenzveig (eds.), ''The World Reacts to the Holocaust'', [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], Baltimore &amp; London, 1996, p.238.  {{ISBN|0-8018-4969-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other such exceptions are [[Camil Baltazar]], [[Maria Banuș]], [[Aurel Baranga]], [[F. Brunea-Fox]], [[Eusebiu Camilar]], [[Georgeta Horodincă]], [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], [[Norman Manea]], [[Sașa Pană]] and [[Titus Popovici]].&lt;ref name="ri238"/&gt; A reprint of ''Unde începe noaptea'' was still not possible, even though Carandino, newly released from prison, pleaded on this issue with communist [[President of Romania|President]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref name="rehasefer"/&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Dan remained largely unknown to the Romanian public. Boris Marian wrote in 2006: "more gifted, we believe, than any one of his better-known colleagues, [Sergiu Dan] is a name rarely mentioned nowadays."&lt;ref name="bmlaudabil"/&gt; Henri Zalis took special care to republish and reevaluate the early work of Sergiu Dan and other Jewish Romanians, a conscious effort to reduce the impact of antisemitic or communist repression. According to fellow critic Ovidiu Morar, this reevaluation of the political aspect was groundbreaking, and "worthy of appreciation".&lt;ref name="ovcondensata"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ovidiu Morar, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MORARapr6.html "''O istorie condensatǎ a literaturii române''"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural journalist Iulia Deleanu also noted that, in his treatment of Dan and other persecuted Jewish writers of that generation, Zalis acted as a "diagnostician".&lt;ref name="idbalanta"/&gt; Of Dan's contribution, Zalis noted: "[it] must not be forgotten [since] it speaks of an experienced tragedy, one that is inseparable from the history of [his] century. A history that belongs to us, once it is no longer overlooked."&lt;ref name="ovcondensata"/&gt; During [[Bookfest]] 2006, Zalis and [[Editura Hasefer]], the Jewish Romanian publishing house, released a critical edition of ''Unde începe noaptea''.&lt;ref name="rehasefer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cronicaromana.ro/index.php?editie=1073&amp;art=53404 "Știri.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34265">The scholarly consensus is that there was no [[The Exodus|Exodus]] as described in the Bible.{{sfn|Merrill|Rooker|Grisanti|2011|p=194}} Modern archaeologists believe that the [[Israelites]] were indigenous to Canaan and were never in Egypt, and if there is any historical basis to the Exodus it can apply only to a small segment of the population of Israelites at large.{{sfn|Collins|2004|p=182}} Nevertheless, there is also a general understanding that something must lie behind the traditions, even if [[Moses]] and the Exodus narrative belong to collective cultural memory rather to history.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=10}} Most scholars therefore agree that the narrative has a historical core, and that some highland settlers, numbering from a few hundred to a few thousand individuals, came from Egypt.{{sfn|Faust|2015|page=476}}

Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]] suggests that the Exodus narrative combines, among other things, the expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], the religious revolution of [[Akhenaten]], the experiences of the [[Habiru]] (gangs of antisocial elements found throughout the ancient Near East), and the large-scale migrations of the '[[Sea Peoples]]', into "a coherent story that is fictional as to its composition but historical as to some of its components."{{sfn|Assmann|2014|page=26}}

==The Exodus and history==
The consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of Israel.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=51}}
There is no indication that the [[Israelites]] ever lived in [[Ancient Egypt]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows almost no sign of any occupation for the entire 2nd millennium BCE (even [[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh-Barnea]], where the Israelites are said to have spent 38 years, was uninhabited prior to the establishment of the Israelite monarchy).{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} In contrast to the absence of evidence for  the Egyptian captivity and wilderness wanderings, there are ample signs of Israel's evolution within Canaan from native Canaanite roots.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}} While a few scholars discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of the exodus story, the majority of archaeologists have abandoned it, in the phrase used by archaeologist William Dever, as "a fruitless pursuit".{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=89}}{{sfn|Dever|2001|p=99}}

The biblical narrative contains some details which are authentically Egyptian, but such details are scant, and the story frequently does not reflect Egypt of the Late Bronze Age or even Egypt at all (it is unlikely, for example, that a mother would place a baby in the reeds of the Nile, where it would be in danger from crocodiles).{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=2}} Such elements of the narrative as can be fitted into the 2nd millennium could equally belong to the 1st, consistent with a 1st millennium BCE writer trying to set an old story in Egypt.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=88–91}} (The name of Moses, for example, belongs to 1st millennium Egyptian, and would have been ''Mase'' in the 2nd).{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=2}} As a result, while a few scholars continue to discuss the historicity, or at least plausibility, of an exodus as described in the Bible, most histories of Israel do not include the Egyptian captivity, the Exodus, or the wilderness wanderings in their discussion of Israel's origins.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=88-89}}

A century of research by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] has found no evidence which can be directly related to the Exodus captivity and the escape and travels through the wilderness.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5}} Archaeologists generally agree that the [[Israelites]] had [[Canaan]]ite origins:{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}} the culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, their cult-objects are those of the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite god]] [[El (deity)|El]], the pottery remains are in the Canaanite tradition, and the alphabet used is early Canaanite.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=176}} Almost the sole marker distinguishing the "Israelite" villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of [[pig]] bones, although whether even this is an ethnic marker or is due to other factors remains a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=176}}

According to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:37–38, the [[Israelites]] numbered "about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children", plus [[Erev Rav|many non-Israelites]] and livestock. [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46 gives a more precise total of 603,550 men aged 20 and up. It is difficult to reconcile the idea of 600,000 Israelite fighting men with the information that the Israelites were afraid of the [[Philistines]] and [[Egyptians]].{{sfn|Miller|2009|p=256}} The 600,000, plus wives, children, the elderly, and the "mixed multitude" of non-Israelites would have numbered some 2 million people.{{sfn|Kantor|2005|p=70}} Marching ten abreast, and without accounting for livestock, they would have formed a column 240 km long.{{sfn|Cline|2007|p=74}} The entire Egyptian population in 1250 BCE is estimated to have been around 3 to 3.5 million,{{sfn|Butzer|1999|p=297}}{{sfn|Kantor|2005|p=70}} and no evidence has been found that Egypt ever suffered the demographic and economic catastrophe such a loss of population would represent, nor that the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai desert]] ever hosted (or could have hosted) these millions of people and their herds.{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=19}} Some have rationalised the numbers into smaller figures, for example reading the [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] as "600 families" rather than 600,000 men, but all such solutions have their own set of problems.{{sfn|Grisanti|2011|pp=240–46}}

Details point to a 1st millennium date for the composition of the narrative: [[Ezion-Geber]] (one of the [[Stations of the Exodus]]), for example, dates to a period between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE with possible further occupation into the 4th century BCE,{{sfn|Pratico|DiVito|1993|pp=1-32}} and those place-names on the Exodus route which have been identified – [[Land of Goshen|Goshen]], [[Pithom]], [[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]], [[Pi-Ramesses|Ramesses]] and [[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh Barnea]] – point to the geography of the 1st millennium rather than the 2nd.{{sfn|Van Seters|1997|pp=255ff}} Similarly, [[Pharaoh]]'s fear that the [[Israelites]] might ally themselves with foreign invaders seems unlikely in the context of the late 2nd millennium, when [[Canaan]] was part of an [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian empire]] and Egypt faced no enemies in that direction, but does make sense in a 1st millennium context, when Egypt was considerably weaker and faced invasion first from the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later from the [[Seleucid Empire]].{{sfn|Soggin|1998|pp=128–29}} The mention of the [[dromedary]] in Exodus 9:3 also suggests a later date – the widespread domestication of the [[camel]] as a herd animal is thought not to have taken place before the late 2nd millennium, after the Israelites had already emerged in Canaan,{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2002|p=334}} and they did not become widespread in Egypt until c. 200–100 BCE.{{sfn|Faye|2013|p=3}}

The chronology of the Exodus narrative is symbolic: for example, its culminating event, the erection of the [[Tabernacle]] as Yahweh's dwelling-place among his people, occurs in the year [[Chronology of the Bible|2666 Anno Mundi]] (Year of the World, meaning 2666 years after God creates the world), and two-thirds of the way through a four thousand year era which culminates in or around the re-dedication of the [[Second Temple]] in 164 BCE.{{sfn|Hayes|Miller|1986|p=59}}{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=180}} As a result, attempts to date the event to a specific century in known history have been inconclusive.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=151}} {{bibleverse|1|Kings|6:1|HE}} places it 480 years before the construction of [[Solomon's Temple]], implying an Exodus at c. 1450 BCE, but the number is rhetorical rather than historical, representing a symbolic twelve generations of forty years each.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}{{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=74}} In any case, [[Canaan]] at this time was part of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian empire]], so that the [[Israelites]] would in effect be escaping from Egypt to Egypt,{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=16, fn.10}} and its cities do not show destruction layers consistent with the Bible's account of the occupation of the land ([[Jericho]] was "small and poor, almost insignificant, and unfortified (and) [t]here was also no sign of a destruction" (Finkelstein and Silberman, 2002).{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2002|pp=77–79, 82}} [[William F. Albright]], the leading biblical archaeologist of the mid-20th century, proposed a date of around 1250–1200 BCE, but his so-called "Israelite" markers ([[Four room house|four-roomed houses]], [[collar-rimmed jar]]s, etc,) are continuations of Canaanite culture.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|pp=175–77}} The lack of evidence has led scholars to conclude that the Exodus story does not represent a specific historical moment.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=152}} 

The [[Torah]] lists the places where the Israelites rested. A few of the names at the start of the itinerary, including [[Avaris|Ra'amses]], [[Pithom]] and [[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]], are reasonably well identified with archaeological sites on the eastern edge of the [[Nile Delta]],{{sfn|Van Seters|1997|pp=255ff}} as is [[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh-Barnea]], where the Israelites spend 38 years after turning back from [[Canaan]]; other than these, very little is certain. The [[Crossing the Red Sea|crossing of the Red Sea]] has been variously placed at the Pelusic branch of the [[Nile]], anywhere along the network of [[Great Bitter Lake|Bitter Lakes]] and smaller canals that formed a barrier toward eastward escape, the [[Gulf of Suez]] (south-southeast of Succoth), and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] (south of Ezion-Geber), or even on a [[lagoon]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]]. The [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] is identified in Christian tradition with [[Mount Sinai|Jebel Musa]] in the south of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], but this association dates only from the 3rd century CE, and no evidence of the Exodus has been found there.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2005|pp=115ff}}

==The expulsion of the Hyksos==
The [[Hyksos]] were a [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic people]] whose arrival and departure from [[Ancient Egypt]] has sometimes been seen as broadly parallel to the biblical tale of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt.{{sfn|Redford|1992|page=412}} [[Canaan]]ite populations first appeared in Egypt towards the end of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] c. 1800 BCE, and either around that time, or c. 1720 BCE, established an independent realm in the eastern [[Nile Delta]]. In about 1650 BCE, this realm was assumed by the rulers known as the Hyksos, who formed the [[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]] of Egyptian pharaohs.{{sfn|Ryholt|Bülow-Jacobsen|1997}}{{sfn|Lloyd|1993|page=76}}

It has been claimed that new revolutionary methods of warfare ensured for the Hyksos their ascendancy, in their influx into the new [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporia]] being established in Egypt's delta and at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in support of the [[Red Sea]] trade.{{sfn|Winlock|1947}}{{sfn|Breasted|2003|page=216}} However, in recent years the idea of a simple Hyksos migration, with little or no war, has gained support.{{sfn|Booth|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Callender|2003|page=157}}

In any case, the [[Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt|16th Dynasty]] and the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]] continued to rule in [[Upper Egypt]] (southern Egypt) in co-existence with the Hyksos kings, perhaps as their vassals. Eventually, [[Seqenenre Tao]], [[Kamose]] and [[Ahmose I]] waged war against the Hyksos and expelled [[Khamudi]], their last king, from Egypt c. 1550 BCE.{{sfn|Ryholt|Bülow-Jacobsen|1997}}

The saga of the Hyksos was recorded by the Egyptian historian [[Manetho]] (3rd century BCE), chief priest at the Temple of [[Ra]] in [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and is preserved in three quotations by the 1st century CE Jewish historian [[Josephus|Titus Flavius Josephus]].{{sfn|Josephus|2006|p=1:14, 1:16, 1:26.}} In Manetho's ''History of Egypt'', as retold by Josephus, Manetho describes the Hyksos, their lowly origins in Asia, their invasion and dominion over Egypt, their eventual expulsion, and their subsequent exile to [[Judea]], and their establishing the city of [[Jerusalem]] and [[Temple in Jerusalem|its temple]]. Manetho defined the Hyksos as being the Hyksos or "Shepherd Kings" or "Captive Shepherds" who invaded Egypt, destroying its cities and temples and making war with the Egyptian people to "gradually destroy them to the very roots". Following a war with the Egyptians a treaty was negotiated stipulating that these Hyksos Shepherds were to exit Egypt.{{sfn|Josephus|2006|p=1:14-15}} 

Josephus said that Manetho's Hyksos narrative was a reliable Egyptian account about the Israelite Exodus, and that the Hyksos were 'our people'.{{sfn|Droge|1996|pp=121–22}}{{sfn|Josephus|2006|p=1:26}}{{sfn|Hengstenberg|1843|p=254}} [[Martin Bernal]] found that a direct relationship between the Hyksos and Israelites is plausible, although it cannot be proven. He noted that the name of the pharaoh [[Yaqub-Har]] is similar to the name of the Israelite patriarch [[Jacob]], and that the highest density of Hyksos scarabs is found in the Israelite [[West Bank]].{{sfn|Bernal|1991|page=357}} [[Donald Redford]] said that the Exodus narrative is a Canaanite memory of the Hyksos' descent and occupation of Egypt.{{sfn|Redford|1992|page=412}} [[Jan Assmann]] said the biblical narrative is more like a counterhistory: ''"It turns kings into slaves; an expulsion into a ban on emigration; a descent from the Egyptian throne to insignificance into an ascent from oppression to freedom as god's chosen people."''{{sfn|Assmann|2009b|page=59}}

Most modern historians reject any identification of the Hyksos with the Israelites, largely because it is generally believed that the early Israelites evolved within the land and culture of Canaan, rather than emerging from Egypt.{{sfn|Johnston|2004|p=181}} There is a current scholarly consensus that if the Israelites did emerge from Egypt, it must have occurred sometime during the 13th century, because there is no archaeological evidence of any distinctive Israelite material culture before that time.{{sfn|Geraty|2015|page = 58}}

==Minoan eruption==

In her book ''The Parting of the Sea: How Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plagues Shaped the Story of the Exodus'', geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen explored links between the biblical Exodus narrative, the Hyksos expulsion, and the [[Minoan eruption|Minoan (Thera) volcanic eruption]].{{sfn|Sivertsen|2009}}

Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, and were described on the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]], pharaoh of the Hyksos expulsion, have been attributed to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption.{{sfn|Foster|1996}}{{sfn|Davis|1990}}{{sfn|Goedicke|1995}} In 2014, Nadine Moeller and [[Robert K. Ritner|Robert Ritner]] offered a new translation of the Tempest Stela. They believe the unusual weather patterns described on the slab were the result of a massive volcano explosion at Thera. They also suggest that the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ahmose I]] ruled at a time closer to the Thera eruption than previously thought.{{sfn|Allen|2014}}{{sfn|Ritner|2014}}

The difficulty with this interpretation is that in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c. 1549–1524 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642–1540 BCE. Alternatively, if the eruption occurred in the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], the absence of Egyptian records of the eruption could be caused by the general disorder in Egypt around that time.{{cn|date=October 2017}} 

While it has been argued that the damage attributed to this storm may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos, and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order.{{sfn|Wiener|1998}} Documents such as [[Hatshepsut]]'s [[Speos Artemidos]] depict storms, but are clearly figurative not literal. Research indicates that the Speos Artemidos stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness.{{sfn|Wiener|1998}}

==Akhenaten and the end of the Amarna period==
[[Akhenaten]], also known as Amenhotep IV, was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] of the [[18th Dynasty]]. This Pharaoh presided over radical changes in Egyptian religious practices. He established a form of solar monotheism or [[monolatry]] based on the cult of [[Aten]], and disbanded the priesthoods of all other gods. His new capital, [[Akhetaten]] or 'Horizon of Aten', was built at the site known today as [[Amarna]].{{sfn|David|1998|pp=124-126}}{{sfn|Montserrat|2002|page=36}} The city was built hastily, mostly using mud bricks. After Akhenaten's death, it was abandoned. The temples, shrines, and royal statues were razed later, during the reign of Horemheb.{{sfn|Stevens|2015}}

The idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars.{{sfn|Freud|1939}}{{sfn|Montserrat|2002}} One of the first to mention this was [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in his book ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]''.{{sfn|Freud|1939}}Basing his arguments on a belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve.{{sfn|Freud|1939}}

Stephen Gabriel Rosenberg, an Israeli archaeologist, suggested that conditions in the [[Amarna]] period ending with the reign of Akhenaten's son, [[Tutankhamun]], very closely match those described in Exodus:&lt;ref name="haveasay"&gt;Stephen Gebriel Rosenberg (2014). [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/The-Exodus-Does-archaeology-have-a-say-348464 The Exodus: Does Archaeology Have a Say?]. ''Jerusalem Post'' (Op-Ed).&lt;/ref&gt;
* a large mudbrick city having been just constructed by slaves of [[Akhnaten]] in two years at [[El Amarna]], a site with little straw, and being abandoned with his religion
* a disenfranchised monotheistic priest class displaced by followers of the old gods of [[Saqqara]] and [[Luxor]] being restored
* extremely specific predictions of disaster - recorded on Tutankhamun's restoration stele - claiming "old gods would punish him if they were not given back their old rights and positions:
** [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]], the androgynous god of the Nile, would make its waters undrinkable; 
** [[Heqet]], the goddess of fertility, would release her frogspawn to swarm over the land;
** [[Osiris]], the god of corn, would not prevent the locusts from consuming his cereals, and 
** [[Ra]], the sun god, would refuse to shine."&lt;ref name="haveasay" /&gt;
* strong resemblance (cherubim, carrying poles) between a pharaoh's battle shrine and the portable ''Mishkan'' or [[Tabernacle]] that went into the desert with other riches - from a city that was abandoned
** extremely strong similarity between the treatment of this portable shrine and the Temple rituals (inner and outer room) at [[Jerusalem]].

Rosenberg further suggests that this date can be reconciled easily with Exodus 12:40 claiming 430 years in Egypt - since 1760 BCE - and the theory that the Israelites came to Egypt with the semitic Hyksos, as proposed by Josephus, which modern scholars place within decades of that time. An also, that if the [[First Temple|Solomonic Temple]] was built 12 generations after the Exodus (I Kings 6:1) and these are actually 30 not 40 real years, 360 years after 1330 is 970 BCE, again within decades of modern estimates.

In 1973, [[William F. Albright]] noted that Moses and many of his family members had Egyptian names, and said that there is no good reason to deny that Moses was influenced by the monotheism of Akhenaten.{{sfn|Albright|1973}} However, Donald Redford said that there is little evidence that Akhenaten was a progenitor of Biblical monotheism. To the contrary, he said, the religion of the [[Hebrew Bible]] had its own separate development beginning 500 years later.{{sfn|Redford|1996}}

==Egyptian and Hellenistic parallels==

Several ancient non-biblical sources seem to parallel the biblical Exodus narrative, and/or the events which occurred at the end of the eighteenth dynasty, when the new religion of Akhenaten was denounced and his capital city of Amarna was abandoned. These tales often combine elements of the Hyksos expulsion.{{sfn|Assmann|2009|p=29}} For example, [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] (c. 320 BCE) tells how the Egyptians blamed a plague on foreigners and expelled them from the country, whereupon Moses, their leader, took them to Canaan.{{sfn|Assmann|2009|p=34}} There are more than a dozen versions of this story, all of them adding more detail, most of them profoundly anti-Jewish.{{sfn|Assmann|2009|p=34}} Manetho tells how 80,000 lepers and other "impure people", led by a priest named [[Osarseph]], join forces with the former Hyksos, now living in Jerusalem, to take over Egypt. They wreak havoc until eventually the pharaoh and his son chase them out to the borders of Syria, where Osarseph gives the lepers a law-code and changes his name to Moses, although the identification of Osarseph with Moses in the second account may be a later addition.{{sfn|Droge|1996|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=342}} Josephus vehemently disagreed with the claim that the Israelites were connected with Manetho's story about Osarseph and the lepers.{{sfn|Assmann|2009|pp=30-31}} The stories told by Hecataeus and Manetho seems to be related in some way to that of the Exodus, although it is impossible to tell whether they both bear witness to historical events, or Manetho is a polemical response to the Exodus story, or the Exodus story a response to the Egyptian stories.{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=170}}

Three interpretations have been proposed for Manetho's story of Osarseph and the lepers: the first, as a memory of the [[Amarna]] period; the second, as a memory of the Hyksos; and the third, as an anti-Jewish propaganda. Each explanation has evidence to support it: the name of the pharaoh, Amenophis, and the religious character of the conflict fit the Amarna reform of Egyptian religion; the name of [[Avaris]] and possibly the name Osarseph fit the Hyksos period; and the overall plot is an apparent inversion of the Jewish story of the Exodus casting the Jews in a bad light. No one theory, however, can explain all the elements. A proposal by Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]]{{sfn|Assmann|2009}} suggests that the story has no single origin but rather combines numerous historical experiences, notably the Amarna and Hyksos periods, into a folk memory.{{sfn|Assmann|2003|page=227}}

'''Suliman Bashear''' [[PhD]] ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;سليمان بشير&lt;/big&gt;}}, Sulaymān Bashīr, {{lang-he|סולימאן בשיר}}; 1947–October 1991) was a leading Druze Arab scholar and professor, who taught at [[Birzeit University]], [[An-Najah National University]], and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Bashear was noted for his work on the early historiography of Islam.

== Life and education==

Bashear was born in the northern [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] village of [[Mghar]]. Bashear studied at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] for his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1971) and [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1973). In 1976, he received his [[PhD]] at the [[University of London]] for his dissertation ‘Communism in the Arab East’, which was published both in [[Arabic]] and in [[English language|English]].

He died in October 1991 following a heart attack, cutting short a promising career. In the last six years of his life, he had produced no less than fifteen published articles.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in introduction to Studies in early Islamic tradition by Laurence Conrad, University of Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis==
Bashear made international headlines when he was injured after allegedly being thrown from a second-story window by his students at the University of Nablus in the West Bank as he argued that [[Islam]] developed as a religion gradually within the historical context of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] rather than being the revelation of a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html The New York Times Radical New Views of Islam and the Origins of the Koran]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this incident has been denied by Bashear’s wife, Dr. Lily Feidy, where she wrote in an email message, “Please note that Suliman was never attacked or injured by his students; nor was he physically attacked by anybody else. I have been asked this question a million times”.&lt;ref&gt;Sadeghi, Behnam, and Mohsen Goudarzi. "Ṣan ‘ā’1 and the Origins of the Qur’ān." Der Islam 87.1-2 (2012), page 32. DOI: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/islam-2011-0025 10.1515/islam-2011-0025]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bashear's historiography of early Islam considered not only the development of religious customs and beliefs, but also traced how later generations recast the past in order to meet the needs of their own era.
Like the work of [[Patricia Crone]], [[John Wansbrough]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]],  and other historiographers of early Islam, Bashear's research challenged what he considered to be the myth of a unified beginning Islam.

'''''The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens''''' is a 2015 book by economist [[Gabriel Zucman]], which popularized the concept of both the [[tax haven]] and [[corporate tax haven]]. The French publication was translated into English by Teresa Lavender Fagan. The foreword was written by [[Thomas Piketty]], Zucman's PhD supervisor. Both Piketty and Zucman are critical of capitalism in its present form. Where Piketty's best-selling [[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]] was the catalyst for debate about inequality, Zucman targets individual and [[corporate tax haven]]s. According to Zucman's research, $USD7.6 trillion representing about eight percent of global net financial wealth, is held in offshore accounts where no taxes are collected.

==Publication and reception==
According to ''The New York Times Book Review'' one of the "strong" virtues of ''The Hidden Wealth of Nations'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens | pages= 200 | isbn =  978-0226245423 | publisher    = [[University Of Chicago Press]] | translator   = Teresa Lavender Fagan | author       = [[Gabriel Zucman]] |url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo20159822.html |date = September 22, 2015|access-date=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that it sheds light on a potential area for significant reforms on an issues with which many may agree,"You might believe that the tax system should be made more progressive, or you might believe that it should be made less so. But whatever you think, you are unlikely to support a situation in which trillions of dollars are hardly taxed at all."&lt;ref name="NYT_Sunstein_2016_Zucman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/01/14/parking-the-big-money/ |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |date=January 14, 2016 |access-date=November 19, 2017 |title=Parking the Big Money |series=The New York Times Book Review |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described Zucman's ''The Hidden Wealth of Nations'' as "carefully considered and closely argued", there was criticism that his "his optimism about initiatives" like the much despised [[Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act]]" (FATCA) and his "neglect" of certain "conflicts of interest within nations." The review noted that Zucman was "at the beginning of what promises to be a brilliant career"−Zucman is a 28-year-old [[University of California, Berkeley]] economist. Tax havens essentially allow "world’s wealthiest individuals and firms" to "steal revenue from other nations". Those who avoid paying their fair share of taxes shift the burden to ordinary people. ''The Atlantic'' reviews said that Zucman’s "main achievement" was to quantify the theft: "$200 billion in state revenues lost through private individuals' use of tax havens, plus another $130 billion in losses created by U.S. firms booking their profits offshore."&lt;ref name="atlantic_Zucman_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/press/201511TheAtlantic.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Intractable Problem of Tax Havens |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=November 2015 |access-date=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' described it "this year’s Piketty", referring to Thomas Piketty, whose best-selling "opus" [[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]], "renewed a debate about inequality" in 2014. Piketty, who was Zucman's PhD. supervisor, wrote the forward to ''Hidden Wealth.'' Zucman, like Piketty is criticizing capitalism and his target is tax havens that allow the wealthiest individuals and corporations to avoid paying taxes on $USD7.6 trillion which represents about "8 percent of the world’s net financial wealth".&lt;ref name="Drucker_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-21/if-you-see-a-little-piketty-in-this-tax-haven-book-that-s-fine |last=Drucker |first=Jesse |date=September 21, 2015 |title=If You See a Little Piketty in This Tax-Haven Book, That's Fine |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book includes a forward by Thomas Piketty, an introduction on how countries can respond to tax havens, a chapter on the history of tax havens from the early twentieth century until today, a description of the "missing wealth" that tax havens steal from national revenues, past errors, suggestions for a new approach and a chapter on multinational corporations that avoid taxes using tax havens.

TUCEMEMS has also organized international conferences for scholars, as the Framing Premodern desires –colloquium, organized in April 2014.&lt;ref name="Activity "&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/news-and-events/Pages/home.aspx Activity], The official website of the Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquium discussed the themes of sexuality and sexual control in medieval and early modern societies.&lt;ref name="FDP"&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/news-and-events/colloquiums/premoderndesires/Pages/home.aspx Framing Premodern Desires], The official homepage of the colloquium.&lt;/ref&gt;

A very important form of activity for the Centre is the scholarly publication series, Crossing Boundaries: Turku Medieval and Early Modern Studies, published by Amsterdam University Press. TUCEMEMS has the general editorship of this scholarly series. The Centre has an Editorial Board consisting of professors and other researchers from the University of Turku, and an advisory board composed of professors and other experts from the relevant fields of study from multiple Universities from around the world.&lt;ref name="Publications"&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/publications/Pages/home.aspx Publications], The official website of the Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the Centre include lectures, seminars and conferences on varying themes.&lt;ref name="TUCEMEMS" /&gt; The Centre organizes Monthly Talks, where researchers present their research themes to other scholars.&lt;ref name="Activity " /&gt;

[[File:Sirkkalan kasarmi.jpg|thumb|The Sirkkala Campus in Turku, were much of the activities of TUCEMEMS takes place.]]

=== Administration ===

TUCEMEMS has a board of ten Members and ten Deputies. The Board is chaired by a Chairperson, who from the beginning of the Centre has been Professor Marjo Kaartinen from the Department of Cultural History of the University of Turku. The Members of the board consists of Professors from the University of Turku, representing fields of study relevant to the chronological scope of the Centre.&lt;ref name="Administration "&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/administration/Pages/home.aspx Administration], The board of TUCEMEMS.&lt;/ref&gt;

The board decides of the budget and of the yearly strategy of the Centre. The board is nominated by the dean of the Faculty of Humanities.&lt;ref name="Hallinto "&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/fi/yksikot/hum/sivustot/tucemems/hallinto/periaatteet/Sivut/home.aspx Operational principles], Operational principles of TUCEMEMS, in Finnish.&lt;/ref&gt;

New members of TUCEMEMS are accepted by the Chairperson. An individual can be accepted as a member if he or she is researching the medieval or early modern period. The person can be a postgraduate student, a post-doc researcher or a student writing their Master’s thesis, if he or she aims to continue to doctoral studies.&lt;ref name="Becoming a member "&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/fi/yksikot/hum/sivustot/tucemems/jasenet/liityjaseneksi/Sivut/home.aspx Becoming a member], How to become a member of TUCEMEMS, in Finnish.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
TUCEMEMS was established in December 2009. The activities of the Centre expanded rapidly in 2010, at the same time as the number of members grew to around 70. The Centre also connected with other centres on the world. The activities included Monthly Talks, one symposium on Medieval and Early Modern Legal Court Records, and a three lecture series held by visiting professors and various local scholars. The Centre also funded research trips and conference journeys for some of its members.&lt;ref name="Report2010"&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/administration/annualreport/Documents/Tucemems_AnnualReport2010_publish.pdf, the annual report of TUCEMEMS for the year 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 new activities were launched. The TUCEMEMS’ own research seminar started in the autumn, with six sessions held. The Centre also organised a lecture series for the general public. Theses studia generalia –lecture series have since been held every spring semester and have attracted considerable attention.&lt;ref name="Report2011"&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/administration/annualreport/Documents/tucemems_annualreport2011.pdf, the annual report of TUCEMEMS for the year 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2012 the Centre published an anthology on the medieval and early modern Turku in Finnish. TUCEMEMS also participated in the organizing of Dies Medievales, the biannual conference of Finnish medievalists in Turku. The programme of the conference was both interdisciplinary and international, with four keynote lecturers from Finland, Sweden and France and 33 presentations in three languages.&lt;ref name="Report2012"&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/administration/annualreport/Documents/Tucemems-annualreport2012.pdf, the annual report of TUCEMEMS for the year 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 The Centre started co-operation with the Amsterdam University Press for the publishing of its own scholarly series, Crossing Boundaries: Turku Medieval and Early Modern Studies. The first publication in the series will be released in 2014.{{update inline|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref name="Report2013"&gt;[http://www.utu.fi/en/units/hum/sites/tucemems/administration/annualreport/Documents/Tucemems_AnnualReport2013.pdf, the annual report of TUCEMEMS for the year 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Underwater archaeology''' is [[archaeology]] practiced underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/gprc/docDetail.action?|title=Underwater and Maritime Archeology in Latin America and the Caribbean|page=21 | id=docid 10408690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the [[classical era]] to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.se/~pa/uwa/history.htm |title=A history of underwater archaeology |first=Per |last=Akesson |work=Nordic Underwater Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbins |first1=David |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Adams |first2=Jonathan |title=Shipwrecks and maritime archaeology |journal=World Archaeology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=279–291 |year=2001 |doi=10.1080/00438240120048635}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. Underwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, [[maritime archaeology]]: the scientifically based study of past [[human]] life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under [[Sea water|salt]] or [[fresh water]] or buried beneath water-logged [[sediment]].&lt;ref name="Muckelroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muckelroy |first=K. |title=Maritime archaeology |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-521-29348-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater [[aviation archaeology]] have also emerged as bona fide activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broken Wings|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/maritime-archaeology/treasures-from-the-deep/broken-wings|website=[[Western Australian Museum]]|publisher=[[Government of Western Australia]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in [[sea-level|sea level]] because of local [[seismic]] events such as the earthquakes that devastated [[Port Royal]] and [[Alexandria]] or more widespread [[climatic]] changes on a [[continent]]al scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged.&lt;ref name="PortRoyal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/portroyal/|title=Port Royal Project: Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BouldnerCliff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2007/jul/07_90.shtml|title=:: University of Southampton|author=University of Southampton|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819063330/http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2007/jul/07_90.shtml|archivedate=2007-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the last ice age, the [[North Sea]] was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as [[mammoths]], are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of [[crannogs]],&lt;ref name="crannog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crannog.co.uk/|title=The Scottish Crannog Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; bridges and [[harbours]]) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater [[archaeological]] sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising [[sea level]]s; wells, cenotes, wrecks ([[shipwrecks]]; [[aircraft]]); the remains of structures created in water (such as [[crannogs]], [[bridge]]s or [[harbours]]); other port-related structures; [[refuse]] or [[debris]] sites where people disposed of their [[waste]], garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by [[ocean dumping|dumping]] into the water.

Underwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/wrecks/id-811 |publisher=Shipwreck Databases Western Australian Museum |title= Zuiddorp (Zuytdorp) (1712/06) North of Kalbarri}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/march/shipwrecks/Zuytdorp/Zuytdorp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603062706/http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/march/shipwrecks/Zuytdorp/Zuytdorp.html |archivedate=2004-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research potential ==
There are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual [[shipwreck]]s can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]) or circumstances of loss (''[[USS Housatonic (1861)|Housatonic]]'' was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine).&lt;ref name="Titanic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/|title=TIP – United States Senate Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Housatonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Housatonic i|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/housatonic-i.html|publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipwrecks such as ''[[Mary Rose]]'' can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental [[time capsule]], preserving an assemblage of human [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] at the moment in time when the ship was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml|title=BBC World Service – Documentaries – What Lies Beneath|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maryrose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryrose.org/|title=The Mary Rose|work=The Mary Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]]'', which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (''Hunley'' also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact);&lt;ref name="Housatonic" /&gt; the ''[[Resurgam]]'' ''II'', the first powered submarine;&lt;ref name=ACHW2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee on Historic  Wreck  Sites Annual Report 2005 |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport (United Kingdom)|Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] |accessdate=5 June 2015 |format=pdf |date=June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114115741/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Holland 5]]'', which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.&lt;ref name=DCMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Minister Andrew McIntosh Acts To Protect Wreck Site Of Prototype Submarine|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2005/dcms001_05.htm|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport (United Kingdom)|Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060926083354/http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2005/dcms001_05.htm|archivedate=26 September 2006|date=4 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Convention ==
All traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Convention on the protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comasproject.eu/index.php?lang=en |title=CoMAS project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919052158/http://www.comasproject.eu/index.php?lang=en |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Underwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, [[diving equipment]] and [[Diver training|diving skills]] are necessary. The depths that can be [[scuba diving|accessed by divers]], and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, [[submarines]] or [[remote sensing]] equipment are needed.

For a marine site, while  some form of working platform (typically a [[boat]] or [[ship]]) is  often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by [[logistics]] problems. A working platform for underwater archeology needs to be equipped to provide for  the delivery of air for example,  recompression and medical  facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including [[water dredge]] and [[air lifts]] create additional [[safety|hazards]] and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong [[tidal]] flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.

Underwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by [[Ocean current|currents]], [[Ocean surface wave|surf]], [[storm]] damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make [[in-situ conservation]] infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as [[Pholadidae|piddocks]]. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form [[concretions]]. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from underwater sites need special care.

[[Visibility]] may be poor, because of sediments or [[algae]] in the water and lack of light penetration.&lt;ref name="Cantelas1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=FJ |last1=Cantelas |first2=BA |last2=Rodgers |title=Tools, Techniques, and Zero Visibility Archaeology. |journal=In: EJ Maney, Jr and CH Ellis, Jr (Eds.) Diving for Science...1997. |volume=Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences |issue=17th Annual Scientific Diving Symposium |year=1997 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4636 |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that survey techniques that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water.

In addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good [[outreach]] possibilities or access for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deepwater Archaeology in Oil and Gas – By Kimberly L. Faulk|url=https://muablog.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/deepwater-archaeology-in-oil-and-gas-by-kimberly-l-faulk-nee-eslinger/|website=Museum of Underwater Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the [[World Wide Web]] for [[webcasting]] projects. An example is  the excavation of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=C |last1=Southerly |first2=J |last2=Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

== Techniques ==
Although specialised techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.&lt;ref name="Muckelroy" /&gt;

An important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the [[logistics]] of operating from a boat and of managing [[diving operations]]. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the ''Mary Rose'' have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.&lt;ref name="Maryrose" /&gt;

As with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualisation).

=== Position fixing ===
Knowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so [[position fixing]] is generally achieved using [[GPS]]. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using [[Navigational transit|transects]]. A site may also be located by visually [[Position fixing|surveying]] some form of marker (such as a [[buoy]]) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding [[sonar]] equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.

=== Site survey ===
[[File:Laevavrakk "Aid".png|thumb|[[Side-scan sonar]] image of shipwreck ''Aid'' in [[Estonia]].]]
The type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.

The simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional [[surveying]] by divers using [[depth gauge]]s and [[tape measure]]ments.&lt;ref name="3H"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/ |title=3D survey resource site from 3H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210160101/http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/ |archive-date=February 10, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land.&lt;ref name="3Htapeerrors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/Downloads/Tape%20Accuracy%20Paper.pdf |title=Research on the accuracy of tape survey methods from 3H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601204853/http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/Downloads/Tape%20Accuracy%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=June 1, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2018 |last=Holt |first=Peter |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, [[Remotely Operated Vehicle]]s (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface.&lt;ref name=NOAAROV&gt;{{cite web|title="ROV" stands for remotely operated vehicle|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/rov.html|website=Ocean Explorer|publisher=[[Office of Ocean Exploration]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning.&lt;ref name="Wessexacoustic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/round2/acoustic-positioning.html|title=The Acoustic Tracking System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROV technology was used during the ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water.&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recording ===
[[File:Diver&amp;shipsbell.jpg|thumb|LAMP archaeologist recording a scaled drawing of the ship's bell discovered on the late 18th century "Storm Wreck" off St. Augustine, Florida]]
A variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. [[Scale drawing]] is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic [[Slate (writing)|dive slates]], or matt [[laminated]] paper.

[[Photography]] and [[videography]] are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. [[Cameras]], including [[video cameras]] can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for [[underwater videography]]. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single [[Photomontage|photomontage or photomosaic]] image of the whole site. 3D [[photogrammetry]] has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Damme |first=T |title=Computer Vision Photogrammetry for Underwater Archaeological Site Recording in a Low-Visibility Environment |url=http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W5/231/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W5-231-2015.pdf |website=The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences |doi=10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-W5-231-2015 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Excavation ===
Where intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a [[water dredge]] or [[airlift (dredging device)|airlift]]. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.

=== Archaeological science ===
A variety of [[archaeological science]]s are used in underwater archaeology. [[Dendrochronology]] is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, [[archaeobotany]] and [[archaeozoology]] have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of [[pollen]] samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through [[X-ray]] of concretions. [[Geology]] can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, [[erosion]] by rivers and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] by rivers or in the sea.

=== Artifact recovery and conservation ===
[[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation.&lt;ref name="denix"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Donny L. |title=Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture |url=http://www.denix.osd.mil/cr/cultural-resources-program-management/archaeology/uploads/basic-methods-of-conserving-underwater-archaeological-material-culture-report-legacy/ |year=1997 |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |location=Washington D. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oregonstate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veilleux|first1=Carol A.|title=Conservation Methods Of Underwater Artifacts|url=http://oregonstate.edu/~veilleuc/UnderwaterArch/UnderwaterArch.htm|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502121500/http://oregonstate.edu/~veilleuc/UnderwaterArch/UnderwaterArch.htm|archivedate=2 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifact either needs to be dried carefully, or the water replaced with some inert medium (as in the case of [[The Mary Rose]]). Artifacts recovered from [[sea water|salt water]], particularly [[metals]] and [[glass]] need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. [[In situ conservation (archaeology)|In-situ conservation]] of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration.

=== Interpretation and presentation of underwater archaeology ===
Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Souter, C., 2006 Cultural Tourism and Diver Education. In Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches. The Springer Series in Underwater Archaeology. Staniforth, M. &amp; Nash, M. (eds) Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One excellent example is the [[Florida Public Archaeology Network]]'s (FPAN) "Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/|website=Florida Panhandle Dive Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or [[academic journal|journal]] articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/|website=uwf.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/|archivedate=2015-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"/&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C Southerly and J Gillman-Bryan. |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

Furthermore, thanks to the adoption of modern technologies, such as Virtual and Augmented reality systems, it is now possible to develop immersive and interactive digital environments for the exploitation of the underwater archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruno, F. et al.|title=Project VISAS: Virtual and augmented exploitation of submerged archaeological sites—Overview and first results|journal=Marine Technology Society Journal|date=2016|volume=50|issue=4|page=119-129|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.50.4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Publication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ.

The specialist journals on [[maritime archaeology]], which include the long established ''[[Nautical Archaeology Society#International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', ''The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology'' (AIMA)  and the recently launched ''Journal of Maritime Archaeology'' publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology.&lt;ref name="JMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/11457|title=Journal of Maritime Archaeology|work=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals.  Some institutions also make their unpublished  reports, often called  'Grey Literature',  accessible thereby allowing access to  far more detail and a wider range of  archaeological data than is otherwise the case with  books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the  [[Western Australian Museum]].&lt;ref name="WAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/#maritime-archaeology/maritime-archaeology-publications|title=Research Areas|publisher=Western Australian Museum|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of [[Jacques Cousteau]].

The techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks,&lt;ref name="IHUA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/978-0-306-46345-7|title=International Handbook of Underwater Archaeology|work=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AU1"&gt;Archaeology Underwater, The NAS Guide to Principles and Practice; eds Martin dean, Ben Ferrari, Ian Oxley, Mark Redknap and Kit Watson. Published by Nautical Archaeology Society, Archetype Press, 1992 {{ISBN|1-873132-25-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keith Muckelroy|Muckelroy]]'s classic work on Maritime Archaeology.&lt;ref name="Muckelroy" /&gt;

[[File:Sievi Boots (2).jpg|thumb|Modern rubber boots]]
[[File:Pair of Man's Dress Wellington Boots LACMA M.67.8.139a-b.jpg|thumb|[[Military uniform|Dress]] Wellington boots, c. 1845]]
The '''Wellington boot''' was originally a type of  leather [[boot]] adapted from [[Hessian (boot)|Hessian boot]]s.  They were worn and popularised by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]. The "Wellington" boot became a staple of practical foot wear for the British [[aristocracy]] and middle class in the early 19th century. The name was subsequently given to waterproof boots made of rubber and they are no longer associated with a particular class. They are now commonly used for a range of agricultural and outdoors pursuits.

==Design and use==
Wellington boots in contemporary usage are waterproof and are most often made from rubber or [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), a [[halogenated]] [[polymer]]. They are usually worn when walking on wet or muddy ground, or to protect the wearer from heavy showers and [[puddles]]. They are generally just below knee-high although shorter boots are available. 
  
The "Wellington" is a common and necessary safety or hygiene shoe in diverse industrial settings: for heavy industry with an integrated reinforced toe; protection from mud and grime in [[Mining|mines]], from chemical spills in chemical plants and from water, dirt, and mud in horticultural and agricultural work; and serving the high standard of hygiene required in [[food processing]] plants, [[operating theater|operating theatres]], and dust-free [[clean room]]s for electronics manufacture.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:DukeWellingtonJamesLonsdale.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. By [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]], 1815. Here he is portrayed wearing tasselled Hessian boots]]

The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] instructed his shoemaker, Hoby of St. James's Street, London, to modify the 18th-century [[Hessian (boot)|Hessian boot]]. The resulting new boot was fabricated in soft calfskin leather, had the trim removed and was cut to fit more closely around the leg. The heels were low cut, stacked around an inch (2.5 centimetres), and the boot stopped at mid-calf. It was suitably hard-wearing for riding, yet smart enough for informal evening wear. The boot was dubbed the ''Wellington'' and the name has stuck in English ever since. In the 1815 portrait by James Lonsdale, the Duke can be seen wearing the more formal Hessian style boots, which are tasselled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk/search/Object.asp?object_key=28601 James Lonsdale's portrait of Wellington]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington's utilitarian new boots quickly caught on with patriotic British gentlemen eager to emulate their war hero.{{Cn|date=October 2018}} Considered fashionable and foppish in the best circles and worn by [[dandies]], such as [[Beau Brummell]], they remained the main fashion for men through the 1840s. In the 1850s they were more commonly made in the calf-high version, and in the 1860s they were both superseded by the ankle boot, except for riding. Wellington is one of the two British Prime Ministers to have given his name to an item of clothing, the other being [[Sir Anthony Eden]] (see [[Anthony Eden hat]]) whilst [[Sir Winston Churchill]] gave his name to a [[cigar]], and William Gladstone (twice prime minister between 1868 and 1894) gave his to the [[Gladstone Bag]], the classic doctor's [[portmanteau]].

===Modifications===
Wellington boots were at first made of leather. However, in 1852 [[Hiram Hutchinson]] met [[Charles Goodyear]], who had just invented the [[sulfur vulcanisation]] process for natural rubber. While Goodyear decided to manufacture tyres, Hutchinson bought the patent to manufacture footwear and moved to France to establish ''À l'Aigle'' ("to the Eagle") in 1853, to honour his home country. Today the company is simply called [[Aigle (company)|Aigle]]. In a country where 95% of the population were working on fields with [[clog (shoe)|wooden clogs]] as they had been for generations, the introduction of the wholly waterproof, Wellington-type rubber boot became an instant success: farmers would be able to come back home with clean, dry feet.

===Production in World War I===
Production of the Wellington boot was dramatically boosted with the advent of [[World War I]] and a requirement for footwear suitable for the conditions in Europe's flooded and muddy [[trench warfare|trenches]]. The North British Rubber Company (now [[Hunter Boot Ltd]]) was asked by the [[War Office]] to construct a boot suitable for such conditions. The mills ran day and night to produce immense quantities of these trench boots. In total, 1,185,036 pairs were made to meet the [[British Army]]'s demands.

===Production in World War II===

In [[World War II]], Hunter Boot was again requested to supply vast quantities of Wellington and thigh boots. 80% of production was of war materials – from (rubber) ground sheets to life belts and gas masks. In the [[Netherlands]], the British forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and thigh boots in vast supplies.

By the end of the war in 1945, the Wellington had become popular among men, women and children for wet weather wear. The boot had developed to become far roomier with a thick sole and rounded toe. Also, with the rationing of that time, labourers began to use them for daily work.

===Post-war===
The lower cost and ease of rubber "Wellington" boot manufacture, and being entirely waterproof, lent itself immediately to being the preferred protective material to leather in all forms of industry. Increased attention to occupational health and safety requirements led to the [[steel toe]] or steel-capped Wellington: a protective (commonly internal) toe-capping to protect the foot from crush and puncture injuries. Although traditionally made of steel, the reinforcement may be a composite or a plastic material such as [[thermoplastic polyurethane]] (TPU).

Such steel-toe Wellingtons are nearly indispensable in an enormous range of industry and are often mandatory wear to meet local occupational health and safety legislation or insurance requirements.

Green Wellington boots, introduced by [[Hunter Boot Ltd]] in 1955, gradually became a shorthand for "country life" in the UK.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; In 1980, sales of their boots skyrocketed after Lady Diana Spencer (future [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]]) was pictured wearing a pair on the Balmoral estate during her courtship with Prince Charles.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Kate kick off a war of the Welles?p|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/8988157/Will-Kate-Middleton-kick-off-a-war-of-the-wellies.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These were the boots that shaped the world|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG3352857/These-were-the-boots-that-shaped-the-world.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032453/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG3352857/These-were-the-boots-that-shaped-the-world.html|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and terminology==
{{importance section|date=March 2016}}

===Australia===
Though most commonly called "gum boots" or "gumbies", an alternative name, "Blucher Boot", is occasionally used by some older Australians. [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] was Wellington's colleague at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and there is speculation that some early emigrants to Australia, remembering the battle, may have confused a different design the [[Blucher shoe]] developed by Blucher. The Australian poet [[Henry Lawson]] wrote a poem to a pair of Blucher Boots in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070610030904/http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/L/LawsonHenry/verse/freemansjournal/blucherboots.html "To a Pair of Blucher Boots" by Henry Lawson]&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
Usually called rubber boots, but sometimes [[galoshes]], rain boots, mucking boots, billy boots, or gum-boots, are popular in Canada and the United States, particularly in springtime when melting snows leave wet and muddy ground. Young people can be seen wearing them to school or university and taking them to summer camps.

While green is popular in Britain, red-soled black rubber boots are often seen in the United States, in addition to Canadian styles. Rubber boots specifically made for cold weather, lined with warm insulating material, are especially popular practical footwear for Canadian winters. This same style of lined boot is also popular among those who work in or near the ocean as one can wade in and out of shallow, but cold, ocean water, while staying dry and warm.
[[Image:Gummistiefel bunt fcm.jpg|thumb|Colourful [[Polyvinyl Chloride|PVC]] Wellingtons]]

In the US white mid-calf rubber boots are worn by workers on [[Shrimp fishery|shrimp boats]] and construction workers pouring concrete.

Leather boots similar to Wellington's original [[Hessian (boot)|Hessian boots]] have been marketed in North America as "Ranch Wellingtons" or "Western Wellingtons". These boots have more rounded toes, lower heels, and less radically scalloped tops than typical "[[cowboy boot]]s".

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], Wellingtons are called "gumboots" "wellies" or "Redbands" (after a popular brand), and are considered essential foot wear for farmers. Gumboots are often referred to in New Zealand popular culture such as the rurally-based ''[[Footrot Flats]]'' comic strip. The farming town of [[Taihape]] in the [[North Island]] proclaims itself "Gumboot capital of the World" and has annual competitions and events such as [[Gumboot Day]], where [[wellie wanging|gumboots are thrown]]. Most gumboots are black, but those worn by [[abattoir]] workers, butchers, fishermen and by hospital operating theatre staff and surgeons are white, and children's sizes come in multiple colours.

The term "gum boot" in New Zealand is thought to derive from the 19th-century [[kauri gum|kauri-gum]] diggers, who wore this footwear, or perhaps because the boots were made from [[gum rubber]]. The term is often abbreviated to "gummies". New Zealand comedy character [[Fred Dagg]] paid tribute to this iconic footwear in his song "Gumboots" a modified version of [[Billy Connolly]]'s "If It Wisnae Fur Yer Wellies".

===Nordic countries===
The boots are very popular in Scandinavian countries, with conditions and climate similar to Canada. In fact, before its entry into the mobile phone business, rubber boots were among the best-known products of [[Nokia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/08/07/ccshel07.xml&amp;sSheet=/money/2005/08/07/ixcoms.html ''London Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DE113BF93BA15752C1A96F948260 ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] issues rubber boots to all soldiers for use in wet conditions and during the winter with felt liners.

===Russia===
In Russia rubber boots were first introduced in the 1920s. Immediately, they became extremely popular because of Russian weather conditions. During the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], 17 rubber-boot factories were built in different parts of the [[Soviet Union]]. Along with [[valenki]] in winter, rubber boots became ''the'' traditional footwear in springs and autumns.

When [[Nikita Khrushchev]] came to power, the boot became charged politically in the context of the "Battle for Modesty" campaign, where rubber footwear was proclaimed as "socialism style" (thus fashionable), while leather, which was obviously more expensive, was derided as "capitalism style" (thus unfashionable). During the period 1961–1964 leather footwear disappeared from Soviet shops. When [[Leonid Brezhnev]] came to power in 1964, the usual leather footwear returned to shops, and rubber boots quickly lost their popularity, returning to their original role of utility footwear.

Nowadays, Wellington boots in Russia have the same role as in most countries.

===United Kingdom===
Wellington boots are a commonly used form of waterproof footwear in the UK, and usually referred to as "Wellies".
Wellington boots are particularly popular for small children when they want to jump in puddles.

==Wellingtons in sport and song==
{{importance section|date=March 2016}}
[[Image:Bootsa.jpg|thumb|Mine workers in South Africa]]
In South Africa, the sound of people dancing in gumboots has been incorporated into a form of semi-traditional popular music, sometimes known as "gumboot music" or "gumboot [[zydeco]]" in Africa, or [[Welly boot dance]] by people from [[UK|Britain]]. The dance began as a form of communication in the late 19th century in the gold mines of South Africa. The miners were forbidden to speak with each other while they worked, and were stripped of the right to wear their tribal garments. They adopted a system of communication using their work attire and native tribal rhythms. The miner uniform included Wellington boots, hard hats, and chains; so the miners used the items of their work uniform to develop a form of communication, for safety, and simply as a form of entertainment. Songs or chants sometimes accompanied these gumboot dances, often with themes of longing or loneliness, and sometimes making fun of their bosses in the songs. The owners of the mines, impressed with this phenomenon, would allow the best gumboot dancers to form troupes and perform. The dances, the uniform, and the rhythms have lived on, from the gold mines in South Africa, in [[step dance]], as well as many other forms of music and dance that use the body to create arrangements of rhythms. Traditional gumboot dances, as well as contemporary versions, can be seen throughout Africa and the United States, though in South Africa gumboot dancing has become something of a tourist attraction, rather than a celebration of liberation under oppression. The 1986 [[Paul Simon]] album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' contains the song "Gumboots". This song, like much of the album, was recorded in South Africa.

In 1974 Scottish comedian [[Billy Connolly]] adopted a comical ode to the boot called "The Welly Boot Song" as his theme tune, and it became one of his best-known songs. In 1976, satirist [[John Clarke (satirist)|John Clarke]]'s alter ego [[Fred Dagg]] reworked Connolly's song as "If It Weren't for your Gumboots", and created a hit. Wellies have also been used by the band, [[Gaelic Storm]], in their fifth full album, "[[Bring Yer Wellies]]", and in the song "Kelly's Wellies" on the same album.

Between 1994 and 1996, [[BBC1]] created several series of [[William's Wish Wellingtons]], about a boy named William whose magical red Wellington Boots could grant him wishes.

Danish band [[Alphabeat]]'s 2007 album ''[[Alphabeat]]'' contains a song called "Rubber Boots/Mackintosh".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858712244 SongMeanings.net Alphabeat – Rubber Boots]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the song "Springtime", [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] tires of spring, and they want drizzle, sleet, and "Wellies on my feet".

In the United Kingdom, there is a light-hearted sport, known as [[wellie wanging]], which involves throwing Wellington boots as far as possible.

[[File:"Anthem for Doomed Youth" by Wilfred Owen (English).jpg|thumb|right|A scan of a final draft of ''[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]'' by [[Wilfred Owen]], penned by the author.]]'''Literature in World War I''' is generally thought to include poems, novels and drama; diaries, letters, and memoirs are often included in this category as well. Although the canon continues to be challenged, the texts most frequently taught in schools and universities are lyrics by [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[Wilfred Owen]]; poems by [[Ivor Gurney]], [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], [[Charles Sorley]], [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] and [[Isaac Rosenberg]] are also widely anthologised. Many of the works during and about the war were written by men because of the war's intense demand on the young men of that generation; however, a number of women (especially [[British women's literature of World War I|in the British tradition]]) created literature about the war, often observing the effects of the war on soldiers, domestic spaces, and the homefront more generally.

&lt;!-- [[John Masefield]] submitted a report to the [[British Foreign Office]], and suggested that he be allowed to write a book about the failure of the allied efforts in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Dardanelles]], which possibly could be used in the U.S. in order to counter what he thought was German propaganda there. As a result, Masefield wrote ''[[Gallipoli (book)|Gallipoli]]''. This work was a success, encouraging the British people, and lifting them somewhat from the disappointment they had felt as a result of the Allied losses in the Dardanelles. Due to the success of his wartime writings, Masefield met with the head of [[Directorate of Military Intelligence|British Military Intelligence]] in France and was asked to write an account of the [[Battle of the Somme]]. Although Masefield had grand ideas for his book, he was denied access to the official records, and therefore, what was to be his preface to the book was published as ''"The Old Front Line"'', a description of the geography of the Somme area.

==General==
The spread of education in Britain in the decades leading up to World War I meant that British soldiers and the British public of all classes were literate. Professional and amateur authors were prolific during and after the war and found a market for their works.&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin Book of First World War Stories |editor1-first=Barbara |editor1-last=Korte |editor2-first=Ann-Marie |editor2-last=Einhaus |chapter=Introduction |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-144215-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature was produced throughout the war - with women, as well as men, feeling the 'need to record their experiences'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Second Battlefield: Women, Modernism and the First World War|last = Smith|first = Angela K|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Manchester|pages = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; - but it was in the late 1920s and early 1930s that Britain had a boom in publication of war literature.&lt;ref name="Penguin" /&gt; The next boom period was in the 1960s, when there was renewed interest in World War I during the fiftieth anniversaries and after two decades focused on World War II.&lt;ref name="Penguin" /&gt;

==Poetry==
{{wikisourcecat|World War I poetry}}
Published poets wrote over two thousand poems about and during the war.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry|editor-first=George|editor-last=Walter |publisher=Penguin UK|year=2006|isbn=978-0-14-118190-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small fraction still is known today, and several poets that were popular with contemporary readers are now obscure.&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt; An orthodox selection of poets and poems emerged during the 1960s, which often remains the standard in modern collections and distorts the impression of World War I poetry.&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt; This selection tends to emphasise the horror of war, suffering, tragedy and anger against those that wage war.&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;

In the early weeks of the war, British poets responded with an outpouring of literary production. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''For all we have and are'' was syndicated extensively by newspapers in English speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Literary Encyclopedia {{!}} For All We Have and Are|url = https://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=35613|website = www.litencyc.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bridges]] contributed a poem ''Wake Up, England!'' at the outbreak of war that he later wished suppressed.,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Up the Line to Death]]'', ed. Brian Gardner, 1976 {{ISBN|0-417-02350-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Masefield]], who later succeeded Bridges as poet laureate, wrote ''August, 1914'', a poem that was admired widely.

[[Wilfred Owen]] was killed in battle; but his poems created at the front did achieve popular attention after the war's end,.e.g., [[Dulce Et Decorum Est]], [[Insensibility]], [[Anthem for Doomed Youth]], [[Futility (poem)|Futility]] and [[Strange Meeting (poem)|Strange Meeting]].  In preparing for the publication of his collected poems, Owen tried to explain:
{{cquote|This book is not about heroes. English poetry is not yet fit to speak of them. Nor is it about deeds, or lands, nor anything about glory, honour, might, majesty, dominion, or power, except War. Above all I am not concerned with Poetry. My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.
This brief statement became the basis for a play based on the friendship between Owen and [[Siegfried Sassoon]] in 1917.}} Epic poem [[In Parenthesis]] by [[David Jones (artist-poet)]] has also been widely hailed as a masterpiece. 

The poem [[In Flanders Fields]] by [[John McCrae]] continues to be one of the more popular wartime poems in Canada, and has achieved a status where it is recognized as one of the country's most notable unofficial symbols.

The [[expressionist]] poet [[August Stramm]] wrote some of Germany's important poems about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schnell: ''Geschichte der deutschen Lyrik. Band 5: Von der Jahrhundertwende bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs''. Reclam, Stuttgart 2013. p. 81. {{ISBN|978-3-15-018892-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the war itself until the late 1970s, the genre of war poetry was almost exclusively reserved for male poets. This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women.&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Many Sisters to Many Brothers|first=Stacy|last=Gillis|title=The Oxford Handbook of British and Irish War Poetry|editor-first=Tim|editor-last=Kendall|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-928266-1|pages=100–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I.&lt;ref name="Gillis" /&gt; Examples of poems by female poets include [[Teresa Hooley]]'s ''A War Film'', [[Jessie Pope]]'s ''War Girls'', and [[Mary H.J. Henderson]]'s ''An Incident''.&lt;ref name="Gillis" /&gt; In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists.&lt;ref name="Gillis" /&gt;

==Novels==
A common subject for fiction in the 1920s and 1930s was the effect of the war, including [[shell shock]] and the huge social changes caused by the war. From the latter half of the 20th century onwards, World War I continued to be a popular subject for fiction, mainly novels.

=== Contemporary ===
[[Alfred Noyes]] is often portrayed by hostile critics as a [[militarist]] and [[jingoist]] despite being a pacifist in life.&lt;ref name=Featherstone&gt;Featherstone, Simon. ''War Poetry: An Introductory Reader''. Routledge, 1995, pp. 28, 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, when it seemed that war might yet be avoided, he published a long anti-war poem called ''The Wine Press''. During World War I, Noyes was debarred by defective eyesight from serving at the front.&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, Thomas Marc and Thorp, Willard (eds). ''Poetry of the Transition, 1850–1914'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1932, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, from 1916, he did his military service on attachment to the [[Foreign Office]], where he worked with [[John Buchan]] on [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;Mason, Mark. [http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/noyes.htm "Alfred Noyes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415233327/http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/noyes.htm |date=2012-04-15 }}, Literary Heritage: West Midlands.&lt;/ref&gt; This included work as a literary figure, writing morale-boosting short stories and exhortatory odes and lyrics recalling England's military past and asserting the morality of her cause.&lt;ref name=Featherstone/&gt; These works are forgotten today apart from two ghost stories, "The ''Lusitania'' Waits" and "The Log of the Evening Star", which are still occasionally reprinted in collections of tales of the uncanny.

''[[All Quiet on the Western Front|Im Westen nichts Neues]]'' (''"All Quiet on the Western Front"''), [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s best-selling book about World War I, was translated into 28 languages with world sales nearly reaching 4 million in 1930.&lt;ref name="Strachan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War: A History | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Strachan, Hew | year=2000 | pages=313–15 | isbn=978-0-19-289325-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the award-winning film which was based on that work of fiction have had a greater influence in shaping public views of the war than the work of any historian.&lt;ref name="Strachan"/&gt; [[John Galsworthy]]'s perspective was quite different in 1915 when he wrote
::Those of us who are able to look back from thirty years hence on this tornado of death — will conclude with a dreadful laugh that if it had never come, the state of the world would be very much the same. It is not the intention of these words to deny the desperate importance of this conflict now that it has been joined&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Galsworthy, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2s3jb6IiJ80C&amp;pg=PA627&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;vq=%22from+thirty+years+hence+on+this+tornado+of+death,+will+conclude+with+a+dreadful+laugh+that,+if+it+had+never%22&amp;source=gbs_quotes#PPA627,M1  "Art and the War" in ''Atlantic Monthly,'' p. 267.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Remarque's book was partly based on [[Henri Barbusse]]'s 1916 novel ''[[Under Fire (novel)|Under Fire]]''. Barbusse was a French journalist who served as a stretcher-bearer on the front lines, and his book was very influential in its own right at the time. By the end of the war, it had sold almost 250,000 copies and read by servicemen of many nations.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to War Writing|chapter=The First World War: British Writing|first=Trudi|last=Tate|editor-first=Catherine Mary|editor-last=McLoughlin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-521-89568-2|pages=160–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British novelist [[Mary Augusta Ward]] wrote generally pro-war novels, some at the request of United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], which nevertheless raised questions about the war.  These include ''[[England's Effort]]'' (1916), ''[[Towards the Goal]]'' (1917), ''[[Missing (Ward novel)|Missing]]'' (1917), ''[[The War and Elizabeth]]'' (1917) and ''[[Fields of Victory]]'' (1919).&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Some pre-existing popular literary characters were placed by their authors in World War I-related adventures during or directly after the war. These include [[Tom Swift]] (''[[Tom Swift and His Aerial Warship]]'' in 1915 and ''[[Tom Swift and His Air Scout]]'' in 1919), [[Sherlock Holmes]] (''[[His Last Bow (story)|His Last Bow]]'', 1917) and [[Tarzan]] (''[[Tarzan the Untamed]]'', 1920).

=== Post-war ===
[[A.P. Herbert]] was one of the first combatants to publish a novel about the war, ''[[The Secret Battle]]'' (1919).&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; This was followed in subsequent years by others, including ''[[Through the Wheat]]'' (1923) by [[Thomas Alexander Boyd]], the "Spanish Farm Trilogy"—''[[Sixty-Four]]'' (1925), ''[[Ninety-Four]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Crime at Vanderlynden's]]'' (1926)—by [[Ralph Hale Mottram]], ''[[Death of a Hero]]'' (1929) by [[Richard Aldington]], ''[[The Middle Parts of Fortune]]'' (1929) by [[Frederic Manning]], ''[[The Patriot's Progress]]'' (1930) by [[Henry Williamson]], ''[[Generals Die in Bed]]'' by [[Charles Yale Harrison]] (1930) and ''[[Winged Victory (novel)|Winged Victory]]'' (1934) by [[Victor Maslin Yeates]].&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

''[[Parade's End]]'' by [[Ford Madox Ford]] was a highly acclaimed [[tetralogy]] of novels, published between 1924 and 1927, that covers the events of World War I and the years around it from the viewpoint of a government statistician who becomes an officer in the British Army during the war. The novels were based on Ford's own experience in the war after he had enlisted at age 41.

[[Willa Cather]] wrote ''[[One of Ours]]'' in 1922, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for her novel that tells the story of Claude Wheeler, a Nebraska farmer who escapes a loveless marriage to fight in the War. Critics like [[H.L. Mencken]] and [[Sinclair Lewis]] panned the book, mostly because it romanticized war. Cather based Claude Wheeler on her cousin G.P. Cather, who was killed in 1918 at the [[Battle of Cantigny]] in France.

[[May Sinclair]] volunteered with the [[Munro Ambulance Corps]] in 1914 and published her account of the front in Belgium as ''[[A Journal of Impressions in Belgium]]'' (1915). She followed this with three novels about the war, ''[[Tasker Jevons]]'' (1916), ''The Tree of Heaven'' (1917) and ''[[The Romantic (1920 novel)|The Romantic]]'' (1920). Journalist [[Evadne Price]] wrote a semi-biographical novel ''[[Not So Quiet: Stepdaughters of War]]'' (1930) about ambulance drivers based on women she had interviewed.

[[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'' (1928), a collection of short stories, was based on the author's experience with British Intelligence during the war.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; It was loosely adapted into the film ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'' (1936), directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and a 1991 [[BBC]] TV series.

British novelist [[W.F. Morris]] wrote two mystery novels set in the Great War- [[Bretherton: Khaki or Field Grey?|''Bretherton'']] (1929) and ''Behind the Lines'' (1930). Morris served in the British army during the war.

''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' is a novel by [[Ernest Hemingway]] set during the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian campaign]] of World War I. The book, published in 1929, is a first-person account of American Frederic Henry, serving as a lieutenant ("Tenente") in the ambulance corps of the [[Italian Army]]. The novel is about a love affair between the expatriate American Henry and Catherine Barkley against the backdrop of World War I, cynical soldiers, fighting and the displacement of populations. The publication of ''A Farewell to Arms'' cemented Hemingway's stature as a modern American writer, became his first best-seller, and is described by biographer Michael Reynolds as "the premier American war novel from that debacle World War I."

The popular literary characters [[Biggles]] and [[Bulldog Drummond]] were created by veterans of the war, [[W.E. Johns]] and [[H.C. McNeile]] respectively. Both characters served in the war and shared some their creators' history. The Bulldog Drummond books were popular among veterans after the war.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Writers like [[Paul Fussell]] and Janet S.K. Watson have questioned '[w]hat role […] memory play[s] in historical reconstruction’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fighting Different Wars: Experience, Memory, and the First World War in Britain|last = Watson|first = Janet S.K.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; - arguing that retrospective accounts are often disillusioned.

Although most famous for his popular [[Hornblower series|''Hornblower'']] series of Napoleonic War adventure novels, [[C.S. Forester]] also wrote three novels set in the First World War. Of the three, only one- [[The General (C.S. Forester novel)|''The General'']] (1936) was set on the Western Front, the others [[The African Queen (novel)|''The African Queen'']] (1935), which was famously [[The African Queen (film)|filmed]] in 1951, was set in German East Africa and ''[[Brown on Resolution]]'' (1929), was a naval adventure set in the Central Pacific. According to one source, Adolf Hitler admired the novel ''The General'' in the late 1930s and recommended it to his generals due to its depiction of the British military mindset.&lt;ref&gt;Sternlicht, Sanford.V. ''C.S. Forester and the Hornblower Saga''. Syracuse University Press 1999. P-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[William March]], who fought with the U.S. Marines in France during World War I, wrote a novel ''[[Company K]]'' in 1933, loosely based on his own experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theshortreview.com/reviews/WilliamMarchCompanyK.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Another American writer [[Dalton Trumbo]] wrote a bitterly anti-war novel ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'' in 1938 which won a [[National Book Award]] the following year and was made into a [[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|film]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/a-triumph-of-anti-war-literature/16751#.WEom6UlunIU&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealander [[John A Lee]], who fought as an infantryman in World War I and who lost an arm, produced a novel ''Citizen into Soldier'' (1937) inspired by his own experiences.&lt;ref&gt;https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/john-a-lee&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late 20th-century and beyond ===
Novels concerning World War I continued to appear in the latter half of the 20th century, albeit less frequently.

The novel ''Return to the Wood'' (1955) by [[James Lansdale Hodson]] depicted the court-martial of a British soldier accused of desertion, and the book was adapted as the play ''Hamp'' in 1964 by John Wilson and filmed as ''[[King and Country]]'' by [[Joseph Losey]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-lansdale-hodson-3/return-to-the-wood/&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''Covenant with Death'' (1961) by [[John Harris (novelist)|John Harris]] portrays a Sheffield [[Pals battalion|Pals]] Battalion on the [[First day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]] in 1916 and [[Christopher Hitchens]] later referred to it as a 'neglected masterpiece'.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowska-Paryz, Marzena. ''Reimagining the War Memorial, Reinterpreting the Great War: The formats of British Commemorative Fiction''.Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. P-1, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/11/the-pity-of-war/307703/&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, there was a resurgence of fiction depicting the aerial campaigns of World War I, including ''The Blue Max'' (1964) by [[Jack D. Hunter]], which became a [[The Blue Max (1966 film)|major film]] in 1966 along with ''A Killing for the Hawks'' (1966) by [[Frederick E. Smith]] and ''In the Company of Eagles'' (1966) by [[Ernest K. Gann]]. 

''How Young They Died'' (1968) by [[Stuart Cloete]] was possibly the last novel written by an actual veteran.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, Hugh &amp; Liddle, Peter. ''Facing Armageddon: The First World War Experience''. Pen &amp; Sword, 2003. p-804&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elleston Trevor]] had made his name in the 1950s through episonage and WW2-themed novels but he turned to World War I with his novel ''Bury Him Among Kings'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-elleston-trevor-1593532.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The novel ''[[Goshawk Squadron]]'' (1971) by [[Derek Robinson (novelist)|Derek Robinson]] depicts a British air-force unit in the closing months of World War I and was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/03/fiction.reviews1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Three Cheers for Me'' (1962) and its sequel ''That's Me in the Middle'' (1973) by [[Donald Jack]], are narrated by fictional Canadian air ace Bart Bandy; both won the Leacock Medal. Canadian novelist [[Timothy Findley|Timothy Findley's]] novel of the conflict [[The Wars|''The Wars'']] was published in 1977 and it received his country's [[Governor General's Award for English-language fiction|top award]] for literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002198948602100111?journalCode=jcla&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[War Horse (novel)|War Horse]]'' (1982) by [[Michael Morpurgo]] is set in World War I and won the [[Whitbread Book Award]] for 1982. It has been adapted into a [[War Horse (play)|play]] and [[War Horse (film)|film]]. U.S. writer [[Mark Helprin|Mark Helprin's]] ''[[A Soldier of the Great War]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mark-helprin/a-soldier-of-the-great-war/&lt;/ref&gt; and French novelist [[Sebastien Japrisot]]'s ''A Very Long Engagement'' both appeared in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/book-review-dead-soldiers-broken-hearts-a-very-long-engagement-sebastien-japrisot-tr-linda-coverdale-1505454.html&lt;/ref&gt; The novel [[Birdsong (novel)|''Birdsong'']] (1993) by [[Sebastian Faulks]] received much praise&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sebastian-faulks/birdsong/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Of similar acclaim is [[Pat Barker]]'s [[Regeneration Trilogy]]; the third novel from the series ''[[The Ghost Road]],'' received the most prestigious award in British fiction: [[The Booker Prize]] in 1995 (though the nomination implied the award was for the whole series. In 2014, during the centenary of the World War I, the Indian author Akhil Katyal published the poem 'Some letters of Indian soldiers at World War One' marking the contribution of more than a million Indian soldiers to the war.

==Memoirs==
Captain [[John Hay Beith]]'s ''[[The First Hundred Thousand (book)|The First Hundred Thousand]]'', a best-selling account of life in the army, was published in 1915 and became one of the more popular books of the period. It was translated into French as ''Les Premiers Cent Mille''. Due to its popularity in the United States, which was neutral at the time, Beith was transferred to the British War Mission in Washington, D.C.

The memoirs of several famous aerial 'aces' were published during the war, including ''Winged Warfare'' (1918) by Canadian [[Billy Bishop|William Bishop]], ''Flying Fury'' (1918) by English ace [[James McCudden]] and [[The Red Fighter Pilot|''The Red Fighter Pilot'']] (1917) by [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the latter two men were killed in action after their books were written). 

After the war many participants published their memoirs and diaries.
