==Plot==
Bree ([[Nora-Jane Noone]]), decides to go for a swim at the Ketea Aquatic Center. The pool manager, McGradey (played by [[Tobin_Bell|Tobin Bell]]), later hangs signs around the pool mentioning that the pool is closing up for the holiday. Bree is later joined by her sister, Johanna (Alexandra Park) in the pool and connect over a competition in college.

Meanwhile, the janitor of the aquatic center, Clara (Diane Farr) is caught by McGradey attempting to steal from the lost and found. She is later laid off and is told to clean up before leaving.

McGradey then eagerly tells all swimmers to leave as they prepare to close. Bree and Johanna reluctantly do so. While packing up, Bree realizes that her engagement ring is missing, after attempting to show Johanna. Johanna sees the ring stuck in the metal grate at the bottom of the pool and both dive in to retrieve it.

The manager thinks everyone has left the pool and decides to close up, failing to notice the girls in the deep end of the pool. He engages the pool cover and leaves for the day with the two girls trapped inside the pool.

The girls are terrified and unsuccessfully attempt to escape. Shortly afterward, Johanna reveals that she is secretly jealous of Bree's successful lifestyle and recent engagement and that she pulled the ring from Bree's bag and threw it in the pool. Bree is initially angry with her sister but her anger is short-lived. Bree also talks about her past with her abusive alcoholic and drug addicted father. She also opens up about the fire which led to his death. Bree reveals that she is diabetic and requires a shot, or there is a possibility that she might slip into a diabetic coma.

The janitor, preparing to leave, is surprised to see the two girls trapped underneath the pool cover. Leading the girls to believe she is going to help them, she picks up Bree's bag, taking her cash, smartphone and credit card. The janitor then proceeds to blackmail her for the password to her phone and her credit card pin number. She later turns the water heater off. The girls have no choice but to wait out the night. Johanna talks about the deep mental damage from her abusive father with Bree saying, "Just keep reminding yourself that he's dead."

The janitor comes back in the morning teasing the girls again. Johanna, angry at her, leads the janitor to place her ear onto the small hole in the pool cover, subsequently stabbing her in the ear with a sharp shard of tile. The janitor then turns on the automatic pool cleaning system, causing the girls to begin suffocating in chlorine. After a few minutes, she turns this off, realising the danger in her action.   

When the janitor leaves again, Johanna apologises to Bree for her jealousy and keeps blaming herself for the situation they're in. Bree comforts her and forgives her for her wrongdoings. Bree reveals that during the accident which killed their father, she actually prevented her dad from escaping and in fact, helped kill her father.

The janitor comes back, realising the error of her ways. She decides to open up the pool cover to let the girls out but the pass code she was given by the manager no longer works, leaving the girls to remain trapped. She tells the girls they're on their own and leaves.

Bree soon grows very weak and cold, passing in and out of consciousness. After initially refusing Bree's offer to try, Johanna spends her last bits of energy trying to rip off the metal grill on the bottom of the pool, something her sister failed to do. After succeeding, Johanna smashes the fiberglass of the pool cover, allowing them to escape. She then pulled Bree, unconscious, out of the pool and gives her the insulin shot, unsure whether she will survive. The janitor appears in front of them with a gun. She threatens to kill the girls after thinking about what might happen if they didn't die in the pool, not wanting to go to prison again. The janitor instead feels sympathetic for the girls and puts the gun down and gives them their belongings back. Johanna, after calling the police, tells her to leave.

Paramedics arrive at the aquatic center and tend to Bree. Johanna gives her her engagement ring back, which the janitor blackmailed Bree for with the intention of pawning it. Bree asked how she got it back to which Johanna replies, "I killed the monster", referring back to what Bree said about killing their father.

==2006 Lordi controversy==
In May 2006 ''7 päivää'' caused a controversy by printing on its front cover a picture of [[Tomi Putaansuu]], the lead singer of the band [[Lordi]] without his face make-up on, even though the band had requested – after winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] – that no pictures of unmasked band members be published. The picture caused a huge reaction among Finns, and in merely two days over 180,000 Finns had signed a pledge to [[boycott]] the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lordi fans furious at outing by gossip magazine |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Lordi+fans+furious+at+outing+by+gossip+magazine/1135220038344 |work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530033844/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Lordi%2Bfans%2Bfurious%2Bat%2Bouting%2Bby%2Bgossip%2Bmagazine/1135220038344 |archivedate=30 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advertisers even withdrew their contracts with ''7 päivää'' because of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainostajat vetäneet ilmoituksiaan Seiskasta |url=http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/artikkeli/Mainostajat+vetäneet+ilmoituksiaan+Seiskasta/1135220039234 |work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=26 May 2006 |language=Finnish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530053721/http://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/artikkeli/Mainostajat%2Bvet%C3%A4neet%2Bilmoituksiaan%2BSeiskasta/1135220039234 |archivedate=30 May 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine quickly apologized for the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anteeksi, Lordi| url=http://www.seiska.fi/toimitus/_a38189/anteeksi+lordi/|work=7 päivää|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Katso]]'' also published some pictures, too, but it did not gain so much attention.

{{nihongo|'''''Advance Guardian Heroes'''''|アドバンスガーディアンヒーローズ|Adobansu Gādian Hīrōzu}} is a [[beat 'em up]] [[videogame]] developed by [[Treasure (company)|Treasure]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The game was released September 22, 2004 in Japan, September 14, 2004 in North America and February 18, 2005 in Europe. The American and European editions of the game are published by [[Ubisoft]].

The game is a sequel to [[Sega Saturn]]'s ''[[Guardian Heroes]]''. Since [[Sega]] is the original copyright holder and wasn't interested in assuming the production of a sequel, Treasure had to license the intellectual property from Sega in order to carry out the game themselves.

== Gameplay ==
''Advance Guardian Heroes'' is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which the playable characters can perform physical and magic attacks. Physical moves include countering and mid-air dashes. Magic attacks, which drain the MP meter, include element spells and protective barriers. It's also possible to go into "Hyper Mode", a faster, more powerful version of the playable character.

The game is separated in various stages and sub-stages with their own boss-fights, enemies, and puzzles. Gameplay modes include "Story" for up to two players, "Versus" and "Training".

Unlike its predecessor, Advance Guardian Heroes allows players to move smoothly towards and away from the screen, as opposed to switching between 3 planes.  Some platforming elements have been added to break up the combat, and two new jumping manoeuvres, the air-dash and the homing jump, have been implemented.  Some sequences in which these moves are used seem to be references to various 8-bit and arcade games, and some wire-fu films.

A large part of the game relies on a revised "barrier spell."  All playable characters (and enemies on higher difficulty settings) have the barrier spell available, and at the cost of magic-over-time, it renders a character invincible.  Properly timed use of the barrier spell allows a player to reflect projectiles and magic (in a visual effect reminiscent of Mischief Makers' Marina Liteyears throwing a laser or lightning bolt back at its source), or stun enemies who attack in melee.

A green gauge is used to represent the character's (and speculatively, the player's) anger.  At any point that the player's character is rendered immobile or out of the player's control, the player can rapidly press buttons to increase the anger gauge.  Points allocated to the character's MOB[ility] grant bonuses to how quickly this gauge increases.  When it flashes, the character can press A+B simultaneously to activate "Hyper Mode" or "Anger Mode," starting a timer in which the anger gauge decreases, the magic gauge increases, the character is given a burst of speed, and the player is returned control of his character.

If the player's character dies during the course of the game, a sinister figure appears and offers to give the character invincibility in exchange for his soul.  If the player refuses, the princess appears and reassures the player that there will be another chance, before the game transitions to a game over screen.  If the player agrees to the sinister figure's conditions, then the character is brought back to life in a state referred to as, "Devil Mode" that is unable to take damage (although still able to be knocked down and flung around) for the next 6 minutes, before the sinister figure reappears and destroys him, resulting in a game over screen.  Regardless of the player's choice, he is able to continue the game from the last checkpoint reached before going into "Devil Mode."

Also, unlike the first game, the player is allowed to use most every character that he unlocks, in the main story as well as in the other modes.

Throughout the game, defeated enemies will drop crystals of varying sizes and colour, that act as the experience points.  Between stages, players can allocate these crystals towards one or more of their character's attributes: Vitality, Mind, Attack, Defence, Magical Attack, Magical Defence, and Mobility.  At certain points, you will have to fight the heroes of the previous game, and upon defeating them, they will give you their souls, which will increase one of your attributes by 10.  Increasing an attribute with soul crystals will raise the character's level, no matter how high that attribute was to begin with.  The higher the character's level, the more soul crystals will be needed to reach the next level, so players have to allocate their points carefully.  Anything left over after allocation, can be donated towards unlocking further playable characters.

== Plot ==

The story follows the events of ''[[Guardian Heroes]]''. After the Undead Hero was returned to his rest, the heroes were given the option of becoming the Sky Spirit's perfect warriors. The group was divided, with Nicole, Serena, and Valgar joining the Sky Spirit, and Han and Genjiro refusing. Randy escaped back to earth on his own, leaving Han and Genjiro to fight a losing battle against their former comrades.

Years later, Zur returns. He resurrects Kanon and uses the power of the Guardian Heroes to take over the world. The few remaining resistance forces call upon the power of the Undead Hero once again, with one young soldier giving up his body to serve as its vessel.

Throughout the game, the character fights the previous heroes and earns their power. Ultimately, it is revealed this is another attempt by the heavens to create the ultimate warrior. In the final battle against the ruler of the heavens, all heroes gather to defeat it and subsequently leave for the Other World.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1418">An '''audio router''' is a device that transports [[sound|audio]] signals from inputs to outputs.

== Inputs and Outputs ==

The number of inputs and outputs varies dramatically. The way routers are described is normally ''number of inputs by number of outputs'' e.g. 2x1, 256x256.

== Signals ==

The type of signals transported - switched can be [[Analog signal|analogue - Analog]] -  audio signals or [[Digital data|Digital]]. [[Digital audio]] usually is in the [[AES/EBU]] standard for broadcast use. Broadband routers can route more than one signal type e.g. analogue or more than one type of digital.

== Crosspoints ==

Because any of the inputs can be routed to any output, the internal arrangement of the router is arranged as a number of crosspoints which can be activated to pass the corresponding signal to the desired output.

The effect is utilized in several magic effects, including the "Devil's Flask".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Manufacture==

To create the desired effect, the bottles are rapidly cooled on the outside and slow cooled on the inside during the glass-making process. This causes the outside to be extremely hard, and the inside to be soft and susceptible to damage which can release the powerful internal stresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Things Work|url=http://www.cybermanual.com/how-things-work-demonstrations-how-everything.html?page=135|accessdate=15 February 2017|page=135|quote=The bottle is tempered in such a way that the outside surface is experiencing compression and the inside surface is experiencing tensile stress. Since it is very hard to start a tear in a layer that is being compressed, it is hard to tear the outside of the bologna bottle.

==Uses==
Because of the seemingly paradoxical nature of the glass (being both extremely durable and extremely fragile), Bologna bottles are often used as [[Theatrical property|props]] in magic tricks, where the bottle can be shattered by rattling a small object inside it.

==History==
Mentioned in the publication of the Royal Society around 1740s, the Bologna bottle is named for where it was first discovered in Bologna, Italy. During this period, a glassblower would create a Bologna bottle by leaving the bottle in the open air instead of immediately placing the bottle back into the furnace to cool ([[Annealing (glass)|annealing]]). This produced a special phenomenon, where the bottle would remain intact even when dropped from a distance onto the brick floor, but would immediately rupture if a small piece of flint were placed inside.&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=SFEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1343&amp;dq=bologna+bottle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhaz5hp7TAhUBxmMKHfUxCf0Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bologna%20bottle&amp;f=false The Philosophical Transactions and Collections – Royal society of London: Abridged and Disposed Under General Heads, Volume 10 (1743-1750).  p. 1343] &lt;/ref&gt;

Although the bottle can resist a strong external force, the extremely fragile flaws inside the bottle prevent it from being used in practical applications.

'''Canal''' is a French subscription provider It is owned by [[Vivendi]] (owner of Canal) with a hundred percent share.

== History==
In 1992, Canal was founded, as ''CanalSatellite'', and the shareholders were [[Canal+ Group]] (66 percent) and Lagardere Active (34 percent), a subsidiary of [[Lagardère Group|Lagardère]].

On 27 April 1996, CanalSatellite launched as a digital satellite platform, which was the first in Europe.

An inside account of the rise of Canal+ and establishment of CanalSatellite as a major satellite TV provider in Europe is given in the book ''[[High Above (book)|High Above]]'', which tells the story of the foundation and development of the leading European satellite operator, [[SES Astra]].

In 15 November 2016, Canalsat was rebranded as ''Canal''.

'''''Capitalism II''''' ({{zh|s=金融帝国II|t=金融帝國II|p=Jīn Róng Dì Guó II}}) is the [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] sequel to the original ''[[Capitalism (video game)|Capitalism]]''. It was created by [[Enlight Software|Enlight]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]] in 2001.

[[File:Capitalism 2.PNG|thumb|left|''Capitalism II'' in-game.]]
The player creates and controls a business empire. This in-depth strategy game covers almost every aspect of business that could be encountered in the real world, including marketing, manufacturing, purchasing, importing and retailing. It has two new campaigns (Capitalist Campaign and Entrepreneur Campaign) plus an in-depth tutorial.

The gameplay is very similar to the original version. One noticeable difference from ''Capitalism'' I is that there are fewer products derived from agricultural resources.

''Capitalism II'' will run on modern versions of Microsoft Windows whereas the previous versions would not.

''Capitalism II'' has also been ported to Mac OS X by [[Virtual Programming]].

A new expanded version of ''Capitalism II'', called ''Capitalism Lab'', was released on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1144#p5117&lt;/ref&gt; ''Capitalism Lab'' has many new features, improvements and a new concept of challenge games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalismlab.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''clave''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɑː|v|eɪ|,_|k|l|eɪ|v}}; {{IPA-es|ˈklaβe|lang}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn-foreign-language-phonetics.com/spanish-phonetic-transcription-converter.php?site_language=english Online Spanish Phonetic Transcription Converter]—Free Online Tool to convert Spanish Text to IPA Phonetic Transcription&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rhythm]]ic pattern used as a tool for [[meter (music)|temporal]] organization in [[Afro-Cuban music]]. It is present in a variety of genres such as [[Abakuá music]], [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], [[conga (music)|conga]], [[son (music)|son]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[songo music|songo]], [[timba]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]]. The five-[[drum stroke|stroke]] clave pattern represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Kubik cited by Agawu, Kofi (2006: 1-46). “Structural Analysis or Cultural Analysis? Comparing Perspectives on the ‘Standard Pattern’ of West African Rhythm” ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' v. 59, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clave pattern originated in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]], where it serves essentially the same function as it does in Cuba. In [[ethnomusicology]], clave is also known as a ''key pattern'',&lt;ref&gt;Novotney (1998: 165).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa, David (2012: 255) ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''.

Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi. {{ISBN|1-57806-145-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The clave pattern is also found in the [[African diaspora]] musics of [[Haitian Vodou drumming]], Afro-[[Brazilian music]], African American music which is known as Hambone and also found in Louisiana Voodoo drumming as well as Afro-[[Uruguayan music]]  ([[candombe]]). The clave pattern (or hambone, as it is known in the United States) is used in North [[American popular music]] as a rhythmic [[motif (music)|motif]] or simply a form of rhythmic decoration.

==Etymology==
''Clave'' is a Spanish word meaning 'code,' 'key,' as in key to a mystery or puzzle, or '[[keystone (architecture)|keystone]],' the wedge-shaped stone in the center of an arch that ties the other stones together. Clave is also the name of the patterns played on [[claves]]; two hardwood sticks used in Afro-Cuban music ensembles—Peñalosa (2009).&lt;ref name="Peñalosa 81"/&gt;

Just as a keystone holds an [[arch]] in place, the clave pattern holds the rhythm together in Afro-Cuban music.&lt;ref name="Peñalosa 81"&gt;Peñalosa, David (2009: 81). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins.'' Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main clave patterns used in Afro-Cuban music are known in North America as ''son clave'' and the ''rumba clave''.{{efn|"There are just two claves—son clave and rumba clave."&lt;ref&gt;Berroa, Ignacio (1996: Warner Brothers VHS). ''Mastering the Art Afro-Cuban Drumming''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Both are used as [[bell pattern]]s across much of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.M. (1959: 210, 212) ''Studies in African Music''. London: Oxford University Press. 1978 edition: {{ISBN|0-19-713512-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Anthony (1960: 51-52) “The Employment of the Standard Pattern in Yoruba Music” ''American Music Society Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egblewogbe"&gt;Egblewogbe cited by Collins (2004: 29) ''African Musical Symbolism in Contemporary Perspective'' (Roots, Rhythms and Relativity) Berlin: Pro Business. {{ISBN|3-938262-15-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.K. Ladzekpo quoted by Peñalosa (2009: 244)&lt;/ref&gt; Son and rumba clave can be played in either a [[Meter (music)#Types|triple-pulse]] ({{music|time|12|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}}) or [[Meter (music)#Types|duple-pulse]] ({{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|2|2}}) structure.{{efn|"In reality, as Peñalosa explains in great detail in ''The Clave Matrix'', there’s really only son and rumba clave, each of which can be played with a pure triple pulse structure feel, a pure duple pulse structure feel or somewhere in‐between. Needless to say, the terms ''son'' and ''rumba'' came much later."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Kevin (2010: 72). ''Beyond Salsa Piano; The Cuban Timba Revolution. v. 3 Cuban Piano Tumbaos (1960-1979)''. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. {{ISBN|1-4505-4553-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The contemporary Cuban practice is to write the duple-pulse clave in a single measure of {{music|time|4|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Kevin (2010: 65) ''Beyond Salsa Piano; The Cuban Timba Revolution''. v. 1 ''The Roots of the Piano Tumbao''. Santa Cruz, CA: Kevin Moore. {{ISBN|978-1-4392-6584-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also written in a single measure in ethnomusicological writings about African music.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they subdivide the beats differently, the {{music|time|12|8}} and {{music|time|4|4}} versions of each clave share the same pulse names. The correlation between the triple-pulse and duple-pulse forms of clave, as well as other patterns, is an important dynamic of sub-Saharan-based rhythm. Every triple-pulse pattern has its duple-pulse correlative.

Son clave has strokes on: 1,  1a,  2&amp;,  3&amp;,  4.

Both clave patterns are used in [[Cuban rumba|rumba]].

Recorded examples of "son clave" used in guaguancó: “Ultima rumba", ''Festival in Havana'', Piñiero, Ignacio with Carlos Embale (1955: CD). “Ague que va caer”, ''Patato y Totico'', Patato (1968: CD).&lt;/ref&gt; Some Havana-based rumba groups still use ''son clave'' for yambú.{{efn|Recorded examples of "son clave" used in yambú: “Ave Maria", ''Conjunto Folkloricó Nacional de Cuba'', (1965: phonorecord). “Mama abuela”, ''Songs and Dances'', Conjunto Clave y Guaguancó (1990: CD). “Maria Belen”, ''El callejon de los rumberos'', Yoruba Andabo (1993: CD). “Chevere”, ''Déjala en la puntica'', Conjunto Clave y Guaguancó (1996: CD). “Las lomas de Belén”, ''Buenavista en guaguagncó'', Ecué Tumba (2001: CD).}} The musical genre known as ''son'' probably adopted the clave pattern from rumba when it migrated from eastern [[Cuba]] to [[Havana]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the nineteenth century, [[African music]] and [[Culture of Europe#Art|European music]] sensibilities were blended together in original Cuban hybrids. Cuban popular music became the conduit through which sub-Saharan rhythmic elements were first codified within the context of European ('Western') [[music theory]]. The first written music rhythmically based on clave was the Cuban [[danzón]], which premiered in 1879. The contemporary concept of clave with its accompanying terminology reached its full development in Cuban popular music during the 1940s. Its application has since spread to folkloric music as well. In a sense, the Cubans standardized their myriad rhythms, both folkloric and popular, by relating nearly all of them to the clave pattern. The veiled code of African rhythm was brought to light due to clave’s omnipresence. Consequently, the term ''clave'' has come to mean both the five-stroke pattern and the total [[Matrix (music)|matrix]] it exemplifies. In other words, the rhythmic matrix is the ''clave matrix''. Clave is the key that unlocks the enigma; it de-codes the rhythmic puzzle. It’s commonly understood that the actual clave pattern does not need to be played in order for the music to be 'in clave'—Peñalosa (2009).&lt;ref name="Peñalosa 81"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most difficult applications of the clave is in the realm of composition and arrangement of Cuban and Cuban-based dance music. Regardless of the instrumentation, the music for all of the instruments of the ensemble must be written with a very keen and conscious rhythmic relationship to the clave . . . Any ‘breaks’ and/or ‘stops’ in the arrangements must also be ‘in clave’. If these procedures are not properly taken into consideration, then the music is 'out of clave' which, if not done intentionally, is considered an error. When the rhythm and music are ‘in clave,’ a great natural ‘swing’ is produced, regardless of the tempo. All musicians who write and/or interpret Cuban-based music must be ‘clave conscious,’ not just the percussionists—Santos (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Santos, John (1986) “The Clave: Cornerstone of Cuban Music” ''Modern Drummer Magazine'' p. 32 Sept.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Clave theory==
There are three main branches of what could be called ''clave theory''.

===Cuban popular music===
First is the set of concepts and related terminology, which were created and developed in Cuban popular music from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. In ''Popular Cuban Music'', Emilio Grenet defines in general terms how the duple-pulse clave pattern guides all members of the music ensemble.&lt;ref name="Grenet, Emilio 1939"&gt;Grenet, Emilio, translated by R. Phillips (1939). ''Popular Cuban Music'' New York: Bourne Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; An important Cuban contribution to this branch of music theory is the concept of the clave as a musical [[period (music)|period]], which has two rhythmically opposing halves. The first half is antecedent and moving, and the second half is consequent and grounded.

===Ethnomusicological studies of African rhythm===
The second branch comes from the [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] studies of [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan African rhythm]]. In 1959, [[Arthur Morris Jones]] published his landmark work ''[[Studies in African Music (book)|Studies in African Music]]'', in which he identified the triple-pulse clave as the [[guide pattern]] for many musics from ethnic groups across Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1959: 3).&lt;/ref&gt; An important contribution of ethnomusicology to clave theory is the understanding that the clave [[matrix (music)|matrix]] is generated by [[cross-beat|cross-rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Locke, David 1982"&gt;Locke, David (1982). "Principles of Off-Beat Timing and Cross-Rhythm in Southern Ewe Dance Drumming” ''Society for Ethnomusicology Journal'' Nov. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 3–2/2–3 clave concept and terminology===
The third branch comes from the United States. An important North American contribution to clave theory is the worldwide propagation of the 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology, which arose from the fusion of Cuban rhythms with jazz in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa (2012: 248).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in the last couple of decades have the three branches of clave theory begun to reconcile their shared and conflicting concepts. Thanks to the popularity of Cuban-based music and the vast amount of educational material available on the subject, many musicians today have a basic understanding of clave. Contemporary books that deal with clave, share a certain fundamental understanding on what ''clave'' means.{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chris Washburne considers the term to refer to the rules that govern the rhythms played with the claves. Bertram Lehman regards the clave as a concept with wide-ranging theoretical syntactic implications for African music in general, and for David Peñalosa, the ''clave matrix'' is a comprehensive system for organizing music—Toussaint (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Godfried T. 2013 ''The Geometry of Musical Rhythm: What Makes a "Good" Rhythm Good?'' p. 17. {{ISBN|1-4665-1202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mathematical analysis===
In addition to these three branches of theory, clave has in recent years been thoroughly analyzed mathematically. The structure of clave can be understood in terms of cross-rhythmic ratios, above all, three-against-two (3:2).&lt;ref&gt;Novotney (1998: ?).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Godfried Toussaint]], a Research Professor of Computer Science, has published a book and several papers on the mathematical analysis of clave and related African bell patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Godfried, "A Mathematical Analysis of African, Brazilian and Cuban Clave Rhythms" Montreal, School of Computer Science. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Godfried, "The Rhythm that Conquered the World: What Makes a 'Good' Rhythm Good?", ''Percussive Note''s. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Toussaint uses [[geometry]]&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Godfried T. 2013 ''The Geometry of Musical Rhythm: What Makes a "Good" Rhythm Good?'' {{ISBN|1-4665-1202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] as a means of exploring the significance of clave.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Godfried, “The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms”, ''Proceedings of BRIDGES: Mathematical Connections in Art Music and Science'' p. 47 Banff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Son clave===
The most common clave pattern used in Cuban popular music is called the ''[[Son (music)|son]] clave'', named after the Cuban musical genre of the same name. Clave is the basic [[period (music)|period]], composed of two rhythmically opposed [[cell (music)|cells]], one antecedent and the other consequent.{{efn|"The time span of the bell rhythm and its division into beats establish meter, a concept that implies a musical period."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, David "Improvisation in West African Musics" ''Music Educators Journal'', Vol. 66, No. 5, (Jan., 1980), p. 125-133. Published by: MENC: The National Association for Music Education.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"We find that all its melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two measures, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak."&lt;ref&gt;Grenet, Emilio, translated by R. Phillips (1939). ''Popular Cuban Music'' New York: Bourne Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Clave was initially written in two measures of {{music|time|2|4}} in Cuban music.&lt;ref&gt;Mauleón, Rebeca (1999: 6) ''101 Montunos''. Petaluma, CA: Sher Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; When written this way, each cell or clave half is represented within a single measure.

====Three-side / two-side====
{{Image frame|width=275|content=[[File:Son clave 3 side and 2 side-B.png|275px]]|align=right}}

The antecedent half has three strokes and is called the ''three-side'' of clave. The consequent half (second measure above) of clave has two strokes and is called the ''two-side''.{{efn|[The] clave pattern has two opposing rhythm cells: the first cell consists of three strokes, or the rhythm cell, which is called ''tresillo'' (Spanish tres &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; three). This rhythmically syncopated part of the clave is called the three-side or the strong part of the clave. The second cell has two strokes and is called the two-side or the weak part of the clave. . . The different accent types in the melodic line typically encounter with the clave strokes, which have some special name. Some of the clave strokes are accented both in more traditional tambores batá -music and in more modern salsa styles. Because of the popularity of these strokes, some special terms have been used to identify them. The second stroke of the strong part of the clave is called ''bombo''. It is the most often accented clave stroke in my research material. Accenting it clearly identifies the three-side of the clave.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa ''The Clave Matrix'' 2009, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; The second common clave stroke accented among these improvisations is the third stroke of the strong part of the clave. This stroke is called ''ponche''. In Cuban popular genres, this stroke is often accented in unison breaks that transition between the song sections.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa 2009, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mauleón 1993, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The third typical way to accent the clave strokes is to play a rhythm cell, which includes both bombo and ponche accents. This rhythm cell is called [the] ''conga'' pattern&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando 1965 [1950] ''La Africania De La Musica Folklorica De Cuba'', 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mauleón 1993, 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iivari, Ville (2011: 1, 5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.siba.fi/fi/web/embodimentofauthority/proceedings;jsessionid=07038526F10A06DE7ED190AD5B1744D7 The Relation Between Clave Pattern and Violin Improvisation in Santería's Religious Feast]''s.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Going only slightly into the rhythmic structure of our music we find that all its melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two measures, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak—Grenet (1939).&lt;ref name="Grenet, Emilio 1939"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[With] clave... the two measures are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites like positive and negative, expansive and contractive or the poles of a magnet. As the pattern is repeated, an alternation from one polarity to the other takes place creating pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to be suddenly reversed, the rhythm would be destroyed as in a reversing of one magnet within a series... the patterns are held in place according to both the internal relationships between the drums and their relationship with clave... Should the drums fall out of clave (and in contemporary practice they sometimes do) the internal momentum of the rhythm will be dissipated and perhaps even broken—Amira and Cornelius (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Amira and Cornelius (1992: 23, 24) ''The Music of Santeria; Traditional Rhythms of the Batá Drums.'' Tempe, AZ: White Cliffs. {{ISBN|0-941677-24-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tresillo====
[[File:Tresillo divisive.png|right|200px|thumb|Tresillo.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Charles Hiroshi (2008). ''Struggling to Define a Nation: American Music and the Twentieth Century'', p.54. {{ISBN|978-0-520-25486-2}}. Shown in common time and then in cut time with tied sixteenth &amp; eighth note rather than rest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned (2007), ''Cuba and Its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo'', p.134. {{ISBN|978-1-55652-632-9}}. Shown with tied sixteenth &amp; eighth note rather than rest.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Tresillo divisive.mid|Play}}]]

In Cuban popular music, the first three strokes of son clave are also known collectively as ''[[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]'', a Spanish word meaning [[triplet (music)|triplet]] i.e. three equal beats in the same time as two main beats. However, in the  vernacular of Cuban popular music, the term refers to the figure shown here.

===Rumba clave===
[[File:Rumba Clave Pattern.svg|right|400px|thumb|Rumba clave in duple-pulse and triple-pulse structures {{audio|Rumba Clave Pattern duple.mid|Play duple}} and {{audio|Rumba Clave Pattern triple.mid|triple}}]]

The other main clave pattern is the ''rumba clave''. Rumba clave is the key pattern used in [[Cuban rumba]]. Use of the triple-pulse form of rumba clave in Cuba can be traced back to the iron bell (''ekón'') part in [[abakuá]] music. The form of rumba known as ''[[Cuban Rumba#Columbia|columbia]]'' is culturally and musically connected with abakuá which is an Afro Cuban [[Cabildo (Cuba)|cabildo]] that descends from the Kalabari of Cameroon. Columbia also uses this pattern. Sometimes {{music|time|12|8}} rumba clave is clapped in the [[accompaniment]] of Cuban [[batá drums]]. The {{music|time|4|4}} form of rumba clave is used in [[Cuban Rumba#Yambú|yambú]], [[guaguancó]] and popular music.

There is some debate as to how the {{music|time|4|4}} rumba clave should be notated for guaguancó and yambú. In actual practice, the third stroke on the three-side and the first stroke on the two-side often fall in rhythmic positions that do not fit neatly into music notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rumbaclave.blogspot.com/ "Rumba Clave: An Illustrated Analysis"], ''Rumba Clave, BlogSpot''. January 21, 2008. "One thing is certain: What you see in standard western notation as written-clave is a long way from what's actually played."&lt;/ref&gt; Triple-pulse strokes can be substituted for duple-pulse strokes. Also, the clave strokes are sometimes displaced in such a way that they don't fall within either a triple-pulse or duple-pulse "grid".&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Michael (2006: 38). ''The Conga Drummer's Guidebook''. Petaluma, CA: Sher Music Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, many variations are possible.

The first regular use of rumba clave in Cuban popular music began with the'' [[mozambique (music)|mozambique]]'', created by Pello el Afrokan in the early 1960s. When used in popular music (such as [[songo music|songo]],  [[timba]] or Latin jazz) rumba clave can be perceived in either a 3–2 or 2–3 sequence.

===Standard bell pattern===
[[File:Standard Bell Clave Pattern.svg|right|400px|thumb|{{music|time|4|4}} standard pattern and {{music|time|12|8}} standard pattern {{audio|Standard pattern duple.mid|Play}}) and triple-pulse (12/8) form ({{audio|Standard pattern triple.mid|Play}}]]

The seven-stroke ''[[standard bell pattern]]'' contains the strokes of both clave patterns. Some North American musicians call this pattern ''clave''.&lt;ref name="Mauleón 1999: 49"&gt;Mauleón (1999: 49)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amira and Cornelius 1992: 23"&gt;Amira and Cornelius (1992: 23)&lt;/ref&gt; Other North American musicians refer to the triple-pulse form as the ''{{music|time|6|8}} bell'' because they write the pattern in two measures of {{music|time|6|8}}.

Like clave, the standard pattern is expressed in both triple and duple-pulse. The standard pattern has strokes on:
1,  1a,  2&amp; 2a,  3&amp;,  4, 4a.

The [[ethnomusicologist]] [[A.M. Jones]] observes that what we call ''son clave, rumba clave'', and the ''standard pattern'' are the most commonly used key patterns (also called ''bell patterns, timeline patterns'' and ''guide patterns'') in [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions]] and he considers all three to be basically ''one and the same pattern''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.M. (1959: 211-212)&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, they are all expressions of the same rhythmic principles. The three key patterns are found within a large geographic belt extending from [[Mali]] in northwest [[Africa]] to [[Mozambique]] in southeast Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa (2009: 53)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="{{music|time|6|8}} clave" as used by North American musicians==
[[File:6-8 clave -B.png|right|300px|thumb|{{music|time|6|8}} standard pattern {{audio|6-8 clave -B1.mid|Play}}; {{music|time|6|8}} son clave {{audio|6-8 clave -B2.mid|Play}}; {{music|time|6|8}} rumba clave {{audio|6-8 clave -B3.mid|Play}}.]]

In Afro-Cuban folkloric genres the triple-pulse ({{music|time|12|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}}) rumba clave is the archetypal form of the guide pattern. Even when the drums are playing in duple-pulse ({{music|time|4|4}}), as in guaguancó, the clave is often played with displaced strokes that are closer to triple-pulse than duple-pulse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rumbaclave.blogspot.com/ "Rumba Clave: An Illustrated Analysis"], ''Rumba Clave, BlogSpot''. January 21, 2008. "... as the tempo increased the clave would be played closer and closer to straight {{music|time|12|8}}..."&lt;/ref&gt; John Santos states: "The proper feel of this [rumba clave] rhythm, is actually closer to triple [pulse].”&lt;ref&gt;Santos (1986: 33)&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, in [[salsa (music)|salsa]] and [[Latin jazz]], especially as played in North America, {{music|time|4|4}} is the basic framework and {{music|time|6|8}} is considered something of a novelty and in some cases, an enigma. The cross-rhythmic structure (multiple beat schemes) is frequently misunderstood to be metrically ambiguous. North American musicians often refer to Afro-Cuban {{music|time|6|8}} rhythm as a ''feel'', a term usually reserved for those aspects of musical nuance not practically suited for analysis. As used by North American musicians, "{{music|time|6|8}} clave" can refer to one of three types of triple-pulse key patterns.

===Triple-pulse standard pattern===
When one hears triple-pulse rhythms in Latin jazz the percussion is most often replicating the Afro-Cuban rhythm [[bembe (membranophone)|bembé]]. The standard bell is the key pattern used in bembé and so with compositions based on triple-pulse rhythms, it is the seven-stroke bell, rather than the five-stroke clave that is the most familiar to jazz musicians. Consequently, some North American musicians refer to the triple-pulse standard pattern as "{{music|time|6|8}} clave".&lt;ref name="Mauleón 1999: 49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amira and Cornelius 1992: 23"/&gt;

===Triple-pulse rumba clave===
Some refer to the triple-pulse form of rumba clave as "{{music|time|6|8}} clave". When rumba clave is written in {{music|time|6|8}} the four underlying main beats are counted: 1, 2, 1, 2.

 '''1''' &amp; a '''2''' &amp; a |'''1''' &amp; a '''2''' &amp; a ||
 X . X . . X |. X . X . . ||

&lt;blockquote&gt;Claves... are not usually played in Afro-Cuban {{music|time|6|8}} feels... [and] the clave [pattern] is not traditionally played in {{music|time|6|8}} though it may be helpful to do so to relate the clave to the {{music|time|6|8}} bell pattern—Thress (1994).&lt;ref name="Thress"&gt;Thress, Dan (1994). ''Afro-Cuban Rhythms for Drumset'', p.9. {{ISBN|0-89724-574-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The main exceptions are: the form of rumba known as Columbia, and some performances of abakuá by rumba groups, where the {{music|time|6|8}} rumba clave pattern is played on claves.

===Triple-pulse son clave===
Triple-pulse son clave is the least common form of clave used in Cuban music. It is however, found across an enormously vast area of sub-Saharan Africa. The first published example (1920) of this pattern identified it as a hand-clap part accompanying a song from [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Natalie (1920: 98)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-rhythm and the correct metric structure==
Because {{music|time|6|8}} clave-based music is generated from [[cross-rhythm]], it is possible to count or feel the {{music|time|6|8}} clave in several different ways. The ethnomusicologist [[Arthur Morris Jones]] correctly identified the importance of this key pattern, but he mistook its accents as indicators of meter rather than the counter-metric phenomena they actually are. Similarly, while Anthony King identified the triple-pulse "son clave" as ''the ‘standard pattern’ in its simplest and most basic form'', he did not correctly identify its metric structure. King represented the pattern in a polymetric {{music|time|7+5|8}} time signature.&lt;ref&gt;King, Anthony (1961:14). ''Yoruba Sacred Music from Ekiti''. Ibadan University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Polymeteric clave.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Anthony King's polymetric representation of triple-pulse "son clave" ({{audio|6-8 clave -B2.mid|Play}}).]]

It wasn't until African musicologists like C.K. Ladzekpo entered into the discussion in the 1970s and 80s that the metric structure of sub-Saharan rhythm was unambiguously defined. The writings of [[Victor Kofi Agawu]] and David Locke must also be mentioned in this regard.&lt;ref name="Locke, David 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi (2003). ''Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the diagram below {{music|time|6|8}} (son) clave is shown on top and a [[beat (music)|beat]] [[cycle (music)|cycle]] is shown below it. Any or all of these structures may be the emphasis at a given point in a piece of music using the "{{music|time|6|8}} clave".

[[File:6-8 clave tapping.png|thumb|center|600px|Different ways to count the {{music|time|6|8}} clave, the first of which is correct {{audio|6-8_clave_tapping.mid|Play}}.]]

The example on the left ({{music|time|6|8}}) represents the correct count and ground of the "{{music|time|6|8}} clave".&lt;ref&gt;Novotney (1998: 155).&lt;/ref&gt; The four dotted quarter-notes across the two bottom measures are the main beats. All clave patterns are built upon four main beats.&lt;ref&gt;Novotney (1998: 250).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mauleón (1993: 47).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa (2009: 1-3).&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom measures on the other two examples ({{music|time|3|2}} and {{music|time|6|4}}) show cross-beats. Observing the dancer’s steps almost always reveals the main beats of the music. Because the main beats are usually emphasized in the steps and not the music, it is often difficult for an "outsider" to feel the proper metric structure without seeing the dance component. Kubik states: "In order to understand the motional structure of any music in Africa, one has to look at the dancers as well and see how they relate to the instrumental background" (2010: 78).&lt;ref&gt;Kubik, Gerhard (2010: 78). ''Theory of African Music'' v. 2. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For cultural insiders, identifying the... ‘dance feet’ occurs instinctively and spontaneously. Those not familiar with the choreographic supplement, however, sometimes have trouble locating the main beats and expressing them in movement. Hearing African music on recordings alone without prior grounding in its dance-based rhythms may not convey the choreographic supplement. Not surprisingly, many misinterpretations of African rhythm and meter stem from a failure to observe the dance.|Agawu|(2003)&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi (2003: 73). ''Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==3–2/2–3 clave concept and terminology==
[[File:Son clave cut-time 3-2 &amp; 2-3.png|right|350px|thumb|3–2 clave ({{audio|Son Clave Pattern duple.mid|Play}}) and 2–3 clave ({{audio|2-3 Son Clave.MID|Play}}) written in cut-time.]]

In Cuban popular music, a chord progression can begin on either side of clave. When the progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave. When the chord progression begins on the two-side, it is in 2–3 clave. In North America, [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[Latin jazz]] charts commonly represent clave in two measures of [[Alla breve|cut-time]] ({{music|time|2|2}}); this is most likely the influence of jazz conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Mauleón, Rebeca (1993: 52) ''Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble''. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. {{ISBN|0-9614701-9-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When clave is written in two measures (right), changing from one clave sequence to the other is a matter of reversing the order of the measures.

===Chord progression begins on the three-side (3–2)===
A [[guajeo]] is a typical Cuban [[ostinato]] melody, most often consisting of [[arpeggiated]] [[chord (music)|chords]] in [[syncopated]] patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. Most guajeos have a binary structure that expresses clave.

====Clave motif====

Kevin Moore states: "There are two common ways that the three-side is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Peñalosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm."&lt;ref name="Moore32"&gt;Moore 2011 p. 32. ''Understanding Clave''.&lt;/ref&gt; The following guajeo example is based on a clave motif. The three-side (first measure) consists of the tresillo variant known as [[cinquillo]].

[[File:3-2 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|500px|3–2 piano guajeo: clave motif, written in cut-time ({{audio|3-2 guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]

Since this chord progression begins on the three-side, the song or song section is said to be in 3–2 clave.

====Offbeat/onbeat motif====

Moore: "By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Peñalosa calls the '[[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|offbeat/onbeat]] motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common."&lt;ref name="Moore32"/&gt; With this type of guajeo motif, the three-side of clave is expressed with all offbeats. The following I–IV–V–IV progression is in a 3–2 clave sequence. It begins with an offbeat pick-up on the pulse immediately before beat 1. With some guajeos, offbeats at the end of the two-side, or onbeats at the end of the three-side serve as pick-ups leading into the next measure (when clave is written in two measures).

[[File:B guajeo.tif|thumb|center|450px|3–2 guajeo: offbeat/onbeat motif, written in cut-time ({{audio|B guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]

===Chord progression begins on the two-side (2–3)===

====Clave motif====

A [[chord progression]] can begin on either side of clave. One can therefore be on either the three-side or the two-side because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression, is the primary referent.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa 2010 p. 136. ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following guajeo is based on the clave motif in a 2–3 sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.

[[File:2-3 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|500px|2–3 piano guajeo: clave motif, written in cut-time ({{audio|2-3 guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]

====Onbeat/offbeat motif====

This guajeo is in 2–3 clave because it begins on the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]], emphasizing the onbeat quality of the two-side. The figure has the same harmonic sequence as the earlier offbeat/onbeat example, but rhythmically, the attack-point sequence of the two measures is reversed. Most salsa is in 2–3 clave, and most salsa piano guajeos are based on the 2–3 onbeat/offbeat motif.

===Going from one side of clave to the other within the same song===
The 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauza]] while he was the music director of [[Machito]] and his Afro-Cubans.&lt;ref name="Sanabria"&gt;Bobby Sanabria quoted by Peñalosa (2009: 252).&lt;/ref&gt; Bauzá was a master at moving the song from one side of clave to the other.

The following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of "Que vengan los rumberos" by Machito and his Afro-Cubans.  Notice that the melody goes from one side of clave to the other and then back again. A measure of {{music|time|2|4}} moves the chord progression from the two-side (2–3), to the three-side (3–2). Later, another measure of {{music|time|2|4}} moves the start of the chord progression back to two-side (2–3).

According to David Peñalosa:

{{quote|The first {{frac|4|1|2}} claves of the verses are in 2–3. Following the measure of {{music|time|2|4}} (half clave) the song flips to the three-side. It continues in 3–2 on the V&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord for {{frac|4|1|2}} claves. The second measure of {{music|time|2|4}} flips the song back to the two-side and the I chord.

In songs like "Que vengan los rumberos", the phrases continually alternate between a 3–2 framework and a 2–3 framework.  It takes a certain amount of flexibility to repeatedly reorder your orientation in this way. The most challenging moments are the truncations and other transitional phrases where you "pivot" in order to move your point of reference from one side of clave to the other.

Working in conjunction with the chord and clave changes, vocalist Frank "Machito" Grillo creates an arc of tension/release spanning more than a dozen measures. Initially Machito sings the melody straight (first line), but soon expresses the lyrics in the freer and more syncopated inspiración of a folkloric rumba (second line). By the time the song changes to 3–2 on the V&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord, Machito has developed a considerable amount of rhythmic tension by contradicting the underlying meter. That tension is then resolved when he sings on three consecutive main beats (quarter-notes), followed by [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]. In the measure immediately following tresillo the song returns to 2–3 and the I chord (fifth line).&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa, David (2010: 154). The Clave Matrix.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tito Puente]] learned the concept from Bauzá.&lt;ref name="Sanabria"/&gt; Tito Puente's "Philadelphia Mambo" is an example of a song that moves from one side of clave to the other. The technique eventually became a staple of composing and arranging in salsa and Latin jazz. According to Kevin Moore:

{{quote|Clave direction is relative while clave alignment is absolute. If you walk from New York to Miami, you're walking south; if you walk from Miami to New York, you're walking north. But if you put your left shoe on your right foot, (i.e., if your shoes are ''cruzado''), it's going to be a very awkward walk in either direction. Your shoes remain "aligned" (or misaligned) with your feet regardless of the direction your feet are taking you, and regardless of how poorly they fit.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Kevin (2012: 28). ''Understanding Clave and Clave Changes: Singing, Clapping and Dancing Exercises''. Santa Cruz: Moore Music. {{ISBN|1-4664-6230-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cuban folkloric musicians do not use the 3–2/2–3 system. Many Cuban performers of popular music do not use it either. The great Cuban conga player and band leader [[Mongo Santamaría]] said, "Don’t tell me about 3–2 or 2–3! In Cuba we just play. We feel it, we don’t talk about such things."&lt;ref&gt;Mongo Santamaría, cited by Washburne, Christopher (2008: 190) ''Sounding Salsa; Performing Latin Music in New York City''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press {{ISBN|1-59213-315-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another book, Santamaría said, "In Cuba we don’t think about [clave]. We know that we’re in clave. Because we know that we have to be in clave to be a musician."&lt;ref&gt;Mongo Santamaría, cited by Gerard, Charley (2001: 49) ''Music from Cuba: Mongo Santamaria, Chocolate Armenteros, and Other Stateside Cuban Musicians''. Praeger Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cuban pianist [[Sonny Bravo]], the late [[Charlie Palmieri]] would insist that, "There’s no such thing as 3–2 or 2–3, there’s only one clave!"&lt;ref&gt;Sonny Bravo cited by Peñalosa (2009: 253).&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Cuban bassist, composer and arranger Alain Pérez flatly states: "In Cuba we do not use that 2–3, 3–2 formula... 2–3, 3–2 [is] not used in Cuba. That is how people learn Cuban music outside Cuba."&lt;ref&gt;Alain Pérez cited by Peñalosa (2009: 253).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In non-Cuban music==

===Controversy over use and origins===

Perhaps the greatest testament to the musical vitality of the clave is the spirited debate it engenders, both in terms of musical usage and historical origins. This section presents examples from non-Cuban music, which some musicians (not all) hold to be representative of clave. The most common claims, those of Brazilian and subsets of American popular music, are described below.

===In Africa===

====A widely used bell pattern====
''Clave'' is a Spanish word and its musical usage as a pattern played on [[claves]] was developed in the western part of Cuba, particularly the cities of [[Matanzas]] and [[Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Fernando (1950). ''La Africania De La Musica Folklorica De Cuba''. Ediciones Universales, en español. Hardcover illustrated edition. {{ISBN|84-89750-18-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writings have claimed that the clave patterns originated in Cuba. One frequently repeated theory is that the triple-pulse African bell patterns morphed into duple-pulse forms as a result of the influence of European musical sensibilities. "The duple meter feel [of {{music|time|4|4}} rumba clave] may have been the result of the influence of marching bands and other Spanish styles..."— Washburne (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Washburne, Christopher (Fall, 1995).{{Cite web |url=http://www.chriswashburne.com/articles.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119090155/http://www.chriswashburne.com/articles.html |archive-date=2009-01-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the duple-pulse forms have existed in sub-Saharan Africa for centuries. The patterns the Cubans call ''clave'' are two of the most common bell parts used in [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions]]. [[Natalie Curtis]],&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Natalie (1920: 98). ''Songs and Tales from the Dark Continent''. New York: Dover Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.M. Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1959: 212).&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony King and [[John Collins (musician/researcher)|John Collins]] document the triple-pulse forms of what we call “son clave” and “rumba clave” in West, Central and East Africa. Francis Kofi&lt;ref&gt;Kofi, Francis (1997: 30, 42).'' Traditional Dance Rhythms of Ghana'' v.1. Everett, PA: Honey Rock.&lt;/ref&gt; and C.K. Ladzekpo&lt;ref&gt;C.K. Ladzekpo cited by Peñalosa (2009: 244).&lt;/ref&gt; document several [[Ghana]]ian rhythms that use the triple or duple-pulse forms of "son clave". Royal Harington&lt;ref&gt;Harington, Royal (1995: 63) ''West African Rhythms for Drumset''. Van Nuys, CA: Alfred Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the duple-pulse form of "rumba clave" as a bell pattern used by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Ibo people|Ibo]] of [[Nigeria]], West Africa. There are many recordings of traditional African music where one can hear the five-stroke "clave" used as a bell pattern.{{efn|Recorded examples of “son clave” in traditional music from Ghana and Benin: "Waka" (oge) Addy, Mustapha Tettey, ''The Royal Drums of Ghana'' (1991: CD). "Kpanlogo" and "Fumefume" ''Traditional Dance Rhythms of Ghana'' v.1, Kofi, Francis (1997: pp. 30, 42/CD). "Nago/Yoruba", ''Benin, Rhythms and Songs for the Vodun'' (1990: CD).}}

====Popular dance music====
Cuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic.&lt;ref&gt;Nigerian musician Segun Bucknor: "Latin American music and our music is virtually the same"—quoted by Collins 1992 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Congolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music ''rumba'', although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as [[soukous]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''. Original Music cassette tape (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Soukous=====
The following soukous bass line is an embellishment of clave.&lt;ref&gt;After Banning Eyre (2006: 16). ''Africa: Your Passport to a New World of Music.'' Alfred Pub. {{ISBN|0-7390-2474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seben bass.tif|thumb|center|350px|Top: clave; bottom: soukous bass line. {{audio|Seben bass.mid|Play}}]]

Banning Eyre distills down the Congolese guitar style to this skeletal figure, where clave is sounded by the bass notes (notated with downward stems).&lt;ref&gt;After Banning Eyre (2006: 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Highlife=====
[[Highlife]] was the most popular genre in Ghana and Nigeria during the 1960s. This arpeggiated highlife guitar part is essentially a guajeo.&lt;ref&gt;Eyre, Banning (2006: 9). "Highlife guitar example" ''Africa: Your Passport to a New World of Music''. Alfred Pub. {{ISBN|0-7390-2474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythmic pattern is known in Cuba as ''baqueteo''. The pattern of attack-points is nearly identical to the 3–2 ''clave motif'' guajeo shown earlier in this article. The [[bell pattern]] known in Cuba as ''clave'', is indigenous to Ghana and Nigeria, and is used in highlife.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa (2010: 247). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Highlife guitar.tif|thumb|center|420px|Top: clave. Bottom highlife guitar part ({{audio|Highlife guitar.mid|Play}}).]]

=====Afrobeat=====
The following [[afrobeat]] guitar part is a variant of the 2–3 ''onbeat/offbeat motif''.&lt;ref&gt;Graff, Folo (2001: 17). "Afrobeat" by Folo Graff. ''African Guitar Styles''. Lawndale CA: ADG Productions.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the melodic contour is guajeo-based. 2–3 clave is shown above the guitar for reference only. The clave pattern is not ordinarily played in afrobeat.

[[File:Afro-beat.tif|thumb|center|420px|Top: 2–3 clave. Bottom: afrobeat guitar part. {{audio|Afro-beat.mid|Play}}]]

===Guide-patterns in Cuban versus non-Cuban music===
There is some debate as to whether or not clave, as it appears in Cuban music, functions in the same way as its sister rhythms in other forms of music (Brazilian, North American and African). Certain forms of Cuban music demand a strict relationship between the clave and other musical parts, even across genres. This same structural relationship between the guide-pattern and the rest of the ensemble is easily observed in many sub-Saharan rhythms, as well as rhythms from Haiti and Brazil. However, the 3–2/2–3 concept and terminology is limited to certain types of Cuban-based popular musics and is not used in the music of Africa, Haiti, Brazil or in Afro-Cuban folkloric music. In American pop music the clave pattern tends to be used as an element of rhythmic color, rather than a guide-pattern and as such is superimposed over many types of rhythms.

===In Brazilian music===
[[File:Brazilian bells.png|thumb|right|300px|Afro-Brazilian bell patterns. {{audio|Brazilian bells 1.mid|Play 1}}, {{audio|Brazilian bells 2.mid|2}}, {{audio|Brazilian bells 3.mid|3}}, {{audio|Brazilian bells 4.mid|4}}]]

Both Cuba and Brazil imported Yoruba, [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Kongo people|Congolese]] slaves. Therefore, it is not surprising that we find the bell pattern the Cubans call ''clave'' in the Afro-Brazilian musics of [[Macumba]] and [[Maculelê (dance)]].{{efn|Recorded examples of “son clave” used in Brazilian Candomblé and Macumba rhythms: “Afro-Brazileiros” ''Batucada Fantastica'' v.4, Perrone, Luciano (1972: CD). “Avaninha / Vassi d'ogun” ''Musique du monde : Brésil  Les eaux d'Oxala'', (1982: CD). “Opanije” ''The Yoruba / Dahomean Collection'', (1998: CD). “Popolougumde” ''Pontos de Macumba'' (1999: CD). Recorded example of “son clave” used in Brazilian maculule: “Maculule” ''Brazil Capoeira'' Pereira, Nazare (2003: CD).}} "Son clave" and "rumba clave" are also used as a [[tamborim]] part in some [[batucada]] arrangements. The structure of  [[bell pattern|Afro-Brazilian bell patterns]] can be understood in terms of the ''clave concept'' (see below). Although a few contemporary Brazilian musicians have adopted the 3–2/2–3 terminology, it is traditionally not a part of the Brazilian rhythmic concept.

Bell pattern 1 is used in [[maculelê (dance)]] and some [[Candomblé]] and [[Macumba]] rhythms. Pattern 1 is known in Cuba as ''son clave''. Bell 2 is used in [[afoxê]] and can be thought of as pattern 1 embellished with four additional strokes. Bell 3 is used in [[batucada]]. Pattern 4 is the [[maracatu]] bell and can be thought of as pattern 1 embellished with four additional strokes.

====Bossa nova pattern====
[[File:Bossa nova pattern.png|right|380px|thumb|Bossa nova stick pattern ({{audio|Bossa nova pattern.mid|Play}}).]]

The so-called "bossa nova clave" (or "Brazilian clave") has a similar rhythm to that of the son clave, but the second note on the two-side is delayed by one pulse (subdivision). The rhythm is typically played as a snare rim pattern in [[bossa nova]] music. The pattern is shown below in {{music|time|2|4}}, as it is written in Brazil. In North American charts it is more likely to be written in cut-time.

According to drummer [[Bobby Sanabria]] the Brazilian composer [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]], who developed the pattern, considers it to be merely a rhythmic motif and not a clave (guide pattern). Jobim later regretted that Latino musicians misunderstood the role of this bossa nova pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Sanabria cited by Peñalosa (2009: 243).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Brazilian examples====
The examples below are transcriptions of several patterns resembling the Cuban clave that are found in various styles of Brazilian music, on the ago-gô and surdo instruments.

Legend: Time signature: {{music|time|2|4}}; L=low bell, H=high bell, O = open surdo hit, X = muffled surdo hit, and | divides the measure:

* Style: Samba 3:2; LL.L.H.H|L.L.L.H. (More common 3:2: .L.L.H.H|L.L.L.H.)
* Style: Maracatu 3:2; LH.HL.H.|L.H.LH.H
* Style: Samba 3:2; L|.L.L..L.|..L..L.L|
* Instrument: 3rd Surdo 2:3; X...OO.O|X...O.O.
* Variation of samba style: Partido Alto 2:3; L.H..L.L|.H..L.L.
* Style: Maracatu 2:3; L.H.L.H.|LH.HL.H.
* Style: Samba-Reggae or Bossanova 3:2; O..O..O.|..O..O..
* Style: Ijexa 3:2; LL.L.LL.|L.L.L.L. (HH.L.LL.|H.H.L.L.)

For 3rd example above, the clave pattern is based on a common accompaniment pattern played by the guitarist. B=bass note played by guitarist's thumb, C=chord played by fingers.
 &amp;|'''1''' &amp; 2 &amp; '''3''' &amp; 4 &amp;|'''1''' &amp; 2 &amp; '''3''' &amp; 4 &amp;||
 C|B C . C B . C .|B . C . B C . C||

The singer enters on the wrong side of the clave and the ago-gô player adjusts accordingly. This recording cuts off the first bar so that it sounds like the bell comes in on the third beat of the second bar. This is suggestive of a pre-determined rhythmic relationship between the vocal part and the percussion, and supports the idea of a clave-like structure in Brazilian music.

===In Jamaican and French Caribbean music===
The son clave rhythm is present in Jamaican mento music, and can be heard on 1950s-era recordings such as  "Don’t Fence Her In", "Green Guava" or "Limbo" by Lord Tickler, "Mango Time" by Count Lasher, "Linstead Market/Day O" by The Wigglers,  "Bargie" by The Tower Islanders, "Nebuchanezer" by Laurel Aitken and others. The Jamaican population is partly of the same origin (Congo) as many Cubans, which perhaps explains the shared rhythm. It is also heard frequently in Martinique's [[biguine]] and Dominica's [[Jing ping]]. Just as likely however is the possibility that claves and the clave rhythm spread to Jamaica, Trinidad and the other small islands of the Caribbean through the popularity of Cuban son recordings from the 1920s onward.

===Experimental clave music===

====Art music====

| audio2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxDIzbeceDY "Cross" (Eugene Novotney)]
}}

The clave rhythm and clave concept have been used in some modern art music ("classical") compositions. "Rumba Clave" by Cuban percussion virtuoso Roberto Vizcaiño has been performed in recital halls around the world. Another clave-based composition that has "gone global" is the snare drum suite "Cross" by Eugene D. Novotney.

====Odd meter "clave"====
{{external media

}}
Technically speaking, the term ''odd meter clave'' is an oxymoron. Clave consists of two even halves, in a divisive structure of four main beats. However, in recent years jazz musicians from Cuba and outside of Cuba have been experimenting with creating new "claves" and related patterns in various odd meters. Clave which is traditionally used in a [[divisive rhythm]] structure, has inspired many new creative inventions in an [[additive rhythm]] context.

&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . I developed the concept of adjusting claves to other time signatures, with varying degrees of success. What became obvious to me quite quickly was that the closer I stuck to the general rules of clave the more natural the pattern sounded. Clave has a natural flow with certain tension and resolve points. I found if I kept these points in the new meters they could still flow seamlessly, allowing me to play longer phrases. It also gave me many reference points and reduced my reliance on "one"—Guilfoyle (2006: 10).&lt;ref&gt;Guilfoyle, Conor (2006: 10).'' Odd Meter Clave for Drumset; Expanding the Rhythmic Language of Cuba''. Essen, Germany: Advance Music.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been called a landmark, "infamous", and one of the most famous bars along the [[Jersey Shore]].&lt;ref name=living&gt;{{cite news|last=Glickson|first=G|title=If you're thinking of living in Belmar|newspaper=New York Times|date=6 September 1992|pages=R5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bite&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMasters|first=Karen|title=By the beach, a club and a club sandwich|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/nyregion/quick-bite-belmar-by-the-beach-a-club-and-a-club-sandwich.html |newspaper=New York Times|date=18 August 2002|pages=NJ12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and Name==
D'Jais Bar &amp; Grill is located at 1801-1805 Ocean Avenue, a street which runs north and south along the Belmar coastline. It is on the west side of the street, and the front entrance faces the beach and boardwalk. According to Frank Sementa, who has been the owner since 1979, the name "D'Jais" comes from the childhood nickname of the first owner of the club, Dominick Joseph DiSalvo, who was called "DJ".&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Borough of Belmar New Jersey|title=Home movie of Belmar from the Summer of ‘59 Surfaces on YouTube|url=http://belmar.com/tourism-news/2009/05/home-movie-of-belmar-from-the-summer-of-59-surfaces-on-youtube/|work=Belmar|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:djafter sm.jpg|left|250px|Southern view from the ocean side.]] D'Jais was established in 1959. Locally, it has been called the most popular bar in town,&lt;ref name="Cariello; Cariello, p. 89"&gt;Cariello; Cariello, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and was busy from the start.&lt;ref name=video /&gt; D'Jais is still a popular spot &lt;ref name="living"/&gt; and has been called a "Jersey shore institution for young people".&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt; During the 1970s, D'Jais was also regular spot for [[Bruce Springsteen]], who also took part in softball games and picnics hosted by the establishment,&lt;ref name=sanford&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandford|first=Christopher|title=Springsteen: point blank|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-80921-7|pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as singer and guitarist [[Bobby Bandiera]].&lt;ref name=Douglass&gt;{{cite book|last=Douglass College|title=New Jersey folklife.|year=1988|publisher=American Studies Dept., Rutgers University|location=Ch. 13, p. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that era, it was considered "the most celebrated of the bars across from the boardwalk", and was popularized for offering five six-ounce pilsner glasses of beer for a dollar.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Local bands also played at the venue during the 70s, including [[Holme (band)|Holme]], whose members included Bobby Bandiera, Frank Sementa, and Kip Conner.&lt;ref&gt;Sandford, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lively&gt;{{cite news|last=Ames|first=L|title=The lively world of club circuit rock|newspaper=New York Times|date=7 May 1978|location=NJ28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cheap&gt;{{cite news|last=Mikle|first=J |title=Cheap concerts, free festivals could be music to your ears&lt;!--|accessdate=6 February 2011--&gt; |newspaper=Asbury Park Press (online)|date=14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased by Sementa, Luddecke, and Conner in 1979. They converted it from a bar famous for its live bands and cheap beer to a trendy dance club with a DJ, theme nights, and a party atmosphere.&lt;ref name=bite/&gt;&lt;ref name="PR2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Satore |first=Bielat |date=18 July 2013 |title= Bielat Santore &amp; Company's "WHO'S WHO in the Restaurant Industry.

In 1984, Monmouth County officials adopted a uniform 2&amp;nbsp;am closing time to discourage patrons from driving to other towns to find bars open later; however in 1986, D'Jais began closing at 12&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=stirs&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Jersey Town Shut Bars Early- and stirs debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/nyregion/jersey-town-shuts-bars-early-and-stirs-debate.html |accessdate=7 February 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 June 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1990, Sementa added the restaurant to the site.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Newspaper publication date 2002, stated "12 years ago": ''2002 - 12 = 1990'' per [[WP:CALC|routine calculations]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a study was conducted at the request of neighboring residents by the [[Alcoholic beverage control state|ABC]] board to analyze the bars operations and occupancy levels. The residents believed patrons of D'Jais had violated Quality of Life conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Residents were cited as spotting multiple fights, as well as other disruptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurant and dance club===
The appearance of D'Jais has changed since the 1970s. The outdoor portion of the restaurant is covered by rooftop, and provides patrons with oceanview seating.&lt;ref name=bite/&gt; The interior features four full-sized bars, as well as one that sits upon the outside deck.&lt;ref name=Corv/&gt; During the summer, most nights D'Jais features a DJ and dance music. There are frequently theme nights and contests.&lt;ref name=Corv/&gt; On Monday nights in the summer, Holme, a New Jersey band whose popularity dates back to the 1970s, entertains the crowd.&lt;ref name=cheap/&gt;&lt;ref name=finale&gt;{{cite news|last=Zedalis|first=J|title=Perfect forecast for finale season of surf and sun expected to end on a high note.|newspaper=Asbury Park Press|date=2 September 2005|author2=Alexander, A.|location=p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notoriety==
D'Jais is considered a landmark dance club and restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D'Jais Oceanview Bar &amp; Cafe|url=http://jerseyshore.metromix.com/bars-and-clubs/dance_club/djais-oceanview-bar-and-belmar-lake-como/493896/content|work=[[Metromix]]|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called many things, including "infamous" and "guido-central".&lt;ref name=Corv&gt;{{cite news|last=Corvino|first=Taylor|title=The D'Jais way The low down on this reputed Belmar club|url=http://jerseyshore.metromix.com/bars-and-clubs/article/the-djais-way/1985188/content|accessdate=7 February 2011|newspaper=[[Metromix]]|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Jais was named the best overall party spot and ranked 4th out of 100 in the 100 Best Bars at the Shore by ''Fun New Jersey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 Bars Down the NJ Shore|url=http://www.funnewjersey.com/upload_user/Best_New_Jersey_bars_and_Clubs/TOP_100_SHORE_BARS_NJ.HTM|work=Fun New Jersey|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club has attracted sports celebrities such as [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Brian Lynch (basketball)|Brian Lynch]].&lt;ref name=break&gt;{{cite news|last=Robbins|first=L.|title=After break and break up, Clijsters makes a fresh start|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEED61F3EF93AA1575BC0A9639C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=After%20break%20and%20break%20up,%20Clijsters%20makes%20a%20fresh%20start&amp;st=cse|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 August 2005|location=F4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, it has been called the most popular bar in town,&lt;ref name="Cariello; Cariello, p. 89"/&gt; and a local hot spot.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gould |first1=Joe |last2=McShane |first2=Larry |title=Crowds smaller at Belmar nightspot after uproar over mayor's comments |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/19/2008-07-19_crowds_smaller_at_belmar_nightspot_after-1.html |accessdate=7 February 2011 |newspaper=[[NY Daily News]] |date=19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DVD Unlimited''' was a [[DVD-by-mail]] service based in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. It was a wholly owned unit of [[SKY Network Television]]. It competed directly with [[Movieshack]] and [[Fatso (online DVD rental service)|Fatso]].

DVD Unlimited was originally based in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], and was created in late 2003 by Don and Sandy Webster, a couple who ran a traditional video store there. Due to health reasons preventing the normal operation of the video store, the couple created an online store modeled after Netflix.  DVD Unlimited was subsequently purchased by SKY TV for an undisclosed sum and promptly formed an alliance with both [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]] (New Zealand) and the [[Telecom New Zealand]] [[XtraMSN]] portal.

In June, 2008 the company announced a merger with former competitors [[Fatso (New Zealand)|Fatso]] and [[Movieshack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Media: DVD delivery market reaches limit | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10517301 | publisher = New Zealand Herald | date = 20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screen Enterprises Limited was formed by merging the businesses of DVD Unlimited, Fatso and Movie Shack. According to the 2008 Sky TV annual report, the three firms were all struggling with the business model that has "yet to be accepted in New Zealand". SKY owns 51% of Screen Enterprises Limited and as such all subscribers are consolidated into SKY’s results.

The company completed the switch-over of its services in November 2008, when it switched its members to the new service which now operates under the [[Fatso (online DVD rental service)|Fatso]] name.

'''Dave Clark''' (March 6, 1909 – July 22, 1995)&lt;ref name="GE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Uncloudy Days: The Gospel Music Encyclopdia|first=Bil|last=Carpenter|year=2005|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jacksonville, Florida]],&lt;ref name="GE"/&gt; was a pioneering [[African-American]] [[record promoter]].

Born in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], Clark became interested in music after a teacher gave him piano and violin lessons. He later learned band music and performed as a teenager with traveling [[minstrel show]]s.

He graduated from [[Lane College]] in Jackson and attended [[Juilliard School]] in New York. He began promoting for [[Decca Records]] in 1938, beginning with [[Jimmie Lunceford]]. This launched a career as a promoter for most major labels that recorded African-American music. He worked for [[Duke Records|Duke]]/[[Peacock Records|Peacock]] for 17 years, and also spent time with [[Chess Records|Chess]], [[Aladdin Records|Aladdin]], [[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo]], [[United Records|United]], [[Stax Records|Stax]], and [[TK Records|TK]], before moving to [[Malaco Records|Malaco]] in 1980.

Clark also served as the musical consultant for several movies, including ''[[The Color Purple]]''. He wrote a column for ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine during the 1960s called "Swing Row Is My Beat". Clark had over 60 songs to his credit, including [[B.B. King]]'s "[[Why I Sing the Blues]]". He was given a Pioneer Award by the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]] in 1993.

In 2013, Clark was posthumously inducted to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="BHOF"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blues.org/#ref=index|title=2013 Blues Hall of Fame Inductees Announced|publisher=Blues.org|accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis Gifford''' (26 December 1927&amp;nbsp;– 18 May 2000)&lt;ref name="guaobit"&gt;Holland, Steve, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/26/guardianobituaries Obituaries: Denis Gifford]'', ''The Guardian'', 26 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; was a British writer, broadcaster, journalist, comic artist and historian of film, comics, television and radio. In his lengthy career, he wrote and drew for [[British comic]]s; wrote more than fifty books on the creators, performers, characters and history of popular media; devised, compiled and contributed to popular programmes for [[radio]] and [[television]]; and directed several short films. Gifford was also a major comics collector, owning what was perhaps the largest collection of British comics in the world.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Sunday Observer Christmas magazine 1974|url=http://www.millersantiquesguide.com/items/26003/sunday-observer-newspaper-christmas-magazine-22-december/|work=Millers Antiques Guide|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford's work in the history of film and comics, particularly in Britain, provided an account of the work in those media of previously unattempted scope, discovering countless lost films and titles and identifying numerous uncredited creators. He was particularly interested in the early stages in film and comics history, for which records were scarce and unreliable, and his own vast collection was an invaluable source. Gifford produced detailed filmographies of every traceable fiction, non-fiction and animated film ever released in the UK, and of early animated films in the US.

He compiled the first comics catalogue attempting to list every comic ever published in the UK, as well as the first price guide for British comics. His research into the early development of comics and cinema laid the groundwork for their academic study, and his reference works remain key texts in the fields.

Gifford was also a cartoonist and comic artist who worked for numerous titles, mostly for British comics in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Although these were largely humour strips, he worked in a range of genres including [[superhero fiction|superhero]], [[Western fiction|Western]], [[science fiction]] and [[Adventure novel|adventure]].

==Early life: 1927–48==
Gifford was born in [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], London, the only son of William Gifford, a printer, and Amelia ''née'' Hutchings.&lt;ref name="Reginald ed. 1979 913"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reginald (ed.)|first=R.|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature: a Checklist, 1700–1974 (Vol. 2, Contemporary Science-Fiction Authors)|year=1979|publisher=Gale Research|location=Detroit|page=913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L25ycEzuXxIC&amp;pg=PA913&amp;lpg=PA913&amp;dq=denis+gifford+%22sherlock+holmes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lkyqi0Ogxb&amp;sig=YOnEO1v7WMpIs8EuvKoos-zwink&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EI5NT4mkD-Op0QXJq5yeBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=denis%20gifford%20%22sherlock%20holmes%22&amp;f=false|author2=Douglas Menville |author3=Mary Burgess }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the prosperous South London suburb of [[Sydenham]], but was evacuated during the war to Tonbridge, Kent.&lt;ref name="Obituary: Denis Gifford"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Denis Gifford|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1366811/Denis-Gifford.html|accessdate=19 March 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford attended the South London private school [[Dulwich College]] (1939–44), and while a pupil there was an avid comic collector and cartoonist. He produced a comic, ''The Junior'', using heated gelatine and hectograph ink, which he sold for 1d around the school,&lt;ref name="guaobit"/&gt; but had published comics art by the time he was 14 (1942).

Gifford became friends with [[Bob Monkhouse]], a Dulwich schoolmate, fellow schoolboy cartoonist and later TV comedian and presenter, who studied in the year below and also had cartoons published while at the school. Gifford and Monkhouse collaborated on comics writing and drawing, a partnership that was to continue for many years in various forms, including as radio scriptwriters. The two toured together as a comedy act in the south east of England in the late 1940s&lt;ref name="Obituary: Denis Gifford"/&gt; with Ernie Lower's West Bees Concert Party, giving charity performances with Monkhouse as the 'straight man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monkhouse|first=Bob|title=Crying With Laughter: My Life Story|year=1994|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-09-925581-2|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford continued drawing during [[National Service]] in the Royal Air Force (1946-8), in which he served in the clerical position of 'AC1 Clerk/Pay Accounts', and went on to draw the ''Telestrip'' cartoon for the ''[[London Evening News]]''.

==Comic art and comic writing: 1942–82==

Gifford's prolific career as a cartoonist included both newspaper strips and comics, almost entirely for British publishers. His first published work was ''Magical Monty'' for ''All-Fun Comics'' (1942)&lt;ref name="Reginald ed. 1979 913"/&gt;  at the age of 14, with a contribution to ''[[The Dandy]]'' the same year, and briefly worked as junior cartoonist for the newspaper ''[[Reynold's News]]'' (1944–45). He collaborated on comics writing and drawing with school friend [[Bob Monkhouse]] while they were still pupils at [[Dulwich College]] together.

After his National Service, Gifford drew the ''Telestrip'' cartoon for the ''[[London Evening News]]'', continuing in ''Rex magazine'' (1971–72), and on bubblegum and cigarette sweet packets.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Steve|title=Obituaries: Denis Gifford|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/26/guardianobituaries|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other newspaper strips were produced by Gifford for ''Empire State News'' and ''[[Sunday Dispatch]]''.

Gifford's early work was with [[D.C. Thomson Comics|D.C. Thomson]] and the majority of his work was for humour strips, but he went on to cover various genres and styles, including adventure, detective, science fiction, Western and superheroes.

Gifford was most productive as a comics artist in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. By the early 1970s Gifford's writing career, mainly on the subjects of comics and film history, began to take over from his work as a cartoonist in his own right.

===Drawing Style===
Gifford had a distinctive, simple drawing style with a light-heartedness evident even in more action-orientated strips. Panels were often bustling and dynamic, with individual characters vying for attention. His humours strips were dense with conspicuously labelled puns and 'sight gags', the "visual conventions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Denis Gifford|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1366811/Denis-Gifford.html|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; of comic art, informed by an intense awareness of the cultural heritage of the medium.

In the period Gifford drew for them, D.C. Thomson and most British comic publishers had a strict policy that artists could not sign their work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stones Throw on Comics Britannia|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34093|accessdate=15 December 2011|date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but exceptionally, he was allowed to clearly sign his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denis Gifford (26/12/1927 - 2000, UK)|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/g/gifford_denis.htm|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Age superheroes: 1945–49===
Gifford created at least three of the earliest British [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, Mr Muscle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr Muscle entry|url=http://britishgoldenagecomics.4t.com/photo.html|work=britishgoldenagecomics|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Dynamic Comics'' (1945), [[Streamline (super-hero)|Streamline]], whose #1 tagline proclaimed him "The speediest fighter in the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Denis|author2=Bob Monkhouse|journal=Streamline Comics|year=1947|issue=#1}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-created with Monkhouse for ''Streamline Comics'' (1947) and Tiger-Man, debuting in ''Ray Regan'' #1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiger-Man entry|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/t/tigerman.htm|work=Internationalhero.co.uk|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1949). Gifford himself credits "the first British superhero in the American comic book style"&lt;ref name="Gifford 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Tel's From the Crypt|journal=Comic Bits|year=1999|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to Derickson Dene by Nat Brand in British anthology comic ''The Triumph'' in 1939, but both Mr Muscle and Streamline were early attempts to introduce British characters in a characteristically American genre, prompted by severely limited imports or reprints of US superhero titles due to wartime paper rationing and import restrictions. Gifford and Monkhouse set up their own publishing company, Streamline, in the early 1950s which published reprints of other Golden Age superheroes such as Captain Might&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain Might entry|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/c/capmit.htm|work=internationalhero.co.uk|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Master Man (Fawcett Comics)|Masterman]].

Only ''Streamline Comics'' #1 had story and art by Gifford, although he contributed the one-page humour strip ''Inky the Imp of the Inkpot'' and the adventure strip ''Search for the Secret City'' in #4.

Mr Muscle should not to be confused with the later DC character Mister Muscle of ''[[Hero Hotline]]'', created by [[Bob Rozakis]], or the Charlton Comics character [[Mr. Muscles]], created by [[Jerry Siegel]]. Tiger-Man should not be confused with Tiger Man, the Street &amp; Smith Golden Age hero, Tigerman, the Fiction House Golden Age hero, or Tiger-Man, the Atlas/ Seaboard character.

===Gifford projects: ''Ray Regan'', ''Star Comics'', ''Panto Pranks'': 1946–50s===

Gifford created, wrote and edited several comics in the 1940s and 1950s. These included detective title ''Ray Regan'' (1949), with art by [[Ron Embleton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashford|first=David|author2=Norman Wright|title=Great British Comic Artists no. 2: Ron Embleton (1930–1988)|journal=Book and Magazine Collector|date=March 2002|issue=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pantomime-themed ''Panto Pranks'' (1949), which Gifford wrote and drew, ''Fizz Comics'' (1949) and ''Star Comics'' (1954), which he drew and edited with Monkhouse, featuring strips of contemporary entertainers [[Morecambe and Wise]], Bob Monkhouse himself, [[Jill Day]] and movie character [[Tobor The Great]]. These titles created by Gifford often ran for just a single issue, to take advantage of a loophole in postwar paper rationing, but the succession of short projects suited Gifford's diverse interests as it enabled him to flit from genre to genre.

===Western strips: ''Roy Rogers'' and others: 1946–61===
Gifford drew and often wrote a number of Western comics strips in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including '''Ace High' Rogers versus Redmask'' (1946),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Complete Catalogue of British Comics|year=1985|publisher=Webb &amp; Bower|location=Exeter, England|isbn=0-86350-079-X|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bill Elliott in Republic's Old Los Angeles'' in ''The Sheriff'' #3 (1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=International Book of Comics|year=1984|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London, England|isbn=0-603-03574-4|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and strips for ''Annie Oakley'' (1957–58)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Complete Catalogue of British Comics|year=1985|publisher=Webb &amp; Bower|location=Exeter, England|isbn=0-86350-079-X|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Gunhawks Western'' (1960–61).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Complete Catalogue of British Comics|year=1985|publisher=Webb &amp; Bower|location=Exeter, England|isbn=0-86350-079-X|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford provided art for movie adaptation strip ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' in Western comic ''The Sheriff Comics'' (no date, 1950s), signing himself 'Gus Denis Gifford' and offering a drawing style [in which] "[h]is likenesses could approach very close to the American ones produced by Harry Parks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Robert W.|title=Roy Rogers: a biography, radio history, television career chronicle&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=McFarland|pages=215|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; consistent with Gifford's busy, comical style in other genres.

===Humour strips: ''Knockout'', ''Whizzer &amp; Chips'' and magazine strips: 1946–71===

Gifford and Monkhouse contributed cartoon strips to various magazines in the 1940s and 1950s, including ''Galaxy'' magazine (1946) (not to be confused with ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'').

Gifford drew the cover for ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' #146 (British series), ''Adventures of [[Baron Munchausen]]'' (1962), a more comedic and cartoon-like rendering than was conventional for the title's covers, which tended to be classically heroic and often painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dccomicsartists.com/classic%20comics/uk%20by_number-2.htm|title=By Number|work=Classics Illustrated by Issue Number|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford went on to produce several strips for the highly popular humour comic ''[[Knockout (UK comics)|Knockout]]'', including ''Our Ernie'' (1950), ''Stoneage Kit the Ancient Brit'' and his own creation, the gags and puzzles strip ''Steadfact McStaunch''. He later revived ''Steadfast McStaunch'' for a run in IPC's new title ''[[Whizzer and Chips]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinn|first=Dez|title=40 Year Flashback: Whizzer and Chips No.1|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/10/40-year-flashback-whizzer-and-chips-no1.html|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1969), which itself merged with ''Knockout'' in 1973.

===Anglo Studios: ''Marvelman'', ''Captain Miracle'', ''Super DC'', ''TV Tornado'': 1954–71===
After working with [[Mick Anglo]] on the ABC science-fiction title ''Space Comics'' (1953–54), Gifford began work for Anglo Studios when it was set up in 1954, including a long stint writing and illustrating early ''[[Marvelman]]'', the superhero reinvented in the 1980s with a darker vision by [[Alan Moore]]. Gifford worked on a number of strips in several titles in the ''Marvelman'' stable, and created the light-hearted backup features ''Flip and Flop'' and ''The Friendly Soul''. He also wrote an editorial piece, ''Founding a Family'', on the history of ''Marvelman Family'' for a 1988 reprint of the strip in ''Miracleman Family'' #2. 
  
When Anglo took on US reprint series ''Annie Oakley'', Gifford was one of the staff of British and Spanish artists used to create new strips (1957–58). Gifford went on to provide Western strips for Anglo Features title ''Gunhawks Western'' (1960–61) and humour strip ''Our Lad'' for Anglo's ''Captain Miracle'' (1961) contributed several humour strips for Anglo's anthology of Silver Age DC reprints, ''Super DC'' (1969–70),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robson|first=Kid|title=A Pictorial Tribute to Mick Anglo|url=http://kidr77.blogspot.com/2011/11/pictorial-tribute-to-mick-anglo-part-1.html|work='Kid' Robson's Comicbooks, Cartoons and Collectibles|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reprints of his humour strip ''The Friendly Soul'' from ''Marvelman'' in ''Superman Bumper Book'' (1970) and ''Super DC Bumper Book'' #1 (1971). Later in the 1960s, Gifford also produced the one-off ''News of the Universe Television Service'' and regular humour strips ''Dan Dan the TV Man'' and the collection of one or two-panel gags, ''Jester Moment'' for ''[[TV Tornado]]'' (1967–68) where Mick Anglo was editor.

==History and criticism of cinema: 1952–98==

===Reference authorship===
Although Gifford did not have an academic background, he was an acknowledged authority on film history who is respected by academics in film studies, media studies and social and cultural history. Much of his reference work is recommended reading in these disciplines. Along with several other pioneering film archivists, Gifford's 'encyclopaedic work' was recognised by the Institute of Historical Research as having "provided thoroughgoing maps of British film personnel and production histories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Justin|title=Film History|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/film_history.html|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford compiled a comprehensive reference work of British-made films, [[The British Film Catalogue|''The British Film Catalogue, 1895-1970: A Reference Guide'']], listing every traceable film made in the UK, including short films generally omitted by film catalogues, with detailed entries including running time, certificate, reissue date, distributor, production company, producer, director, main cast, genre and plot summary. It was a labour of many years, as Gifford tracked down retired industry professionals and researched back issues of trade publications, fanzines and directories. The Catalogue's third (1994) edition revised all entries and was published in two volumes, ''The Fiction Film, 1895–1994'' and ''The Non-Fiction Film, 1888–1994''. It became a seminal work for British film historians, acclaimed by [[The British Film Institute]] (BFI)'s curator of Moving Image in a ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' magazine shortlist of the best ever film books: "The nearest we have to a British national filmography was created not by any institute or university but by one man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKernan|first=Luke|title=The best film books, by 51 critics|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/film_books_full.php|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford's popular work ''A Pictorial History of Horror'' also made the shortlist.

All editions of the Catalogue omitted animated films, but Gifford's ''British Animated Films, 1895–1985: A Filmography'' provided a similarly completist approach. Over 1200 films were detailed, attempting to include every British animated film of the period with a cinema release, whether full-length feature, short, public information film or advertisement. Gifford also provides an historical overview, giving particular attention to the pre-World War II era. As he was to attempt with the history of comics, Gifford sought to correct inaccuracies in cinema history that gave undue credit to the US industry, citing [[Dudley Buxton]] "who [in 1915] first animated [[The Sinking of the Lusitania|the sinking of the Lusitania]] in all its terrifying drama, three years before [[Winsor McCay]] tackled the same subject in the United states. Yet according to film history, McCay's version was the world's first dramatic cartoon film!"

Gifford's writing also included biographies of cinematic figures, including ''[[Boris Karloff|Karloff]]: The Man, The Monster, The Movies'' and ''The Movie Makers: [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]]'', with his meticulous research and detailed knowledge well suited to the form.

Gifford was a judge at the Sitges 1977 International Festival of Fantasy and Horror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sitges 1977 International Festival of Fantasy and Horror|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ca&amp;u=http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/arxiu/1977/jurat&amp;ei=d0o0T4H6EsS_8APQkLWoAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ7gEwAg&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dsitges%2B%2B1977%2B%2522denis%2Bgifford%2522%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DU2I%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D678%26prmd%3Dimvnso|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BFI holds an extensive archive of interviews recorded by Gifford of various figures in the film, television and comics industries. ''The Denis Gifford Collection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=British Film Institute|title=The Denis Gifford Collection|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/filmtvinfo/library/collections/audiotapes/gifford.html|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is held as part of the BFI National Library. The BFI ran a Denis Gifford Tribute Evening at the [[National Film Theatre]] in January 2001 to mark his work on film history.

===Popular audience and fan press authorship===

As well as vintage comedy, Gifford had a particular interest in genre films, favouring the origins of those genres and the lower-budget B-movie output. He had written for science fiction fanzines since the 1950s, which he regarded as the period in which the genre gained maturity in the cinema: "it was the 1950s before sci-fi really got started, first with [[George Pal]]'s astounding semi-documentary ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'' pipped at cinematic post by [[Robert L. Lipert]]'s B-movie ''[[Rocketship X-M]]''. Where the cinema led, comics followed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Space Aces: Comic Book Heroes of the Forties and Fifties|year=1992|publisher=Greenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had attempted to spur early science fiction 'fandom' with his 1952 ''Space Patrol Official Handbook'', an introduction to science fiction that included an index of 'films of future fantasy' from the 1902 French 'trick' film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' by [[Georges Méliès]] and the 1918 Danish ''[[A Trip to Mars]]'' up to contemporary films such as the 1951 ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', screen shots from recent science fiction films ''[[The Man From Planet X]]'', ''[[Rocketship X-M]]'', ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]''. Astronomical facts and diagrams of imagined spacecraft and spacesuit, drawn by Gifford, were also included.

Horror held a special fascination for Gifford: he was an active figure in horror fandom of the 1950s, 60s and 70s, including the Gothique Film Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Dave|title=History of the Gothique Society|url=http://www.thegothiquefilmsociety.org.uk/|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in the 1970s he had regular columns in [[Dez Skinn]]'s ''House of Hammer'' magazine, first a serialised ''Golden History of Horror'' and later ''History of Hammer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinn|first=Dez|title=Getting on Track with the House of Hammer|url=http://dezskinn.com/warner-williams-2/|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gifford had been deeply critical of [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Studios]], especially the productions of its later years, preferring the more understated examples of early British and Hollywood horror. He found Hammer's relatively explicit use of blood-letting and sexuality to be cynically exploitative, noting in his 1973 ''A Pictorial History of Horror'' that "The new age of horror was geared to a new taste. Where the old films had quickly cut away from the sight of blood, Hammer cut in for a closeup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Annandale|first=David|title=Lo, the Might Have Fallen (and They Can't Get Up)|url=http://upcomingdiscs.com/2008/02/02/lo-the-might-have-fallen-and-they-cant-get-up/|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Pictorial History of Horror'' was an influential work for a generation of film and horror enthusiasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Andrew|title=Mark Gatiss on European Horror and his "bloodthirsty youth"|journal=Radio Times|date=30 October 2012|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-30/mark-gatiss-on-european-horror-and-his-bloodthirsty-youth|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described  in ''[[The Paris Review]]'' by author and journalist Dave Tompkins as "the most important book of my childhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Dave|title=Eyeballs Left Standing|journal=The Paris Review|date=5 November 2012|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/11/05/eyeballs-left-standing/|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford was a lifelong fan of [[Laurel and Hardy]], and founded 'Film Funsters', the first British branch of the Laurel &amp; Hardy Appreciation Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Obituaries: Tony Hawes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-tony-hawes-1279183.html|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as writing several articles on the duo. He was also a keen [[Sherlock Holmes]] enthusiast, and was a member of the Sherlock Holmes Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reginald|first=R.|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L25ycEzuXxIC&amp;pg=PA913&amp;lpg=PA913&amp;dq=denis+gifford+%22sherlock+holmes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lkyqi0Ogxb&amp;sig=YOnEO1v7WMpIs8EuvKoos-zwink&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EI5NT4mkD-Op0QXJq5yeBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=denis%20gifford%20%22sherlock%20holmes%22&amp;f=false|author2=Douglas Menville |author3=Mary Burgess }}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote various reviews and articles on films featuring the detective.

Gifford wrote numerous articles on film and popular entertainment, both professionally and for fanzines.

==Career in cinema: 1962–67==
Although a highly respected film historian, Gifford's professional involvement in cinema was relatively limited. However, in the 1950s and 1960s he directed and photographed a number of short films, most of which were publicity and public information films commissioned by the British Government. He also produced and directed the Pathe newsreel ''Highlight: The Singing Cinema'' (1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Pathe|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=81563|work=Highlight: the Singing Cinema|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compilation of extracts from British musical films from 1929–64.

While at Pathe, Gifford married Angela Kalagias, a fellow Pathé employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Steve|title=Obituary: Denis Gifford|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/26/guardianobituaries|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple, who later divorced, had one daughter, Pandora Jane, born in 1965.

Gifford scripted the Space Race spoof [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry on'']] ''Spaceman'' in 1962, but although scheduled the film was not shot.

===Filmography===
{{Main| Published work on cinema by Denis Gifford}}

==History and criticism of comics: 1970–95==
Gifford was regarded by many as the UK's pre-eminent comics historian, particularly of early British comics. The [[British Library]] provides catalogues and reference works written by Gifford as assistance to researchers of its ''British Comics Collection'', and indeed most of the reference works on the subject provided by the British Library were written by Gifford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=British Library|title=British Comics Collection: Help for Researchers|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/britcomics/|accessdate=14 December 2011}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Comics scholarship, still relatively undeveloped in comparison to other media, was almost non-existent in 1971, when Gifford published his first book on comics history, ''Discovering Comics''. At that time, no comprehensive archive of British comics existed, no fully researched cataloguing had been attempted, the mass pulping of comics in Britain in the 1940s meant that many issues and even titles were lost without effective records, no university courses were dedicated to the study of the medium, and serious research and debate had not taken place into the origin and development of the comic as a form. Gifford was determined that the comic should gain a credibility in mainstream culture and academia which it already possessed in continental Europe, and to a lesser extent the US: "Curiously, only Great Britain, where the comic paper was born, takes its comics for what they superficially seem – ephemera to be discarded as soon as read."&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Denis, ''Discovering Comics'', 1971, Introduction: The Editor's Chat.&lt;/ref&gt; Although enthusiastic about comics of every era, Gifford had a particular passion for vintage comics, "earlier in the medium's evolution, when it was a chaos of one-offs, irregular schedules, and a comic historian's nightmare of inept publishers operating from the back rooms of run-down bookshops on a shoe string budget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darlington|first=Andrew|title=Daredevils of the Stratosphere (review of Space Aces)|journal=The Mentor|date=October 1995|issue=88|url=http://efanzines.com/Mentor/TM88COMP.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The origin of the comic and early comics history===
Gifford provided the first reliable, detailed account of early comics in works such as ''Victorian Comics'' (1976) and ''The British Comics Catalogue, 1874–1974'' (1974), with a detailed overview in his ''International Book of Comics'' (1984). He also advanced debate on the origins of comics, including what the first comic and comic characters were,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=Louis|title=Victorian Comics by Denis Gifford, British Comic Catalogue, 1874–1974 by Denis Gifford: Review|journal=Victorian Periodicals Newsletter|date=March 1978|volume=11|issue=1|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that "there is no point [in the history of comics] where we can pick up a paper and declare it Comic Number One."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Victorian Comics|year=1974|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=0-04-741002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the first comedic narrative periodical, as an antecedent to the comic as ''The Comick Magazine'' (1796) which although all text included a single [[William Hogarth]] print per issue, which Gifford suggested when combined formed a "narrative sequence&amp;nbsp;... [so that] they could be described  as an early form of comic strip."&lt;ref name="Gifford 1999"/&gt; Gifford identified the significant stage of "the first continuing cartoon hero"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=International Book of Comics|year=1984|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=0-603-03574-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]]'s ''Dr Syntax'' in the serial ''The Schoolmaster's Tour'' in ''The Poetical Magazine'' (1 May 1809). He argued that "in Europe, perhaps the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=International Book of Comics|year=1984|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=0-603-03574-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first caricature magazine, an important prototypical form of the comic, was [[Thomas Hopkirk|Hopkirk]]'s ''[[The Glasgow Looking Glass]]'' (11 June 1825).

Gifford located the origin of the modern graphic narrative in the late nineteenth century, tracing development through various stages that included ''Judy - The London Serio-Comic Journal'' (1 May 1867) featuring ''[[Ally Sloper]]'', the first recurring character in a text and picture serial. He observed in ''Victorian Comics'' that Sloper "was the first to appear in comic book format&amp;nbsp;... a paperback reprint collection&amp;nbsp;... the first to have his own comic paper&amp;nbsp;... and was the longest lived [character] in comic history." He suggested a key contender as the first comic as being the paper ''[http://john-adcock.blogspot.com/2009/09/funny-folks.html Funny Folks]'' (12 December 1874), which had an unprecedented half-picture, half-text per page layout. Sloper's debut was certainly a series of panels, but it lacks "interdependence as a sequential narrative strategy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=Garrett|title=British Comics at the Fin de Siècle|url=http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/illustratedword/comics/07comics.html|work=The Illustrated Word at the Fin de Siècle|publisher=University of Yale|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with images each relaying a single joke without forming a narrative with other panels, and it lacked some key features of the form, such as the speech bubble, while it had accompanying text for each image. Debate continues, but Gifford's research and conclusions into the origins of comics as a medium have gained considerable academic acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Library - British Comics Collection|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/britcomics/|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ally Sloper===
[[Ally Sloper]] was championed by Gifford as the world's first ever comic character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sabin|first=Roger|title=Ally Sloper: the First Comics Superstar|journal=Image &amp; Narrative|date=October 2003|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/graphicnovel/rogersabin.htm|accessdate=2 January 2012|issn=1780-678X|postscript=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and became a totemic figure for him, being revived and sometimes drawn by him in a number of comics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Denis|journal=Ally Sloper|date=October 1976 – February 1977|issue=1-4|publisher=Alan Class Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Ally Sloper: The Legendary Cartoon Character Celebrates the 100th Anniversary of his Comic 'This Year|journal=Book and Magazine Collector|date=May 1984|issue=3|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that sought to ensure a modern readership had an awareness of early comic history. The ''Ally Sloper'' magazine was not a commercial success and lasted only four issues, but the innovation of Gifford's tone in the title was acknowledged by one cultural historian as "[w]ith his accurate spoof of the style of traditional British humour comics&amp;nbsp;... anticipat[ing] Viz by nearly three years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British Comics: A Cultural History|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-855-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced artwork for advertisements for an Ally Sloper T-shirt, which was published in several [[Alan Class Comics]] titles in 1976, to promote the ''Ally Sloper'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astounding Stories #118|url=http://britishcomicsdatabase.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/astounding-stories-118.html|work=British Comics Database|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinister Tales #143|url=http://britishcomicsdatabase.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/sinister-tales-143.html|work=British Comics Database|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford also initiated the Ally Sloper Awards in 1976, an annual prize for veteran comic artists.

At a summit on comics history convened by the 1989 [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games|Lucca Comics Festival]] in Italy, Gifford was invited to be one of the eleven 'international specialists' to sign a declaration that [[The Yellow Kid]] was the first comic character having been first published in 1895. Gifford signed, but pointedly did so in the name of Ally Sloper, first published in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gravett|first=Paul|title=The Graphic Novelist's Progress|url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/births_of_the_comics/|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical classification of British comics===
Gifford sought to draw a distinct definition for British comics history, as the Golden Age and other historical eras of comics were first defined to describe US comics history. These eras relate to UK comics only as a result of American influence on the UK market and creators, and do not acknowledge key differences in British comics of the period, notably the preponderance in Britain of humorous anthologies rather than the genre titles, most especially superheroes, that predominated in the US. Gifford observed that the "Thirties were the Golden Age of British comics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=International Book of Comics|year=1984|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=0-603-03574-4|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the profusion of successful, high quality and specifically British humour comics beginning in the 1930s, including D.C. Thomson's ''The Dandy'' (4 December 1937),  ''The Beano'' (30 July 1938) and ''Magic'' (22 July 1939) and Amalgamated Press's ''Jingles'' (1934), ''Jolly'' (1935), ''Golden'' (23 October 1937), ''Radio Fun'' (15 October 1938), ''Happy Days'' (8 October 1938) and ''Knockout'' (4 March 1939). The start of the Second World War in 1939, and the resulting paper shortages, marked the end of many of the titles, a definable end to the era and the beginning of what Gifford termed the "Dark Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=The Complete Catalogue of British Comics|year=1985|publisher=Webb &amp; Bower|isbn=0-86350-079-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gifford denis ally sloper-1.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|Gifford's Ally Sloper #1, his 1976 attempt to find a modern audience for the character he argued was the world's first in comics]]

===Comics Catalogue and Price Guide===
Gifford's ''The British Comics Catalogue, 1874–1974'' (1974) was the first comprehensive index of British comics, and his later ''British Comics, Story Papers, Picture Libraries, Girls Papers, American Reprints, Facsmilies, Giveaways Price Guide'' (1982) the first attempt to offer a price guide for British comics (US comic books had been covered by ''The [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'' since 1970). It was the antecedent of works such as the ''[http://www.comicpriceguide.co.uk/ Official Comic Book Price Guide for Great Britain]'' (1989).

===Resistance to adult themes in children's comics===
Gifford had a particular interest in children's comics. Although his collection included 1960s [[Underground comix|underground comics]], the [[alternative comics]] of the 1970s as well as the more experimental mainstream of comics' [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]], he was not initially convinced by changing conceptions of comics as a medium suited to addressing adult themes such as sexuality, violence and storytelling techniques influenced by literary fiction, cinema and art. He recognised that the growth in adult readership of comics since the 1970s was due to nostalgia, but did not foresee the potential for a development of the medium. "And nostalgia is escape. The comics - the best of them - represent wholesome innocence, a marvelous sense of fun and a pointer to current times perhaps, the triumphant overcoming of all sorts of difficulties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibbins|first=James|newspaper=Daily Mail (quoted in Gravett, Paul, [http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/great_british_comics1/ 'Nostalgia isn't What it Used to be'] in [[Comics International]] (2005))|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children's comics began to reflect changes in cinema and mass culture, he was unafraid to speak out, even where this might involve constraints on the comics industry and creators.

After media outrage at the 1976 ''Look Out for Lefty'' strip about football hooliganism in the IPC comic ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'', Gifford controversially drew parallels with the [[Fredric Wertham|Wertham censorship]] of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that "Perhaps its time we had another outcry against products like ''Action''. ''Action'' is a new kind of comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, stuff like this provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce ''Action'' are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steeples|first=Joe|title=Comic Strip Hooligans|url=http://www.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/?p=317|accessdate=29 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=17 September 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite ''2000 AD'' (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed stortelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: "Whether children would actually enjoy living in [the future]&amp;nbsp;... is another matter, for as depicted&amp;nbsp;... the future is a world of unrelieved violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=The International Book of Comics|year=1984|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=0-603-03574-4|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that "I look back to the days of my youth&amp;nbsp;... when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Valerie|title=AARGH lives – but the blood is printed red|url=http://www.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/?p=306|accessdate=29 December 2011|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=23 February 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gifford's concerns were limited to comics intended for children and adolescents, and he was well aware of a development of the medium for an adult audience. He collected and was able to appreciate the content of underground and Modern Age comics, offering sophisticated and sometimes sympathetic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=The International Book of Comics|year=1984|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=0-603-03574-4|pages=248–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford's own ''Ally Sloper'' comic (1976) offered a combination of vintage and alternative strips for an adult audience, although the nostalgic strips were his primary interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=David|title=Nasty tales: Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n' Roll and Violence in the British Underground|year=2001|publisher=Critical Vision|isbn=1-900486-13-X|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09KauG1G_fgC&amp;dq=%22denis+gifford%22+%22collector%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Dandy'' record challenge===
Working for the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as a comics expert, Gifford had to qualify his recommendation that ''[[The Dandy]]'' be regarded as the world's oldest comic (first issue December 1937) after the entry was challenged in 1999. The first issue of Italian comics magazine ''[[Il Giornalino]]'' was cover dated 1 October 1924, US comic book ''[[Detective Comics]]'' (March 1937) began nine months earlier, and the Belgian comic magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' had more issues. Gifford admitted that "[i]t may be that we will have to insert the word British into the Guinness Book of Records to clarify the position." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fraser|first=Stephen|title=Comic capers as rivals claim Dandy's record|newspaper=Scotland on Sunday|date=18 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and criticism of radio, television, music and music hall: 1971–89==

Gifford's work ''The Golden Age of Radio'' was the first reference guide to programmes, broadcasters and catchphrases of radio of the 1930s and 1940s, and remains an important source for researchers in radio history.

Gifford was working on a filmography and history of 1930s British television, but died before its completion.

==Career in television and radio: 1953–99==
Gifford wrote extensively for comedy and light entertainment in both television and radio, his work often reflecting his fascinations of radio and film nostalgia and cartoon art.

===Television and radio scriptwriting===
Gifford wrote the first television series of comedy stars [[Morecambe and Wise]], ''Running Wild'' (1954), having been brought in with fellow cartoonist, comic enthusiast and film buff Tony Hawes to save a series which was initially panned by critics.&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt; He also provided material for the opening night of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (1955) and co-wrote the first comedy show to be screened by [[BBC2]], the TV movie [https://web.archive.org/web/20130511215805/http://www.memorabletv.com/uk-tv/the-alberts-channel-too/ ''Alberts' Channel Too''] (1964) for the launch of the channel, although the whole evening's broadcasting was lost due to a power blackout. He wrote for ''[[Junior Showtime]]'' (1973), devised the nostalgia panel show [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262969/ ''Looks Familiar''] (1970–87) for Thames TV, presented by Denis Norden, its radio counterpart ''Sounds Familiar'' and the Thames quiz show ''Quick on the Draw'' (1974–1979) featuring drawings by cartoonists and celebrities, with presenters including Bob Monkhouse, [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Bill Tidy]]. He also wrote scripts for the ITV children's puppet shows ''Witches' Brew'' (1973) and ''The Laughing Policeman'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Laughing Policeman|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/33945|work=BFI Film &amp; TV Database|publisher=BFI|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford also designed stunts for the popular BBC1 game show ''[[The Generation Game]]''.

The scriptwriting partnership with Hawes began in radio, for weekly BBC concert party ''The Light Optimists'' (1953) and continued with stunt devising for the US-bought game show ''[[People Are Funny]]'' for [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Obituary: Tony Hawes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-tony-hawes-1279183.html|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and radio broadcasting===
A broadcaster in his own right, Gifford featured in numerous television and radio programmes as an expert in the history of film, radio and comics, as well as appearances in a variety of documentary and news magazine programmes over several decades. 
Appearances included editions of BBC's [[Bernard Braden|''On The Braden Beat'']] (1964) commenting on comics, Granada's ''[[Clapperboard (TV series)|Clapperboard]]'' (1974) and a review of forthcoming horror films for BBC1's ''[[Film 1973]]'' (1973), ''Goon but not Forgotten'', a radio history of the Goon Show as part of the ''Laughter in the Air: The Story of Radio Comedy'' (1979) and twice as guest panellist for Radio 4 panel show ''[[Quote... Unquote]]'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btwebworld.com/quote-unquote/p0000015.htm |title=Quote&amp;nbsp;... Unquote Radio Show Archive: Producers/Readers/Panellists |author=Rees, Nigel |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford and Monkhouse reprised their partnership with BBC radio programmes on the history of the comics, ''Sixpence for a Superman'' (1999) on British comics and the two-part ''A Hundred Laughs for a Ha'penny'' (1999), a history of comic papers.

==Obituaries: 1992–2000==
Gifford also regularly wrote obituaries of notable figures in comics, film and entertainment history for British national newspapers ''The Independent'' and ''The Guardian'' and posthumously for the [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/index.html ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''], drawing on his specialist knowledge and often personal familiarity with the subject. His output was prolific and constant, with his own obituary in ''The Guardian'' noting that "[h]is last commission was phoned in from his home in Sydenham, south London, to his editor on Thursday, May 18; it is thought he died the same day." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holland|first=Steve|title=Obituaries: Denis Gifford|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/26/guardianobituaries|accessdate=8 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection of comics and other popular media==

Gifford's most valuable research resource was his own collection, as in over sixty years he had accumulated what is generally recognised as the largest comic collection in the UK and the largest collection of British comics in the world,&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt; including the only known complete runs of all comics published in the UK in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lent|first=John A.|title=The winding, pot-holed road of comics scholarship|journal=Studies in Comics|year=2010|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17|doi=10.1386/stic.1.1.7/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He collected the first and last issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sale|first=Jonathan|title=Collecting: Paper values|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/collecting-paper-values-1143720.html|accessdate=21 February 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all comics published in the UK, as well as Christmas issues&lt;ref name="Rogers 42–44"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Byron|title=Desperate Den|newspaper=Sunday Times magazine|date=19 June 1987|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other special editions, and also collected first issues of US comics. To a lesser extent, first issues of comics from other countries were also collected. Gifford was also a collector of other ephemera, including pulp books, popular magazines, theatrical programmes, film and comic fanzines, original film scripts and sheet music, as well as pop culture memorabilia, describing himself as "the keeper of the nation's nostalgia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=The Golden Age of Radio: An Illustrated Companion|year=1985|publisher=B.T. Batsford|isbn=0-7134-4234-4|pages=(Personal biog.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and with a collection that included periodicals not to be found in the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Terry|title=The British Golden Age, Collectors And The British Comic Book Archive|url=http://www.comicbitsonline.com/2011/05/08/the-british-golden-age-collectors-and-the-british-comic-book-archive/|work=comicbitsonline.com|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an obsession which dominated both his life and his South London home, once described in a colour supplement interview as the den of "a boy who had run away from home" and never returned. A reliable figure was never established for the size of his collection, but its scale constrained movement throughout the house and extended into every room, even the kitchen: "There are comics on the stove, on the fridge, on the floor. Denis Gifford can still use his grill, but roasts are a memory for he can no longer open his oven. The fridge filled up years ago, for Denis is fascinated by the free gifts that come with some comics&amp;nbsp;... There are lollipops in the fridge now, and Desperate Dan nougat."&lt;ref name="Rogers 42–44"/&gt;

Unusually for a collector, Gifford's interests were defined by their eclecticism, including comics, radio recordings and film from throughout the world and spanning from the origins of the media up to new releases. His own 'biog' for a 1975 book calculates his collection "extends to some 20,000 issues"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Happy Days! One Hundred Years of Comics|year=1975|publisher=Jupiter Books|location=London|isbn=1-870630-47-5|page=inside front cover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but is careful to limit the estimate to the particularly British form of 'comic papers' which excluded his vast collection of American comic books, and in any case accumulated many more in the next 25 years of his life. He had certain specific interests, notably British horror films of the 1930s to the 1960s, early cinema and radio, Laurel and Hardy movies and memorabilia, British comic papers of the late nineteenth century and British and US comics of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, especially those which featured personalities from contemporary radio. However, the parameters of his interests and collection broadened substantially throughout his life.

Gifford's collection had suffered an early setback, an anecdote related by Bob Monkhouse: "You cannot begin to imagine his grief when he completed his National Service to return home to find that his mother had thrown away his huge collection of ''Film Fun'', ''The Joker'', ''Merry'' and ''Bright'' and a dozen other titles&amp;nbsp;... Denis was to spend the rest of his life trying to replace those lost copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawkes|first=Harry|title=Antiques &amp; Collecting: Tons of bumper fun go up for grabs|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Antiques+%26+Collecting%3A+Tons+of+bumper+fun+go+up+for+grabs.-a074489182|accessdate=8 January 2012|newspaper=The Birmingham Post|date=24 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford's mother was later to express deep regret at their destruction.

Despite his hopes that his vast collection might form the basis of a national museum of comics, through an archive such as the [http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/n/national-art-library-comics-and-comic-art-collection/ Victoria and Albert Museum National Art Library Comics and Comic Art Collection], it was broken up and auctioned off after his death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strummer|first=Robin|title=Art of Dennis the Menace and Billy Bunter expected to raise pounds 250,000 at auction|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; "leaving 12 tons of paper at his home to be cleared and sorted." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawkes|first=Harry|title=Antiques &amp; Collecting: Collecting Diary|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Antiques+%26+Collecting%3a+Tune+in+for+a+lesson+in+advancing+technology%3b...-a073826486|newspaper=The Birmingham Post|date=28 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monkhouse reflected in the foreword to auction catalogue of ''The Denis Gifford Collection'' on how one "whose researches were so meticulous have allowed this vast gathering of treasures to have swollen into such unruly and uncatalogued confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monkhouse|first=Bob|title=The Denis Gifford Collection Auction, Part One: Sunday 25th February 2001 (Catalogue)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Denis_Gifford_Collection_Part_One.html?id=YuANMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|year=2001|publisher=Hamer 20th Century Books|location=Worksop|page=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sale was described in the auction pamphlet as "surely the largest private collection of annuals, books, cartoons, cinema history, comics, ephemera &amp; original artwork ever to come on the market. The collection, housed in some 600 boxes and weighing ten tons, arrived on a groaning lorry and took five men nearly three hours to unload. We expect sales to run to some 4000 lots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamer|first=Martin|journal=Gifford Collection Auction pamphlet|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford's collection was the product of his lifelong passion for comics and popular culture, and his highly prolific research work was an attempt to provide a comprehensive history of the ephemeral. Particularly in the early decades of his writing on the subject, pop culture drew little attention from academic research and Gifford was particularly passionate about the most obscure examples of vintage comics, film, television and radio, and determined that they should be recognised, chronicled and remembered before extant copies were lost.

==Comic fandom: fanzines and conventions==
Gifford was a pivotal figure in the development of comics "fandom" in the UK, first through his writing and publishing of early fanzines in the 1950s. In the 1970s he helped introduce comics conventions to the UK, events where creators and industry figures could meet and respond to comics fans. It was a significant progression of the already established comics marts where comics were simply sold, and in which Gifford was a key figure, providing the introductory presentation at the Comic Mart Summer Special 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Mart Summer Special 1974 poster|url=http://cgcforum.gpanalysis.com/cgcforum_thread.asp?pagenumber=1&amp;ThreadID=4605076&amp;forumID=4&amp;threadName=Britain%27s+Comic+Mart+-+1974+Poster|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other UK events.

In 1974 he was the only comics industry guest at an early meeting of Britain's major comics convention, [[British Comic Art Convention|Comicon 74]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinn|first=Dez|title=Early Days of UK Comic Conventions and Marts: Comicon|url=http://dezskinn.com/fanzines-3/|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford organised [[Comics 101]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinn|first=Dez|title=Early Days of UK Comic Conventions and Marts: Comics 101 and Kak|url=http://dezskinn.com/fanzines-3/|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1976, the first convention dedicated to British comic creators, with guests including celebrated figures in British comics including [[Frank Hampson]], [[Leo Baxendale]], [[Frank Bellamy]] and [[Ron Embleton]], ''Marvelman'' creator Mick Anglo and ''[[Garth (comic strip)|Garth]]'' creator Steve Dowling, Gifford conducting an on-stage interview with Dowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Denis|title=Comics 101 Interview with Steve Dowling|journal=Ally Sloper|year=1976|issue=1|url=http://hoopercomics.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/steve-dowling-creator-of-garth/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the convention was a reference to the 101 years since the first issue of ''Funny Folks'' (1874) which Gifford regarded as the first comic.

In 1977 Gifford co-founded the Society of Strip Illustration, a network for all those involved in any stage of the creative process of comics production which later became the [[Comic Creators Guild]]. In 1978 he established the Association of Comics Enthusiasts, whose newsletter ''Comic Cuts'' ran for 14 years proper and, as a section of UK comics fanzine ''The Illustrated Comics Journal'', until his death. Gifford also wrote extensively for comics magazines and fanzines, particularly ''Comic Cuts'', and it was here that he wrote some of his most specialist work on comics history and criticism.

Prizegiving of the first [[Ally Sloper Award]]s for comic creators also took place at Comics 101, with Bob Monkhouse presenting.

Gifford continued to organise, guest and attend comics conventions throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s in the UK, USA and throughout Europe, including regular guest appearances the [[Comics art and writing of Denis Gifford#Lectures and presentations on comics history and criticism|Lucca International Comics Festival]], was an official guest at the first [[United Kingdom Comic Art Convention|UK Comic Art Convention (UKCAC)]] in 1985 and was a guest speaker at the 1st UK Paperback and Pulp Bookfair in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1st UK Paperback and Pulp Bookfair Official Souvenir Booklet|url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/t393.htm|work=The Locus Index to Science Fiction: 1984–1998|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ally Sloper Awards==

Gifford created the Ally Sloper Awards, a series of awards to recognise veteran British comics artists. The award was first presented in 1976, but no longer runs.

In [[roulette]], the '''''en prison'' rule''' is an opportunity to recover one's stakes after a spin of zero, provided one's bet was even-odds (i.e. high–low, even–odd, red–black).&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://wizardofodds.com/roulette |title=Roulette |publisher=Wizard Of Odds Consulting |accessdate=2009-09-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a variant of the '''''la partage'' rule''', in which a player loses only half their even-odds stake if the original spin is a zero, recouping the other half&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"/&gt; (''partage'' being French for "sharing").  In European casinos, where ''la partage'' is customary, the player may be given the option instead to place their original stake ''en prison'' ("in prison"  in French).&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"/&gt; The stake is left on the previous bet, and the croupier places a marker on it to show it is ''en prison''.&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"/&gt; If the bet wins on the next spin, the player's stake is returned; if it loses, it is forfeited.&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"/&gt;  Different casinos adopt different rules for the case where zero comes up a second time: it may be treated as won, lost, ''la partage'' or ''en prison''.&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"/&gt; 

The 'La Partage' version of Roulette is more favorable towards the player when compared to the standard American and European Roulette Games. It has a payout percentage of [https://www.redblackwin.com 98.5%] 

Most [[List of casinos in the United States|Casinos in the United States]] do not use ''la partage'' or ''en prison'' rules; an even-odds stake loses if zero is rolled.&lt;ref name="wizardofodds"/&gt; Those that do include these [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] Casinos: [[The Bellagio]], [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]], [[The Mirage]], [[The Rio]] and [[The Wynn]].

'''Entertainment Rights''' was a media company with international business in the production and sales of [[Children's television series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentrights.com/corporate/ |title=Corporate |publisher=Entertainment Rights |date= |accessdate=2011-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043537/http://www.entertainmentrights.com/corporate/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}} The business entity was first founded in 1989 as "Sleepy Kids". In 1999, the company was renamed "Entertainment Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entertainment Rights Plc: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=645700|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1989, "Sleepy Kids" was founded by Martin and Vivien Schrager-Powell. It was created in order to produce ''[[Midnight Patrol: Adventures in the Dream Zone]]'' (Potsworth and Co. in the UK) a children's animated series. Schrager-Powell's business partner was [[Hanna-Barbera]]. Within months of the founding, Sleepy Kids became a public company. It produced ''[[Dr. Zitbag's Transylvania Pet Shop]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK: Making it Tough for Tots - Sleepy Kids.|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/uk-making-tough-tots-sleepy-kids/article/409470|website=Management Today|accessdate=2011-11-15|date=1992-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Budgie the Little Helicopter]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Between 1998 and 1999, Sleepy Kids expanded. In December 1998, the company merged with [[Richard Digance|The Richard Digance Card Company]], Clipper Films and Ridgeway Films. In 1999, the company acquired [[Siriol Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/skd-media-to-buy-out-carrington-productions/1223882.article |title=Skd Media To Buy Out Carrington Productions |publisher=Broadcast |date=1999-10-29 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1999, Sleepy Kids purchased Boom Boom (owner of ''[[Basil Brush]]''), Carrington Productions International (owner of the Ventureworld Films and ''[[Dr. Zitbag's Transylvania Pet Shop]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Following these acquisitions, Sleepy Kids was renamed "SKD Media". In 2000, SKD Media was renamed "Entertainment Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/skd-boosts-overseas-sales-profile/1225306.article |title=SKD boosts overseas sales profile |publisher=Broadcast |date=1999-11-26 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment Rights purchased the rights to programs from companies such as Link Entertainment (distributors for [[Woodland Animations]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waller|first1=Ed|title=Entertainment Rights buys Postman Pat creator|url=http://www.c21media.net/entertainment-rights-buys-postman-pat-creator/|website=C21Media|accessdate=1 November 2017|date=7 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varga London, Hibbert Ralph Entertainment, and [[Peter Maddocks|Maddocks Animation]] and Little Entertainment Company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2004, Entertainment rights acquired Tell-Tale Productions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3650828.stm |title=Tweenies maker bought for £3.1m |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisherentertainment.com/entertainment-rights-acquires-tell-tale-productions/ |title=Entertainment Rights acquires Tell-Tale Productions |publisher=Crisher Entertainment |date=2004-09-13 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rights to most of the [[Filmation]] library from [[Sonar Entertainment]] (Hallmark).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} 

At the end of 2004, Entertainment Rights employed 95 people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the 2005 financial year, Entertainment Rights' [[revenue]] was £12.4 million. The company bid for [[Chorion]] but the offer was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologyweekly.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articles/0a3172d4201c47efbda8d9c815916ac1/Chorion-rejects-Entertainment-Rights-offer.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130707044420/http://technologyweekly.mad.co.uk/Main/Home/Articles/0a3172d4201c47efbda8d9c815916ac1/Chorion-rejects-Entertainment-Rights-offer.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-07 |title=Welcome to the new mad.co.uk |publisher=Technologyweekly.mad.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3453967.stm |title=Noddy owner rejects bid approach |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-02-03 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Siriol Productions]] came under new management. The company was renamed "[[Calon (TV production company)|Calon]]". Most of the rights to completed productions were kept by Entertainment Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lianne Stewart |url=http://kidscreen.com/2005/08/01/siriol-20050801/#ixzz1Yj6FYh00 |title=Siriol heads south, and Lyons moves on |publisher=Kidscreen |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 January 2007, Entertainment Rights acquired Classic Media for {{USD|210 million}} (£106.9 million). Before completion, both companies announced distribution and production agreements with [[Genius Products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genius Products announces long-term co-production and distribution agreements with Entertainment Rights PLC and Classic Media|url=http://www.geniusproducts.com/PressRelease.aspx?releaseid=207|website=Genius Products|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=18 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101213/http://www.geniusproducts.com/PressRelease.aspx?releaseid=207|archivedate=28 September 2007|date=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the company appointed of Deborah Dugan, former president of [[Disney Publishing Worldwide]], as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). There had been financial instability within the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Katie|title=ER announces new CEO|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/er-announces-new-ceo/035902|website=Licensing.biz|accessdate=2011-11-15|date=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By January 2009, the company had dismissed one third of its employees. The company's market value decreased from £267 million in March 2007 to £5.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/4163292/Three-companies-in-talks-to-buy-Entertainment-Rights.html |title=Three companies in talks to buy Entertainment Rights |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-01-07|accessdate=2011-11-15 |location=London |first1=Amanda |last1=Andrews |first2=Ben |last2=Harrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2009, six companies had requested to purchase Entertainment Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loveday|first1=Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/six-bid-for-entertainment-rights/035716 |title=Six bid for Entertainment Rights |publisher=Licensing.biz |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in February 2009, Entertainment Rights was fined £245,000 by the [[Financial Services Authority]] for failing to inform shareholders of "a potential $14 million earnings hit in a timely manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loveday|first1=Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/now-entertainment-rights-is-hit-with-fsa-fine/035717 |title=Now Entertainment Rights is hit with FSA fine |publisher=Licensing.biz |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22332">''Five Easy Pieces'' (2016) is a theatre production that the Swiss theatre and film director [[Milo Rau]] made with children for the [[Ghent]] [[arts centre]] CAMPO and that is based on the [[Marc_Dutroux|Dutroux]] affair.

==The Dutroux affair as a starting point==
As with other theatre productions by Milo Rau, testimonies and reconstructions of true facts form the basis of ''Five Easy Pieces''.&lt;ref name="kfda.be"&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20180217103112/http://www.kfda.be/en/program/five-easy-pieces Page about ''Five Easy Pieces'' (Milo Rau, 2016)] on the website of Kunstenfestivaldesarts&lt;/ref&gt; In this case they relate to the life and the crimes of Marc Dutroux, who kidnapped, raped and murdered with the help of some accomplices a series of children in the 90s in [[Belgium]]. Milo Rau says that he is always looking for the traumatic, tragic moments in the lives of both individuals and a country, because we are most affected and changed in those moments.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Lyn Gardner, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212193106/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/22/young-actors-play-child-killer-marc-dutroux-five-easy-pieces-milo-rau 'It's supposed to be funny': young actors perform play about child killer Marc Dutroux], in: The Guardian, 22/03/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Jean-Marie Wynants, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212193448/http://www.lesoir.be/archive/recup/1207037/article/culture/scenes/2016-05-11/milo-rau-explore-l-affaire-dutroux-avec-sept-enfants?noCookies=1 Milo Rau explore l'affaire Dutroux avec sept enfants], in: Le Soir MAD, 11/05/2016, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Milo Rau's intention was not to create an accurate representation of the Dutroux affair with ''Five Easy Pieces'', but a modern [[tragedy]] with Dutroux as the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Smit, 'Dutroux is de grote afwezige op het podium', in: Het Parool, 06/02/2017, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; His intention was to make "a children's theatre performance that was risky, unprecedented and virtually impossible."&lt;ref name="campo.background"&gt; Stefan Bläske, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180217103824/https://www.campo.nu/en/news/64/milo-rau-over-de-achtergrond-van-five-easy-pieces Milo Rau about the background of Five Easy Pieces], on the website of CAMPO, 06/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt; With the life and the crimes of Marc Dutroux as a starting point he searches in ''Five Easy Pieces'' for the limits of "what children know, feel and do", and explores what is acceptable and unacceptable for the spectators.&lt;ref name="kfda.be"/&gt;

==Underlying themes==
The essence of ''Five Easy Pieces'' is not the horror of the Dutroux affair, but the big themes that lie behind this specific case. According to Milo Rau, these are "the decline of a country, the national paranoia, the mourning, and the anger that followed the crimes."&lt;ref name="campo.background"/&gt;  It is not the killer and his psyche that interest him, but the history of Belgium and the collapse of Western colonial and industrial powers.&lt;ref name="kfda.be"/&gt; In the Dutroux affair a number of important historical events concerning Belgium converge: from the loss of the Congo colony to the closure of the coal mines. In the theatre production Marc Dutroux functions as a kind of collective symbol for Belgium, as a black hole.&lt;ref name="Guy_Duplat"&gt;Guy Duplat, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212205041/http://www.lalibre.be/culture/scenes/la-vie-de-marc-dutroux-jouee-par-des-enfants-5727714035708ea2d51ac15e La vie de Marc Dutroux jouée par des enfants], in: LaLibreBelgique, 03/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Five Easy Pieces'' Milo Rau fictionalizes the Dutroux affair with the aim of telling something that exceeds the case.&lt;ref name="ccdefactorij.be"&gt;Charlotte De Somviele, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212205907/https://www.ccdefactorij.be/files/download/20160430fepdestandaardorigineelvooraankondigingvoor-kinderen-is-dutroux-een-gruwelijk-sprookje.pdf Voor kinderen is Dutroux een gruwelijk sprookje - Milo Rau gooit zich op de Belgische geschiedenis], in: De Standaard, 30/04/2016, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own word, Marc Dutroux is a pretext for him to talk "about a government that does not function and about to what extent people have been disconnected from the political system."&lt;ref name="bruzz"&gt;Jasmijn Post en Maria Groot, [https://issuu.com/bruzz.be/docs/binder_bruzz1521 Dutroux voor beginners - Milo Rau heeft geen schrik van controverse], in: Bruzz, 04/05/2016, N° 1521, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutroux affair serves as an [[allegory]] about how we experience the world and think about it, and about how we deal with the emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

==Theatre about theatre==
Milo Rau's ''Five Easy Pieces'' is also a reflection on [[theatre]].&lt;ref name="rtbf.be"&gt;Christian Jade, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212211630/https://www.rtbf.be/culture/scene/detail_five-easy-pieces-comment-faire-jouer-des-enfants-milo-rau-et-peter-seynaeve-s-expliquent?id=9430889 "Five easy pieces". Comment faire jouer des enfants ? Milo Rau et Peter Seynaeve s'expliquent], in the culture section of the website of RTBF, 15/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''Five Easy Pieces'' refers to a series of exercises that [[Igor Stravinsky]] composed in 1917 in order to teach children how to play the piano, and that were also called ''[[Five_Easy_Pieces_(Stravinsky)|Five Easy Pieces]]''. The theatre production of Milo Rau is made up of five [[monologue|monologues]], each offering a different perspective on how children learn to act and how they learn to grow up.&lt;ref name="bruzz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ccdefactorij.be"/&gt; Milo Rau sees his performances as ''Lehrstücke'', in the [[Bertolt_Brecht|Brechtian]] tradition: his actors learn to play.&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"&gt;Herien Wensink, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212213119/https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/05/30/over-wreedheid-leren-door-die-na-te-spelen-1623506-a166923 Over wreedheid leren door die na te spelen], in: NRC , 30/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Every scene of Milo Rau's ''Five Easy Pieces'' starts with the projection of a short film in which adults start the scene. The children then take up live, act the scene simultaneously on the theatre stage, and continue playing while the only adult actor - in the role of director - films and encourages them.&lt;ref name="Guy_Duplat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Els Van Steenberghe, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180215195524/http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/podium/five-easy-pieces-dutroux-spelen-door-hem-net-niet-te-spelen/article-review-706661.html 'Five Easy Pieces': Dutroux spelen door hem net niet te spelen], in: Knack Focus, 23/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the children play the role of the old and sick father of Dutroux, a police agent who discovers the murdered children, one of his victims and the parents of one of his other victims.&lt;ref name="rtbf.be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guy_Duplat"/&gt; What Milo Rau was interested in was to show the audience that a director, just like Marc Dutroux, is always a manipulator to a certain extent and that there exists a power game between him and his actors (especially if they are children).&lt;ref name="rtbf.be"/&gt;

==Artistic team==
Milo Rau is responsible for the concept, text and direction of ''Five Easy Pieces''. The actors on stage are Rachel Dedain, Aimone De Zordo, Fons Dumont, Arno John Keys, Maurice Leerman, Pepijn Loobuyck, Willem Loobuyck, Blanche Ghyssaert, Polly Persyn, Lucia Redondo, Peter Seynaeve, Pepijn Siddiki, Elle Liza Tayou, Winne Vanacker, Hendrik Van Doorn and Eva Luna Van Hijfte. However, they form two different casts of seven children and one adult. Peter Seynaeve also takes on the role of directing assistant and performance coach. The actors in the film material are Sara De Bosschere, Pieter-Jan De Wyngaert, [[Johan Leysen]], Peter Seynaeve, Jan Steen, Ans Van den Eede, Hendrik Van Doorn and Annabelle Van Nieuwenhuyse. Stefan Bläske is the dramatic advisor.&lt;ref name="campo.production"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217111125/https://www.campo.nu/en/production/1836/five-easy-pieces Page about Five Easy Pieces (Milo Rau, 2016)], on the website of CAMPO&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''Five Easy Pieces'' (Milo Rau, 2016) is a production of the Ghent arts centre CAMPO and the International Institute of Political Murder (IIPM), the theatre and film production company of Milo Rau.&lt;ref name="kfda.be"/&gt; Co-producers are the Kunstenfestivaldesarts (Brussels), [[Munich Kammerspiele|Münchner Kammerspiele]], La Bâtie - Festival de Genève, Kaserne Basel, Gessnerallee Zürich, Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA), SICK! Festival (Manchester), Sophiensaele Berlin and Le phénix scene national Valenciennes pôle européen de création.&lt;ref name="campo.production"/&gt;

==Performances==
''Five Easy Pieces'' premiered on 14 May 2016 at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels. An extensive tour in Belgium and abroad followed afterwards, from 2016 until 2018. In Belgium, the production was performed in [[Aalst,_Belgium|Aalst]], [[City_of_Brussels|Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Genk]], Ghent, [[Mons]], [[Namur]], [[Ostend]], [[Roeselare]], [[Turnhout]], [[Waregem]] and [[Zaventem]]. In the [[Netherlands]] performances took place in [[Amsterdam]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Utrecht]]. In addition, the production travelled around the world with an extensive series of performances in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="campo.production"/&gt;

==Reception in press==
''Five Easy Pieces'' received wide critical acclaim in the press. Based on a poll among about fifty critics, the German specialist journal Theater Heute proclaimed ''Five easy pieces'' as best production of the year.&lt;ref name="Theater_Heute"/&gt;
Theatre critic Tuur Devens wrote in the Dutch theatre magazine Theaterkrant: "But let Dutroux play by children?! Children who play casual and innocent, you can not let them bring such horror? Milo Rau does it, and in his way in a splendid way: the subject matter of ''Five Easy Pieces'' is the Dutroux affair, but at the same time it is about playing, about manipulation and abuse of power in the world, outside and in theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Tuur Devens, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180218192533/https://www.theaterkrant.nl/recensie/five-easy-pieces/milo-rau-iipm-campo/ Kinderen spelen Dutroux-zaak na], in: Theaterkrant, 27/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dutch newspaper NRC culture editor Herien Wensink wrote: "You could blame director Milo Rau - public impact is guaranteed - but the execution is subdued and integer, the result powerful and disruptive."&lt;ref name="nrc.nl"/&gt; Journalist Magali Degrande wrote in the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad: "''Five Easy Pieces'' makes you shiver and smile, a nacre pickaxe that reveals hidden basements and rolls flat over them. Irresponsibly good theater."&lt;ref&gt;Magali Degrande, Kinderen over Dutroux: "Als het maar niet illegaal is", in: Het Nieuwsblad, 18/05/2016, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet there were also some critical reactions, especially from Jean Lambrecks, the father of one of the victims of Dutroux. He was disappointed because Milo Rau's production is insufficiently a factual representation of the Dutroux affair.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Vandebroek, "Dit doet de waarheid heel veel geweld aan", in: Het Belang van Limburg, 25/02/2017, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival selections==
In 2017 ''Five Easy Pieces'' was selected for the Theater Festival in both the Netherlands and [[Flanders]]. Together with ''Risjaar Drei'' (Olympique Dramatique and Toneelhuis, 2017), it was the only production that was selected for both festivals, which present the most interesting performances of the past season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217111928/https://www.theaterfestival.be/en/voorstellingen/five-easy-pieces/ Page about Five Easy Pieces (Milo Rau, 2016)] on the website of the Flanders Theatre Festival&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217112620/http://tf.nl/programma-onderdeel/five-easy-pieces/ Page about Five Easy Piece (Milo Rau, 2016)], on the website of the National Dutch Theatre Festival&lt;/ref&gt; In its report the jury of the Flanders Theatre Festival wrote: "Its wry humour and its political-social commitment make 'Five Easy Pieces' one of the most captivating theatre experiences of the past season, which the jury voted for as one block".&lt;ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212220827/https://www.theaterfestival.be/website/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TheaterFestival-2017_Juryrapport.pdf Een berg van betekenis: juryverslag het TheaterFestival 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the production was also selected for the German Theatertreffen festival, which shows the ten most notable productions of the past season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217125559/https://www.berlinerfestspiele.de/en/aktuell/festivals/theatertreffen/archiv_tt/archiv_tt17/tt17_programm_auswahl/tt17_veranstaltungsdetail_auswahl_206937.php Page about Five Easy Pieces (Milo Rau, 2016)] on the website of Theatertreffen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In October 2016 Milo Rau received the Special Prize of the Jury 2016 for ''Five Easy Pieces'' from the Belgian ''Prix de la Critique Théâtre et Danse''. The jury report stated: "This is not a performance, but a flagellation. [...] This is all the brave, reckless genius of Milo Rau, who never curbs the candour of the young actors but slips in powerful metaphors."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180212220048/https://www.campo.nu/nl/news/59/speciale-juryprijs-voor-five-eas...

Afterwards, a series of prizes followed outside of Belgium. At the Theatertreffen festival in Berlin in May 2017, Milo Rau was awarded the 3sat prize for the production. The jury praised the director for his trendsetting and artistic-innovative work. The jury report stated: "Rau does not make the monstrous bearable, but he makes it narrative, and asks fundamental questions about violence between minors and adults. In this way, 'Five Easy Pieces' celebrates what the Dutrouxs of this world want to destroy: childlike wisdom, childlike will and childlike pride."&lt;ref&gt;blg, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180212215240/http://m.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20170514_02881879 Dutroux-theaterstuk gelauwerd in Berlijn], in: De Standaard/DS2, 15/05/2017, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217135555/https://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/theater/191716/index.html 3sat-Preis für Milo Rau], on the website of 3sat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217140626/https://www.campo.nu/en/news/81/3sat-award-for-five-easy-pieces-milo-rau-at-theatertreffen 3sat-award for Five Easy Pieces/Milo Rau at Theatertreffen] on the website of CAMPO, 15/07/2017&lt;/ref&gt; The German-speaking theatre magazine Theater Heute awarded the production with both the best production prize in 2017 and the prize for the best dramaturgy in 2017.&lt;ref name="Theater_Heute"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180217141004/https://www.campo.nu/en/news/87/more-awards-for-five-easy-pieces- More awards for Five Easy Pieces!], on the website of CAMPO, 31/08/2017&lt;/ref&gt; At the MESS festival in Sarajevo in October 2017, ''Five Easy Pieces'' received four prizes: the Grand Prix – Golden Laurel Wreath for Best Performance, the Golden Laurel Wreath for Best Director, the Audience Award for Best Performance and the MESS Critics Award.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180218190732/https://www.campo.nu/en/news/91/four-awards-in-sarajevo Four awards in Sarajevo], on the website of CAMPO, 16/10/2017

'''''Flux''''' was a short-lived magazine in the mid-1990s which focused on music (mostly [[hard rock]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]), [[comic book]]s and [[video game]]s. 

==History and profile==
The magazine was [[bi-monthly]] and lasted for seven issues. The headquarters was in [[New York City]] and the publisher was [[Harris Publications]].&lt;ref name=saga&gt;{{cite web|title=Harris Publishing, Inc.|url=http://samuelsaguamediastuff.weebly.com/publishing-house.html|work=Samuel Saga's Media Stuff|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented as an edgier alternative to magazines such as [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] and [[GamePro]]. Notable recurring departments included "Don't Ever Do This," which offered explicit instructions for pranks and antisocial behavior, and "Babewatch," which was merely photos of attractive females from TV shows, movies, and comic books.

Amongst its editors was [[Dan Amrich]], who would go on to write for [[GamePro]] for several years under the moniker of Dan Elektro. Comics reviews were written by [[Christopher Golden]], who would later write comics himself, as well as horror and fantasy novels. The magazine folded in 1995.&lt;ref name=saga/&gt;

'''Gilbert Rozon''' (born October 26, 1954) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[impresario]] and founder of the ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' ({{lang-fr|Juste pour Rire}}) [[comedy festival]], which he created on July 14, 1983. He is also responsible for the development and international deployment of the Just for Laughs/Juste pour Rire brand in over 150 countries. The Just for Laughs festival is considered the largest comedy festival in the world.&lt;ref name="FICC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ficc.qc.ca/fr/Portefeuille/Portefeuille.php |title=Gestion Juste pour Rire Inc. |date=2000–2012 |work=Notre Portefeuille |publisher=Fonds d'investissement de la culture et des communications |language=French |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617232311/http://www.ficc.qc.ca/fr/Portefeuille/Portefeuille.php |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Gilbert Rozon is the eldest of seven children. Raised in [[Saint-André-d'Argenteuil, Quebec|Saint-André d'Argenteuil]], he began working at a young age as a [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboy]]. At the age of 14 he became a [[gravedigger]], salesman, printer, show organizer, publisher of telephone directories business, key to real estate, etc. It is in this context from his work experience that he developed his sense of humour. After a short stay in [[France]] at age 20, he studied law at the [[Université de Montréal]] where he graduated.&lt;ref name="JdeM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/divertissement/arts-scene/entrevues/2007/01/07/3215272-jdm.html|title=GILBERT ROZON: Un homme de famille|last=Gaudet|first=Agnès|date=2007-07-01|publisher=[[Le Journal de Montréal]]|language=French|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1980, he founded the ''La Grande Virée'' ({{lang-en|The Grand Excursion}}) festival in [[Lachute]]  which welcomed more than 60,000 spectators in its first year and more than 80,000 in 1981. For its third year, Gilbert Rozon moved ''La Grande Virée'' to the [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] neighbourhood in [[Montreal]]. It was a failure.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divertissement.ca.msn.com/musique/festivals/galeries.aspx?cp-documentid=28666128&amp;page=1|title=L’échec du Festival la Grande Virée est à l’origine du Festival Juste pour rire|date=2011-05-09|work=Divertissement|publisher=[[MSN]].ca|language=French|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the failure of his first festival in Montreal, Rozon borrowed more than [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1 million to found the ''[[Just for Laughs]]'' festival in 1983. The festival was based in Montreal, although spread to [[Toronto]], [[Chicago]], [[Nantes]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="JdeM2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/divertissement/arts-scene/nouvelles/2007/05/11/4173677-jdm.html|title=LALIBERTÉ ET ROZON: Du rêve à la réalité|last=Parent|first=Marie-Joëlle|date=2007-07-01|publisher=[[Le Journal de Montréal]]|language=French|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozon was the [[impresario]] of [[Charles Trenet]] until his death. He was the producer of shows featuring [[Laurent Ruquier]], [[Franck Dubosc]], [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]], [[Florence Foresti]], [[Arturo Brachetti]], [[Stéphane Rousseau]], [[Jean-Marc Parent]], [[Jean-Luc Lemoine]], [[Rachid Badouri]], [[André Sauvé]], [[Christophe Alévêque]], etc.

Just for Laughs represents over 75 artists, over 200 hours of television broadcast in over 150 countries each year and hundreds of shows a year. For 25 years, Gilbert Rozon has been at the helm of the festival before giving way to [[Alain Cousineau]] with whom he founded the festival in 1983. He remains chairman and CEO of the group.

Starting in 2006, he became a member of the jury on the [[France|French]] program, ''[[La France a un incroyable talent]]''.&lt;ref name="JdeM3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/divertissement/tele-medias/nouvelles/2007/09/24/4521877-jdm.html|title=INCROYABLE TALENT: Un deuxième mandat confié à Gilbert Rozon|last=Gaudet|first=Agnès|date=2007-09-24|publisher=[[Le Journal de Montréal]]|language=French|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m6.fr/emission-la_france_a_un_incroyable_talent/|title=La France a un incroyable talent|publisher=[[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]|language=French|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Gilbert Rozon received an unconditional discharge from the Quebec Superior Court after pleading and being found guilty of a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/23/23224.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816004608/http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/23/23224.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-16 |title=La victime de Gilbert Rozon contre-attaque |work= |author=Radio-Canada |date=1999-03-08|language=French |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; because a criminal record would have made it difficult for him to travel internationally for his work.&lt;ref name="cbc2000"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/03/13/sexassault990313.html |title=Montreal impresario avoids jail time for sex assault |work= |author=CBC |date=2000-11-10|accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/23/23004.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628053645/http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/23/23004.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-28 |title=Gilbert Rozon pourra voyager librement |work= |author=Radio-Canada |date=1999-03-03|language=French |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused of unlawful confinement of a 31-year-old woman but the charge was withdrawn by the police for lack of evidence. Groups of women expressed anger over sentencing they considered as being too lenient.&lt;ref name="cbc2000"/&gt;

On October 18, 2017, Rozon announced he was resigning from his position as the President of Just for Laughs as well as the vice-president of the Montreal Metropolitan Board of Trade, amid allegations of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/18/glibert-rozon-steps-down-just-for-laughs-allegations_a_23248298/|title=Head Of Just For Laughs Festival Resigns Amid Sex Assault Claims|date=18 October 2017|website=Huffingtonpost.ca|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hungama TV''' is a TV channel for children in India based in [[Mumbai]]. Originally a subsidiary of [[UTV Software Communications]] launched on September 26, 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/utv-launches-hungama-tv/61180/|title=UTV Launches Hungama TV|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  the channel was sold to [[Disney]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/walt-disney-offers-to-acquire-utv-for-about-rs-2000-crore/822896|title=Walt Disney offers to acquire it for about rs 2000 crore|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney then bought UTV in 2011 thus reuniting UTV and Hungama TV under same ownership of Disney. Hungama TV is now an operating unit of [[Disney Channels Worldwide]]. It does not have an English audio track.

==History==
[[UTV Software Communications|UTV]] and [[Ronnie Screwvala]] formed United Home Entertainment with 51% and 49% ownership interests respectively. United Home was formed to launch an Indian children's channel. The company hired TAG for channel packaging. Chief Operating Officer Purnendu Bose was hired and was expected to hire 100 employees for the channel. Rs 100 crore was the expected initial investment with expectations of break even in three years. In September 2004, Hungama TV started broadcasting as the first domestic children's channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bansal|first1=Shuchi|title=Hungama TV to fight for ad share|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/hungama-tv-to-fight-for-ad-share-104040901069_1.html|accessdate=May 24, 2017|work=Business Standard India|date=9 April 2004|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, one of the UTV founders, Zarina Mehta became head of programming for Hungama. In early 2006, Mehta was promoted to chief operating officer of the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adesara|first1=Hetal|title=Hungama TV COO Zarina Mehta|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/special/y2k6/ms_media/zarina.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2017|work=Indian Television|date=May 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2006, [[Disney India]] acquired a controlling stake in Hungama TV from [[UTV Software Communications]] Limited while also taking a 14.9% share in UTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leahy|first=Joe|title=Disney switches on to Hindi market|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1114f6f4-4347-11db-9574-0000779e2340.html|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|date=13 September 2006|author2=Sundeep Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Disney acquired Hungama TV from UTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinha|first=Ashish|title='UTV investment is long-term play'|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/-utv-investment-is-long-term-play-108061801044_1.html|accessdate=April 23, 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel started with both live-action and animated programming but, following the success of ''[[Doraemon]]'', gradually shifted its focus to solely animated programming.&lt;ref name=Laun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k4/sep/sep229.htm|title=Hungama TV banking on movies, four driver shows|date=September 21, 2004|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afaqs.com/news/story/12801_Hungama-TV-to-focus-on-animation-now|title=Hungama TV to focus on animation now|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Hungama started adding original Indian series as a part of a localisation strategy.&lt;ref name=tvpost&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungama TV gets new look, plans to add local shows {{!}} TelevisionPost.com|url=http://www.televisionpost.com/television/hungama-tv-gets-new-look-plans-to-add-local-shows/|accessdate=May 24, 2017|work=Television Post|date=October 10, 2013|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

A Hindi dub of the Shin Chan anime started airing on Hungama TV on June 19, 2006, and it gained up to 60% of the channel's market share. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.in/disney-companies/media-networks/kids-channels/recent-shows|title=Shin Chan on Hungama TV - Disney India|last=|first=|date=|website=corporate.disney.in|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were complaints from parents over the main character's behavior and the attitudes exhibited towards elders on the show, both of which were seen as a negative influence on children. The show was banned from Indian television in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/india-bans-telecasting-of-shin-chan/151557.shtml|title=India bans telecasting of Shin Chan|website=www.merinews.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; Hirsch was raised in [[Ewing Township, New Jersey|Ewing Township]], where she graduated from [[Ewing High School (New Jersey)|Ewing High School]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Shaheed M.

"Hirsch was born in Trenton. She graduated from Ewing High School in 1968."&lt;/ref&gt; She said she left as soon as she could, and attended and graduated from [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], Florida.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seejane.org/membership/salon-changing-the-lens-why-diversity-matters/|title=Salon - Changing the Lens: Why Diversity Matters - See Jane|work=See Jane|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked for the ''[[Coconut Grove Playhouse]]''. She then worked for burlesque dancer [[Ann Corio]] in Massachusetts as a manager.

Hirsch relocated to New York and started working for the [[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|''National Lampoon'' show]] and then for the [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'' magazine]].

She wrote two of the first six episodes of ''[[It's Garry Shandling's Show]]'', each of which received media praise, but she left the show soon after. In the wake of widespread 2017 media coverage of [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]], Hirsch revealed that she had not left her writing position by choice. After writing two acclaimed episodes (of the first six) of ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'', she was cut from meetings and not allowed to write any parts except for occasional single scenes with women. She stated that one day she was sitting across from [[Garry Shandling]] in his office, and one of the actors on the show unexpectedly approached her from behind and placed his flaccid penis on her shoulder. Producer [[Brad Grey]] forced Hirsch to quit from her writing position the next day, without pay.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/comedy-writer-reveals-lurid-details-harassment-set-why-it-cost-her-a-job-guest-column-1049647|title=Comedy Writer Reveals Lurid Details of Harassment on Set — and Why It Cost Her a Job (Guest Column)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-11/comedy-writers-defend-say-anything-culture-in-sensitive-times|title=Comedy Writers Defend Say-Anything Culture in Sensitive Times|date=2017-11-11|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsch wrote contributions for comedy books, as well as publications like ''[[The New York Times]]''. She once lent $300 to [[John Belushi]] to fly to an audition for ''[[Animal House]]'' in California.  She moved to Los Angeles and started writing for ''[[Square Pegs]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She has produced or written for ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'', ''[[Anything But Love]]'', ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[The Nanny]], [[Murphy Brown]],'' and ''[['Til Death]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Hirsch has said that acceptance of women in the industry is greater now than in the 1970s when she started.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has been noted for using her clout to demand women not be ostracized or harassed on set, and she regularly mentors women in the comedy industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hirsch is a vocal supporter of several programs aimed at helping people with [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] or disabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/opinion/disabled-on-broadway.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Disabled on Broadway|date=2017-04-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supports ''Faith in America'' and other causes to end religious prejudice and hate towards members of the gay community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">The '''Junction Theatre Company''' was South Australia’s first professional [[community theatre]] company, founded in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"New Theatre Company Formed", The Advertiser, Sunday October 6, 1984, Page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Junction Theatre Company created touring works in schools, factories and other workplaces, with an aim to “create theatre of a high artistic quality which is accessible to those sections of the community who have not traditionally participated in theatre as an accessible option for entertainment, learning and expressing issues” &lt;ref&gt;"Junction Theatre Company Annual Report 1990", State Library of South Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days Junction Theatre was one of the country's main proponents of work supported by the program of funding Art and Working Life,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Milne, Theatre Australia (un)limited: Australian Theatre Since the 1950s, Rodopi 2004&lt;/ref&gt; along with companies such as [[Melbourne Workers Theatre]] in Victoria. The Art and Working Life funding program supported projects created in partnership with Trade Unions. Through the use of its own venue, it also became known as having an important role in facilitating the work of smaller companies in South Australia &lt;ref&gt;Don Rubin, Chua Soo Pong, Ravi Chaturvedi, The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific, Taylor &amp; Francis 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Junction Theatre Company’s first Artistic Director was Malcolm Blaylock.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Milne, Theatre Australia (un)limited: Australian Theatre Since the 1950s, Rodopi 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent and artistic director was Geoff Crowhurst, who was in the role until the closure of the company in 2001. Geoff Crowhurst was considered “A master of making theatre work for the good of whole communities”,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/news/media-centre/media-releases/australia-council-mourns-geoff-crowhurst/ AUSTRALIA COUNCIL MOURNS GEOFF CROWHURST]"&lt;/ref&gt;  and had an [[Arts South Australia]] Ruby Award category posthumously named in his honour for individuals who make "an outstanding contribution to community cultural development” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/ruby-awards-have-an-art-of-glass-for-10th-anniversary/news-story/9a8dc45affee457c81ddced45df9a66f "Ruby Awards have an art of glass for 10th Anniversary"] The Advertiser&lt;/ref&gt;

Productions by Junction Theater Company include:

* The company's first production, ''Next Year's Model'' in 1984, about the gradual closure of the General Motors Holden plant in Woodville, Victoria &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/60962 "AusStage Database" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Keys to the Animal Room'' by Peta Murray, 1993, about an abusive marital relationship, which received the 1994 Gold [[AWGIE Awards|AWGIE Award]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://australianplays.org/playwright/CP-murken "Peta Murray | Australian Plays Online" ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Hello Down There'' in 1993, a play about the collapse of the [[State Bank of South Australia]], which was named 'Best Community Theatre for 1993' in The Advertiser &lt;ref&gt;Junction Theatre Company Annual Report, 1993, pp 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* The company's last production, ''Love Land and Money'', 2002, relating to themes of reconciliation and mining industries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://murraybramwell.com/?p=322 "The Adelaide Review, No.222, March, 2002. pp.22-23" ]&lt;/ref&gt; co-presented by [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]] and [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]]

The '''Lumières Award''' ({{lang-fr|Prix Lumières}}) (sometimes called the ''Prix Lumière'' or ''Lumière Award'') is a [[France|French]] [[film award]] presented by the ''Académie des Lumières'' to honor the best in the [[French language|French-speaking cinema]] of the previous year. The awards ceremony is organized by the Académie des Lumières which consists of over 200 representatives of the international press based in [[Paris]]. Today it is regarded as one of the most prestigious [[French film industry]] awards, equivalent to the [[Golden Globe Award]] presented by the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]].

==History ==
&lt;!--- Placed in hidden note until there's more sources to verify its predecessor: The original ''Prix Louis Lumière'', named after the film pioneer [[Louis Lumière]], was first given in 1935 by a jury of the Academie Nationale. The prize was discontinued in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Tad Bentley Hammer International film prizes: an encyclopedia -  1991 Page 148 "PRIX LOUIS LUMIERE 1934-1984 Introduced in 1935 by a jury of the prestigious French National Academy, the Prix Lumière, named for the famous film pioneer Louis Lumière, was until its demise in 1985 the oldest film prize given in France. Among its recipients can be found some of the greatest names in French and world cinema, as well as some relatively obscure filmmakers.&lt;/ref&gt; After an 11 year hiatus the new ---&gt;
The Lumières Award was initiated in 1995 by French producer [[Daniel Toscan du Plantier]] and American journalist and ex-[[Newsweek]]'s Paris correspondent [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]]. Their idea was to replicate the [[Golden Globes]] given by the foreign press in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academielumieres.com/l__academie_des_lumieres_du_cinema.ws L'Académie des Lumières] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017225322/http://www.academielumieres.com/l__academie_des_lumieres_du_cinema.ws |date=2013-10-17 }} "À l'image des Golden Globe Awards décernés chaque année par l'Association de la presse étrangère de Hollywood, l'Académie des Lumières veut souligner le grand intérêt que porte au cinéma français la presse internationale largement représentée à Paris."&lt;/ref&gt; The Lumières Award is usually presented a month before [[César Award]], the French national film award.

== Background ==

'''''Mahatma''''' was a monthly magic periodical founded by George Little, which was published March 1895 – February 1906 (issue 104).&lt;ref name="Alfredson"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://askalexander.org/display/21976/A+Bibliography+of+Conjuring+Periodicals+in+English+1791+1983/250|title=A Bibliography of Conjuring Periodicals in English: 1791 - 1983|last=Alfredson|first=James B.|last2=Daily|first2=George L.|publisher=Magicana for Collectors|year=1986|isbn=|location=[[York, Pennsylvania]]|pages=230-231|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alfredson and Daily,&lt;ref name="Alfredson" /&gt; it was "the first English language magical serial of any substance". With the September 1902 issue, it became the official magazine of the [[Society of American Magicians]].&lt;ref name="Alfredson" /&gt; ''Mahatma'' was printed in the back of New York City's [[Martinka|Martinka's magic shop]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lybrary.com/mahatma-p-83.html|title=Mahatma by George H. Little|website=Lybrary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Publication history ==
The first issue of ''Mahatma'' was published in March 1895.&lt;ref name="Alfredson" /&gt; There was a gap in publication of 28 months between issues 8 and 9 of volume 1. During this time, the publishers put out 2 other magazines that followed the numbering of ''Mahatma'': ''Vaudeville'' and ''Artist Era''. ''Vaudeville'' claimed to be a continuation of ''Mahatma'' with a change in name and format, and ran for two issues (Volume 1 Numbers 9 &amp; 10). Only two issues of ''Artist Era'' are known to exist (Volume 1 Numbers 11 &amp; 13).

A '''microphone''', colloquially nicknamed '''mic''' or '''mike''' ({{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|k}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/magazine/01-onlanguage-t.html?_r=1|title=How Should 'Microphone' be Abbreviated?|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=29 July 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[transducer]] that converts [[sound]] into an [[electrical signal]].

Microphones are used in many applications such as [[telephone]]s, [[hearing aid]]s, [[public address system]]s for concert halls and public events, [[motion picture]] production, live and recorded [[audio engineering]], [[sound recording]], [[two-way radio]]s, [[megaphone]]s,  [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting, and in computers for recording voice, [[speech recognition]], [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic sensors or [[Automatic Performance Control|knock sensors]].

Several different types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a [[sound wave]] to an electrical signal.  The most common are the [[dynamic microphone]], which uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field; the [[condenser microphone]], which uses the vibrating [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] as a [[capacitor]] plate, and the [[piezoelectric microphone]], which uses a crystal of [[piezoelectric]] material.  Microphones typically need to be connected to a [[preamplifier]] before the signal can be [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded or reproduced]].

==History==
In order to speak to larger groups of people, a need arose to increase the volume of the human voice. The earliest devices used to achieve this were acoustic [[megaphone]]s.  Some of the first examples, from fifth century BC Greece, were theater masks with  horn-shaped mouth openings that acoustically amplified the voice of actors in [[amphitheatre]]s.&lt;ref name="Montgomery1959"/&gt; In 1665, the English physicist [[Robert Hooke]] was the first to experiment with a medium other than air with the invention of the "[[lovers' telephone]]" made of stretched wire with a cup attached at each end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McVeigh|first1=Daniel|title=An Early History of the Telephone: 1664–1866: Robert Hooke's Acoustic Experiments and Acoustic Inventions|url=http://oceanofk.org/telephone/html/part1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903082530/http://www.oceanofk.org/telephone/html/part1.html|archivedate=2003-09-03|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German inventor [[Johann Philipp Reis]] designed an early sound transmitter that used a metallic strip attached to a vibrating membrane that would produce intermittent current. Better results were achieved with the "liquid transmitter" design in Scottish-American [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s telephone of 1876 – the diaphragm was attached to a conductive rod in an acid solution.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Elizabeth 1999 Alexander Graham Bell: an inventive life. Kids Can Press, Toronto&lt;/ref&gt; These systems, however, gave a very poor sound quality.

The first microphone that enabled proper voice telephony was the (loose-contact) [[carbon microphone]]. This was independently developed by [[David Edward Hughes]] in England and [[Emile Berliner]] and [[Thomas Edison]] in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent (after a long legal dispute) in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9wEntQmA0IC|title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age|author=Paul J.

Also in 1923, the [[ribbon microphone]] was introduced, another electromagnetic type, believed to have been developed by [[Harry F. Olson]], who essentially reverse-engineered a ribbon speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1931 Harry F. Olson and Les Anderson, RCA Model 44 Ribbon Microphone |url=http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/olson-anderson-rca-090106/ |publisher=''[[Mix Magazine]]'' |date=Sep 1, 2006 |accessdate=10 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324111751/http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/olson-anderson-rca-090106 |archivedate=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years these microphones were developed by several companies, most notably RCA that made large advancements in pattern control, to give the microphone directionality.  With television and film technology booming there was demand for high fidelity microphones and greater directionality. [[Electro-Voice]] responded with their Academy Award-winning [[shotgun microphone]] in 1963.
 
During the second half of 20th century development advanced quickly with the [[Shure]] Brothers bringing out the [[Shure SM58|SM58]] and [[Shure SM57|SM57]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Shure Americas |url=http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history |title=History – The evolution of an audio revolution |accessdate=13 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915095300/http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history |archivedate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest research developments include the use of fibre optics, lasers and interferometers.

==Components==
[[File:MicrophoneSymbol.png|thumb|Electronic symbol for a microphone]]
The sensitive transducer element of a microphone is called its ''element'' or ''capsule.'' Sound is first converted to mechanical motion by means of a diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal. A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A [[wireless microphone]] contains a [[radio transmitter]].

== Varieties ==
Microphones are categorized by their [[transducer]] principle, such as condenser, dynamic, etc., and by their directional characteristics. Sometimes other characteristics such as diaphragm size, intended use or orientation of the principal sound input to the principal axis (end- or side-address) of the microphone are used to describe the microphone.

=== Condenser ===
[[File:Oktava319-internal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Inside the Oktava 319 condenser microphone]]

The '''condenser microphone''', invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stokowski.org/Development_of_Electrical_Recording.htm |title= Bell Laboratories and The Development of Electrical Recording |publisher=Stokowski.org (Leopold Stokowski site)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also called a '''capacitor microphone''' or '''electrostatic microphone'''—capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] acts as one plate of a [[capacitor]], and the vibrations produce changes in the distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the method of extracting the [[audio signal]] from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a '''DC-biased microphone''', the plates are [[Voltage bias|biased]] with a fixed charge (''Q''). The [[voltage]] maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = {{fract|Q|V}}), where Q = charge in [[coulomb]]s, C = capacitance in [[farad]]s and V = potential difference in [[volt]]s.  The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them for a parallel-plate capacitor. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an "element" or "capsule".

A nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant. The capacitance of the capsule (around 5 to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Farad|pF]]) and the value of the bias resistor (100&amp;nbsp;[[ohm|MΩ]] to tens of GΩ) form a filter that is high-pass for the audio signal, and low-pass for the bias voltage. Note that the time constant of an [[RC circuit]] equals the product of the resistance and capacitance.

Within the time-frame of the capacitance change (as much as 50&amp;nbsp;ms at 20&amp;nbsp;Hz audio signal), the charge is practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies above and below the bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.

[[Image:AKG C451B.jpg|thumb|right|[[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] C451B small-diaphragm condenser microphone]]
'''RF condenser microphones''' use a comparatively low RF voltage, generated by a low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule may be part of a [[resonant circuit]] that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency signal with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The [[Sennheiser]] "MKH" series of microphones use the RF biasing technique. A covert, remotely energised [[The Thing (listening device)|application of the same physical principle]] was devised by Soviet Russian inventor [[Léon Theremin]] and used to bug the US Ambassador's Residence in Moscow between 1945 and 1952.

Condenser microphones span the range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal and are now the popular choice in laboratory and [[recording studio]] applications. The inherent suitability of this technology is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as [[phantom power]] or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example, the [[Røde]] NT2000 or CAD M179.

A [[valve microphone]] is a condenser microphone that uses a [[vacuum tube]] (valve) amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Institute BV Amsterdam| first=SAE|title=Microphones |url=http://www.sae.edu/reference_material/audio/pages/Microphones.htm|publisher=Practical Creative Media Education|accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remain popular with enthusiasts of [[tube sound]].

==== Electret condenser ====

An electret microphone is a type of capacitor microphone invented by [[Gerhard Sessler]] and [[James Edward Maceo West|Jim West]] at [[Bell laboratories]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|first=G.M. |last=Sessler |author2=West, J.E.

The externally applied charge described above under condenser microphones is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material. An [[electret]] is a [[ferroelectric]] material that has been permanently [[electric charge|electrically charged]] or ''polarized''. The name comes from ''electr''ostatic and magn''et''; a static charge is embedded in an electret by alignment of the static charges in the material, much the way a magnet is made by aligning the magnetic domains in a piece of iron.

Due to their good performance and ease of manufacture, hence low cost, the vast majority of microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national.com/nationaledge/dec02/article.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045334/http://www.national.com/nationaledge/dec02/article.html|date=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimates annual production at over one billion units. Nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones are electret types. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and [[lavalier microphone|lavalier]] use to built-in microphones in small [[sound recording]] devices and telephones. Though electret microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement microphone. Unlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated [[Microphone preamplifier|preamplifier]] that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently [[phantom power]]ed in [[sound reinforcement]] and studio applications.  Monophonic microphones designed for [[personal computer]] (PC) use, sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5&amp;nbsp;V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.

Only the best electret microphones rival good DC-polarized units in terms of noise level and quality; electret microphones lend themselves to inexpensive mass-production, while inherently expensive non-electret condenser microphones are made to higher quality.

{{Anchor|Dynamic microphone}}&lt;!-- redirects link here [[Dynamic microphone]] [[Moving-coil microphone]] --&gt;

=== Dynamic ===
[[Image:Patti Smith performing in Finland, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Patti Smith]] singing into a [[Shure SM58]] (dynamic cardioid type) microphone]]

The '''dynamic microphone''' (also known as the '''moving-coil microphone''') works via [[electromagnetic induction]]. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high [[gain before feedback]], makes them ideal for on-stage use.

Dynamic microphones use the same dynamic principle as in a [[loudspeaker]], only reversed. A small movable [[induction coil]], positioned in the [[magnetic field]] of a [[permanent magnet]], is attached to the [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying [[current (electricity)|current]] in the coil through [[electromagnetic induction]]. A single dynamic membrane does not respond linearly to all audio frequencies. For this reason, some microphones utilize multiple membranes for the different parts of the audio spectrum and then combine the resulting signals. Combining the multiple signals correctly is difficult; designs that do this are rare and tend to be expensive. On the other hand, there are several designs that are more specifically aimed towards isolated parts of the audio spectrum. The [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] D 112, for example, is designed for bass response rather than treble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akg.com/site/products/powerslave,id,261,pid,261,nodeid,2,_language,EN.html "AKG D 112 – Large-diaphragm dynamic microphone for bass instruments]"&lt;/ref&gt; In audio engineering several kinds of microphones are often used at the same time to get the best results.

=== Ribbon ===
{{main|Ribbon microphone}}
[[Image:Edmund Lowe fsa 8b06653.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edmund Lowe]] using a ribbon microphone]]

[[Ribbon microphone]]s use a thin, usually corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically connected to the microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a [[#Bi-directional|bi-directional]] (also called figure-eight, as in the [[#Microphone polar patterns|diagram]] below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides.  Also, because the ribbon has much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the [[sound pressure]]. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or [[Blumlein Pair|Blumlein pair]], stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.

Other directional patterns are produced by enclosing one side of the ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone]] has several externally adjustable positions of the internal baffle, allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from "figure-eight" to "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high-quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2008/02/11/story8.html
 |title=Local firms strum the chords of real music innovation
 |journal=Mass High Tech: the Journal of New England Technology
 |date=February 8, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require [[phantom power]]; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, ''i.e.'', those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.

=== Carbon ===
{{Main|Carbon microphone}}

The [[carbon microphone]] was the earliest type of microphone. The carbon button microphone (or sometimes just a button microphone), uses a capsule or button containing carbon granules pressed between two metal plates like the [[Emile Berliner|Berliner]] and [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] microphones. A voltage is applied across the metal plates, causing a small current to flow through the carbon. One of the plates, the diaphragm, vibrates in sympathy with incident sound waves, applying a varying pressure to the carbon. The changing pressure deforms the granules, causing the contact area between each pair of adjacent granules to change, and this causes the electrical resistance of the mass of granules to change. The changes in resistance cause a corresponding change in the current flowing through the microphone, producing the electrical signal. Carbon microphones were once commonly used in telephones; they have extremely low-quality sound reproduction and a very limited frequency response range, but are very robust devices. The Boudet microphone, which used relatively large carbon balls, was similar to the granule carbon button microphones.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://www.machine-history.com/Boudet%20Microphone
 |title=Boudet's Microphone
 |publisher=Machine-History.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other microphone types, the carbon microphone can also be used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early [[repeater|telephone repeaters]], making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. These repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old "candlestick" telephone if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.

{{Anchor|Piezoelectric microphone}}&lt;!--Redirects link here [[Piezoelectric microphone]]--&gt;

=== Piezoelectric ===
A '''crystal microphone''' or '''piezo microphone'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seung S. Lee |first1=Woon Seob Lee  |title=Piezoelectric microphone built on circular diaphragm |journal=Sensors and Actuators A |volume=144 |year=2008 |pages=367–373 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~qiw4/Academic/ME2080/ZnO%20circular%20microphone.pdf |accessdate=3 March 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717185137/http://www.pitt.edu/~qiw4/Academic/ME2080/ZnO%20circular%20microphone.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the phenomenon of [[piezoelectricity]]—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An example of this is [[potassium sodium tartrate]], which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with [[vacuum tube]] (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders.  Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ohm|megohms]]) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early [[transistor]] equipment and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.

Piezoelectric transducers are often used as [[contact microphone]]s to amplify sound from acoustic musical instruments, to sense drum hits, for triggering electronic samples, and to record sound in challenging environments, such as underwater under high pressure. [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|Saddle-mounted pickups]] on [[acoustic guitar]]s are generally piezoelectric devices that contact the strings passing over the saddle. This type of microphone is different from [[Pick up (music technology)#Magnetic pickups|magnetic coil pickups]] commonly visible on typical [[electric guitar]]s, which use magnetic induction, rather than mechanical coupling, to pick up vibration.

=== Fiber optic ===

A [[fiber optic]] microphone converts acoustic waves into electrical signals by sensing changes in light intensity, instead of sensing changes in capacitance or magnetic fields as with conventional microphones.

During operation, light from a laser source travels through an optical fiber to illuminate the surface of a reflective diaphragm. Sound vibrations of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.

Fiber optic microphones do not react to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI/RFI]] immunity). The fiber optic microphone design is therefore ideal for use in areas where conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside [[Gas turbine#Industrial gas turbines for electrical generation|industrial turbines]] or in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) equipment environments.

Fiber optic microphones are robust, resistant to environmental changes in heat and moisture, and can be produced for any directionality or [[impedance matching]]. The distance between the microphone's light source and its photodetector may be up to several kilometers without need for any preamplifier or another electrical device, making fiber optic microphones suitable for industrial and surveillance acoustic monitoring.

Fiber optic microphones are used in very specific application areas such as for [[infrasound]] monitoring and [[Noise-canceling microphone|noise-canceling]]. They have proven especially useful in medical applications, such as allowing radiologists, staff and patients within the powerful and noisy magnetic field to converse normally, inside the MRI suites as well as in remote control rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rt-image.com/Case_Study_Can_You_Hear_Me_Now_Technology_for_better_communication_in_the_MRI_su/content=9004J05E48B6A686407698724488A0441 |title=Case Study: Can You Hear Me Now? |work=rt-image.com |publisher=Valley Forge Publishing |first=Susan |last=Karlin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715212557/http://www.rt-image.com/Case_Study_Can_You_Hear_Me_Now_Technology_for_better_communication_in_the_MRI_su/content%3D9004J05E48B6A686407698724488A0441 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include industrial equipment monitoring and  audio calibration and measurement, high-fidelity recording and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goulde|first1=Berg|title=Microphones For Computer|url=https://microphonetopgear.com/microphones-for-computer/|website=Microphone top gear|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser ===
{{Main|Laser microphone}}

[[Laser microphone]]s are often portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, because they can be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the laser spot from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.

In a more robust and expensive implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an [[interferometer]], which detects movement of the surface by changes in the [[optical path length]] of the reflected beam. The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics.

A new type of laser microphone is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect [[sound]] [[vibration]]s in free air. On 25 August 2009, U.S. patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations in the amount of laser light reaching the photodetector. A prototype of the device was demonstrated at the 127th Audio Engineering Society convention in New York City from 9 through 12 October 2009.

=== Liquid ===
{{Main|Water microphone}}

Early microphones did not produce intelligible speech, until [[Alexander Graham Bell]] made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter.  Bell's liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water with a small amount of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged needle.  Elisha Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle.  Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application.  The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.

=== MEMS ===
{{main|Microelectromechanical systems}}

The [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] (MicroElectrical-Mechanical System) microphone is also called a microphone chip or silicon microphone. A pressure-sensitive diaphragm is etched directly into a silicon wafer by MEMS processing techniques, and is usually accompanied with integrated preamplifier. Most MEMS microphones are variants of the condenser microphone design. Digital MEMS microphones have built in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits on the same CMOS chip making the chip a digital microphone and so more readily integrated with modern digital products. Major manufacturers producing MEMS silicon microphones are Wolfson Microelectronics (WM7xxx) now Cirrus Logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cirrus-logic-completes-acquisition-of-wolfson-microelectronics-2014-08-21|title=Cirrus Logic Completes Acquisition of Wolfson Microelectronics |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=2014-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; InvenSense (product line sold by Analog Devices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/en/about-adi/news-room/press-releases/2013/10_14_13_adi_to_sell_microphone_product_line_to_in.html|title=Analog Devices To Sell Microphone Product Line To InvenSense |publisher=MarketWatch.com |accessdate=2015-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Akustica (AKU200x), Infineon (SMM310 product), Knowles Electronics, Memstech (MSMx), NXP Semiconductors (division bought by Knowles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.knowles.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=252194&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1884042|title=Knowles Completes Acquisition of NXP’s Sound Solutions Business |publisher=Knowles |accessdate=2011-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), Sonion MEMS, Vesper, AAC Acoustic Technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/157790-mems-microphone-will-be-hurt-by-downturn-in-smartphone-market |title=MEMS Microphone Will Be Hurt by Downturn in Smartphone Market |publisher=[[Seeking Alpha]] |accessdate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Omron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omron.com/media/press/2009/11/c1125.html |title=OMRON to Launch Mass-production and Supply of MEMS Acoustic Sensor Chip -World's first MEMS sensor capable of detecting the lower limit of human audible frequencies- |accessdate=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, since the 2010s, there has been increased interest and research into making piezoelectric MEMS microphones which are a significant architectural and material change from existing condenser style MEMS designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1324827|title=MEMS Mics Taking Over|work=EETimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speakers as microphones ===
A [[loudspeaker]], a transducer that turns an electrical signal into sound waves, is the functional opposite of a microphone. Since a conventional speaker is constructed much like a dynamic microphone (with a diaphragm, coil and magnet), speakers can actually work "in reverse" as microphones. The resulting signal typically offers reduced quality including limited high-end frequency response and poor [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]. In practical use, speakers are sometimes used as microphones in applications where high quality and sensitivity are not needed such as [[intercom]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s or [[Voice chat#Voice chat in gaming|video game voice chat]] peripherals, or when conventional microphones are in short supply.

However, there is at least one practical application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size [[woofer]] placed closely in front of a "kick drum" ([[bass drum]]) in a [[drum set]] to act as a microphone.  A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a {{convert|6.5|in|adj=on}} woofer shock-mounted into a 10" drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. 

Less commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a [[tweeter]] is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.

== Capsule design and directivity ==
The inner elements of a microphone are the primary source of differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]] between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bartlett  | first = Bruce  | title = How A Cardioid Microphone Works | url = http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/church_sound_how_a_cardioid_microphone_really_works/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polar patterns ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A microphone's directionality or polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis.  The polar patterns illustrated above represent the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones such as in the Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually [[perpendicular]] to the microphone body, commonly known as "side fire" or "side address". For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as "end fire" or "top/end address".

Some microphone designs combine several principles in creating the desired polar pattern. This ranges from shielding (meaning diffraction/dissipation/absorption) by the housing itself to electronically combining dual membranes.

===Omnidirectional===
An '''omnidirectional''' (or nondirectional) microphone's response is generally considered to be a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the polar pattern for an "omnidirectional" microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it's cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.

The wavelength of sound at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz is 1.4" (3.5&amp;nbsp;cm). The smallest measuring microphones are often 1/4" (6&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter, which practically eliminates directionality even up to the highest frequencies. Omnidirectional microphones, unlike cardioids, do not employ resonant cavities as delays, and so can be considered the "purest" microphones in terms of low coloration; they add very little to the original sound. Being pressure-sensitive they can also have a very flat low-frequency response down to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz or below. Pressure-sensitive microphones also respond much less to wind noise and plosives than directional (velocity sensitive) microphones.

An example of a nondirectional microphone is the round black ''eight ball''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lloydmicrophoneclassics.com/mic_history.html History &amp; Development of Microphone.] Lloyd Microphone Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unidirectional===
A unidirectional microphone is primarily sensitive to sounds from only one direction. [[#Microphone polar patterns|The diagram above]] illustrates a number of these patterns. The microphone faces upwards in each diagram. The sound intensity for a particular frequency is plotted for angles radially from 0 to 360°. (Professional diagrams show these scales and include multiple plots at different frequencies. The diagrams given here provide only an overview of typical pattern shapes, and their names.)

{{Anchor|Cardioid}}

===Cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, subcardioid===
[[Image:Us664a microphone.jpg|thumb|right|University Sound US664A dynamic supercardioid microphone]]

The most common unidirectional microphone is a '''cardioid''' microphone, so named because the sensitivity pattern is "heart-shaped", i.e. a [[cardioid]]. The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones, since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone, which is the "stem" of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitors]]. Since these directional [[transducer]] microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them very close to the sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/node473.html Proximity Effect.] Geoff Martin, ''Introduction to Sound Recording''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SM58]] has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shure.com/americas/about-shure/history/index.htm |title=History – The evolution of an audio revolution |publisher=[[Shure]] |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.

The cardioid is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional (pressure) and a figure-8 (pressure gradient) microphone;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KApvYcQkY_gC|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround - A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|last=Rayburn|first=Ray A.|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136118135|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for sound waves coming from the back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other.

By combining the two components in different ratios, any pattern between omni and figure-8 can be achieved, which comprise the first-order cardioid family.  Common shapes include:

* A '''hyper-cardioid''' microphone is similar to cardioid, but with a slightly larger figure-8 contribution, leading to a tighter area of front sensitivity and a smaller lobe of rear sensitivity.  It is produced by combining the two components in a 3:1 ratio, producing nulls at 109.5°.  This ratio maximizes the [[directivity factor]] (or directivity index).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5872011/|title=On the Design and Implementation of Higher Order Differential Microphones - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tym4kKVPfaAC|title=Study and Design of Differential Microphone Arrays|last=Benesty|first=Jacob|last2=Jingdong|first2=Chen|date=2012-10-23|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642337529|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''super-cardioid''' microphone is similar to a hyper-cardioid, except there is more front pickup and less rear pickup.  It is produced with about a 5:3 ratio, with nulls at 126.9°.  This ratio maximizes the ''front-back ratio''; the energy ratio between front and rear radiation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* The '''sub-cardioid''' microphone has no null points. It is produced with about 7:3 ratio with 3-10&amp;nbsp;dB level between the front and back pickup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2005/december/text/content2.html |title=Ask the Doctors: The Physics of Mid-Side (MS) Miking |author=Dave Berners |publisher=[[Universal Audio]] |work=Universal Audio WebZine |date=December 2005 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/mic3.html#c2 |title=Directional Patterns of Microphones |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bi-directional===
"Figure 8" or bi-directional microphones receive sound equally from both the front and back of the element. Most ribbon microphones are of this pattern.  In principle they do not respond to sound pressure at all, only to the ''change'' in pressure between front and back; since sound arriving from the side reaches front and back equally there is no difference in pressure and therefore no sensitivity to sound from that direction. In more mathematical terms, while omnidirectional microphones are [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] transducers responding to pressure from any direction, bi-directional microphones are [[Gradient vector|vector]] transducers responding to the gradient along an axis normal to the plane of the diaphragm. This also has the effect of inverting the output polarity for sounds arriving from the back side.

{{anchor|Shotgun and parabolic microphones|shotgun}}

===Shotgun and parabolic===
[[Image:shotgun microphone.jpg|thumb|left|An Audio-Technica shotgun microphone]]
[[File:Interference Tube.jpg|thumbnail|left|The interference tube of a shotgun microphone. The capsule is at the base of the tube.]]
[[File:Sony parabolic reflector.jpg|thumb|left|A Sony parabolic reflector, without a microphone. The microphone would face the reflector surface and sound captured by the reflector would bounce towards the microphone.]]

'''Shotgun microphones''' are the most highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types.  At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of off-axis waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique is the presence of some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects.  Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.

===Boundary or "PZM"===
Several approaches have been developed for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from one or more of the surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical polar pattern and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;({{Cite patent|US|4361736}})&lt;/ref&gt; While the patent has expired, "Pressure Zone Microphone" and "PZM" are still active trademarks of [[Crown International]], and the generic term [[boundary microphone]] is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is "Phase Coherent Cardioid" or "PCC," but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.

== Application-specific designs ==
A [[lavalier microphone]] is made for hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).

A [[wireless microphone]] transmits the audio as a radio or optical signal rather than via a cable. It usually sends its signal using a small FM radio transmitter to a nearby receiver connected to the sound system, but it can also use infrared waves if the transmitter and receiver are within sight of each other.

A [[contact microphone]] picks up vibrations directly from a solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or [[insect]]s. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones have been used to pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A [[throat microphone]] is a variant of the contact microphone that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.

A [[parabolic microphone]] uses a [[parabolic reflector]] to collect and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, in much the same way that a [[parabolic antenna]] (e.g. [[satellite dish]]) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, [[eavesdropping]], [[Police|law enforcement]], and even [[espionage]]. Parabolic microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.

A stereo microphone integrates two microphones in one unit to produce a stereophonic signal. A stereo microphone is often used for [[broadcast]] applications or [[field recording]] where it would be impractical to configure two separate condenser microphones in a classic X-Y configuration (see [[microphone practice]]) for stereophonic recording. Some such microphones have an adjustable angle of coverage between the two channels.

A [[noise-canceling microphone]] is a highly directional design intended for noisy environments.  One such use is in [[aircraft]] cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in [[live event support]] on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with [[Concert|live performances]]. Many noise-canceling microphones combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source and the second is positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16&amp;nbsp;dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Janet Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crownaudio.com/pdf/mics/136368.pdf Crown Audio.

== Stereo microphone techniques ==
{{main|Microphone practice}}
Various standard techniques are used with microphones used in [[sound reinforcement]] at live performances, or for recording in a studio or on a motion picture set. By suitable arrangement of one or more microphones, desirable features of the sound to be collected can be kept, while rejecting unwanted sounds.

== Powering ==
Microphones containing active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require power to operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical to use the same cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as [[:de:Tonaderspeisung]] or T-power and DIN 45596 for [[phantom power]]. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, "plug-in power" is more common, for microphones using a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability|journal=Webstore.iec.ch|volume=IEC 61938:2013|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connectors ==
[[File:Yeti-USB-Microphone.jpg|thumb|upright|A microphone with a USB connector]]

The most common connectors used by microphones are:
*Male [[XLR connector]] on professional microphones
*¼&amp;nbsp;inch (sometimes referred to as 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]] on less expensive musician's microphones, using an unbalanced 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch (6.3&amp;nbsp;mm) TS phone connector. Harmonica microphones commonly use a high impedance 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch (6.3&amp;nbsp;mm) TS connection to be run through guitar amplifiers.
*3.5&amp;nbsp;mm (sometimes referred to as 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch mini) stereo (and also come in varieties known as mono) mini phone plug on prosumer camera, recorder and computer microphones.
*[[USB]] allows direct connection to PCs. Electronics in these microphones powered over the USB connection performs preamplification and AD conversion before the digital audio data is transferred via the USB interface.

Some microphones use other connectors, such as a 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some lavalier (or "lapel", from the days of attaching the microphone to the news reporters suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a [[Radio Pack|radio pack]]. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.

=== Impedance-matching ===
Microphones have an electrical characteristic called [[electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s&amp;nbsp;(Ω), that depends on the design. In passive microphones, this value describes the electrical resistance of the magnet coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the output resistance of the amplifier circuitry. Typically, the ''rated impedance'' is stated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;International Standard IEC 60268-4&lt;/ref&gt; Low impedance is considered under 600&amp;nbsp;Ω. Medium impedance is considered between 600&amp;nbsp;Ω and 10&amp;nbsp;kΩ. High impedance is above 10&amp;nbsp;kΩ. Owing to their built-in [[Electronic amplifier|amplifier]], condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200&amp;nbsp;Ω.&lt;ref name=Eargle2002&gt;{{cite book |title=Audio Engineering for Sound Reinforcement |last=Eargle |first=John |authorlink=John M.

The output of a given microphone delivers the same [[Power (physics)|power]] whether it is low or high impedance{{citation needed|reason=The impedance of the microphone determines how much power is dissipated internally given the impedance of its connected device.|date=September 2015}}. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200&amp;nbsp;Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a [[transformer]] that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available that can be used in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.

Low-impedance microphones are preferred over high impedance for two reasons: one is that using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance{{citation needed|reason=Unless there is an IEEE specification that states specific audio input and output impedances for all equipment, this is an over-reaching statement that might not always (or frequently) be true.|date=September 2015}}. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more [[mains hum|hum]] (and possibly [[Radio frequency interference|radio-frequency interference]] (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.

Some microphones are designed ''not'' to have their impedance matched by the load they are connected to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_imepdance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428071840/http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_imepdance|date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so can alter their frequency response and cause distortion, especially at high sound pressure levels. Certain ribbon and dynamic microphones are exceptions, due to the designers' assumption of a certain load impedance being part of the internal electro-acoustical damping circuit of the microphone.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, A.

=== Digital microphone interface ===
[[File:Neumann D-01 IBC 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|Neumann D-01 digital microphone and Neumann DMI-8 8-channel USB Digital Microphone Interface]]
The [[AES42]] standard, published by the [[Audio Engineering Society]], defines a digital interface for microphones. Microphones conforming to this standard directly output a digital audio stream through an XLR or [[XLD connector#XLD keyed variant|XLD]] male connector, rather than producing an analog output. Digital microphones may be used either with new equipment with appropriate input connections that conform to the AES42 standard, or else via a suitable interface box. Studio-quality microphones that operate in accordance with the AES42 standard are now available from a number of microphone manufacturers.

== Measurements and specifications ==
[[Image:Oktava319vsshuresm58.png|thumb|left|A comparison of the far field on-axis frequency response of the Oktava 319 and the [[SM58|Shure SM58]]]]

Because of differences in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform [[phase (waves)|phase]] and [[frequency]] responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often not the case for music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.[http://www.microphone-data.com/]. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from this or any other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC&amp;nbsp;60268-4.

A [[frequency response]] diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in [[decibel]]s over a range of frequencies (typically 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0° to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: "30&amp;nbsp;Hz–16&amp;nbsp;kHz&amp;nbsp;±3&amp;nbsp;dB". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, linear, plot between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude of no more than plus or minus 3&amp;nbsp;dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how ''smooth'' the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as "20&amp;nbsp;Hz–20&amp;nbsp;kHz" are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' frequency response varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC&amp;nbsp;60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in ''plane progressive wave'' conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. ''Close talking'' microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.

The self-noise or [[equivalent input]] noise level is the sound level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does in the absence of sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in [[dB(A)]], which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: "15&amp;nbsp;dBA SPL" (SPL means [[sound pressure]] level relative to 20&amp;nbsp;[[micropascal]]s). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]], which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14&amp;nbsp;dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20&amp;nbsp;dBA SPL or 32&amp;nbsp;dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel &amp; Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0&amp;nbsp;dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from [[Georg Neumann GmbH|Neumann]] and [[Røde]] that advertise noise levels between 5–7&amp;nbsp;dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the [[A-weighting]] curve while broadband noise may be increased.

The maximum SPL the microphone can accept is measured for particular values of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD), typically 0.5%. This amount of distortion is generally inaudible,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} so one can safely use the microphone at this SPL without harming the recording. Example: "142&amp;nbsp;[[dB SPL]] peak (at 0.5%&amp;nbsp;THD)". The higher the value, the better, although microphones with a very high maximum SPL also have a higher self-noise.

The clipping level is an important indicator of maximum usable level, as the 1%&amp;nbsp;THD figure usually quoted under max SPL is really a very mild level of distortion, quite inaudible especially on brief high peaks. Clipping is much more audible. For some microphones the clipping level may be much higher than the max SPL.

The dynamic range of a microphone is the difference in SPL between the noise floor and the maximum SPL. If stated on its own, for example "120&amp;nbsp;dB", it conveys significantly less information than having the self-noise and maximum SPL figures individually.

[[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] indicates how well the microphone converts acoustic pressure to output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device.  This is a practical concern but is not directly an indication of the microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, "transduction gain" being perhaps more meaningful, (or just "output level") because true sensitivity is generally set by the [[noise floor]], and too much "sensitivity" in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1&amp;nbsp;V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so −60&amp;nbsp; dB is more sensitive than −70&amp;nbsp;dB.

== Measurement microphones ==&lt;!--[[Measurement microphone]] redirects here--&gt;
[[Image:AKG C214 condenser microphone with H85 shock mount.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] C214 condenser microphone with [[shock mount]]]]
Some microphones are intended for testing speakers, measuring noise levels and otherwise quantifying an acoustic experience. These are calibrated transducers and are usually supplied with a calibration certificate that states absolute sensitivity against frequency. The quality of measurement microphones is often referred to using the designations "Class 1," "Type 2" etc., which are references not to microphone specifications but to [[sound level meter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;IEC Standard 61672 and ANSI S1.4&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive standard&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61094&lt;/ref&gt; for the description of measurement microphone performance was recently adopted.

Measurement microphones are generally scalar sensors of [[pressure]]; they exhibit an omnidirectional response, limited only by the scattering profile of their physical dimensions. [[Sound intensity]] or sound power measurements require pressure-gradient measurements, which are typically made using arrays of at least two microphones, or with [[Hot-wire anemometry|hot-wire anemometers]].

===Calibration===
{{Main|Measurement microphone calibration}}

To take a scientific measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in [[volt]]s per [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]). Since this may change over the lifetime of the device, it is necessary to regularly [[Calibration|calibrate]] measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All [[measurement microphone calibration|microphone calibration]] is ultimately traceable to [[primary standard]]s at a national measurement institute such as [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] in the UK, [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]] in Germany and [[NIST]] in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary standard. Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.

Depending on the application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically) and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped (most such microphones come in foam-padded cases to reduce this risk) or exposed to sounds beyond the acceptable level.

== Arrays ==
{{Main|Microphone array}}

A microphone array is any number of microphones operating in [[tandem]]. There are many applications:

*Systems for extracting voice input from [[ambient noise level|ambient noise]] (notably [[telephone]]s, [[speech recognition]] systems, [[hearing aid]]s)
*[[Surround sound]] and related technologies
*Locating objects by sound: [[acoustic source localization]], ''e.g.'', military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire. Aircraft location and tracking.
*[[High fidelity]] original recordings
*3D spatial [[beamforming]] for localized acoustic detection of [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] sounds

Typically, an array is made up of omnidirectional microphones distributed about the [[perimeter]] of a space, linked to a [[computer]] that records and interprets the results into a coherent form.

{{Anchor|Microphone windscreens}}

== Windscreens ==
[[File:Microphone and cover.JPG|thumb|Microphone with its windscreen removed.]]
{{see also|Pop filter}}
'''Windscreens''' (or windshields – the terms are interchangeable) provide a method of reducing the effect of wind on microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.

The shielding material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – is designed to have a significant acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency audio content. This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.

Since all wind noise is generated at the first surface the air hits, the greater the spacing between shield periphery and microphone capsule, the greater the noise attenuation. For an approximately spherical shield, attenuation increases by (approximately) the cube of that distance. Thus larger shields are always much more efficient than smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/files/03_Blasted_Microphones.pdf|title=Blasted microphones|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With full basket windshields there is an additional pressure chamber effect, first explained by Joerg Wuttke,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmebase.pt/Wind.html|title=Joerg Wuttke - Microphones and Wind|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, for two-port (pressure gradient) microphones, allows the shield/microphone combination to act as a high-pass acoustic filter.

Since turbulence at a surface is the source of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rycote.com/microphone-windshield-shock-mount/cyclone/|title=Rycote Cyclone|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the studio and on stage, pop-screens and foam shields can be useful for reasons of hygiene, and protecting microphones from spittle and sweat. They can also be useful coloured idents. On location the basket shield can contain a suspension system to isolate the microphone from shock and handling noise.

Stating the efficiency of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100&amp;nbsp;Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200&amp;nbsp;Hz to ~3&amp;nbsp;kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, even though it has a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10&amp;nbsp;dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50&amp;nbsp;dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.

== What ''type'' of thing is literature? ==
Literature can be described as all of the following:

* [[Communication]] &amp;ndash; activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.
** [[Written communication]] (writing) &amp;ndash; representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system).&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Daniels, "The Study of Writing Systems", in ''The World's Writing Systems'', ed. Bright and Daniels, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subdivision of [[culture]] &amp;ndash; shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-arts the arts].

A '''seating plan''' is a [[diagram]] or a set of written or spoken instructions that determines where people should take their seats. It is widely used on diverse occasions. 

Seating plans have a wide range of purposes. At formal [[dinner]]s, they are usually used to avoid chaos and confusion upon entrance and to follow the [[etiquette]]. In this case, it is customary to arrange the [[Hospitality|host]] and hostess at the opposite sides of the table, and alternate male and female guests throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Oretha D. Swartz|title=Service Etiquette|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1988|isbn=9780870216206|pages=267-278}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Place card]]s can be used to direct guests. [[State dinner]]s have their own protocol and arrangements are made so that the most distinguished guests can have the possibility to engage in conversation. Plans are also made for [[airplanes]], where the objective is to differentiate [[passenger]]s between the various [[Travel class|travel classes]] and ensure everybody has a place. Similarly, [[theatre]]s or [[movie theatre|cinema]]s may allow spectators to choose their seats beforehand. A seating plan is of crucial importance for [[musical ensemble]]s or [[orchestra]]s, where every type of [[Musical instrument|instrument]] is allocated a specific section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching Band &amp; Orchestra: Methods and Materials|author=Lynn G. Cooper|publisher=GIA Publications|year=2004|isbn=9781579992750|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tectoy''' (known as '''Tec Toy''' before late 2007) is a Brazilian toy and electronics company headquartered in [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tectoy.com.br/termos.php|title=Termos de Uso|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Tectoy|language=Portuguese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901064638/http://www.tectoy.com.br/termos.php|archive-date=September 1, 2009|dead-url=yes|access-date=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for producing, publishing, and distributing [[Sega]] consoles and video games in [[Brazil]]. The company was founded by Daniel Dazcal, Leo Kryss, and Abe Kryss in 1987 because Dazcal saw an opportunity to develop a market for electronic toys and video games, product categories that competitors did not sell in Brazil at the time.  The company stock is traded on the [[Bovespa]].  

Soon after its founding, Tectoy completed a licensing agreement with Sega allowing it to market a laser gun game based on the Japanese anime [[Zillion (anime)|''Zillion'']], which sold more units in Brazil than in Japan.  Tectoy would later bring the [[Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] to the region, as well as Sega's later video game consoles and the [[Sega Meganet]] service.  Other products developed by Tectoy include educational toys such as the Pense Bem, karaoke machines, and original Master System and Mega Drive games released exclusively in Brazil, such as ''[[Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau]]'' and Portuguese translations and alternate versions of video games.  Over its history, Tectoy has diversified to include more electronic products, such as [[DVD player|DVD]] and [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray players]] and the [[Zeebo]] console.  While successful at times, the company has also undergone [[debt restructuring]] in 2000 and actions to consolidate its two public stock offerings into one.

Tectoy is credited with the continued success of Sega consoles in Brazil far past their lifetimes worldwide.  At one point, Tectoy held an 80% market share of video games in Brazil.  The Master System and Mega Drive are still produced in Brazil decades after their cancellation in the rest of the world, and Tectoy's consoles continue to rival more modern systems by [[Microsoft]] and [[Sony]] in popularity.

=== Formation and early years (1987-1996) ===
Tectoy was founded in September 1987 by Daniel Dazcal, Leo Kryss, and Abe Kryss.  Dazcal was previously associated with [[Sharp Corporation]] in Brazil, while the Kryss brothers were the owners of Evadin, a Brazilian TV manufacturer associated with [[Mitsubishi]].  The new startup company sought to create "intelligent toys" designed specifically for the Brazilian market.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Szczepaniak|first=John|date=November 2006|title=Company Profile: Tec Toy|url=|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|issue=30|pages=50–53|doi=|issn=1742-3155|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Brazil's most dominant toy manufacturer was [[Estrela (company)|Estrela]], which held 55% of the market share but did not have any interest in electronics.  This gave Dazcal an area to focus the new company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In order to give the company an advantage in marketing costs, Tectoy set its factory in the [[Free Economic Zone of Manaus]] to leverage tax incentives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the primary goals of the founders of the company was to enter the video game market.  Relying on individual previous experiences in working with Japanese companies, Tectoy executives reached out to [[Sega]], which initially showed reluctance to partner with Tectoy given the failure of [[Tonka]] in merchandising Sega products in the United States.  The company slowly built trust with Sega and was ultimately granted total liberty to manage Sega products in the Brazilian market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The first Sega product released by Tectoy was the ''Zillion'' infrared [[laser tag]] gun, based on the phaser featured in [[Zillion (anime)|the anime of the same name]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The success of ''Zillion'' led Sega to have Tectoy distribute its 8-bit video game console, the [[Master System]], in Brazil as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Launched officially in Brazil in September 1989, the Master System achieved success.&lt;ref name="brasil_lancamento"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jogos.uol.com.br/playstation3/ultnot/2009/09/04/ult530u7180.jhtm|title=Master System completa 20 anos de vida no Brasil|last=|first=|date=September 4, 2009|website=[[Universo Online]]|publisher=[[Grupo Folha]]|language=Portuguese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227035251/http://jogos.uol.com.br/playstation3/ultnot/2009/09/04/ult530u7180.jhtm|archivedate=February 27, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 21, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tectoy's revenue in 1989 was [[Brazilian cruzado|Cz$]]66 million,&lt;ref name="brasil_lucro"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://acervo.estadao.com.br/publicados/1989/12/20/g/19891220-35228-nac-0046-eco-10-not-skhwggs.jpg|title=Tec Toy ultrapassa suas metas|last=Aguiar|first=Isabel Dias de|date=December 20, 1989|newspaper=[[O Estado de S.Paulo]]|access-date=|publisher=Grupo Estado|issue=35228|location=São Paulo|volume=110|page=46|language=Portuguese|issn=1516-2931|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192502/http://acervo.estadao.com.br/publicados/1989/12/20/g/19891220-35228-nac-0046-eco-10-not-skhwggs.jpg|archive-date=March 3, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which Cz$40 million was attributed to the  console.

In May 2007, Fernando Fischer became the company's president.  He promised to reverse the R$3 million loss from the previous year, and increase revenue by R$45 million.&lt;ref name="fischer_2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/informatica/ult124u377555.shtml|title=Tectoy faz parceria com a Qualcomm|date=March 1, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2014|website=Folha de S.

Tectoy set forth four business areas of focus in the digital entertainment field: video games, DVDs, digital TV receivers, and toys.

=== Further diversification and stock actions (2010-present) ===
For a short time starting in November 2010, Tectoy produced and marketed 14-inch tube TVs with 12 games included in memory.  This production came at a time when LCD and plasma screen manufacturers accounted for 70% of production in the Free Economic Zone of Manaus.&lt;ref name="tv_tubo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/41584_A+TELINHA+DA+TECTOY|website=IstoÉ Dinheiro|first=Ralphe|last=Manzoni Jr|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=February 28, 2014|title=A telinha da Tectoy|language=Portuguese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310050702/http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/41584_A+TELINHA+DA+TECTOY|archivedate=March 10, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faced with the success of outsourced [[set-top box]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;es for the South Korean company Humax, which produced them for Sky, Tectoy executives saw the possibility of using the company's factory in Manaus for third-party products.  This, the company reasoned, would be especially helpful to those who wanted to enter the Brazilian market without investing in their own structure.  Tectoy's workforce rose from 200 to 400 employees as a result of the partnership with Humax,&lt;ref name="humax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valor.com.br/arquivo/863743/tectoy-investe-em-producao-terceirizada|first=Moacir|last=Drska|website=Valor Econômico|date=December 20, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2014|title=Tectoy investe em produção terceirizada|language=Portuguese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311122220/http://www.valor.com.br/arquivo/863743/tectoy-investe-em-producao-terceirizada|archivedate=March 11, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began on December 16, 2010.&lt;ref name="breve_historico" /&gt;  The company's partnership with Humax ended in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;ref name="financas_2013_2"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 25, 2014|archivedate=February 26, 2014|url=http://institucional.tectoy.com.br/_arq/53_Arq10.pdf|publisher=Tec Toy S/A|format=PDF|date=September 30, 2013|title=ITR - Informações Trimestrais|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NfAZ0Xlj?url=http://www.tectoy.com.br/_arq/53_Arq10.pdf|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of higher revenues obtained in early 2011, Tectoy attempted to auction preferred and common shares.  While the company expected to gain R$9.6 million from the sale, a lack of market interest prevented the sale from happening.&lt;ref name="acoes_1"/&gt;  Tectoy continued to invest in new categories and licensing in digital electronics.  Tablets were a major part of the company's revenue in 2013, accounting for 37% of revenue between January and September, with the expectation of surpassing DVD players and becoming their main product category.  In 2012, Tectoy licensed [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters to launch a new product, the Magic Tablet.&lt;ref name="acoes_3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/107304_INSISTO+LOGO+EXISTO|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=February 25, 2014|title=Insisto, logo existo|website=IstoÉ Dinheiro|first=João|last=Varella|language=Portuguese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310050659/http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/107304_INSISTO+LOGO+EXISTO|archivedate=March 10, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's shares were grouped in 2015.  Tectoy was forced to carry out the procedure after actions of [[B3 (stock exchange)|BM&amp;F Bovespa]] against [[penny stock]]s.&lt;ref name="acoes_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/140325_BARRADOS+NO+BAILE|website=IstoÉ Dinheiro|title=Barrados no baile|first=Natália|last=Flach|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014|language=Portuguese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306220653/http://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/noticias/140325_BARRADOS+NO+BAILE|archivedate=March 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strategy of the company has been betting on [[nostalgia]] to bring back consoles that were sold in the 1980s and 1990s. In March 2017, Tectoy released the Atari Flashback 7, a version of the [[Atari 2600]], with 101 games in memory but without support to insert game cartridges.&lt;ref name="atari_relanc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.ign.com/atari-2600/46672/news/relancamento-do-atari-2600-chega-ao-brasil-nesta-quarta-feir|title=Relançamento do Atari 2600 chega ao Brasil nesta quarta-feira|last=Penilhas|first=Bruna|date=March 22, 2017|website=IGN Brasil|publisher=Ziff Davis|language=Portuguese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418090537/http://br.ign.com/atari-2600/46672/news/relancamento-do-atari-2600-chega-ao-brasil-nesta-quarta-feir|archivedate=April 18, 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=April 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, by June of the same year, it was planned to relaunch the Mega Drive, with some additional features such as a [[Secure Digital|microSD card]] slot.&lt;ref name="mega_drive_relanc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.ign.com/brasil/41752/news/tectoy-anuncia-relancamento-do-mega-drive-no-brasil|website=IGN Brasil|last=Lucca|first=Matheus de|title=Tectoy anuncia relançamento do Mega Drive no Brasil|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017|language=Portuguese|publisher=Ziff Davis|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418090406/http://br.ign.com/brasil/41752/news/tectoy-anuncia-relancamento-do-mega-drive-no-brasil|archivedate=April 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the end of 2015, Tectoy was still selling the Master System continuously since 1989.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://za.ign.com/ps4/64636/feature/the-5-longest-console-lifespans|title=The 5 longest console lifespans|last=Fick|first=Matthew|date=|website=IGN Africa|publisher=Ziff Davis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106145422/http://za.ign.com/ps4/64636/feature/the-5-longest-console-lifespans|archivedate=November 6, 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 30, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the Master System had sold 8 million units in Brazil.&lt;ref name="MDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jogos.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/2016/05/12/console-em-producao-ha-mais-tempo-master-system-ja-vendeu-8-mi-no-brasil.htm|title=Console em produção há mais tempo, Master System já vendeu 8 mi no Brasil|last=Azevedo|first=Théo|date=May 12, 2016|website=[[Universo Online]]|publisher=[[Grupo Folha]]|language=Portuguese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514115923/http://jogos.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/2016/05/12/console-em-producao-ha-mais-tempo-master-system-ja-vendeu-8-mi-no-brasil.htm|archivedate=May 14, 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=May 13, 2016|quote=Comercializado no Brasil desde setembro de 1989, o saudoso Master System já vendeu mais de 8 milhões de unidades no país, segundo a Tectoy.|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tectoy is known for their handling and distribution of Sega consoles in Brazil.  The company has sold all of Sega's consoles since 1987, including the Master System, Mega Drive, [[32X]], [[Sega CD]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Game Gear,&lt;ref name="brasil_gboygear" /&gt; Saturn,&lt;ref name="saturn" /&gt; [[Sega Pico]], and Dreamcast, in addition to the ''Zillion'' laser tag gun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because Tectoy continued to produce the Master System and Mega Drive years after its cancellation, the Master System is considered the longest-lived console in the [[History of video games|history of video game consoles]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The company also introduced the [[Sega Meganet]] service to Brazil in 1995, starting with a focus on e-mail but later expanding to online multiplayer and chat by 1996,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as partnering with Brazilian bank [[Banco Bradesco|Bradesco]] to develop a banking system, similar to Japan's connection with Nagoya Bank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As of 2015, the Master System and Mega Drive combined sell around 150,000 a year.

In 2006, Tectoy released the Master System 3 Collection and the Mega Drive 3, including 120 and 71 built-in games, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Tectoy has received and considered requests to remake the original Master System.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1990s, Tectoy translated several games published by Sega into Portuguese.

Some examples of this include: ''[[Teddy Boy (video game)|Teddy Boy]]'' became ''Geraldinho'', certain ''[[Wonder Boy]]'' titles became ''[[Monica's Gang]]'' games, and ''[[Ghost House (video game)|Ghost House]]'' became ''Chapolim vs. Dracula: Um Duelo Assutador'', based on Mexican TV series ''[[El Chapulín Colorado]]''.  Additionally, Tectoy ported games for their Sega systems, such as ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' for the Master System and ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' for the Mega Drive,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as various games ported from the Game Gear to the more popular Master System.  Aside from porting, the company developed ''[[Férias Frustradas do Pica-Pau]]'' after finding out that ''[[Woody Woodpecker]]'' was the most popular cartoon on Brazilian television.  These titles were developed in-house by Tectoy in Brazil.  Tectoy also suggested the development of ''[[Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II]]'', a project that Sega accepted but would be the only suggestion from Tectoy that Sega approved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  More recently, Tectoy created two Mega Drive games based on ''Show do Milhão'', a Brazilian game show based on the ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' format,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fim_concordata" /&gt; and ''Mega Drive 4 Guitar Idol'', a 16-bit rhythm video game based on ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' with its own guitar peripheral.  Tectoy had been granted a master license by Sega for all of their games, including those developed in Europe or America, and had permission to sell any game by Sega in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aside from its work with Sega, Tectoy has developed and sold karaoke machines,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; set-top boxes,&lt;ref name="humax" /&gt; televisions pre-installed with games,&lt;ref name="tv_tubo" /&gt; mobile games,&lt;ref name="level_up" /&gt; DVD players,&lt;ref name="fim_concordata" /&gt; Blu-ray players,&lt;ref name="blu-ray" /&gt; a mobile TV receiver,&lt;ref name="tv_toy" /&gt; the Nabaztag music player,&lt;ref name="fogo" /&gt; and the Zeebo video game console.&lt;ref name="zeebo_data_od" /&gt;  Tectoy also distributed [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] games in Brazil such as [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|''Blade Runner'']], [[StarCraft (video game)|''StarCraft'']], and [[Daytona USA (video game)|''Daytona USA'']].

'''''The Falls''''' is a 1980 film directed by [[Peter Greenaway]]. It was Greenaway's first feature-length film after many years making shorts. It does not have a traditional dramatic narrative; it takes the form of a [[mockumentary|mock documentary]] in 92 short parts.

==Plot==
The world has been struck by a mysterious incident called the "Violent Unknown Event" or VUE, which has killed many people and left a great many survivors suffering from a common set of symptoms: mysterious ailments (some appearing to be mutations of evolving into a bird-like form), dreaming of water (categorised by form, such as Category 1, Flight, or Category 3, Waves) and becoming obsessed with birds and flight. Many of the survivors have been gifted with [[fictional language|new languages]].  They have also stopped aging, making them immortal (barring disease or injury).

A directory of these survivors has been compiled, and ''The Falls'' is presented as a film version of an excerpt from that directory, corresponding to the 92 entries for persons whose surnames begin with the letters FALL-. Not all of the 92 entries correspond to a person – some correspond to deleted entries, cross references and other oddities of the administrative process that has produced the directory. One biography concerns two people – the twin brothers Ipson and Pulat Fallari, who are played (in still photographs) by the [[Brothers Quay]].

In addition to the common VUE symptoms mentioned above, a number of themes run through the film. Among these are references to a number of bureaucratic organisations including the VUE Commission and the Bird Facilities Industries (a parody of the [[British Film Institute]] which produced the film), the [[List of years in aviation|history of manned flight]] from [[Daedalus]] with the suggestion that birds may be responsible for the VUE (and that the film may thus be seen as a sequel to Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''), complex debates over the location of the epicentre of the VUE, and repeated references to [[Tulse Luper]]. Luper is a recurring off-stage character in Greenaway's early films, and would eventually appear on film in the epic series ''[[The Tulse Luper Suitcases]]'' (2003 onwards), which is itself named in ''The Falls''.

''The Falls'' includes clips of a number of Greenaway's early shorts. It also anticipates some of his later films: the subject of biography 27, Propine Fallax, is a pseudonym for Cissie Colpitts, the central figure of ''[[Drowning by Numbers]]'' (1988), while the car accident in biography 28 prefigures that in ''[[A Zed and Two Noughts]]'' (1985).

The largely formal and deadpan manner of the narration contrasts with the absurdity of the content.

==Characters==
Two example biographies follow.

Bwythan Fallbutus is the 42nd victim of the Violent Unknown Event listed in the VUE directory. Bwythan Fallbutus was Betheda Fallbutus' eldest son. He was the officially-appointed VUE Commission's linguistic expert. He lived just off the Goldhawk Road within a three-minute walking distance of his mother, whom he visited every day. The VUE had given Bwythan a bone-marrow deficiency, wattles and cobs along his backbone, and a foot disease that shredded his toe-nails. He could drink salt water without harm but felt listless and debilitated away from the influence of [[chlorophyll]], which is why there were always several plantpots in his office, and even on his desk. Bwythan could speak fourteen VUE languages and interpret successfully in nine of them at a diplomatic level. It was Bwythan who had organised the examination of Agropio Fallaver, the sole speaker of the language named after him. Although Bwythan had come to the private opinion that Fallaver was somehow a fake manoeuvred by FOX, the Society for Ornithological Extermination. Bwythan has privately researched the ten-thousand most popularly used words in forty-three of the main VUE languages and has produced a comparative dictionary. From this research he wrote a book, ''View from [[Babylon|Babel]], to explain, or attempt to explain the gift of tongues and the fragmentation of language''. In trying to do this, and in his associated search for a common linguistic denominator, he successfully demonstrated that the names of birds were important key words. It was rumoured that it was because of the conclusions of his research that Bwythan was run down by a white van, registration number NID 92, on a zebra crossing in the [[Goldhawk Road tube station|Goldhawk Road]]. A van with the same registration had been seen outside Bwythan's house an hour before the accident. The police later found the vehicle responsible on a deserted airfield. It was supposed that the assailant, or assailants, had escaped by air.

Catch-Hanger Fallcaster is one of the victims of the Violent Unknown Event listed in the VUE directory. Her biography, number 49 in the movie, is one amidst several interrelated biographies concerning different members of the Fallcaster family. Catch-Hanger Fallcaster had been a teacher. She had taught Russian to [[Germany|Germans]]. And certainly before the VUE, she would never have admitted to a great knowledge of [[ornithology]]. The VUE had made Catch-Hanger three inches taller, paralysed her index fingers and improved her eyesight. She now taught Abcadefghan to anyone who wanted to learn. Catch-Hanger has translated [[Tulse Luper]]'s ''Some Birds of the Northern Hemisphere'', establishing a definitive pronunciation of the Abcadefghan equivalents for the [[Falconidae]]. She has also started work on an Abcadefghan-English language primer that is based substantially on the three [[children's song|nursery rhymes]], "Goosey, Goosey, Gander," "Who Killed Cock-Robin?," and "I Shot a Little Duck."

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack is mainly by [[Michael Nyman]] and is partly based, like his later music for ''Drowning by Numbers'', on the slow movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra K. 364]]''.  It also includes numerous clips from various songs popular among the avant-garde of the time, including pieces by [[Brian Eno]] (in particular "Golden Hours" from [[Another Green World]]) and snippets of "Jugband Blues", the last song [[Syd Barrett]] recorded with [[Pink Floyd]].

==Languages==
[[fictional language|Languages]] the survivors have been gifted with include:

*Abcadefghan
**Abcadefghan is often used in the preparation of papers on engineering, [[metallurgy]] and radiophonics. It is suggested that [[Sami people|Sami]] and [[Finnish people|Finns]] can understand Abcadefghan, which would make Abcadefghan a [[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-Samic language]] but, in itself, is not that scientifically valuable since there aren't that many technical-papers in these languages. Research is required to determine the extent to which Abcadefghan is derived from or related to [[Abecedarian]]. (Curiously enough, Abecedarian is never mentioned as a VUE language in the movie). In the movie story, the language is taught by Catch-Hanger Fallcaster to ''"anyone who wanted to learn".'' She is said to have translated [[Tulse Luper]]'s ''Some Birds of the Northern Hemisphere'' into Abcadefghan. The name of the language, taking the first ordered letters of the alphabet as its root, seems to have been logically inspired by its technical, industrial nature. In fact, the language actually spoken here is [[Estonian language|Estonian]].

'''''The Last Warning''''' is a 1928 American [[Mystery fiction|mystery film]] directed by [[Paul Leni]], and starring [[Laura La Plante]], [[Montagu Love]], and [[Margaret Livingston]]. Its plot follows a New York producer's attempt to re-stage a play five years after one of the original cast members was murdered in the theater. The film is based on the 1922  [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[melodrama]] of the same name by Thomas F. Fallon, which in turn was based on the story ''House of Fear'' by Wadsworth Camp, the father of the writer [[Madeleine L'Engle]].

Conceived as a followup to Leni's wildly successful 1927 production ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (also starring La Plante), the film was produced by [[Universal Pictures]] under [[Carl Laemmle]]. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles in the summer of 1928 on sets recycled from Univeral's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). It premiered on [[Christmas Day]] 1928 before expanding in January 1929, and was released as both a part-[[sound film|sound]] as well as a [[silent film]]; the silent version is the only known extant version.{{sfn|McCaffrey| 1999|p=172}} It was the final film directed by Leni before his death from [[blood poisoning]] on September 2, 1929.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt;

Response by critics to ''The Last Warning'' varied, with many praising its performances and cinematography, though several commented on its incoherent plot, and others criticized its integration of sound, feeling it presented optimally as a silent film. In 2016, Universal Pictures selected the film for [[Film preservation|restoration]], using elements from two different prints owned by the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] and the [[Cinémathèque Française]].

==Plot==
[[File:The Last Warning (1929).ogg|thumb|left|thumbtime=14:59|upright=1|''The Last Warning'']]
In a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of a play entitled ''The Snare'', one of the actors, John Woodford, inexplicably dies during a stage performance, and his body disappears. Few clues exist as to what caused his death, aside from several drops of liquid found that resembled [[chloroform]]. Rumors of a [[love triangle]] between Woodford and two cast members circulate as a possible motive for his death.

Five years after the theater's closure, producer Mike Brody decides to solve the mystery by again staging the play with the remaining cast and re-enacting Woodford's murder. During rehearsals in the abandoned theater, strange occurrences plague the cast, including ominous noises, falling scenery, and an unexplained fire. Doris, the lead actress, has her purse stolen from her dressing room by an unseen assailant; Josiah Bunce, the [[Stage management|stage manager]], reportedly receives a telegram warning him to drop out of the play, signed by John Woodford, and the theater's new owner, Arthur McHugh, also receives a visit from Woodford's ghost. 

The production continues, and during the final rehearsal, Harvey Carleton inexplicably disappears from the stage during a blackout. Doris spots a mysterious masked figure in a theater box in addition to a man resembling John Woodford, but both disappear. Behind a picture hanging on the stage, a lever is discovered which opens a trap door, where the cast find Harvey incoherent. Arthur and Richard Quayle, another cast member, venture inside, where they discover a tunnel that leads to Doris's dressing room. 

Arthur has police officers appointed at the theater for the show's opening the following night. During the performance, an electrical wire charged to 400 volts is discovered connected to a [[candlestick]] onstage, and Arthur lunges at Richard to prevent him from touching it during the final scene. The unseen masked assailant is discovered hiding inside a [[grandfather clock]] onstage, but he drops through a trap door in the floor just after shooting one of the police officers. The assailant scales the theater and throws a [[Mannequin|dummy]] resembling John Woodford onto the stage. He then begins swinging from a rope, but is brought back down by a stagehand who cuts it.

The masked assailant is discovered to be Josiah, who caused Woodford's death via [[electrocution]] and had been behind the "hauntings" to prevent the theater from being used.

==Production==
===Screenplay and filming===
The film was envisioned as a companion piece to director Leni's earlier ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'', due to that film's great popularity. Universal assigned Leni to the project under the assumption that his previous success would yield significant box-office results.{{sfn|Soister|Nicolella|Joyce|2014|p=311}} It is based on the 1922 play of the same name by Thomas F. Fallon,{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=47}} which ran for 238 performances from October 24, 1922, until May 1923 at the [[Klaw Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Playbill]]|title=''The Last Warning'' at the Klaw Theatre|url=http://www.playbill.com/production/the-last-warning-klaw-theatre-vault-0000006318|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120011532/http://www.playbill.com/production/the-last-warning-klaw-theatre-vault-0000006318|archive-date=November 20, 2018|publisher=TotalTheater|issn=0551-0678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fallon's play was in turn based on the story ''House of Fear'' by Wadsworth Camp, the father of writer [[Madeleine L'Engle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/07/AR2007090702690.html?noredirect=on|title=Writer Madeleine L'Engle, 88; Author of 'A Wrinkle in Time'|date=September 8, 2007|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|archive-url=http://archive.is/OxrGU|archive-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Principal photography]] began in August 1928.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=18}} The theater set used in the film had originally been used in the 1925 ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' starring Lon Chaney,&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.silentfilm.org/eventinfo/the-last-warning-festival-2016 | title = The Last Warning | last = Atkinson | first =Michael | website = SilentFilm.org| publisher=San Francisco Silent Film Festival| dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117063419/http://www.silentfilm.org/eventinfo/the-last-warning-festival-2016|archive-date=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Daily News]]|last=Shaffer|first=George|location=New York City|title='Phantom of Opera' Sets Dug Up for New Spook Film|date=June 26, 1928|p=30|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25545116/daily_news/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was located in [[Universal City, California]].{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=44}}  

===Casting===
Actress Laura La Plante, a former-teenage actress who had previously starred in Leni's ''The Cat and the Canary'', was given top-billing in her role as Doris Terry, though her part in the film  is considerably less involved than in the former.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=29}} Film historian John Soister characterizes La Plante's role as that of an [[ingénue]],{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=20}} consisting primarily of reactions to "assorted assaults, visions, and set-ups."{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=29}} The film marked La Plante's first talking picture.&lt;ref name=hartford/&gt; British actor Montagu Love was cast opposite La Plante, receiving second-billing. Soister notes that Love was "cast against type" for his role, that of "no-nonsense" theater owner Arthur McHugh.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=29}} 

Margaret Livingston, an actress who had also begun her career as a teenager, was cast in the role of actress Evalynda Hendon; her performance in the film helped earn her a role in Universal's ''The Charlatan'', released later that year.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=30}} In the role of Richard Quayle, Leni cast actor [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]], who subsequently had a minor part in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931).{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=32}} [[Bert Roach]] was cast as Mike Brody, the producer who re-stages the play in the film.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=32}} Barbara, an elderly [[character actor|character actress]] who starred in the original play in which Woodford was murdered, is portrayed by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] actress Carrie Daumery.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=22}} This was Daumery's only film credit from the silent era, and her role is likened by Soister and others to that of Flora Finch in ''The Cat and the Canary'', but stripped of any comedic tone.{{sfn|Soister|Nicolella|Joyce|2014|p=312}}

==Release==
According to the [[American Film Institute]],&lt;ref name=AFI/&gt; ''The Last Warning'' had its theatrical debut in New York City on January 6, 1929.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=33}} However, special advance screenings occurred on [[Christmas Day]] 1928 in several U.S. cities, including [[Chillicothe, Missouri]],&lt;ref name=christmas&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune]]|location=Chillicothe, Missouri|title=The Last Warning|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25542418/the_chillicothe_constitutiontribune/|via=Newspapers.com|p=3|date=December 18, 1928}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manhattan, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Manhattan Mercury]]|location=Manhattan, Kansas|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25542745/the_manhattan_mercury/|via=Newspapers.com|title=Wareham Theater Program|date=December 17, 1928|p=2|quote="Christmas Special: "The Last Warning" with Laura La Plante}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was marketed as a successor to producer Leni's previous film ''The Cat and the Canary'', attributed to producer Laemmle's "discriminating supervision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|location=Detroit, Michigan|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25542547/detroit_free_press/|title=Carl Laemmle, Jr., Earns Signal Promotion For One of his Years|via=Newspapers.com|date=December 23, 1928|p=43}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered one of the last [[Silent film|silent films]] produced by [[Universal Studios]], but it was also released in a "part-talkie" [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] version with a brief minute or two of [[Sound film|synch-sound]] footage added, as well as screams, cries, and other sound effects.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Register-Guard]]|location=Eugene, Oregon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25545228/the_eugene_guard/|p=5|date=January 5, 1929|via=Newspapers.com|title=Association Show Booked; 'Last Warning' Coming}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scenes have since been lost.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt; Few prints of the film exist in the United States: One is owned by the [[George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection]] in [[Rochester, New York]], which was originally owned by the [[Cinémathèque Française]], and is slightly edited and entirely silent with [[French language|French]] intertitles.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=18}} 

===Restoration===
In 2016, the film underwent [[Digital photograph restoration|digital]] [[Film preservation|restoration]] by Universal Pictures, sourced from both the Cinémathèque Française print, as well as a print featuring the original English title cards owned by the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] Collection of the [[UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive]].&lt;ref name=PR/&gt; The restored print was screened at the [[Castro Theatre]] as part of the [[San Francisco Silent Film Festival]] on June 4, 2016.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-pictures-restores-silent-film-the-last-warning-honoring-the-studios-rich-history-and-cultural-legacy-300278957.html|work=[[PR Newswire]]|title=Universal Pictures restores silent film, The Last Warning, Honoring the Studio's rich history and cultural legacy|date=June 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716205229/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-pictures-restores-silent-film-the-last-warning-honoring-the-studios-rich-history-and-cultural-legacy-300278957.html|archive-date=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was again screened in September 2016 at Cinecon Classic Film Festival in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive]]|publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]]|url=https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archival-spaces/2016/09/30/cinecon-52|date=September 30, 2016|title=Cinecon 52|last=Horak|first=Jan-Christopher|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120020707/https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archival-spaces/2016/09/30/cinecon-52|archive-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
===Contemporaneous===
Though it re-teamed Leni with ''The Cat and the Canary'' star Laura La Plante and features a similar style, ''The Last Warning'' lacks the supernatural elements of ''The Cat and the Canary'' and is therefore usually considered in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] genre rather than the [[Horror film|horror]] genre&lt;ref name = "Atkinson"/&gt;; some historians, however, have classed it as a horror film.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=20}} Elements of comedy present in Leni's ''The Cat and the Canary'' are also absent from the film.{{sfn|Petrie|2002|p=189}} Extant published reviews of the film were varied.{{sfn|Soister|2001|p=32}}{{sfn|Petrie|2002|p=189}}

Mordaunt Hall of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted the film contained "some finely directed passages," but that it was "not especially disturbing."&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|title=THE SCREEN; A Nonchalant Sleuth.

The majority of the criticism surrounding the film had to do with its integration of sound.{{sfn|Petrie|2002|p=189}} Irene Thirer of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', who felt the film "should never have been a talkie," elaborating that the dialogue episodes "retard the action" and "are not well done."&lt;ref name=thirer&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Daily News]]|location=New York City|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25541536/daily_news/|title="The Last Warning" Fine Mystery Stuff|date=January 6, 1929|via=Newspapers.com|last=Thirer|first=Irene}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Montana Standard]]'' noted that the film "presents many thrills" and was widely enjoyed by the audiences at the film's premiere in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Montana Standard]]|title=Audience Enjoys Mystery Picture|location=Butte, Montana|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25542055/the_montana_standard/|via=Newspapers.com|date=December 15, 1929}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critic of the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' alternately felt that, "as a talking picture, the film retains all the chill values of the play, with its eerie noises, screams, fright-fraught dialogue and general noise and excitement," but conceded that "it decidedly is not the scary kind of mystery play that the average person would find too startling."&lt;ref name=hartford&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|location=Hartford, Connecticut|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25542256/hartford_courant/|title=Stage and Screen|date=January 24, 1929|p=13|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sid Silverman, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', noted the use of sound effects as "multiple, continuous, and in detail," and that the film included "enough screams to stimulate the average film mob into sticking through it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverman|first=Sid|title=The Last Warning|page=44|date= January 9, 1929|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall also criticized the film's utilization of sound, writing: "There are too many outbursts of shrieking, merely to prove the effect of the audible screen, to cause any spine-chilling among those watching this production."&lt;ref name=hall/&gt; 

The ''[[Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune]]'' noted that ''The Last Warning'' "the most thrilling mystery film released this season,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune]]|location=Chillicothe, Missouri|date=February 23, 1929|p=4|title="The Last Warning" A Chilling Mystery Thriller|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25541911/the_chillicothe_constitutiontribune/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Billings Gazette]]'' deemed it "the greatest mystery picture ever filmed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Billings Gazette]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/25542178/the_billings_gazette/|via=Newspapers.com|location=Billings, Montana|title=Fannie Brice in "My Man"|date=March 17, 1929|p=7}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Photoplay]]'' was less laudatory, noting: "This could have been a gorgeous mystery story, but it's an obvious cross between ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[The Terror (1928 film)|The Terror]]'', with none of their consistency or power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|work=[[Photoplay]]|title=The Last Warning – Universal|p=76|date=February 1929|url=https://archive.org/details/photoplay3536movi/page/n207|issn=0732-538X|publisher=[[Macfadden Communications Group|Macfadden Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrospective===
In a retrospective assessment, author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, commending its camerawork and direction, but criticizing the film's story as "silly."{{sfn|Maltin|Green|Edelman|2010|p=365}} Commenting on the finale, film historian [[Graham Petrie]] notes that Leni and cinematographer [[Hal Mohr]] "handle the camera with the utmost possible freedom, culminating in a scene in which the camera swings on a rope with the villian from one part of the theater to another. Along the way, Leni revels in the shadows, cobwebs, [[Dutch angle|tilted angles]], subtly distorted perspectives, ominously confined spaces, and clutching hands that had by now become his trademark."{{sfn|Petrie|2002|p=215}} Petrie, who classifies the film as a [[thriller film|thriller]] rather than a mystery, emphasizes that its stylistic and visual elements supersede narrative plausibility and characterization.{{sfn|Petrie|2002|pages=215–216}}

'''The Society of M.I.C.E.''' is a charitable organisation based in [[Kingston upon Hull]]. It was founded in 1961, by a group of dedicated [[entertainment|entertainers]] working on an idea proposed by Al Gillyon. The society is modelled on the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]]. Its membership is exclusively of men, although the members wives, partners and friends often help out in varying capacities. MICE is an [[acronym]] for '''"Men in Charitable Endeavour"'''.

==The beginning==
In 1960, Al Gillyon proposed the setting up of an organisation in Kingston upon Hull similar to the Grand Order of Water Rats. The idea was talked about in clubs, at shows, even in people's front rooms after a show. But, in the words of Al Gillyon, "We cannot hold a first meeting until permission has been obtained from the Variety Artist Association" of which all were loyal members. Permission of the association was granted and the first ever meeting To which hirteen entertainers were invited, was held at the Windmill Hotel, Witham, Kingston upon Hull on 13 February 1961. Ten were able to attend. Officers were elected, it was agreed that the aims of the group,  '''''[[Fellow]]ship''''', '''''Benevolence''''' and '''''[[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]''''' should be paramount and the group should be known as "The Society of MICE".

===The Offices of the Society===
[[Image:Terry Matsell 1.jpg|thumb|175px|Terry Matsell, one of the founder members, and the first SCRIBE MOUSE]]

The Society has the usual [[committee]] structure, with a President and Vice-president elected annually, chosen singly by the outgoing President and announced at the annual dinner, which is held in Mid February. There are also positions for chairman, Secretary, Treasurer and the Steward to the [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]]. The only difference is the title of these positions, all of which are extremely fitting:-

*President = '''KING MOUSE''' 
*Vice-President = '''PRINCE MOUSE''' 
*Chairman = '''TRAP GUARD''' 
*Secretary = '''SCRIBE MOUSE''' 
*Treasurer = '''KEEPER OF THE CHEESE''' 
*Steward to the Elders = '''PILOT MOUSE'''

There are other positions within the society, including the '''CONCERT MOUSE''', who organises the concerts.

===Founder Members===

The following:

*Al Gillyon 
*Harry Hemingway 
*Clive Hunter 
*Terry Matsell 
*Jimmy Welsh 
*Jack Wilkinson
*Brian Winchester

are considered to be the founder members of the society as they were either present at the very first meeting of the society, or offered their apologies for absence. From these members, the first KING MOUSE was Al Gillyon, the first PRINCE MOUSE was Jack Wilkinson, the first SCRIBE MOUSE was Terry Matsell, and the first TRAP GUARD was Jimmy Welsh, who at the time was also the Vice-Chairman of the Variety Artists Association.

==Today==
The Society is currently made up of Singers &amp; [[Entertainment|Entertainers]], mainly from the [[Kingston upon Hull]] area, along with many other members who perform equally as important roles behind the scenes. Members of the 'Old Flames' (Retired members of [[Humberside]] fire brigade) have also joined the society" and [[Stars in Their Eyes]]" champion [[Ian Moor]] is a member and former holder of the office of Prince Mouse.

The Society's aim is to raise funds for local good causes and charities, by means of live concert shows and other fund raising events. The society holds [[raffle|tombola]] &amp; [[raffle]] stalls at various outdoor events throughout the summer and concerts are usually twice monthly in and around the [[Kingston upon Hull]] area. Venues vary from clubs to residential homes. It holds meetings every fortnight, to discuss future concerts and other matters regarding fund raising for the community. The meeting venue has changed several times over the years, and is referred to by members as the '''MOUSE HOLE'''.

In 1996, the society added an extra act to the concerts, in the form of a [[choir]], made up of several of the society's members. Initially called "The Bolder Boys", named after Harry Bolder, who conducted the choir in its early years and whose idea it was to form the choir, today it is known as "The MICE Singers". As well as regular appearances at the society's concerts, they perform at many other venues, and are now in great demand throughout the year, with appearances at [[weddings]], residential homes, [[harvest festival]]s, [[schools]], and other events.

===Anthem===
The Society has an anthem, with [[lyrics]] written by one of the founder members, Clive Hunter, who adapted the words to the tune of [[Three Blind Mice]]. The anthem is sung at all concerts, and at the annual dinner by all the members present.

===The King's Special Project===
Each year the elected King Mouse nominates a charity or organisation to be the prime beneficiary of the years fundraising efforts and specific concerts and events are chosen to raise funds solely for this purpose. A [[cheque]] for the grand total raised is then presented to a representative from the charity or organisation at the annual "Special Presentation Evening", which is held at the end of January, shortly before the annual dinner.

{{Culture of Turkey}}
The '''[[theatre]] of [[Turkey]]''' encompasses the traditional theatre practice of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period and the modern Turkish theatre. In Turkey, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the general directorate of [[Turkish State Theatres]] or Istanbul Municipality Theatre.

==History==
The [[Darülbedayi]] was an Ottoman imperial theatre established in Istanbul in 1914 and run by the actor [[Muhsin Ertuğrul]].&lt;ref&gt;The Turkish muse: views &amp; reviews, 1960s-1990s - Page 252 Talât Sait Halman, Jayne L. Warner - 2006 "His emphasis is less on the artistic evolution of the Darulbedayi than on its organizational and structural growth. To a large extent, the history of this remarkable repertory theater is dominated by Muhsin Ertugrul as artistic director, actor, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tivoli Gardens''' (or simply '''Tivoli''') is an [[amusement park]] and [[pleasure garden]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The park opened on 15 August 1843 and is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top attractions in Denmark|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/guide/denmarks-most-visited-attractions|website=visitdenmark.com|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Dyrehavsbakken]] in nearby [[Klampenborg]], also in Denmark.

With 4.6&amp;nbsp;million visitors in 2017,&lt;ref name="tivoligardens.com"/&gt; Tivoli is the second-most popular seasonal amusement park in the world after [[Europa-Park]]. Tivoli is the most-visited theme park in [[Scandinavia]], and the fifth most-visited theme park in Europe, only behind [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]], [[Europa-Park]], [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] and [[Efteling]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The amusement park was first called "Tivoli &amp; Vauxhall";&lt;ref name="copenhagenet1"&gt;[http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-tivoli.asp Tivoli – Tivoli Gardens Copenhagen – Copenhagen Portal – Tourist Guide]. Copenhagenet.dk. Retrieved on 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "Tivoli" alluding to the [[Jardin de Tivoli, Paris|Jardin de Tivoli]] in Paris (which in its turn had been named from [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] near [[Rome]], [[Italy]]),"Vauxhall" alluding to the [[Vauxhall Gardens]] in London. It is also mentioned in various books, like ''Number the Stars'' by Lois Lowry.

Tivoli's founder, [[Georg Carstensen]] (b. 1812 – d. 1857), obtained a five-year charter to create Tivoli by telling [[King Christian VIII]] that "when the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics". The monarch granted Carstensen use of roughly 15 acres (61,000 m²) of the fortified [[glacis]] outside Vesterport (the West Gate) for an annual rent. Therefore, until the 1850s, Tivoli was outside the city, accessible through Vesterport.

From the very start, Tivoli included a variety of attractions: buildings in the exotic style of an imaginary Orient: a theatre, band stands, restaurants and cafés, flower gardens, and mechanical [[amusement ride]]s such as a [[merry-go-round]] and a primitive [[Roller_coaster#Scenic_railways|scenic railway]]. After dark, colored lamps illuminated the gardens. On certain evenings, specially designed [[fireworks]] could be seen reflected in Tivoli's lake.

Composer [[Hans Christian Lumbye]] (b. 1810 – d. 1874) was Tivoli's musical director from 1843 to 1872. Lumbye was inspired by Viennese waltz composers like the Strauss family ([[Johann Strauss I]] and his sons), and became known as the "Strauss of the North." Many of his compositions are specifically inspired by the gardens, including "Salute to the Ticket Holders of Tivoli", "Carnival Joys" and "A Festive Night at Tivoli". The [[Copenhagen Philharmonic Orchestra|Tivoli Symphony Orchestra]] still performs many of his works.

[[File:The Tivoli park, Copenhagen, Denmark.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Tivoli's pirate ship, {{circa|1900}}]]

Tivoli was also used predominantly in the 1961 science fiction film, Reptilicus. 

In 1874, Chinese style Pantomimeteatret (The Pantomime Theatre) took the place of an older smaller theatre. The audience stands in the open, the stage being inside the building. The theatre's "curtain" is a mechanical peacock's tail. From the very beginning, the theatre was the home of Italian pantomimes, introduced in Denmark by the Italian [[Giuseppe Casorti]]. This tradition, which is dependent on the Italian [[Commedia dell'Arte]] has been kept alive, including the characters Cassander (the old father), Columbine (his beautiful daughter), [[Harlequin]] (her lover), and, especially popular with the youngest spectators, the stupid servant [[Pierrot]]. The absence of spoken dialogue is an advantage, as Tivoli is now an international tourist attraction.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Tivoli also hosted [[Human zoo|human exhibitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Exhibitions. Race, Gender and Sexuality in Ethnic Displays|last=Andreassen|first=Rikke|publisher=Ashgate|year=2015|isbn=9781472422453|location=Farnham|pages=13-15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathisers burnt many of Tivoli's buildings, including the concert hall, to the ground. Temporary buildings were constructed in their place and the park was back in operation after a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;The Twentieth Century with Walter  Cronkite: Sabotage. CBS, 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tivoli is always evolving without abandoning its original charm or traditions. As Georg Carstensen said in 1844, "Tivoli will never, so to speak, be finished," a sentiment echoed just over a century later when [[Walt Disney]] said of his own Tivoli-inspired [[theme park]], "[[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world." 
In Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the word tivoli has become synonymous with any amusement park.

==Rides==
[[File:Tivoligardens2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Dragon Boat lake and ''[[Dæmonen]]'' roller coaster in the background]]
The park is best known for its wooden [[roller coaster]], Rutschebanen, or as some people call it, Bjergbanen (''The Mountain Coaster''), built in 1914. It is one of the world's oldest wooden roller coasters that is still operating today. An operator controls the ride by braking down the hills so it won't gain too much speed. It is an [[American Coaster Enthusiasts|ACE]] Coaster Classic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceonline.org/CoasterAwards/?type=1 ACE Coaster Classic Awards]. Aceonline.org. Retrieved on 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another roller coaster, [[Dæmonen|The Demon]] (''Dæmonen''), features an [[Immelmann loop]], a [[vertical loop]], and a [[zero-G roll]] all during the ride time of just one minute and forty six seconds. An old roller coaster, The Snake (''Slangen''), was removed to have enough space for The Demon. In 2017, Tivoli Gardens added an optional [[virtual reality]] experience to the ride, simulating a flight through ancient China, along with encounters with dragons and demons. The Demon is situated next to the concert hall.

A well-known [[swing ride]], [[Star Flyer (Tivoli Gardens)|The Star Flyer]], opened in Tivoli in 2006. {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=off}} high and built by the [[Australia]]n company [[Funtime (manufacturer)|Funtime]], it offers panoramic views of the city.&lt;ref name="copenhagenet1"/&gt;

On 1 May 2009, Tivoli Gardens opened the new ride Vertigo, a looping plane ride where the rider pilots the ride, able to control the plane.

A [[Zamperla]] Air Race ride, Aquila, opened on 11 April 2013. It is a giant swing and spinner with centrifugal powers up to 4 g, named after the constellation of the Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivoli.dk/en/forlystelser/aquila/ Aquila] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104111553/http://www.tivoli.dk/en/forlystelser/aquila/ |date=4 January 2014 }}. Tivoli.dk. Retrieved 27 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newest attraction is Fatamorgana, which opened in 2016. This is the world's first [[Condor (ride)|Condor]] 2GH, which offers two separate seating arrangements, one milder version with two-seater gondolas, and a thrilling version in which riders are slung around at high speed while seated in a ring and facing away from the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tivoligardens.com/en/forlystelser/fatamorgana|title=Fatamorgana|website=Tivoli|accessdate=2 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619052935/http://www.tivoligardens.com/en/forlystelser/fatamorgana|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the rides, Tivoli Gardens also serve as a venue for various performing arts &amp; as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.

===Tivolis Koncertsal===
{{main|Tivolis Koncertsal}}
'''Tivolis Koncertsal''' is a classical concert hall featuring concerts with some of the largest names in international classical music.

===The Pantomime Theatre===
{{main|Pantomimeteatret}}
The '''Pantomime Theatre''' is an open-air theatre designed by [[Vilhelm Dahlerup]], also known for the design of the [[Royal Danish Theatre]]. It is a toy-like [[historicism|historicist]] built in Chinese style and noted for its mechanical front curtain that takes five men to operate and unfolds like a [[peafowl|peacock's tail]]. As indicated by the name, it is primarily a scene for pantomime theatre in the classical Italian [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition, which is performed daily with a live [[pit orchestra]]. Besides this original function, the theatre leads a second life as a venue for ballet and [[modern dance]], performing works by choreographers such as [[August Bournonville]], [[Dinna Bjørn]], Louise Midjord and [[Paul James Rooney]].

===The Tivoli Youth Guard===
[[File:Tivoligarden 2011.JPG|250px|thumb|Tivoligarden]]
The Tivoli Youth Guard is a formation of boys and girls aged 8–16 dressed in uniforms reminiscent of those of the [[Den Kongelige Livgarde|Royal Danish Guard]] complete with [[bearskin]]s. It was founded in 1844 and gives concerts, makes parades, stands guard at the garden's buildings and monuments at special occasions and represents the gardens at various events. It is composed of a [[Corps of drums]], a military styled [[marching band]] and a [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] platoon.

===Rhythmical music===
During the warmer summer months, Tivoli also features a live music series dubbed ''Fredagsrock'' (''Friday Rock''), which in the past has featured [[Roxette]], the [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Kanye West]], [[5 Seconds of Summer]] and popular Danish groups such as [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]], Nephew, [[Hanne Boel]], [[Raveonettes]] and [[Thomas Helmig]].

During [[Copenhagen Jazz Festival]] Tivoli Gardens is one of the many Copenhagen localities that serves as a venue for concerts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivoli.dk/composite-7069.htm Tivoli summer 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930062437/http://www.tivoli.dk/composite-7069.htm |date=30 September 2011 }}.

'''Trailblazer''' is a [[family roller coaster]] at [[Hersheypark]] [[amusement park]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It is located in the Pioneer Frontier section of Hersheypark, just below Storm Runner. The ride is notable for being the second-oldest operating coaster in the park, after the [[Comet (Hersheypark)|Comet]], and for its family-friendly height requirement of 36&amp;nbsp;inches and above with an adult.

==Description==
The coaster reaches speeds of up to 45&amp;nbsp;mph, and features a helix that circles 4 times. The mid-course brake zone is nearly level with [[Storm Runner]], and the queue for that ride extends inside Trailblazer's first drop.

==History==
According to a 1974 Souvenir book printed before the coaster was finalized, the ride was supposed to feature two lifts.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey's Guidebook, Western Publishing Company, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ride received two brand new trains in 2003 built by [[Premier Rides]]. The main difference is the new cars had individual lap bars for each seat, rather than the single "t-bar" lap bars for each pair of seats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2589">The '''United States Barista Championship''' or '''USBC''', is a competition to decide the most well rounded [[barista]] in the United States. Competitors prepare and serve three courses of espresso-based beverages consisting of [[espresso]]s, milk beverages, and signature drinks. The Competitor must make all three courses of beverages within a 15 minute time limit and are judged by seven different judges. The judging team consists of 4 sensory judges, 2 technical judges, and 1 head judge. The role of the sensory judge is to score the competitor solely on the quality of the beverage served and customer service. The technical judges are not served drinks, but score the competitor on items ranging from cleanliness to consistency of shot times. Judges undergo a certification process before the competition.

All USBC competitors must first qualify at a CoffeeChamps Qualifying Competition, which is an abbreviated version of the USBC. At the Qualifying Competitions, baristas serve two courses of espresso-based beverages consisting of espressos and signature drinks for 2 scoring sensory judges, 2 non-scoring guest judges or judges-in-training, 2 technical judges, and 1 head judge. There is a 10 minute time limit. 

2 Qualifying Competitions are held each year, the top 18 competitors from each Qualifying Competition move on to USBC. Places 7-18 move into Round One of USBC. The top 6 from each Qualifying Competition receive a "buy" into the Semi-Finals round. 

USBC consists of 3 rounds: Round One, Semi-Finals, and Finals. At the end of Round One, the competitors with the 6 highest scores will advance to the Semi-Finals round and join the 12 competitors who earned a “buy” from CoffeeChamps. There are 18 competitors in Semi-Finals and 6 competitors in Finals.  

The winner represents the United States in the [[World Barista Championship]].

In New Zealand, 67% of the population play video games, 48% of video game players are female and the average age of a video game player is 34.

In 2015, domestic video game development in New Zealand supported 568 full-time game developer jobs and collected $78.7 Million in revenue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, the video game industry in New Zealand is worth $424 million annually, inclusive of traditional retail and digital sales.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.scoop.co.nz/2017/03/08/nz-video-games-industry-revenues-race-ahead-to-424m-in-2016/|title=Scoop Business » NZ video games industry revenues race ahead to $424M in 2016|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difference in population size, New Zealand game development is comparable to Australia's, in terms of revenue and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Video_game_industry/Report/c02|title=Chapter 2|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry body for video games in New Zealand is the [[Interactive Games and Entertainment Association]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[New Zealand Game Developers Association]] supports video game development.

==History==
New Zealand was an early adopter of the video game phenomenon, despite its remoteness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://summit.sfu.ca/item/204|title=Early Games Production in New Zealand|author=Melanie Swalwell|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Atari 2600 titles were assembled under licence by Monaco Distributors in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pinwhiz/nz2600.htm Retrogames.co.nz - New Zealand Atari 2600 Games]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand even developed its own [[Pong]]-style game console, the Sportronic, in the late 1970s, as a result of import licensing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/sportronic-in-beige/|title=Sportronic in Beige|author=Russell Brown|publisher=Public Address|date=2003-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pinwhiz/sportn.htm Obscure Pixels - Sportronic]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Laser Hawk]]'' was developed for the [[Atari 8-bit]] in 1986 by [[Andrew Bradfield]] and Harvey Kong Tin.

''[[Super Skidmarks]]'', released for the [[Commodore Amiga]] in 1995, was developed by Auckland-based Acid Software.

==Major companies and global recognition==
Although a minor player in the global video gaming industry, New Zealand has had success with homegrown game developers such as Dinosaur Polo Club (developers of ''[[Mini Metro (video game)|Mini Metro]]'') and [[Sidhe Interactive]].  

The action RPG ''[[Path of Exile]]'', developed by [[Grinding Gear Games]] and released in 2013, enjoyed international success.

==Exhibitions==
The [[Game Masters (exhibition)|Game Masters]] exhibition was held at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]], from 15 December 2012 through to 28 April 2013.

==Controversies==
In 2003, ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' became the first video game officially banned in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand bans video game|work=[[MSNBC]]|date=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3693947/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/new-zealand-bans-video-game/|accessdate=2011-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105084639/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3693947/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/new-zealand-bans-video-game/|archive-date=2012-11-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sterne der satire-mz.jpg|thumb|"Star of Satire - Walk of Fame of Cabaret - since 2004"]]

The '''Walk of Fame of Cabaret''' is a [[sidewalk]] between [[Proviant-Magazin]] and [[Schönborner Hof]] in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]],  which is embedded with more than 40 seven-pointed irregularly shaped stars featuring the names of [[cabaret]] [[celebrity|celebrities]] selected by a group of experts and honored by several sponsors for their contributions to the cabaret culture.

The first stars, awarded on July 16, 2004, were inaugurated in the presence of [[Christina Weiss]], Culture Representative and [[Minister of State]] of Germany and [[Kurt Beck]], the premier of the German federal state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In January 2007, [[Peter Hammerschlag]] was honored, and his became the 43rd star on the walk.

== Characteristics ==
The Walk of Fame runs north to south between Münsterstraße and Schillerstraße.

Each star consists of a stainless-steel seven-pointed irregularly shaped star, inlaid into a bronze square. Inside the star, the signature of the honoree is etched. The full name of the honoree in [[capital letters]] can be seen on the bronze square, as well as the sponsor in normal letters.

The committee of experts initially selected 80 deceased stars to be honored on the walk of fame. Additionally to these, each year a living author or interpreter receives a star.

== Details on the honorees  ==
Details on the honorees may be found at the nearby Stiftung Deutsches Kabarett (German Cabaret Foundation). Here, the core of the German Cabaret Archive is formed by more than eighty [[literary estate]]s with biographies, documents and cultural heritage, regarding eighty thousand people from the history of cabaret and the forms of comedy that preceded it. This archive is based on the private initiative of Reinhard Hippen (1961). The counterpart of the "Walk of Fame" can be found in the "[[Hall of Fame]]" in the [[Bernburg]] castle, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. Numerous exhibits remind viewers of the "immortals" of cabaret.

== List of stars ==
Of all the nominated people, the following stars have been created:

[[File:We Said Go Travel.jpg|thumb|We Said Go Travel banner from We Said Go Travel website by [[Lisa Ellen Niver]]]]'''We Said Go Travel''' is a global community of over sixteen hundred writers from seventy five countries with articles from every continent. Stories are shared with photos and video from a perspective of the transformative power of travel. We Said Go Travel has hosted live and online events as well as travel writing contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.johnnyjet.com/2013/01/travel-contests-week-of-january-9th-2012/ |title      =  Travel Contest Round-up January 2013 |work      =Johnny Jet }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.johnnyjet.com/2013/05/travel-contests-week-of-may-15th-2013/ |title      =  Travel Contest Round-up May 2013 |work      =Johnny Jet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original blog began on blogspot by [[Lisa Ellen Niver]], a member of the [[Travelers' Century Club]]. The We Said Go Travel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.wesaidgotravel.com/ |title      =  We Said Go Travel Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; website with earned ratings of PR 5 and PA 50 began in May 2010. The first content was the newsletters previously published online during an eleven-month sabbatical in [[South-east Asia]] from August 2008-July 2009.

The site was created as a platform for a travel memoir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =http://www.wesaidgotravel.com/our-book|title      =Rajna Travel memoir}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a sabbatical year which included an underwater engagement, losing sixty pounds and visiting twelve countries.

With the first event in March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =http://www.westsidetoday.com/n4382/we-said-go-travel.html |title      =Uncovering Jewish Morocco, March 24, 2011: Speaker: Lisa Ellen Niver |work      =Westside Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; a larger platform was required and a website was built on weebly.com at www.wesaidgotravel.com with the blog being on www.wesaidgotravel.net.  As the number of followers and events grew, it was necessary to combine the two sites into one on wordpress on www.wesaidgotravel.com.

In April 2011, Niver was invited to have a "We Said Go Travel" Blog on the ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url        =  http://www.jewishjournal.com/wesaidgotravel |title      =  Jewish Journal Column}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1282">'''Zarnitsa''' ({{lang-ru|Всесоюзная пионерская военно-спортивная игра «Зарница»}}, All-Union [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Young Pioneer]] military sports game Zarnitsa) was a massive children's war game organized within the Young Pioneers organization. The game was an imitation of military actions (reconnaissance, battles, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;"Мысы — родина «Зарницы»? Будущая Всесоюзная военная игра зародилась в школе Краснокамского района, считает учительница Зоя Кротова", ''[[Zvezda (Perm)|Zvezda]]'' no. 52 (31920) May 18, 2012 ([https://www.webcitation.org/69gzHQifK archive at webcitation], retrieved December 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''zarnitsa'' literally means "[[heat lightning]]".

It was intended for schoolchildren of 4-7 classes (10-13) years. A similar game, '''Orlyonok''' ([[:ru:Орлёнок (игра)|Орлёнок]]), was for older schoolchildren.
