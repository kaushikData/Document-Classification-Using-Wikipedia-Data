[[File:Victims of Abu Sleem massacre.JPG|thumb|People at a Benghazi rally looking at the photos of victims of Abu Salim prison massacre (February 2011)]]
'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human rights abuses==
[[Amnesty International]] has called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996,&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |title=Investigation needed into prison deaths |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317043628/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |archivedate=2015-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident which some have referred to as the '''Abu Salim prison massacre'''.&lt;ref name="court celebrates massacre"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|title=Libyan legal court celebrates Abu Salim prison massacre|publisher=[[Arabic News]]|date=24 June 2005|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227211022/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|archive-date=2011-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a "site of egregious [[human rights violations]]."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=  Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=  [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmates of Abu Salim prison==
*[[Ahmed al-Senussi]], a current member of the NTC, was held here by Gaddafi until his release in 2001.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |last=Stock |first=Johnathan |title=Gaddafi-Opfer Al-Senussi: Gott entscheidet, was mit dir passiert |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |accessdate=25 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=13 March 2011 |agency=SPIEGEL-Verlag |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DGwSOUj?url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |archivedate=2011-08-25 |language=German |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

==Libyan civil war==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=RAW,Libya, Rebels and citizens setting prisoners free from Abu Salim Priso in Tripoli 24.08.2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHy2jmVocQ |work=[[YouTube]] |author=FreePressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter [[Matthew VanDyke]] from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in [[Brega]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=American fighting Kadhafi 'lunatics' dreams of free Libya |first=Jay|last=Deshmukh |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 October 2011 |work=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggq9gizU50QT6TMAe6WPD-7Xytrw?docId=CNG.63f3ecd569de01fd9d60c41e9a017daa.931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/25/libya.freed.american/|title = American held in solitary escapes Tripoli prison|author = Phil Gast|work = CNN|date =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a "writer and journalist," but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN" /&gt;

'''Agritourism''' or '''agrotourism''', as it is defined most broadly, involves any [[Agriculture|agriculturally]] based operation or activity that brings visitors to a [[farm]] or [[ranch]]. Agritourism has different definitions in different parts of the world, and sometimes refers specifically to [[farm stay]]s, as in Italy. Elsewhere, agritourism includes a wide variety of activities, including buying produce direct from a farm stand, navigating a [[corn maze]], slopping hogs, picking fruit, feeding animals, or staying at a bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) on a farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Emily|last= Biuso|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Down on the Farm With Your Sleeves Rolled Up  |url= http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/11/23/travel/escapes/23agritourism.html?sq=agritourism&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=

Though most agritourists simply spend an afternoon visiting farm stands, picking fruit, or feeding animals, others might stay on a farm for several days. Depending on the farm, they might have the opportunity to help with farm or ranch chores, contributing to tasks ranging from planting crops to building greenhouses. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 23, 2007 |accessdate=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agritourism is a form of niche tourism that is considered a growth industry in many parts of the world, including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Hollow Log Country Retreat |url=http://agritourismaustralia.com.au/ |title=Accommodation, Tours, Farmstay, B&amp;B Options in Regional Australia |publisher=Agritourism Australia |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410050443/http://agritourismaustralia.com.au/ |archive-date=2012-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref name="Manitoba Agritourism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opportunities for Diversifying our Farms|url=http://mbagritourism.wordpress.com/|work=Growing Forward and Manitoba Agriculture Food and Rural Initiatives|publisher=Manitoba Agritourism|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref name="farmstays.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Nowak |url=http://farmstays.blogspot.com/ |title=The Farm Stay Project |publisher=Farmstays.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wesvarrdec |url=http://wesvarrdec.blogspot.com/2010/02/agri-tourism-boom-seen-in-2009.html# |title=Leading innovations in R&amp;D for 2011-2016: Negros agri-tourism booms in 2009 |publisher=Wesvarrdec.blogspot.com |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms associated with agritourism are "agritainment", "value added products", "farm direct marketing" and "sustainable agriculture".

== Public awareness ==
People have become more interested in how their food is produced. They want to meet farmers and processors and talk with them about what goes into [[food production]].&lt;ref name="USDA" /&gt; For many people who visit farms, especially children, the visit marks the first time they see the source of their food, be it a [[Dairy cattle|dairy cow]], an ear of [[Maize|corn]] growing in a field, or an [[apple]] they can pick right off a tree.&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/knowyourfarmer?navid=KNOWYOURFARMER|publisher=USDA|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers and ranchers use this interest to develop traffic at their farm or ranch, and interest in the quality of their products, as well as awareness of their products.&lt;ref name="Meadowlark Herald, Vol. 3 Iss. 8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadowlarkherald.blogspot.com |last=Brachfeld |first=Aaron |title=USDA February 2012 Agrotourism to cultivate new direct sales |publisher= The Meadowlark Herald {{pipe}} Volume 3 Issue 8 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
While revenue and education are often primary drivers for farmers to diversify and invite guests onto their property, safety isn't always a top priority. Accidents involving tractors, wagon rides, trips, falls, and traffic occur at agritourism operations on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ag Injury News Clippings|url = http://www.AgInjuryNews.org|website = www.aginjurynews.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data and specific cases of agrotourism-related injuries are tracked and stored by researchers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weichelt|first=Bryan|last2=Gorucu|first2=Serap|date=2018-02-17|title=Supplemental surveillance: a review of 2015 and 2016 agricultural injury data from news reports on AgInjuryNews.org|url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2018/02/16/injuryprev-2017-042671|journal=Injury Prevention|language=en|pages=injuryprev–2017–042671|doi=10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042671|issn=1353-8047|pmid=29386372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this data is available at publicly accessible sites such as AgInjuryNews.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aginjurynews.org|title=Ag Injury News Clippings|website=www.aginjurynews.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agritourism by country ==

=== Latvia ===
Agrotourism in [[Latvia]] is a popular international tourist destination with many farming tours available such as grain, vegetable, fruit, dairy, and livestock. The farms display the lifestyles and work of active farmers, farming processes, farm products, and the opportunities and positive aspects of a life in the countryside. Tourists can learn how food is made from the field to the final product whilst also engaging in harvesting if possible. Some tours focus on traditional local [[Latvian cuisine]] such as [[cottage cheese]], [[buckwheat]], [[seaberry]] buckthorn, [[caraway]] cheese, dark [[rye bread]] and cured meats. Brewing beer is also widely popular with plenty of breweries producing a wide array of beer types.

The country-hotel scene has come on apace since 1960, when the [[Michelin Guide|Michelin guide]] to Italy listed not a single establishment in the Chianti area. But even after the boom in rural accommodation in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the choice was still limited, by and large, to basic agroturismo farm-holiday places or rather stuffy country-house hotels. The past few years have seen the arrival of a handful of stylish luxury spa resorts, and some mid-range options where guests benefit from a hands-on, personal approach.

Since 1985 agritourism in Italy is formally regulated by a state law,&lt;ref&gt;Law N. 730, year 1985&lt;/ref&gt; emended in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Law N. 96, year 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The law states basic requirements to claim the title of "agriturismo", and delegates single regions to further regulate the matter.

Italian agritourism attract visitors from all around the globe. In particular, given the luxury nature of rural tourism, international flows are demand-driven.

=== India ===
Since 2004 Agriculture Tourism is operational, it started in Baramati Agri Tourism Center under the guidance of Pandurang Taware.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He received the National Tourism Award from the President Of India, for the most innovative Tourism Product. Agri Tourism India (ATDC) is pioneer in the development and marketing of agri tourism concept in India. ATDC, as of 2014, has 218 affiliated farmers and operates agri tourism center in their respective villages in the state of Maharashtra.

=== Turkey ===

In the province of Hatay, The village of [[Vakifli]] has a small eco and cultural tourism industry, as it is often touted as the last rural village in Turkey where [[Armenians]] live. The small village has a guest house where visitors can buy organic products and see the life of the village. There is potential for ecotourism in the Aegean area of Western Turkey as well, and is a growing industry there.

According to the USDA [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service]], "Tourism is becoming increasingly important to the U.S. economy. A conservative estimate from the [[Federal Reserve Board]] in [[Kansas]], based on 2000 data, shows that basic travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.6 percent of all U.S. employment.

Through the Small Farm Center at the [[University of California]], "Agricultural tourism or agritourism, is one alternative for improving the incomes and potential economic viability of small farms and rural communities. Some forms of agritourism enterprises are well developed in [[California]], including fairs and festivals. Other possibilities still offer potential for development".&lt;ref name="asfc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfc.ucdavis.edu/agritourism/ |title=Agritourism Davis, California: University of California, Small Farm Center |date=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UC Small Farm Center has developed a California Agritourism Database that "provides visitors and potential entrepreneurs with information about existing agritourism locations throughout the state".&lt;ref name="cad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calagtour.org/AgTour.ASP |title=California Agritourism Database Davis, California: University of California, Small Farm Center |accessdate=December 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115161716/http://www.calagtour.org/AgTour.ASP |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication ''Promoting Tourism in Rural America'' explains the need for planning and marketing a rural community and weighing the pros and cons of tourism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">'''Arming yeast''' is a tool in [[biotechnology]] and [[biological research]] where a [[protein]] of interest is expressed on the surface of [[yeast]] cells. This is used in industrial settings for expression of [[enzymes]] to serve as [[catalyst]]s in reactions, as well as in pharmaceutical settings for screening drug candidates. ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is most commonly used as arming yeast because it is easy to grow, can be [[genetic engineering|genetically manipulated]], and is [[generally recognized as safe]] by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=Kondo2004&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yeast cell-surface display-applications of molecular display|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |date=2004 |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=28-40 |vauthors=Kondo A, Ueda M |doi= 10.1007/s00253-003-1492-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
The most common mechanism of arming yeast is to [[fusion protein|fuse]] a protein of interest to the extracellular domain of the yeast mating protein [[alpha-agglutinin|α-agglutinin]].&lt;ref name=Kondo2004/&gt;

== Uses ==
Arming yeast have been used for a variety of industrial and research processes.

"'''Attack of the Killer App'''" is the third episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]]&lt;!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --&gt; of the American animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on July 1, 2010. The episode focuses on the release of the new eyePhone, resulting in [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] posting a [[viral video]] of [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] on the Internet. [[Craig Ferguson]], host of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', guest stars as Leela's singing [[boil]], Susan.

==Plot==
The episode opens with the Planet Express crew recycling their old electronics. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]] announces that they will be delivering all the Earth’s [[e-waste]] to the Third World of the [[Antares]] system. After dropping them off, they decide it would be better to keep using their old electronics. This changes when they see a commercial for MomCorp’s new [[iPhone|eyePhone]]. The crew all buy eyePhones, which feature a wide variety of applications, including the [[Twitter|Twitcher]] application. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] get into a competition to get the most followers, wagering a dollar and stating that the loser must jump into a tub of two-headed alien goat vomit and diarrhea.

Meanwhile, [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] reveals to her sons that the eyePhones allow her to direct market to the users, based on what they post on Twitcher. She also reveals her evil plan wherein the “twit worm” will be transmitted as soon as someone has one million followers. The twit worm will work as a virus infecting the human brain and making people into mindless zombies that follow her every whim.

Fry decides he needs to have more interesting twits in order to beat Bender. He soon discovers that [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] has a boil, named Susan, which sings show tunes. Fry shares video of the boil on his eyePhone, in spite of his promise not to. The video is a hit and Leela is ridiculed wherever she goes. Fry and Bender both reach one million followers simultaneously and Mom transmits the twit worm to all of their followers, including [[Hermes Conrad]], [[Amy Wong]] and Pro. Farnsworth.

Leela discovers that her humiliation is old news and that a new video has everyone’s attention. She forgives Fry and he reveals to her that he posted a video of himself completing the loser’s side of the bet in order to make up for the humiliation he caused her. Meanwhile, Mom's virus activates turning Fry and Bender's followers to zombies who get in line to buy the eyePhone 2.0 while Mom looks on satisfied.

==Continuity==
Bender's good twin [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Flexo|Flexo]] makes a brief cameo in one of the recycling bins.&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; The cell phone [[Amy (Futurama)|Amy]] throws away before getting an eyePhone is the same as in "[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]". The chairs at the pizza restaurant are the same ones the Cygnoids had in "[[A Leela of Her Own]]".

==Cultural references==
Most of the episode focuses on parodies of the [[iPhone]] and [[Twitter]], renamed the eyePhone and Twitcher respectively.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html |title=Futurama: "Attack of the Killer App" Review |author=Canning, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-06-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704042349/http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyePhone is placed directly in the eye, hence the name ''eye''Phone.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; 
Fry asks, "Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?", to which Bender replies, "August 6, 1991", which is the date that [[Tim Berners-Lee]] announced the [[World Wide Web]] project and software on the newsgroup alt.hypertext.&lt;ref name="a.v.club"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/attack-of-the-killer-app,42568/ |title=Futurama "Attack of the Killer App" |author=Handlen, Zack |date=July 1, 2010 |work=[[The A.V.

==Broadcast and reception==
In the original American broadcast, "Attack of the Killer App" was viewed by an estimated 2.159 million households receiving a 1.3 rating/2% share in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and 1.1 rating/4% share in the 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051 |title=Thursday Cable Ratings: USA’s Royal Pains &amp; Burn Notice lead Thursday cable pack; Bethenny Lags Futurama |author=Seidman, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=TVbythenumbers |accessdate=2010-07-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704143202/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Canning of [[IGN]] in his review gave the episode an 8.5 calling it "Great" and also stated in his review ""Attack of the Killer App" had more than enough great laughs to outweigh this weak bit", in reference to the Susan Boyle joke. He also praised the references to iPhone and Twitter jokes.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Zack Helden gave the episode a B saying "This was funny, generally, and I'm glad the series hasn't lost its teeth. It's just, I miss the writers' habit of biting off just a little more than they could chew."&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; He also found the Susan Boyle jokes to be "mean-spirited" but clever and so "bizarre that it worked".&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; Darren Franich of [[Entertainment Weekly|EW]] Popwatch said the episode was "as good as anything the show produced in its prime" particularly commenting on the speed of the episode and the precision of its satire. He also noted that the episode benefited from good timing, coming right on the heels of recent iPad and iPhone releases which kept the episode from feeling "outdated".&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/ |title='Futurama' has returned: Well, IS it still good? |first=Darren |last=Franich |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100705101625/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/| archivedate= 5 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Gandert of [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] rated the episode a 7.1.

The '''Avenue of the Arts''' is a city designated arts cultural district&lt;ref&gt;Eisinger, Peter. ''Urban Affairs Review'', January 2000 vol. 35 no. 3,  "The Politics of Bread and Circuses - Building the City for the Visitor Class". pp. 316-333, doi: 10.1177/107808740003500302 .&lt;/ref&gt; on a segment of [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], that includes many of the city's cultural institutions, most notably the theater district south of [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall]].  The designation can be found as far south as [[Washington Avenue Historic District (Philadelphia)|Washington Avenue]] and as far north as the [[Cecil B. Moore, Philadelphia|Cecil B. Moore]] neighborhood.

The name "Avenue of the Arts" originated in a strategy by mayor [[Ed Rendell]] to redevelop South Broad Street in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]].&lt;ref name=cares&gt;Dobrin, Peter. ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', May 11, 2015, "[http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-11/news/62005302_1_philadelphia-singers-greater-philadelphia-cultural-alliance-candidates Will the city's arts scene get a mayor who cares?]".&lt;/ref&gt; The Avenue of the Arts originally ran along Broad Street from Locust Street south to Lombard Street. The Avenue's definition was expanded to North Broad Street by city planners under mayor [[John F. Street]]'s administration to encourage further development in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/14446354.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Avenue of the Arts is overseen by the [[non-profit organization]] [[Avenue of the Arts, Inc.]] led by Executive Director Karen Lewis.

[[File:AvenueOfTheArts.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Avenue of the Arts street sign]]

The Avenue of the Arts is the locale for many of the city's large theatres, including the [[Kimmel Center]] (home of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]), the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]], [[Merriam Theater]], [[The Wilma Theater|Wilma Theater]], [[Liacouras Center]], and [[Suzanne Roberts Theatre]].  Buildings for the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] are located just south and east of the [[Kimmel Center]]; the Merriam Theatre is often used for high-end productions involving the school.

[[Philadelphia International Records]]' offices and gift shop is also located along this strip.  Just south of the strip is the [[Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts]], and on Broad Street in this vicinity, just north of [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall]], is the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], which, founded in 1805, is America's oldest art school and museum and boasts a distinguished collection of American art.

Several parking garages and public transportation services provided by [[SEPTA]] and [[Delaware River Port Authority|DRPA]] at the [[Walnut–Locust station|Walnut–Locust]], [[12–13th &amp; Locust station|12-13th Street]], and [[15–16th &amp; Locust station|15-16th Street]] stations, served by the [[Broad Street Line]] and the [[PATCO Speedline|Lindenwold Line]].  The availability of public transportation makes Avenue of the Arts highly accessible to visitors.

The '''Bergen County Cooperative Library System''' ('''BCCLS''') is a consortium of [[public library|public libraries]] in the four northeastern [[New Jersey]] [[Gateway Region]] counties of [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]], [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]], and [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]]. Founded in 1979,  the organization allows for reciprocal borrowing among its members so that books, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs and other media are shared among the libraries cooperatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmilfordboro.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=97 ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a valid library card from participating towns are permitted to reserve materials online and have them transferred to their local library, where materials can be retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bccls.org/|title=BCCLS|website=www.bccls.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were 77 public libraries with a total of 81 branches participating in the consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarytechnology.org/libraries.pl?Consortia=Bergen+County+Cooperative+Library+System|title=libraries.org: search results -- the library is a member of Bergen County Cooperative Library System|website=www.librarytechnology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Bergen County’s public libraries are members of the Bergen County Cooperative Library System along with 15 libraries from Essex, Hudson, and Passaic.  A patron’s hometown library card is honored at all participating libraries. The BCCLS had also participated in the Open Borrowing (www.openborrowing.org) program, with participating libraries in Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and Warren counties; this participation ended on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passaicpubliclibrary.org/flyers/2014_12_04_Open_Borrow.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8132">'''Bert is Evil''' is the name of a parody website, founded by Dino Ignacio on March 30, 1997, which featured [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], a character on the American children's [[television]] program ''[[Sesame Street]]''. In 1998, Dino Ignacio, Wout J Reinders and Jasper Hulshoff Pol accepted the [[Webby Award]] and the People's Voice Award for Best Weird Website at the Palace of Fine Arts auditorium in [[San Francisco]].

The website featured manipulated images of the character consorting with nefarious figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//fractalcow.com/bert/bert4.htm |title=Image of Bert with Adolf Hitler |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1998-04-19 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980419000407/http://fractalcow.com/bert/bert4.htm |archivedate=April 19, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Robert Mugabe]], and [[Osama bin Laden]], as well as being present at events such as the [[JFK assassination]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040208090437/http://www.bertisevil.tv/pages/bert000.htm Image of Bert at the JFK assassination]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oklahoma City bombing]], humorously offered as "proof" that Bert was no mere innocent children's television character. The "Evil Bert" phenomenon was picked up by other humorists, who created their own images linking Bert to current and historical atrocities.

In the summer of 1998, due to the website's immense cult popularity, it became too expensive for Ignacio to continue running. Instead of shutting the site down, he offered to allow anyone who was willing to mirror his original website the opportunity to [[Web hosting service|host]] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm |title=Dec 06, 1998 Archive.org copy of the original Bert is Evil |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1998-12-06 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206071043/http://www.fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm |archivedate=December 6, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result dozens of mirrors appeared, increasing the website's popularity and visibility.

==Osama Bin Laden image==
The first mirror, maintained by Dennis Pozniak, continued in the same vein by adding new "evidence" of Bert's evilness (such as Bert's connection to the [[JonBenét Ramsey|Ramsey Family]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010624121356/http://plaza.v-wave.com/bert/exclu008.htm Image of Bert with the Ramsey Family]&lt;/ref&gt; and serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010813203911/http://plaza.v-wave.com/bert/exclu016.htm Image of Bert as Jack the Ripper]&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of 1998, Pozniak posted a contribution submitted by humorist J-roen [[Photoshopping|photoshopped]] to depict the then relatively unknown international terrorist, [[Osama bin Laden]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20001209122600/http://plaza.v-wave.com/bert/exclu006.htm Image of Bert with Osama bin Laden]&lt;/ref&gt; posing with Bert.

In October 2001, an undoctored [[Reuters]] news photograph was published showing a pro Osama bin Laden [[protest]] [[Demonstration (people)|rally]] in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=92090&amp;page=1#.Tw-RQ4GdD-s |title=Osama bin Muppet? - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2001-10-11 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News photographs: {{cite web |url=http://www.mlcsmith.com/humor/bertsama/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107081039/http://www.mlcsmith.com/humor/bertsama/ |archivedate=2004-11-07 |df= }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20020918125552/http://nu.nl/img?name=osama.bin.laden.bert.evil&amp;x=350&amp;y=228] [https://web.archive.org/web/20011119202304/http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/nm/20011009/wl/imdf09102001085522a.html] [https://web.archive.org/web/20011120070330/http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/p/nm/20011005/wl/imdf05102001094431a.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One protester is seen holding a large [[collage]] style poster of bin Laden with a small image of Bert over his right shoulder – the same image posted to the Bert mirror in 1998 – which prompted much confusion and joking among Western audiences.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed account of the use of the image, in [[South Asia]] as well as by Western news agencies, see [http://www.lindqvist.com/bert.php]. This also argues against the notion that inclusion of the Bert image is some kind of coded communication. It is more likely that the protester did not know who Bert is.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Being unaware of ''Sesame Street'', [[Dhaka]] printer Mostafa Kamal had copied the collage from the [[World Wide Web]], leaving the image of Bert in his collage.&lt;ref name=scarcity&gt;Rosenzweig, Roy. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/529596 Scarcity or Abundance: Preserving the Past in a Digital Era]". ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' 108.3 (2003): 735-762.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|735}}

After this photo was released on the news wires, the owners of ''Sesame Street'', [[Sesame Workshop]], raised the possibility of pursuing legal action against Ignacio. In response, he took down the "Bert is Evil" section of his website,&lt;ref name=scarcity /&gt;{{rp|736}} also stating that he did not want to undermine the character in the eyes of children who watched ''Sesame Street''. "I am doing this because I feel this has gotten too close to reality", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm |title=Oct 14, 2001 Archive.org copy of the original Bert is Evil |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-10-14 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011014193614/http://fractalcow.com/bert/bert.htm |archivedate=October 14, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the original Bert/Osama picture had been posted to Dennis Pozniak's mirror, he too was bombarded by the international media seeking interviews. As a result of all the attention, Pozniak also closed his mirror.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011031055247/http://plaza.v-wave.com/bert/ Oct 31, 2001 Archive.org copy of the original Bert is Evil mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Brother Mouse''' is a not-for-profit publishing project in [[Laos]].

Big Brother Mouse focuses on publishing books that improve literacy and quality of life; and on making those books accessible, particularly in rural Lao villages. Books are scarce in Laos. Many people have never read anything except old textbooks and government pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;Krausz, Tibor. “People Making a Difference”. Christian Science Monitor, February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The project uses the slogan, “Books that make literacy fun!” Its first books, published in 2006, were easy picture books designed to have a strong appeal for children. Since then, it has expanded to publish books for all ages, “designed not only to make reading fun, but also to share information about the wider world.”&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;Wells, Bonnie. “Picturing Laos”. Amherst Bulletin, August 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of titles focus on health, nutrition, history, and science.

== History ==

The founder, retired book publisher [[Sasha Alyson]], first visited Laos in May, 2003, and discovered that many children in Lao villages had never seen a book.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Kevin. “O Pioneers”. Publishers Weekly, May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he himself “never saw a book in Lao. That gave me the idea for a publishing project here, that would both teach publishing skills and create books.”&lt;ref name="Wells" /&gt; He began exploring the feasibility of such an idea.

[[File:Khamla Panyasouk of Big Brother Mouse reads to children.jpg|thumb|Khamla Panyasouk of Big Brother Mouse reads to children]]
For three years, Alyson regularly visited Laos from a temporary base in [[Thailand]], exploring the feasibility of such a project. He met with government officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), teachers, and students. During that period, Alyson also worked with two Lao college students: Khamla Panyasouk and Siphone Vouthisakdee. Together they developed five easy and entertaining books for children, often using popular books from the west for inspiration about how to make books appealing. These first five books were:&lt;ref name="bbmwebsite"&gt;http://www.BigBrotherMouse.com, accessed March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Frog, Alligator, Buffalo'' by Khamla Panyasouk. This was an [[alphabet book]], with a short humorous rhyme for each consonant in the Lao alphabet. (In the Lao alphabet, vowels are not considered part of the regular alphabet.) 
* ''The Cat that Meditated'' by Siphone Vouthisakdee. Siphone wrote four traditional folktales he had learned from his parents and grandparents. The title story tells about a cat that vows to stop eating meat, so the mice begin to bring it vegetables. But one by one, the mice disappear.
* ''Bangkok Bob'' by Sasha Alyson. Inspired by the ''[[Curious George]]'' books, this tells about a young monkey who visits Bangkok and is overwhelmed by the skyscrapers and big trucks, which he thinks are tall trees and galloping elephants.
* ''Baby Frog, Baby Monkey'' by Siphone Vouthisakdee. Taking inspiration from ''[[The Foot Book]]'', by [[Dr. Seuss]], the author used rhymes, repetition, and the pairing of opposite words, to create a book for very young readers.
* ''The Polar Bear Visits Laos'' by Sasha Alyson. Inspired by another Dr. Seuss book, ''[[Hop on Pop]]'', this matches short sentences that include an internal rhyme with cartoon images.

Three of the books were illustrated by Ounla Santi, a [[Vientiane]] art student who has continued to illustrate many books for the project. Two others were illustrated by Tha Tao and Taeng Thaotueheu, high school students who placed first and second in an art contest that Alyson sponsored in an effort to find promising young illustrators.

Publishers in Laos are required to have a special publishing license, and each book must be registered with and approved by the government. At the end of 2005, Alyson entered into an agreement with Dokked, a Vientiane-based publisher, to act as publisher for these first five books.  They came off the press in March 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Stay Another Day: Promoting Sustainable Tourism, published by International Finance Corporation/World Bank Group, January, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; under the Dokked imprint, but also carrying the Big Brother Mouse logo. The next month a sixth book, ''The Big Chicken'', was published in a similar cooperative arrangement with Action with Lao Children, a Vientiane-based NGO.

Soon after that, Sasha agreed with Khamla Panyasouk, author of one of the first books, that they would form a new entity to act as publisher for future books, with Khamla as the owner, and Alyson as the volunteer adviser. In June 2006, Khamla graduated from college, obtained his business license, and then received a publishing license. It was, according to officials, the first publishing license they had ever awarded in [[Luang Prabang Province]], and required extra research for them to learn to how to do it. (It is Lao custom to identify people only by first names, even in formal situations. This article uses that first-name convention for people living in Laos, and last names for people living where that usage is customary.)

== First book parties ==

[[File:Lao students reading their first books.jpg|thumb|right|Lao students reading their first books at a school book party]]Although many organizations had expressed interest in purchasing children’s books if they were available, few actually did so. Big Brother Mouse began exploring other ways to get books into distribution. On 29 December 2006, they went to a school in Ban Nunsawat, a rural village on the outskirts of [[Luang Prabang]]. Khamla discussed the importance of books, Siphone talked about writing books, and Tha Tao gave an art lesson. This developed into the rural school book parties that later became the primary distribution mechanism for Big Brother Mouse books.

In its first year, Big Brother Mouse published 30 books, and has continued at approximately that rate. It continues to run book parties in rural schools, and that program has expanded considerably, with 31 of these events in 2007, 196 in 2008, increasing to 510 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report, Big Brother Mouse, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Village reading rooms ==

In 2008, Big Brother Mouse began experimenting with another way to create book access in rural villages, by setting up small reading rooms in the home of a volunteer. This is still conducted on a smaller scale than the school book parties. At the end of 2010, there were 146 of these reading rooms, largely in the Ngoi district of Luang Prabang province, sponsored by [http://www.planetwheeler.org/ Planet Wheeler Foundation] (founded by Lonely Planet publishers Tony and [[Maureen Wheeler]]) and [http://www.globaldevelopment.org.au/ Global Development Group] of Australia.

The project aims to continue making books available, through village reading rooms such as these in other regions of Laos. This commitment was one of three that was highlighted at the plenary session of the [[Clinton Global Initiative]], held in Hong Kong in 2008.&lt;ref name="bbmwebsite" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://press.clintonglobalinitiative.org/index.php?s=43&amp;item=33&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourists also help with distribution. “Give books, not candy,” Khamla encourages visitors who want to take a gift when they go to a rural village.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;Ellis, Lauren. For the Love of Reading. Fah Thai magazine, Jan.-Feb. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== The name ==

The Lao name for the project is “Aai Nuu Noi” which literally translates as “Older brother that is a small rodent.” (Lao uses a single term, “nuu”, for mice, rats, and other rodents, then distinguishes between types by using  adjectives such as small, big, wild, etc.) In deciding on an English translation, Alyson originally considered “Brother Mouse” to avoid any confusion with the Big Brother of George Orwell, but finally decided “Big Brother Mouse” was a catchier name, and that most people would understand it was not related to the Orwellian connotations.

== People ==

*[[Sasha Alyson]] (b. 1952), the founder, continues to act as full-time volunteer adviser to the project.

All of the paid staff are Lao, and three of them are the owners:

* Khamla Panyasouk (b. 1983) the original owner, was born in a rural village in Pac Ou district. As the primary owner, he oversees all activities, and handles most government relations. At about age 12, he moved to Luang Prabang and became a novice monk at a Buddhist temple, so that he could continue his education beyond the primary school that was available in his village. He recalls his surprise, in Luang Prabang, when he saw tourists reading books. He was only aware of books as the dull, obsolete textbooks he sometimes had seen in his school, and couldn’t imagine why anyone would read them while on vacation.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;
* Siphone Vouthisakdee (b. 1984) Siphone was born in a remote village, where only five children have graduated from primary school. He and Khamla had known each other for many years, first when they were both novice monks, then as students at the Teacher Training College. Siphone has put to paper several collections of Lao folktales, including a collection of stories about Xieng Mieng, the most popular Lao folkhero. He handles a growing range of editorial responsibilities.
* Sonesoulilat (Sone) Vongsouline (b. 1990) who received eight years of training at the Children’s Cultural Center in Luang Prabang, where he learned to lead children’s activities.&lt;ref name="bbmwebsite" /&gt; Sone joined the Big Brother Mouse staff during its first year, when he was 16. His responsibilities quickly increased, and he became a part owner three years later, taking responsibility for hiring, training, and coordinating events in schools and villages.

== Books ==

As of the end of 2010, about two thirds of the books published by Big Brother Mouse were primarily intended for children up to age 12, although they are also enjoyed by adults, who have not seen such books before. The following sample list of titles shows the range of books the project has produced:&lt;ref name="bbmwebsite" /&gt;

* ''Animals of Laos'': A well-illustrated introduction to the country’s varied animals, which encourages readers to protect Laos's natural heritage, while introducing simple scientific and environmental ideas.
* ''Around the World with 23 Children'': Students from the [[Vientiane International School]] wrote about their home countries from their perspective, talking about such topics as popular foods, holidays, customs, landmarks, and animals.
* ''Baby Care'': Why is breastfeeding important? What situations call for a visit to the doctor? Why do babies cry? With just one or two sentences per page, this book guides new parents through the first year of their child's life. It was the first book published by Big Brother Mouse that specifically targeted adults rather than children, and sought to directly improve quality of life. The high level of interest that it generated, in rural villages, convinced the staff to continue publishing more such books.
* ''The Dead Tiger Who Killed a Princess'': Folktales were once passed along orally, but they risk being forgotten, as television spreads. This collection is the first in a series, which the project plans to continue indefinitely, to preserve them. Already enough stories have been collected for three more volumes.
* ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'': [[Anne Frank]]'s famous and eloquent diary took four years to translate and get into print; it appeared at the end of 2010.
* ''The Hungry Frog'': An 8-page book, by a Khamla, young woman on the project staff who had no writing experience, has colorful illustrations, strong repetition, and a punchy ending; it’s intended to draw the interest of very beginning readers.
* ''The Joy of Reading'': A small book, inspired by the [[Mem Fox]] classic ''Reading Magic'', encourages parents to read aloud to their children, and gives some pointers about how to do so.
* ''Laos 1957'': Anthropologist Joel Halpern came to Laos for a year, in 1957, and preserved some 3,000 color slides, with detailed captions. They provided the basis for a book which, for most Lao readers, is their first chance to see the world of their parents and grandparents.
* ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'': [[Hans Christian Andersen]]’s romantic classic has been popular particularly with teenagers and young adults.
* ''New, Improved Buffalo'': This story of a boy who improves his buffalo, by adding an umbrella, then a television, wings, extra legs, and more, was illustrated by Chittakone, a 14-year-old boy who won the second art contest sponsored by Big Brother Mouse.&lt;ref&gt;“Young Artist Has Designs,” Vientiane Times Weekend, January 13, 2007, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Proverbs of Laos'': Young people at the Children's Cultural Center and at the Orphanage School in Luang Prabang interviewed parents and grandparents to select a favorite proverb, then illustrated it.
* ''Spectacular!'': Eye-catching photographs, obtained through [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and [[Creative Commons]] licensing, show microbes, galaxies, and everything in between.
* ''Traditional Toys'': Photos and text show how Lao villages have, for generations, made and enjoyed toys from natural objects.
* ''Wat Xieng Thong, the stories of Siaosawat'': The Buddhist [[Wat Xieng Thong]] temple, the most famous temple in [[Luang Prabang]] has a chapel decorated with mirrored mosaics, that tell parables of a past age.
* ''What's in the Sky?'': The spectacular photographs provided in recent years by [[NASA]] were the backdrop for one of the project's first science books.
* ''Women's Health'': Four chapters about women's anatomy, pregnancy, and childbirth, from the [[Hesperian Foundation]]'s book ''Where Women Have No Doctor''.

== Organizational structure and affiliations ==

Lao law does not have a provision for [[non-profit organizations]] of the type that exist in many western countries. Big Brother Mouse operates under a standard Lao business license, but on a not-for-profit basis.&lt;ref name="bbmwebsite" /&gt; In 2010 it reported total income of $326,000, from these sources:
* 26% from foundations (Australia, USA, and Europe)
* 27% from large individual donors ($10,000 USD or more)
* 29% from individual donors (less than $10,000 U.S.)
* 18% from sales of books

Most American donors contribute through the [http://www.laosliteracyproject.org/ Laos Literacy Project, Inc.], a 501-c-3 non-profit organization in the United States that was established specifically to support Big Brother Mouse's literacy and education work.

Significant support also comes from Planet Wheeler Foundation and the Global Development Group (GDG) in Australia, and most Australian donors contribute through the GDG to receive an Australian tax deduction.

[[File:Vide-poche.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Coin tray in [[Pottery|ceramics]] in ''[[Raku ware|raku]]''-style).]]

A '''coin tray''' is a container, used to receive various small items such as [[coins]], [[key (lock)|keys]] or [[train ticket|transport tickets]] from trouser pockets. For example, when getting undressed before going to bed.

There are coin trays in [[ceramic]], [[leather]], [[metal]], [[textile]] or [[wood]]. The edges may be more or less flat.

A '''country club''' is a privately owned [[Club (organization)|club]], often with a membership quota and admittance by invitation or sponsorship, that generally offers both a variety of recreational [[sport]]s and facilities for dining and entertaining.  Typical athletic offerings are [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[Human swimming|swimming]].  A country club is most commonly located in city outskirts or suburbs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/countryclub?view=uk|title=Country club|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries – Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is distinguished from an urban [[Sports club|athletic club]] by having substantial grounds for outdoor activities and a major focus on golf.

Country clubs originated in [[Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;Wray Vamplew, “Sharing Space: Inclusion, Exclusion and Accommodation at the British Golf Club before 1914” Journal of Sport and Social Issues 34, no. 359 (2010): 359, doi: 10.1177/0193723510377327.&lt;/ref&gt; and first appeared in the US in the early 1880s.&lt;ref name="Simon, Roger D. 2007"&gt;Simon, Roger D. “Country Clubs.” In The Encyclopedia of American Urban History, edited by David R. Goldfield, 193-94. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2007. doi: 10.4135/9781412952620.n110.&lt;/ref&gt; Country clubs had a profound effect on expanding suburbanization&lt;ref name=steele75&gt;[[John Steele Gordon|Gordon, John Steele]], [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=2eebc0a3-cedf-410c-93df-47b259cb7346%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=119&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=mth&amp;AN=9010080571 “The Country Club”].

Country clubs can be exclusive organizations.  In small towns, membership in the country club is often not as exclusive or expensive as in larger cities where there is competition for a limited number of memberships.  In addition to the fees, some clubs have additional requirements to join.  For example, membership can be limited to those who reside in a particular housing community.

Country clubs were founded by upper-class elites between 1880 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Jolly-Ryan, “Chipping Away at Discrimination at the Country Club,” Pepperdine Law Review 25, no. 495 (1998): 2 http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/pepplr25&amp;div=37&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heinonline.org"&gt;Jennifer Jolly-Ryan, “Chipping Away at Discrimination at the Country Club,” Pepperdine Law Review 25, no. 495 (1998): 496, http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/pepplr25&amp;div=37&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1907, country clubs were claimed to be “the very essence of American upper-class.”&lt;ref name=steele75 /&gt;  The number of country clubs increased exponentially with industrialization, the rise in incomes, and suburbanization in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=steele75 /&gt;  During the 1920s, country clubs acted as community social centers.&lt;ref name=steele75 /&gt;  When people lost most of their income and net worth during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]],  the number of country clubs decreased drastically for lack of membership funding.&lt;ref name=steele75 /&gt;

Historically, many country clubs refused to admit members of minority racial groups as well those of specific faiths, such as [[American Jews|Jews]] and [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]]s. In a 1990 landmark ruling at [[Shoal Creek Golf and Country Club]], the PGA refused to hold tournaments at private clubs that practiced racial discrimination. This new regulation led to the admittance of blacks at private clubs. The incident at Shoal Creek is comparable to the [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1966 NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which led to the end of racial discrimination in college basketball.

Beginning in the 1960s [[civil rights]] lawsuits forced clubs to drop exclusionary policies, but ''de facto'' discrimination still occurs in cases until protest or legal remedies are brought to bear.

The [[Philadelphia Cricket Club]] is the oldest country club in the United States devoted to playing games&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pga.com/professionalchampionship/news/2015-pnc-headed-philadelphia-cricket-club|title=2015 PNC headed to Philadelphia Cricket Club|work=PGA.com|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Country Club Of Salisbury is also one of the oldest country clubs in the U.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6275">'''Cultural mediation''' describes a profession that studies the cultural differences between people, using the data in problem solving.
It is one of the fundamental mechanisms of distinctly human [[Developmental psychology|development]] according to [[cultural–historical psychology|cultural–historical psychological theory]] introduced by [[Lev Vygotsky]] and developed in the work of his numerous followers worldwide.

==Introduction==
Vygotsky investigated [[child development]] and how this was guided by the role of [[culture]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. Vygotsky observed how higher mental functions developed through [[social interactions]] with significant people in a child's life, particularly parents, but also other adults. Through these interactions, a child came to learn the habits of mind of her/his culture, including [[speech pattern]]s, [[written language]], and other [[symbol]]ic knowledge through which the child derives meaning and affects a child's construction of his or her knowledge. This key premise of Vygotskian psychology is often referred to as "cultural mediation". The specific knowledge gained by a child through these interactions also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]].

==Example==
The easiest way to understand mediation is to start with an example and follow with the Vygotskian principles behind it.

At a North American girl's fourth birthday, she sits at the table with friends and family. As the candles on her birthday cake are lit and it is placed on the table, the child gains a feeling of deeply felt joy.  This is not only because she knows the cake is sweet and she likes sweet food, nor that the candles' sparkling is pleasing to her eyes. While these would be sufficient reason to arouse an emotional response in an ape, there are mental processes in a four-year-old that extend well beyond this. She patiently waits as her family and friends sing "[[Happy Birthday to You]]". The joy is not in the cake itself but in the cake's specific meaning to her. It is a sign that today is a special day for her in which she is the center of attention and that her friends and family are praising her. It's also a sign that she is bigger and as such has higher status among her peers. It's not just a cake, it is a [[birthday cake]] and, more specifically, it is her own. The true significance of the birthday cake then, is not in its physical properties at all, but rather in the significance bestowed upon it by the culture the daughter is growing into. This is not restricted to such artifacts as a birthday cake. A classroom, a game of soccer, a fire engine are all first and foremost [[cultural artifact]]s from which children derive meaning.

This example can help us understand Vygotsky's approach to human development. Like animals, we have lower [[mental functions]] tied closely to biological processes. In our birthday cake example, a toddler may well have reached out to take a handful of cream from the cake as soon as she saw it and the four-year-old may have been tempted to do the same. In humans, however, lower mental functions facilitate a new line of development qualitatively unique to humans. Vygotsky referred to this as the higher mental functions. The lower mental functions cannot be equated to those of an ape as they are interwoven with the line of higher mental functions and are essential to them.
{{quote|"The history of child behavior is born from the interweaving of these two lines. The history of the development of the higher mental functions is impossible without a study of their prehistory, their biological roots, and their organic disposition." (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 46)}}

However, it is this higher line of development that explains the birthday cake example with profound insight.

From the perspective of an individual child's development, the higher psychological line of development is one guided by the development of ''tools'' and ''signs'' within the culture. In our example above, the birthday cake is much more than a source of nourishment, it is a sign with much deeper and broader meaning. The sign ''mediates'' between the immediate sensory input and the child's response, and in so doing allows for a moment of reflection and self-regulation that would not otherwise be possible. To the extent that these signs can be used to influence or change our physical or social environment they are tools. Even the birthday cake can be considered as a tool in that the parents use it to establish that their daughter is now older and has a new status in society.

The cake is a sophisticated example. Tools and signs can be much simpler, such as an infant pointing to an object she desires. At first she may simply be trying to reach the object, but the mother's response of passing the object helps the infant realize that the action of pointing is a tool to change the environment according to her needs. It is from these simple inter-subjective beginnings that the world of meaning in the child mediated by tools and signs, including language, develops.

A fundamental premise of Vygotsky's therefore, is that tools and signs are first and foremost shared between individuals in society and only then can they be internalized by individuals developing in the society as is reflected in this famous quote:
{{quote|"Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological), and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to voluntary attention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the higher functions originate as actual relations between human individuals." (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 57)}}

{{Italic title}}
'''''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst''''' (literally "Monuments of German musical art") is a [[Historical editions (music)|historical edition of music]] from Germany, covering the Baroque and Classical periods.&lt;ref&gt;''Cf''. Wikipedia article in German. [[:de:Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst|Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The edition comprises two series: the first appeared in sixty-five volumes between 1892 and 1931, and the second, which was subtitled ''Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Bayern'' (Monuments of musical art in Bavaria), in thirty-six volumes between 1900 and 1931. The first series was issued by a Prussian royal commission of celebrity musicians and musicologists in instalments through the music publishers Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in Leipzig, and the second by the Society for the Publication of Monuments of Musical Art in Bavaria.

A parallel series of volumes on Austrian composers, ''[[Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich]]'' (Monuments of musical art in Austria), was begun in 1959, and as at 2015-10-25 is in progress at one hundred and fifteen volumes.

References to these editions in this article in common with general practice use the acronyms ''DdT'', ''DTB'', and ''DTO'', and to the Münchener Digitalisierungs Zentrum Digitale Bibliothek with ''MDZ''.

Between 1957 and 1961 the First Series was revised and re-issued by the publishers under the editorship of H. J. Moser again in sixty-five volumes.

In 1962 revision of the Second Series of ''DdT'' (i.e., ''DBT'') was begun. By 1970 three volumes (9, 20, and 22) had been revised.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, W. (1970) ''Harvard Dictionary of Music''. Article: Editions. London: Heinemann Educational Books Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco Public Library lists volumes 34, and 36, with date 1962.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Public Library catalogue entry: Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Bayern http://sflib1.sfpl.org/search~S1?/cSCORE+780.82+D417db+1962/c780.82+d417+db+++++1962/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=c780.82+d417+db+++++1962&amp;1%2C%2C6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the publication of a ''neue Folge'' (new series) of ''DdT'' : ''DBT'' with the same musical content was started by the Gesellschaft für Bayerische Musikgeschichte (Society for Bavarian Music History) via Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. The ''DdT'' was dropped and the new series entitled "Denkmaeler der Tonkunst in Bayern". The editors decided on volumes of musical scores, and book-format special volumes (''Sonderbände''). As at 2015-10-25 twenty-four volumes of musical scores have been published, and two special volumes. Breitkopf &amp; Härtel's catalogue refers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.breitkopf.com/work/6/denkmaeler-der-tonkunst-in-bayern-neue-folge Publisher's online catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Münchener Digitalisierungszentrum (Munich Digitization Centre) of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (State Library of Bavaria) has published the 1892 ''DdT'', and 1900 ''DBT'', online.&lt;ref&gt;Münchener Digitalisierungszentrum. (2009) ''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst - 1. Folge''. Online. http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/ausgaben/uni_ausgabe.html?projekt=1208776013&amp;recherche=ja&amp;ordnung=sig&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The genesis of ''DdT'' is indicated by the title page to Volume One: ''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst herausgegeben durch eine von der königlich Preussischen Regierung berufene Commission'' &lt;ref&gt;Scheidt, Samuel / Seiffert, Max: Tabulatura nova, für Orgel u. Clavier, Leipzig, 1892. [Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst - 1. Folge.] Online. Accessed 2015-10-26. https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/metaopac/search?documentid=1978803&lt;/ref&gt; (''Monuments of German musical art edited by the Commission appointed by the Royal Prussian Government'')

The Kingdom of Prussia was ruled at its peak by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor William II (1859-1941)]], and Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898)]]. After the resignation of the Chancellor in 1890, the Emperor also presided over the fall of the kingdom. The production of ''DdT'' began in 1892, and continued throughout the First World War until 1931 and nearly the start of the Third Reich (1933-1945): an example perhaps of ''ars longa, vita brevis''. The life of ''DdT'' was largely independent of the fall of Prussia, and its significance was tempered by the changes in Europe after 1918, and after 1945. The re-evaluation of its contents in the period 1959 to 1970 may be an indication either of the lasting value of the works of older composers from a modern perspective, or of a tendency to retain nationalism in music in some degree. The philosophy of ''Musica Britannica'' may hold a similar place in England.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Musica Britannica'' web site indicates the rationale of the edition. http://www.musicabritannica.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of these editions in drawing attention to music by composers who deserved recognition has been illustrated by Sir Jack Westrup.&lt;ref&gt;Westrup, Sir J. A. (1973) ''An introduction to musical history''. London: Hutchinson &amp; Co. (Publishers) Limited. [2nd. ed.] pp. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bismarck's thoroughness, and efficiency, were thus not limited to the Prussian Army, and the Prussian welfare state, but characteristically extended to the art of music: stepping from the particular of Bismarck's choice to the general of national identity, the expression of national identity became a characteristic throughout the wider continent of Europe during the period 1870 to 1914. For example, national feeling in Czechoslovakia, Russia, and England encouraged the fine art counterparts of folk art that achieved expression in the works of ''inter alia'' Smetana, Dvořák, Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky, Holst, and Vaughan Williams.

Within this heady prevailing mixture of aspiration, purpose, and achievement, the foreword to the First Series explains the Commission's philosophy. ''Die Werke hervorragender älterer deutscher Tonmeister der Kunst und Kunstwissenschaft von neuem zugänglich zu machen, ist längst als eine Aufgabe unserer Zeit erkannt worden. . . . ''

&lt;small&gt;''Translation.''——To make accessible again the works of outstanding older German musical masters of art, and of the science of art, has long been realized as a responsibility of our times. The emergence of the collected editions of the works of JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH, HÄNDEL, SCHÜTZ, and others owes to this realization. Projects like Friedrich Chrysander's "Monuments of Musical Art", and the publications of the Society for Music Research, are wholly or at least in part dedicated to the same purpose in life.

Apart from the merit that these publications attract in themselves, they have at the same time the advantage of more clearly recognizing the difficulties that are considered by general agreement to have been overcome. Consideration of the difficulties suggests the desire for a new enterprise, which would complement the already existing volumes in print, would be compared with them, and at the same time be thought of as comprehensive, and limited: comprehensive, in that the aim of not only the full publication of the works of a single great master would be addressed; and limited, insofar as only compositions of German musicians of the XVI, XVII and XVIII century would be published.

The masters GLUCK and HAYDN may remain aüsser considered as total spending their compositions are great tasks to existing, the solution of which is only a matter of time otherwise scheduled no composer will be to exclude its Werke have a right to continue to live in the German people by historical and artistic importance. In the almost endless riches of such works but it is to call those musical masters the first publication of whom would be in prospect, because it requires preparatory work already long in progress:

(1) Composers of sacred and secular vocal music: HANS LEO HASSLER, SAMUEL SCHEIDT, JOHANN HERMANN SCHEIN, ANDREAS HAMMERSCHMIDT, MELCHIOR FRANCK, ADAM KRIEGER, JOHANN CHRISTOPH BACH (the Eisenach Bach), and JOHANN MICHAEL BACH.   

(2) Organ composers: the master of the North German organ school exclusively BUXTEHUDE; also: SAMUEL SCHEIDT, JOHANN PACHELBEL and JOHANN GOTTFRIED WALTHER.

(3) Composers for Clavier and other instruments: JOHANN JAKOB FROBERGER, JOHANN KRIEGER, JOHANN KUHNAU, JOHANN BERNHARD BACH and CARL PHILIPP EMANUEL BACH. The Royal Prussian Ministry of Culture has conceived the attainment of such a plan for the publication of "Monuments of German musical art" headed one of num berufenen Commission and support the Publishing Act Breitkopf und Härtel in Leipzig envisaged. The present sample volume should serve to further illustrate of the company. The recording, which takes the company will prevail fir the follow-up and arrangement thereof. 

Berlin May 1892.&lt;/small&gt;


[[Johann Christoph Bach|Johann Christoph Bach (1642-1703)]] was born in Arnstadt, and died in Eisenach. His compositions are regarded as the most important in the Bach family before Johann Sebastian Bach.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Wolff, et al. "Bach." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online.

''Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst. Zweite Folge: Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Bayern : Veröffentlicht durch die Gesellschaft zur Herausgabe von Denkmälern der Tonkunst in Bayern'' [''Monuments of German musical art. Second series: Monuments of musical art in Bavaria : Published by the Society for the Publication of Monuments of Musical Art in Bavaria'']&lt;ref&gt;Listings based upon visual inspection of the digital copies available at the [[Munich Digitization Center]] with the [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/ausgaben/uni_ausgabe.html?projekt=1311245427&amp;recherche=ja&amp;ordnung=sig listing of the associated titles]&lt;/ref&gt;

From Volume Twenty-six the words "unter Leitung der Adolf Sandberger" were added to the description. &lt;ref&gt;Munich Digitalization Centre http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0006/bsb00064330/images/index.html &lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes on editing===
In the following list a forward slash "/" indicates a new line of print.

All words on the title pages of ''DTB'' are printed in capital letters. This usage has been interpreted by assignation of capital letters only to nouns, and proper names even when the words begin a new line.

For ease of reference the contents of the title pages are arranged into volume of the whole series, volume description (''Jahrgang''), title, publisher, and date of publication. From volume thirty-two as Dr Benno Filser Verlag arranged the title pages differently the arrangement has been followed here against the column heading.

Only from volume twenty-one did the publishers print the number of the volume in the whole series (e.g., ''einundzwanzigster Band der ganzen Reihe'').

Minutiae of printing have been maintained: no opening bracket before ''vierundzwanstigster'' in volume twenty-four; an unascribed "I." in volume four, and an unascribed "II, 2" in volume fifteen, which are both missing from the descriptions in ''MDZ''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/ausgaben/uni_ausgabe.html?sortjahr=19&amp;recherche=ja&amp;ordnung=chrono&amp;projekt=1311245427&amp;einzelsatz=j Münchener Digitalisierungs Zentrum Digitale Bibliothek : Denkmäler deutscher Tonkunst - 2.

'''Epaulette''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|p|ə|l|ɛ|t}}; also spelled '''epaulet''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epaulet |title=Definition of EPAULET |author=|date=|work=[[Merriam-Webster.com]]|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of ornamental shoulder piece or decoration used as insignia of [[military rank|rank]] by [[armed force]]s and other organizations. In the French and other armies, epaulettes are also worn by all ranks of elite or ceremonial units when on parade. It may bear rank or other insignia, and should not be confused with a [[shoulder mark]] - also called an shoulder board, rank slide, or slip-on - a flat cloth sleeve worn on the shoulder strap of a uniform (although the two terms are often used interchangeably).&lt;ref&gt;“Uniform Dress Guidelines”. Canadian Coast Guard. ver 26 06/27/08, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Epaulettes are fastened to the shoulder by a [[shoulder strap]] or ''passenten'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W. Y.|last=Carman|page=100|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a small strap parallel to the shoulder seam, and the button near the collar, or by laces on the underside of the epaulette passing through holes in the shoulder of the coat. Colloquially, any [[shoulder mark|shoulder straps with marks]] are also called epaulettes. The placement of the epaulette, its color and the length and diameter of its bullion fringe are used to signify the wearer's rank. At the join of the fringe and the shoulderpiece is often a metal piece in the form of a [[crescent]]. Although originally worn in the field, epaulettes are now normally limited to dress or ceremonial military uniforms.

==Etymology==
''Épaulette'' is a French word meaning "little shoulder" ([[diminutive]] of ''épaule'', meaning "shoulder").

== History ==
[[File:Louis XIV, King of France, after Lefebvre - Les collections du château de Versailles.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV]] wearing shoulder ribbons, an early type of epaulette of the late 17th century]]
Epaulettes bear some resemblance to the shoulder [[pteruges]] of ancient [[Roman Army|Roman]] military costumes. However their direct origin lies in the bunches of ribbons worn on the shoulders of [[military coat]]s at the end of the 17th century, which were partially decorative and partially intended to prevent [[shoulder belt (military)|shoulder belt]]s from slipping. These ribbons were tied into a knot which left the fringed end free. This established the basic design of the epaulette as it evolved through the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;John Mollo, page 49 "Military Fashion", {{ISBN|0-214-65349-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 18th century on, epaulettes were used in the French and other  armies to indicate rank. The rank of an officer could be determined by whether an epaulette was worn on the left shoulder, the right shoulder or on both. Later a "counter-epaulette" (with no fringe) was worn on the opposite shoulder of those who wore only a single epaulette. Epaulettes were made in [[silver]] or [[gold]] for officers, and in cloth of various colors for the enlisted men of various arms.  Certain categories of cavalry wore flexible metal epaulettes referred to as shoulder scales, rarely worn on the field.

By the early 18th century, epaulettes had become the distinguishing feature of commissioned rank. This led officers of military units still without epaulettes to petition for the right to wear epaulettes, to ensure that their status would be recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson-Latham, R: ''The Royal Navy 1790–1970'', page 5. Osprey Publishing, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  
During the Napoleonic Wars and subsequently through the 19th century, [[grenadiers]], [[light infantry]], [[voltigeurs]] and other specialist categories of infantry in many European armies wore cloth epaulettes with wool fringes in various colours to distinguish them from ordinary [[line infantry]]. "Flying artillery" wore "wings", similar to an epaulette but with only a bit of fringe on the outside, which matched the shoulder seam. Heavy [[artillery]] wore small balls representing [[ammunition]] on their shoulders."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

An intermediate form in some services, such as the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]], is the [[shoulder board]], which neither has a fringe nor extends beyond the shoulder seam. This originated during the 19th century as a simplified version for service wear of the heavy and conspicuous full dress epaulette with bullion fringes.

==Modern derivations==
Today, epaulettes have mostly been replaced by a five-sided flap of cloth called a [[shoulder board]], which is sewn into the shoulder seam and the end buttoned like an epaulette.

From the shoulder board was developed the [[shoulder mark]], a flat cloth tube that is worn over the shoulder strap and carries embroidered or pinned-on rank insignia. The advantages of this are the ability to easily change the insignia as occasions warrant.

Airline pilot uniform shirts generally include cloth flattened tubular epaulettes having cloth or bullion braid stripes, attached by shoulder straps integral to the shirts.  The rank of the wearer is designated by the number of stripes:  Traditionally four for captain, three for first officer (copilot), two for second officer (flight engineer). However, rank insignia are airline specific. For example, at some airlines, two stripes denote junior first officer and one stripe second officer (cruise or relief pilot).  Airline captains' uniform caps usually will have a braid pattern on the bill.

In the Belgian army, red epaulettes with white fringes are worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the [[Belgian Royal Escort|Royal Escort]] while fully red ones are worn by the [[Grenadiers]]. Trumpeters of the Royal Escort are distinguished by all red epaulettes while officers of the two units wear silver or gold respectively.

In the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], epaulettes are still worn on some Army [[Full dress|Full Dress]], [[Patrol Dress]], and [[Mess Dress]] uniforms. Epaulettes in the form of shoulder boards are worn with the officer's white Naval Service Dress. 

After the [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces|unification of the Forces]], and prior to the issue of the [[Uniforms of the Canadian Forces#Distinct Environmental Uniform|Distinct Environmental Uniforms]], musicians of the [[Band Branch (Canadian Forces)|Band Branch]] wore epaulettes of braided gold cord.

== France ==
Until 1914, officers of most [[French Army]] infantry regiments wore gold epaulettes in full dress, while those of mounted units wore silver. No insignia was worn on the epaulette itself, though the bullion fringe falling from the crescent differed according to rank.&lt;ref&gt;André Jouineau, Officers and Soldiers of the French Army 1914, {{ISBN|978-2-352-50104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ranks of most branches of the infantry, as well as [[cuirassier]]s wore detachable epaulettes of various colours (red for line infantry, green for [[Chasseur]]s, yellow for Colonial Infantry etc.) with woollen fringes, of a traditional pattern that dated back to the 18th Century. Other cavalry such as [[hussar]]s, [[dragoons]] and chasseurs à cheval wore special epaulettes of a style originally intended to deflect sword blows from the shoulder.
  
In the modern French Army, epaulettes are still worn by those units retaining 19th-century-style full dress uniforms, notably the [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|ESM Saint-Cyr]] and the [[Garde Républicaine]]. The [[French Foreign Legion]] continued to wear their green and red epaulettes, except for a break from 1915 to 1930. In recent years, the Marine Infantry and some other units have readopted their traditional fringed epaulettes in various colours for ceremonial parades. The [[Marine nationale]] and the [[Armée de l'Air]] do not use epaulettes, but non-commissioned and commissioned officers wear a gilded shoulder strap called ''attente'', which  original function was to clip the epaulette onto the shoulder. The ''[[attentes]]'' are also worn by Army generals on dress uniform.

== Germany ==
[[File:Epauletten Achselstücken Offiziere 1918.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;''Epauletten'', and the corresponding ''shoulder knots'' of the German Empire 1871-1918]]
Until World War I, officers of the Imperial German Army generally wore silver epaulettes as a distinguishing feature of their full-dress uniforms. For ranks up to and including captain these were "scale" epaulettes without fringes, for majors and colonels with fine fringes and for generals with a heavy fringe. The base of the epaulette was of regimental colors. For ordinary duty, dress "shoulder-cords" of silver braid intertwined with state colors, were worn.&lt;ref&gt;page 590, Volume XXVII, Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1919-45, [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] uniforms were known for a four cord braided "figure-of-eight" decoration which acted as a shoulder board for senior and general officers. This was called a "shoulder knot" and was in silver with the specialty color piping (for field officers) and silver with red border (for generals). Although it was once seen on US Army uniforms, it remains only in the [[Mess dress|mess uniform]]. A  similar form of shoulder knot was worn by officers of the [[British Army]] in full dress until 1914 and is retained by the [[Household Cavalry]] today. Epaulettes of this pattern are used by the [[Republic of Korea Army]]'s general officers and were widely worn by officers of the armies of Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia; all of which formerly wore uniforms closely following the Imperial German model. The Chilean Army still retains the German style of epaulette in the uniforms of its ceremonial units, the Military Academy and the NCO School while the 5th Cavalry Regiment "Aca Caraya" of the [[Paraguayan Army]] sports both epaulettes and shoulder knots in its dress uniforms (save for a platoon wearing [[Chaco War]] uniforms). Epaulettes of the German pattern (as well as shoulder knots) are used by officers of ceremonial units and schools of the [[Bolivian Army]].

==Haiti==
Gold epaulettes in [[Haiti]], were frequently worn throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in full dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-28YAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=haitian+army+gold+epaulettes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cTgM3AsFYh&amp;sig=62Y2n1At4l57S5cyY4ov5ugZhy0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fOSoVJDyA4SngwTY4oH4Aw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=haitian%20army%20gold%20epaulettes&amp;f=false |title=Education, Volume 23 |publisher=New England Publishing Company |page=281 |year=1903 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Haitian Revolution]], Gen.

== Sweden ==
Epaulettes first appeared on [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[uniform]]s in the second half of the 18th century. The epaulette was officially incorporated into Swedish uniform regulations in 1792, although foreign recruited regiments had had them earlier. Senior officers were to wear golden crowns to distinguish their rank from lower ranking officers who wore golden stars.

Epaulettes were discontinued on the field uniform in the mid-19th century, switching to rank insignia on the collar of the uniform jacket. Epaulettes were discontinued when they were removed from the general issue [[Full dress#Military|dress uniform]] in the 1930s. They are, however, still worn by the Royal Lifeguards and by military bands when in ceremonial full dress.

Epaulettes first appeared on British [[uniform]]s in the second half of the 18th century. The epaulette was officially incorporated into [[Royal Navy]] uniform regulations in 1795, although some officers wore them before this date. Under this system, [[flag officer]]s wore silver stars on their epaulettes to distinguish their ranks. A [[Captain (naval)|captain]] with at least three years seniority had two plain epaulettes, while a junior captain wore one on the right shoulder, and a [[commander]] one on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/search/lightbox.cfm/category/90266|title=Epaulettes at the National Maritime Museum website|author=|date=|work=NMM.ac.uk|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, army officers' large, gold-fringed epaulettes were abolished&lt;ref&gt;Major R.M. Barnes, page 260 "A History of the Regiments and Uniforms of the British Army", First Sphere Books edition 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a simplified equivalent officially known as twisted shoulder-cords.&lt;ref&gt;Section 24 "Dress Regulations for the Army 1900&lt;/ref&gt; These were generally worn with full dress uniforms until 1939. Naval officers retained the historic fringed epaulettes for full dress during this period.

British cavalry on active service in the Sudan (1898) and during the [[Boer War]] (1899–1902) sometimes wore epaulettes made of [[chainmail]] to protect against sword blows landing on the shoulder. The blue "Number 1 dress" uniforms of some British cavalry regiments and [[yeomanry]] units still retain this feature in ornamental silvered form.&lt;ref&gt;R.M. Barnes page 316 "Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire", Sphere Books 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902, the [[British Army]] stopped wearing epaulettes in the field, switching to rank insignia embroidered on the cuffs of the uniform jacket. During [[World War I]], this was found to make officers a target for snipers, so the insignia was frequently moved to the shoulder straps, where it was less conspicuous.

The current multi terrain pattern (MTP) and the older [[British Army uniform#No.8: Temperate combat dress|combat uniform]] (DPM) have the insignia formerly used on shoulder straps displayed on a single strap worn vertically in the centre of the chest.

== United States ==
[[File:CharlesGriffin.jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen. [[Charles Griffin]] wearing epaulettes during the [[American Civil War]]]]
Epaulettes were authorized for the [[United States Navy]] in the first official uniform regulations, ''Uniform of the Navy of the United States, 1797''. [[Captain (United States)|Captain]]s wore an epaulette on each shoulder, [[Lieutenant#Naval rank|lieutenant]]s wore only one, on the right shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Col.

Epaulettes were specified for all [[United States Army]] officers in 1832; infantry officers wore silver epaulettes, while those of the artillery and other branches wore gold epaulettes, following the French manner. The rank insignia was of a contrasting metal, silver on gold and vice versa.

In 1851, the epaulettes became universally gold. Both majors and second lieutenants had no specific insignia. A major would have been recognizable as he would have worn the more elaborate epaulette fringes of a senior field officer. The rank insignia was silver for senior officers and gold for the bars of captains and first lieutenants. The reason for the choice of silver eagles over gold ones is thought to be one of economy; there were more cavalry and artillery colonels than infantry so it was cheaper to replace the numerically fewer gold ones.

Shoulder straps were adopted to replace epaulettes for field duty in 1836.

Licensed officers of the [[U.S. Merchant Marine]] may wear [[shoulder marks]] and sleeve stripes appropriate to their rank and branch of service. Deck officers wear a foul anchor above the stripes on their shoulder marks and engineering officers wear a three-bladed propeller. In the U.S. Merchant Marine, the correct wear of shoulder marks depicting the fouled anchor is with the un-fouled stock of the anchor forward on the wearer.

==In popular culture==
In literature, film and political satire, [[dictator]]s, particularly of unstable [[Third World]] nations, are often depicted in military dress with oversized gold epaulettes.{{Citation needed|reason=Vague and unspecific. Provide examples perhaps?|date=January 2016}}

The eponymous character of ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' along with the rest of the duelists have stylised epaulettes on their uniforms.

The members of the Teikoku Kageki-dan from ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' have epaulettes on their uniforms.

'''Ethnic issues in China''' arise from [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], and other factors. They have driven historical movements such as the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] (which targeted the [[Mongol]] leadership of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]) and the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. Ethnic tensions have led to [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].

==Background==
{{main|Demographics of China}}
China is a largely-homogenous society; over 90 percent of its population has historically been [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title= China|accessdate= 2007-04-24|publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's [[List of ethnic groups in China and Taiwan|ethnic groups]] are distinguishable by [[physical appearance]] and relatively-low [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] rates. Others have married Han Chinese and resemble them. A growing number of ethnic minorities are fluent at a native level in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Children sometimes receive ethnic-minority status at birth if one of their parents belongs to an [[ethnic minority]], even if their ancestry is predominantly Han Chinese. Pockets of immigrants and foreign residents exist in some cities.

A 100-day crackdown on illegal foreigners in Beijing began in May 2012, with Beijing residents wary of foreign nationals due to recent crimes.&lt;ref name=steinfeld&gt;Jemimah Steinfeld, 25 May 2012, [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/24/world/asia/china-foreigners/index.html?hpt=ias_t2 Mood darkens in Beijing amid crackdown on 'illegal foreigners'], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15 May 2012, [https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/05/15/beijing-pledges-to-clean-out-illegal-foreigners/ Beijing Pledges to ‘Clean Out’ Illegal Foreigners], China Real Time Report, Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; [[China Central Television]] host Yang Rui said, controversially, that "foreign trash" should be cleaned out of the capital. &lt;ref name=steinfeld/&gt;

===Racism in Imperial China===
[[File:1900 killing of foreigners.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=See caption|1861 [[Woodblock printing|woodblock print]] of Westerners (depicted as a pig and a goat) being executed by Chinese officials]]
Racial discrimination by the ruling Han Chinese in [[History of China#Imperial China|imperial China]] has been documented in historical texts such as [[Yan Shigu]]'s commentary on the ''[[Book of Han]]'', in which the [[Wusun]] people were called "barbarians who have green eyes and red hair" and compared to [[macaque]]s.&lt;ref name="yanshigu"&gt;''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.guoxue123.com/shibu/0101/01hsyz/111.htm with commentary by Yan Shigu] '''Original text''':　烏孫於西域諸戎其形最異。今之胡人青眼、赤須，狀類彌猴者，本其種也。&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ethnic conflicts resulted in genocides.

According to 20th-century social and cultural critic [[Lu Xun]], "Throughout the ages, Chinese have had only two ways of looking at foreigners, up to them as superior beings or down on them as wild animals."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, ''Chinese Shadows'' (New York: The Viking Press, 1977), 1. Leys has noted that Lu Xun's polemical utterance can be applied to the Maoist bureaucracy at the time Leys wrote his book. However, Leys also pointed out that it would be unfair to apply Lu Xun's statement to the Chinese people in general. As according to Leys, the Chinese people themselves are friendly and hospitable to foreigners.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mongols]] divided groups into a four-class [[caste|caste system]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Merchants and non-Mongol overseers were usually immigrants or local ethnic groups: [[Turkestani]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslims and [[Christian]]s. Foreigners from outside the Mongol Empire, such as the [[Marco Polo|Polo family]], were welcomed.

Despite the Muslims' high position, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them: restricting [[halal]] slaughter and other Islamic practices, such as [[circumcision]] (and [[kosher]] butchering for Jews). Genghis Khan called Muslims "slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QyhCTMOnLoL_8AbNt5DADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yuan%20dynasty%20halal&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QyhCTMOnLoL_8AbNt5DADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=yuan%20dynasty%20halal&amp;f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=|pages=229, 230|isbn=0-8122-4237-8&lt;!--|nopp=340--&gt;|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim generals eventually joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols.

Anti-Japanese sentiment primarily stems from [[Japanese war crimes]] committed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

Most Muslims in Tibet are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai (the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]), in 1949 the Communists ended violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, recent Tibetan-Muslim violence occurred. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over a bone in soups and the price of balloons; Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans, attacking Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans burned the apartments and shops of Muslims, and Muslims stopped wearing their traditional headwear and began to pray in secret.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |date=23 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archivedate=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese-speaking Hui also have problems with the Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking [[Kache]] Muslim minority).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 0-415-99194-3| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is "nihilation", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled "barbarians" or "devils", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as "foreign devils" (''yangguizi''), "devil slaves" (''guinu''), "barbarian devils" (''fangui''), "island barbarians" (''daoyi''), "blue-eyed barbarian slaves" (''biyan yinu''), or "red-haired barbarians" (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992). The Discourse of Race in Modern China. Stanford University Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chinese orthography]] provides opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically. Some [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically-pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. For example, the name of the [[Yao people]] was transcribed as [[wikt:猺|猺]], a character which also means "jackal" and is written with the [[Radical 94|dog radical]] 犭. This name for the Yao, developed by 11th-century [[Song dynasty]] authors, has been replaced twice in 20th-century language reforms: with the invented character ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] (with the [[Radical 9|human radical]] 亻) and with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] (with the [[Radical 96|jade radical]] 玉), which can also mean "precious jade". Although the characters have the same pronunciation, they have different [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radicals]] (which convey different meanings).

'''Expertise finding''' is the use of tools for finding and assessing individual [[expertise]]. In the recruitment industry, e.g., [[LinkedIn]], expertise finding is the problem of searching for employable candidates with certain required [[skill]]s set.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Importance of expertise ==

It can be argued that [https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com.ph/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1109&amp;context=student human expertise] is more valuable than capital, means of production or intellectual property. Contrary to expertise, all other aspects of capitalism are now relatively generic: access to capital is global, as is access to means of production for many areas of manufacturing.  [[Intellectual property]] can be similarly licensed.  Furthermore, expertise finding is also a key aspect of [[institutional memory]], as without its experts an institution is effectively decapitated.  However, finding and "licensing" expertise, the key to the effective use of these resources, remain much harder, starting with the very first step: finding expertise that you can trust.

Until very recently, finding expertise required a mix of individual, social and collaborative practices, a haphazard process at best.  Mostly, it involved contacting individuals one trusts and asking them for referrals, while hoping that one's judgment about those individuals is justified and that their answers are thoughtful.

In the last fifteen years, a class of [[knowledge management]] software has emerged to facilitate and improve the quality of expertise finding, termed "expertise locating systems".  These software range from [[Social network service|social networking systems]] to [[knowledge base]]s.  Some software, like those in the social networking realm, rely on users to connect each other, thus using social filtering to act as [[Recommender system|"recommender systems"]].

At the other end of the spectrum are specialized [[knowledge base]]s that rely on experts to populate a specialized type of [[database]] with their self-determined areas of expertise and contributions, and do not rely on user recommendations.  Hybrids that feature expert-populated content in conjunction with user recommendations also exist, and are arguably more valuable for doing so.

Still other expertise knowledge bases rely strictly on external manifestations of expertise, herein termed "gated objects", e.g., [[citation impact]]s for scientific papers or [[data mining]] approaches wherein many of the work products of an expert are collated.  Such systems are more likely to be free of user-introduced biases (e.g., [http://researchscorecard.com/ ResearchScorecard] ), though the use of computational methods can introduce other biases.

There are also hybrid approaches which use user-generated data (e.g., member profiles), community-based signals (e.g., recommendations and skill endorsements), and personalized signals (e.g., social connection between searcher and results), as at LinkedIn.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Ha-Thuc|first=Viet|last2=Venkataraman|first2=Ganesh|last3=Rodriguez|first3=Mario|last4=Sinha|first4=Shakti|last5=Sundaram|first5=Senthil|last6=Guo|first6=Lin|date=2016-02-15|title=Personalized Expertise Search at LinkedIn|eprint=1602.04572|class=cs.IR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the systems outlined above are listed in Table 1.

== Technical problems ==
A number of interesting problems follow from the use of expertise finding systems:

* The matching of questions from non-expert to the database of existing expertise is inherently difficult, especially when the database does not store the requisite expertise.  This problem grows even more acute with increasing ignorance on the part of the non-expert due to typical search problems involving use of keywords to search unstructured data that are not semantically normalized, as well as variability in how well an expert has set up their descriptive content pages.  Improved question matching is one reason why third-party semantically normalized systems such as [http://researchscorecard.com ResearchScorecard] and [[BiomedExperts]] should be able to provide better answers to queries from non-expert users.
* Avoiding expert-fatigue due to too many questions/requests from users of the system (ref. 1).
* Finding ways to avoid "gaming" of the system to reap unjustified expertise [[credibility]].
* Infer expertise on implicit skills. Since users typically do not declare all of the skills they have, it is important to infer their implicit skills that are highly related their explicit ones. The inference step can significantly improve [[Precision and recall|recall]] in expertise finding.

== Expertise ranking ==

Means of classifying and ranking expertise (and therefore experts) become essential if the number of experts returned by a query is greater than a handful.  This raises the following social problems associated with such systems:

* How can expertise be assessed objectively? Is that even possible?
* What are the consequences of relying on unstructured social assessments of expertise, such as user recommendations?
* How does one distinguish [[Authority|''authoritativeness'']] as a proxy metric of expertise from simple ''popularity'', which is often a function of one's ability to express oneself coupled with a good social sense?
* What are the potential consequences of the social or professional stigma associated with the use of an authority ranking, such as used in [http://technorati.com Technorati] and [http://researchscorecard.com ResearchScorecard])?
* How to make expertise ranking personalized to each individual searcher? This is particularly important for recruiting purpose since given the same skills, recruiters from different companies, industries, locations might have different preferences on candidates&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sources of data for assessing expertise ==
Many types of data sources have been used to infer expertise.  They can be broadly categorized based on whether they measure "raw" contributions provided by the expert, or whether some sort of filter is applied to these contributions.

Unfiltered data sources that have been used to assess expertise, in no particular ranking order:

* user recommendations
* help desk tickets: what the problem was and who fixed it
* e-mail traffic between users
* documents, whether private or on the web, particularly publications
* user-maintained web pages
* reports (technical, marketing, etc.)

Filtered data sources, that is, contributions that require approval by third parties (grant committees, referees, patent office, etc.) are particularly valuable for measuring expertise in a way that minimizes biases that follow from popularity or other social factors:

* [[patent]]s, particularly if issued
* scientific publications
* issued grants (failed grant proposals are rarely know beyond the authors)
* [[clinical trial]]s
* product launches
* pharmaceutical drugs

== Approaches for creating expertise content ==
* Manual, either by experts themselves (e.g., [https://skillhive.com Skillhive]) or by a curator ([http://expertisefinder.com/ Expertise Finder])
* Automated, e.g., using [[software agent]]s (e.g., MIT's [http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/Expert-Finder/Expert-Finder-Intro.html ExpertFinder]) or a combination of agents and human curation (e.g., [http://researchscorecard.com/ ResearchScorecard] )
* In industrial expertise search engines (e.g., LinkedIn), there are many signals coming into the ranking functions, such as, user-generated content (e.g., profiles), community-generated content (e.g., recommendations and skills endorsements) and personalized signals (e.g., social connections). Moreover, user queries might contain many other aspects rather required expertise, such as, locations, industries or companies. Thus, traditional [[information retrieval]] features like text matching are also important. [[Learning to rank]] is typically used to combine all of these signals together into a ranking function&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==1950==
After [[World War II]] ended, [[fashion]] was in transition. New fabrics and techniques were invented, and people created new styles and silhouettes. 

In [[Paris]], [[Christian Dior|Dior]] launched the "vertical line", also known as the [[sheath dress]]. Its overall silhouette was long and narrow. Generally, it was made with three pieces: a [[bodice]], [[skirt]] and [[jacket]]. The bodice was high V-shaped with shirring necklines with long straight sleeves, the skirt was narrow and slim, and the jacket was short and boxy.

==1951==
The tiny [[Waistline (clothing)|waistline]] became a popular style this year. Many designers emphasized the waistline, especially Dior. He hired technicians with new skills to create higher waistlines for his collection. 

The [[United States]]' new trends spread all around the world. The "[[American Look (fashion movement)|American Look]]" especially appealed to teenagers. 

Many designers were focusing on the sleeve. Sleeves were still wide but were becoming softer and smoother than previous styles. Popular styles of this year were tailored [[tweed (cloth)|tweed]] dresses, ankle-length [[evening gown|evening dresses]], and small daytime [[hat]]s with jewels and fur trimming. Popular colors were charcoal grey, green tones, blue tones, purple, and orchid pink.

==1952== 
This year was all about changes of waistline, from the high waist to the no waist.

Among designers, Dior and [[Cristóbal Balenciaga|Balenciaga]] led fashion trends. Dior presented high-waisted garments with [[swimsuit]]-inspired tight shapes from neck to hips, which flared smoothly over the knees. Balenciaga went another direction, with slack-waist dresses and middle length skirts. Balenciaga made the silhouette almost not touch the body. The choices of personal fashion styles represented the freedom of women's lives after World War II ended.

==1953==
This year focused on shape and sheen. The waistline became more loose. The half-fitted suit and sheath dress were introduced. Hair lengths and skirt lengths became shorter. The skirt lengths were up to 14 to 15 1/2 inches from the ground. The hair trend called "the Italian haircut" is a layered short [[Hairstyle|haircut]] with curly hair, also known as "the puddle haircut". The common silhouette of women's wear had bulky shoulders with wide [[lapel]]s around the chest. 

Necklines were accessorized with jeweled scarves. Accessories were a big trend in 1953, becoming more showy, with some designers even embedding jewels in the heels of shoes. The most common accessory for women was the long cotton, wool, silk or fur [[shawl]]; it could work with different occasions and outfits.

==1954==
The tiny waist and full skirt lost their dominance in the shape of style. Rather than emphasizing the waist, women started makes their breasts pointy and big. 

Designers created relaxed silhouettes, such as the [[Pencil skirt|H-line]]  skirt from Dior. Its shape was straight from the shoulder to the hip.  It was more than two inches bigger than Dior's previous silhouette. 

This year, the mood was elegant and the colors were soft and bright. Coats or jackets always came with dresses or other outfits. Among the variety of jacket designs, [[Ben Zuckerman]] created the "skyscraper jacket", which had a short bosom-length [[Bolero jacket|bolero]]. The pants were shorter and long sweaters were often worn over skirts. 

Brown was the most used basic color and popular colors were ivory and green.

==1955==
Clothes became contemporary. The women's style became simple but at the same time had sex appeal, and the flavor was from the 1920s. 

The fashion of this year was strongly influenced by Asian designers, especially from [[Japan]] and [[India]]. The "Oriental look" from [[Givenchy]] led the trend. Indian [[sari]]s and tunic were extremely popular. This year's casual clothes were the most demanded style than previously couture, though still popular. Dressing up desire was at its peak in 1955. Women loved to wear long evening dresses rather than short basic dresses. Evening dresses were made with light [[wool]] [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] or thick wool with gold jewels. The desire to be fancy was reflected in the fabric; manufacturers made wool or tweed with [[Mink fur|mink]], [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[Angora wool|angora]]. Because of the influences from Asian fashion, a variety of tones of red, emerald green, yellow and sapphire blue were popular.

==1956==
While women used to wear comfortable clothes, people were starting to look for more personal and formal clothes, and went back to the classics. The big influence for this movement was American Broadway musicals such as ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. The style in the musical was following the previous style of [[World War I]]. 

[[Silk]], [[satin]] and chiffon were popular this year. The Asian style became more powerful with influential elements due to the world becoming more accessible via trading. For the comfortable daytime look, fluffy knit and long-length [[Coat (clothing)|coats]] were popular.

==1957==
[[Coco Chanel|Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel]] became a big name in 1957. She introduced the legendary [[two-piece suit]] which had a boxy fit, open button jacket with [[blouse]] inside, pockets decorations, cuffs made with [[pearl]]s, and H-line skirt. Not only did the suit become the iconic style, but also [[Pullover (garment)|pullovers]] fabricated with [[Jersey (fabric)|jerseys]] and tweeds and [[lace]] evening dresses became the most elegant look of women. 

The biggest news in the fashion industry was the death of Christian Dior, and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Saint Laurent]] replaced him. 

Women started to come down from [[stiletto heel]]s due to the disappearance of the waistline, and [[hemline]]s were made higher so that the legs could look longer without heels. The [[cloche hat]] with a loose [[pleated skirt]] was a popular common fashion in 1957.

==1958==
This year saw another change of shape. Due to some people not liking the new loose shape like Balenciaga's "sack dress", a new shape came out: the triangle shape called "[[Trapeze dress|trapeze]]". People's demand was widening, and one dominant shape was no longer wanted. 

Coats were also made with the trapeze shape, which looked like a bell. Coats were presented with more designs of collars and details. Hats and shoes were important in 1958. Luxurious materials were often used, such as  [[Fox fur|fox]], [[lynx]] and mink. 

The popular young generation's look was a bulky sweater with skinny skirts or pants. Beige was the most used basic color and popular colors were bright yellow, blue, magenta red, and fuchsia pink.

==1959==
Many designers started to create a new silhouette by manipulating fabrics. The "sack dress" was still in existence, but was on its way out in 1959. Necklines became more three-dimensional by folding the fabrics and creating geometric shapes around the shoulders. 

Chanel was still the most wanted designer. Her comfortable new casual look fascinated people for a long time. Women preferred the formal jacket to be longer and slimmer. Fabrics and details became more luxurious, such as mink, [[sable]], [[leopard]], fox and even [[tiger]]. Popular colors were olive green, brown, and black and white contrast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12160">The problem in [[number theory]] known as "[[Fermat's Last Theorem]]" has repeatedly received attention in fiction and popular culture.

==Television==
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]", the Doctor transmits a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by typing it in just a few seconds on a laptop, to prove his genius to a collection of world leaders discussing the latest threat to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2014/10/17/homers-last-theorem.html |last=Singh |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Singh |date=2014-10-17 |access-date=2018-09-10 |website=[[Boing Boing]] |title=Homer's Last Theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[The Royale]]", an episode (first aired 27 March 1989) of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', begins with [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] attempting to solve the puzzle in his ready room; he remarks to [[William Riker|Riker]] that the theorem had remained unproven for 800 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/news/a28040/fermats-last-theorem-star-trek-the-next-generation/ |title=Here's a Fun Math Goof in 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' |website=[[Popular Mechanics]] |last=Moseman |first=Andrew |date=2017-09-01 |access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captain ends the episode with the line "Like Fermat's theorem, it is a puzzle we may never solve." Wiles' proof was released five years after the episode aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kevin Knudson |date=20 August 2015 |title=The Math Of Star Trek: How Trying To Solve Fermat's Last Theorem Revolutionized Mathematics |publisher=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinknudson/2015/08/20/the-math-of-star-trek-how-trying-to-solve-fermats-last-theorem-revolutionized-mathematics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem was again mentioned in a subsequent ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode called "[[Facets (DS9 episode)|Facets]]" in June 1995,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/geek-trivia-the-math-behind-the-myth/|title=Geek Trivia: The math behind the myth|last=Garmon|first=Jay|date=|work=[[TechRepublic]]|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Jadzia Dax]] comments that one of her previous hosts, [[Tobin Dax#Tobin Dax|Tobin Dax]], had "the most original approach to the proof since Wiles over 300 years ago."
* A sum, proved impossible by the theorem, appears in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets|first=Simon|last=Singh|isbn=978-1-4088-3530-2|year=2013|location=London|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three-dimensional world in "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;", the equation &lt;math&gt;1782^{12} + 1841^{12} = 1922^{12}&lt;/math&gt; is visible, just as the dimension begins to collapse. The joke is that the twelfth root of the sum does evaluate to 1922 due to rounding errors when entered into most handheld calculators; the left hand side is odd, while &lt;math&gt;1922^{12}&lt;/math&gt; is even, so the equality cannot hold. (The twelfth root of the left-hand side is not 1922, but approximately 1921.99999996.) A second "counterexample" appeared in a later episode, "[[The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace]]": &lt;math&gt;3987^{12} + 4365^{12} = 4472^{12}&lt;/math&gt;. These agree to 10 of 44 decimal digits, but simple [[Divisibility rule#Divisibility by 3|divisibility rules]] show 3987 and 4365 are multiples of 3 so that a sum of their powers is also. The same rule reveals that 4472 is ''not'' divisible by 3, so that this "equation" cannot hold either.

==Theater==
* In [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'', Septimus Hodge poses the problem of proving Fermat's Last Theorem to the precocious Thomasina Coverly (who is perhaps a mathematical prodigy), in an attempt to keep her busy. Thomasina responds that Fermat had no proof and claimed otherwise in order to torment later generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guaspari|first=David|date=1996|title=Stoppard's Arcadia|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4613314|journal=[[The Antioch Review]]|volume=54|issue=2|pages=222–238|doi=10.2307/4613314|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after ''Arcadia'' opened in London, Andrew Wiles announced his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a coincidence of timing that resulted in news stories about the proof quoting Stoppard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Love and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Tom Stoppard's ''Arcadia'' |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |journal=[[Notices of the AMS]] |year=1995 |volume=42 |number=11 |pages=1284&amp;ndash;1287 |url=https://www.ams.org/notices/199511/arcadia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prose fiction==
* [[Arthur Porges]]' short story "[[The Devil and Simon Flagg]]" features a [[mathematician]] who bargains with the [[Devil]] that the latter cannot produce a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasman|first=Alex|date=January 2003|title=Mathematics in Fiction: An Interdisciplinary Course|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F10511970308984042|journal=[[PRIMUS (journal)|PRIMUS]]|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10511970308984042|issn=1051-1970|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devil is not successful and is last seen beginning a collaboration with the hero.

*[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s 1939 essay titled "[[The Total Library]]", a precursor to the short story "[[The Library of Babel]]", mentions "the proof of Pierre Fermat's theorem" in an imaginative list of texts that would exist in a total library. Borges also alluded to Fermat's Last Theorem in his detective story "[[The Aleph (short story collection)|Ibn-Khakam al-Bokhari, Murdered in His Labyrinth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irwin |first=John T. |authorlink=John Irwin (academic) |title=The Mystery to a Solution: Poe, Borges, and the Analytic Detective Story |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=1994 |isbn=9780801854668 |oclc=27895797}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the book ''[[The Oxford Murders (novel)|The Oxford Murders]]'' by [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martinez]], Wiles's announcement in Cambridge of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem forms a peripheral part of the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Mary W.|date=June 2007|title=The Oxford Murders|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02985700|journal=[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=77–78|doi=10.1007/bf02985700|issn=0343-6993|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Oxford Murders (film)|Its 2007 film version]] shows "Professor Henry Wilkins"' ([[Martin Nigel Davey]]) proof of "Bormat"'s Last Theorem at Cambridge.

==Movies==
* Fermat's equation also appears in the movie ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]'' with [[Elizabeth Hurley]] and [[Brendan Fraser]]. Hurley plays the devil who, in one of her many forms, appears as a school teacher who assigns Fermat's Last Theorem as a homework problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:TaoistCharm.JPG|thumb|right|100px|A Daoist ''fulu'' talisman]]
{{Taoism}}
'''Fulu''' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:符籙|符籙]]}}) is a term for Daoist practitioners in the past who could draw and write supernatural talismans, ''Fu'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:符|符]]}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transasiart.com/Numismatique/numismatique_chine/amulettes/religieuses/ncnamurel.htm|title= Amulettes religieuses (Religious charms).|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=6 July 2018|work= François Thierry de Crussol (TransAsiart)|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shenfu'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:神符|神符]]}}) which they believed functioned as summons or instructions to deities, spirits, or as tools of [[exorcism]],&lt;ref&gt;The Tao of Craft: Fu Talismans and Casting Sigils in the Eastern Esoteric Tradition by Benenell Wen. Publisher: North Atlantic Books. Publication date: September 27, 2016. {{ISBN|978-1623170660}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicinal potions]] for ailments.  It is believed by Taoists that in the past the ability to write Shenfu had been once decreed by their deities to authorized priests or ''daoshi''. Lu ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:籙|籙]]}}) is a register and compilation of the membership of the daoshi as well as the skills they were able to use.  These practitioners are also called ''Fulu Pai'' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:符籙派|符籙派]]}}) or the ''Fulu Sect'' made up of daoshi from different schools or offshoots of Taojia.

== Daoist scripture ==
One of the earliest classical scripture referring to Fu was the [[Huangdi Yinfujing]] ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:黃帝陰符經|黃帝陰符經]]}}), although it does not contain specific instructions to write any talisman.

The second chapter of each of the three grottoes in the [[Daozang]] is a record of the history and feats of the Fulu Sect.

== Fu on Taoist talismanic coins ==

[[File:91619 SMVK EM objekt 1016716 (1).jpg|thumb|left|A Taoist charm or talisman coin that contains Taoist "magic writing" on display at the [[Museum of Ethnography, Sweden]].]]

Fu script was also used on Taoist coin talismans (many of which resemble [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash coins]]), many of these talismans haven't been deciphered yet but a specimen where Fu was used next to what is believed to be their equivalent [[Hanzi|Chinese characters]] exists. On rare occasions Taoist Fu writing has also been found on Buddhist numismatic charms and amulets. Most of these coin talismans that feature Fu writings request [[Lei Gong]] to protect its carriers from evil spirits and misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://primaltrek.com/daoist.html|title= Daoist (Taoist) Charms - 道教品壓生錢 - Introduction and History of Daoist Charms.|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=10 May 2018|work= Gary Ashkenazy / גארי אשכנזי (Primaltrek – a journey through Chinese culture)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TAOISTSECRET.COM [http://www.taoistsecret.com/taoist.html Taoist Talismans].

The '''Goethe-Institut, New York''' is an organization that is located at 30 [[Irving Place]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The organization is part of the worldwide [[Goethe-Institut]] non-profit association. It fosters cultural cooperation and promotes [[German language]] learning by offering the public opportunities to interact with themes and questions relevant to [[German culture]] and society.
The institute provides grants for translation in subject areas like democracy, current regional and [[global issue]]s, the cultural dimension of European integration, recent [[German history]] or outstanding works of contemporary German literature.

== History ==
The Goethe-Institut New York origins were with the Goethe-Haus (New York), ''an organization founded for the purpose of furthering cultural relations between the people of Germany and the people of the United States,'' The Goethe House was founded April 12, 1957, as an American non-profit membership corporation in New York City.

The institute has its beginning in the Goethe Etage, an office building at 120 East 56th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, to provide enough space for its books, small exhibitions, and lectures.

The inaugural address was given by [[James Bryant Conant|James B. Conant]], former President of Harvard University, [[John Jay McCloy|John J. McCloy's]] successor as High Commissioner in Germany, and from 1955-57 America's first Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany. John J. McCloy, Chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, had presented the plan for the establishment of such a cultural center to Chancellor of Germany [[Konrad Adenauer]] three years earlier.

James B. Conant became President of Goethe House, John J. McCloy became Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Under the stewardship of McCloy and his former political adviser in Germany Samuel Reber, who becomes Goethe House's first administrator, the cultural center served as a forum for German representatives in art and culture.

The German government gives Goethe House a new home at 1014 Fifth Avenue. Acquired from the estate of [[James W. Gerard]], pre-World War I American Ambassador to Imperial Germany, the mansion becomes the home of Goethe House for over fifty years.

In 1969 the Goethe House, while retaining its original name, became a branch of the Munich-based [[Goethe-Institut]] and since then received financial support from the Federal Republic of Germany.

''Goethe-Institut Curatorial Residencies Ludlow 38'' was founded as a space in 2008 for experiments within contemporary art. The venue is located on the Lower East Side in the tradition of the German Kunstverein.

On April 15, 2010 the Goethe-Institut New York announced the relocation of its library and administrative offices to 72 Spring Street. 
Located in the East Village off Bowery, the Wyoming Building became a space for talks, performances, film screenings, installations, and exhibitions.

The building at 30 Irving Place opens in March 2015 to the public with space for lectures and film screenings, a library, reading rooms, language classrooms, and offices.

The Goethe-Institut New York offers German language courses from April 2015.

The Goethe-Institut New York is also regional coordinator of 10 institutes and one center in the [[North America]]n region, which comprises [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and [[Mexico]], and committed to the same set of goals and objectives. In the United States: [[Boston]], New York, [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Los Angeles]], and the Goethe-Zentrum in Atlanta. In Canada: [[Ottawa]], [[Montreal]], and [[Toronto]]. In Mexico: [[Mexico City]].

A '''horse culture''' is a [[tribe|tribal group]] or [[community]] whose day-to-day life revolves around the herding and breeding of [[horse]]s. Beginning with the [[domestication of the horse]] on the steppes of [[Eurasia]], the horse transformed each society that adopted its use. Notable examples are the [[Mongols]] of [[Mongolia]], the [[Scythian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads of [[Central Asia]], and the [[American Indians in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Great Plains]] after horses were imported from [[Europe]], particularly from [[Spain]], during the 16th century.

History offers many examples of horse cultures, such as the [[Huns]] and [[Eurasian nomads|other peoples in Europe and Asia]].  Horse cultures tend to place a great deal of importance on horses and by their very nature are [[nomad]]ic and usually [[hunter-gatherer]] or [[nomadic pastoralist]] societies.  For example, the arrival of the horse in the Americas revolutionized the culture of the [[Plains Indians]].  The horse increased mobility; the ability of the horse to cover a lot of ground in a very short period of time allowed native people to easily move from place to place, bringing on a nomadic shift in their culture, with an impact on transportation, trade, hunting and warfare.

However, there were also disadvantages to adopting horse culture, such as the increased responsibility of caring for the horses and keeping them healthy.  [[Social structure]]s of the community also had to shift to accommodate the physical space for horses to graze and feed easily.

'''Licitars''' ({{IPA-hr|lǐtsitaːr|pron}}) are colorfully decorated biscuits made of sweet honey dough that are part of  [[Croatia]]'s cultural heritage. They are a traditional symbol of the Croatian capital [[Zagreb]]. They are used as an ornamental gift, often given at celebrations of love such as weddings and St. Valentine's Day. At Christmas time, the city of Zagreb and the Christmas tree in the main square in particular are festooned with thousands of licitar hearts.

In 2010, [[UNESCO]] added the ''Gingerbread craft from Northern Croatia'' to the "Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage" for Croatian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/forty_six_new_elements_added_to_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ UNESCO: Forty-six new elements added to Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and tradition ==

The tradition of making and giving Licitars stretching as far back as the 16th century. Licitar makers, known as ''Medičari'', were highly regarded in society, and their Licitars very much sought after (licitars were more sentimental than giving a bouquet of roses). Even today the tradition is kept alive by a select few who covert the art in family secrecy, and their methods of production have scarcely changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.licitar.hr/ Licitar; toplo srce hrvatskoga puka]&lt;/ref&gt; One Licitar still takes over a month to make.
[[File:Samobor Licitar.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Licitar Hearts in [[Samobor]] ]]
Licitars became famous due to their being sold at the [[Marian shrine]] of [[Marija Bistrica]] (near Zagreb) to which pilgrims visited St Mary of Bistrica for the Assumption or St Margaret's Day. Although not a religious symbol, licitars were often bought to take home as a reminder of their long and sometimes arduous journey to [[Zagorje]]. Licitars' simple shape and attractive colour and decorations were a keen souvenir to show their families and neighbours when they came back.

== Ingredients and preparation ==

[[File:Lect7.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Licitar workshop in [[Radovljica]]]] Licitars are made using traditional ingredients, methods and devotion. Their ingredients are simple (honey, flour, eggs, water and natural colours) but their preparation is long. The dough matures for a few days, then is shaped and baked and left for two weeks to dry. Colouring is the next step after which they are left to dry again for two weeks. Once dry the licitars are finally decorated and again left to dry for a week.

Traditionally Licitars are 100% handmade, decorated with a swirling outline, small flowers and a small mirror. Being made of honey dough and natural products Licitars are also edible.

Licitars are referred to as [[gingerbread]], though they do not actually contain [[ginger]].

== Modern uses ==

In modern times Licitars are traditional Croatian souvenirs (and can be found in all Croatian airports and in many tourist gift shops), Christmas tree decorations, wedding favours for guests, business gifts, many other ornamental purposes, and is still given as a way of showing your affection to the ones you love.

'''Lithuanization''' (sometimes also called ''Lithuanianization'') is a process of [[cultural assimilation]]—either forced or voluntary—adoption of [[Lithuania]]n culture or [[Lithuanian language|language]] experienced by non-Lithuanian people or groups of people.

== History ==

[[File:Mapa rozsiedlenia ludności polskiej na terenie Litwy w 1929.jpg|thumb|Map of the Polish population in Lithuania on the basis of elections to the parliament of Lithuania in 1923, censuses in 1921 and elections to the Polish parliament in 1922,]]

In the early Middle Ages the consolidation of Baltic lands by the [[Duchy of Lithuania]] led to gradual Lithuanization and subsequent assimilation of neighboring Baltic tribes or their parts, including the [[Selonians]], [[Jotvingians]], [[Nadruvians]] and [[Curonians]] who shared religious, cultural, and linguistic similarities with the Lithuanians.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Lithuanian annexation of [[Ruthenia]]n lands between the 13th and 15th centuries was accompanied by some Lithuanization. A large part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] remained Ruthenian, since due to a religious, linguistic and cultural dissimilarity there was less assimilation between the ruling nobility of the pagan Lithuanians and the conquered Orthodox [[Eastern Slavs]]. Moreover, following the military and diplomatic expansion of the Grand Duchy into the Ruthenian and Russian lands, local leaders retained a significant autonomy that limited the amalgamation of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Orest Subtelny ''Ukraine. A History''. Second edition, 1994. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Even when some localities received the appointed [[Gediminid]] leaders, the [[Lithuanian nobility|Lithuanian higher nobility]] in the Ruthenian lands largely embraced the Slavic customs and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and became indistinguishable from a larger [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] nobility resulting in the two cultures merging to the extent that much of the upper class of Ruthenians merged into Lithuanian nobility and began to call themselves Lithuanians ''gente Rutenus natione Lituanus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalizacija yra unifikacija |last=Bumblauskas |first=Alfredas |work=alfa.lt |language=Lithuanian |url=https://www.tv3.lt/naujiena/268743/a-bumblauskas-globalizacija-yra-unifikacija |date=2005-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Litvin]]y),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YkiiknLBao0C&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=called+themselves+Litviny&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=called%20themselves%20Litviny&amp;f=false Marshall Cavendish, "The Peoples of Europe", Benchmark Books, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; yet spoke the [[Ruthenian language]]&lt;ref name="Łukowski"&gt;{{cite book | author =Jerzy Lukowski |author2=Hubert Zawadzki  | title =A Concise History of Poland | year = 2001| editor = | pages =33–45 | publisher =[[Cambridge University]] Press | location =Cambridge | isbn =0-521-55917-0 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=NpMxTvBuWHYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Jagiello}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plokhy"&gt;{{cite book | author =Serhii Plokhy | title =The Origins of the Slavic Nations: Premodern Identities in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus | year =2006 | editor = | pages =109–111 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]] | location =Cambridge | isbn =0-521-86403-8| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pCdUmCWxwJ8C&amp;pg=RA7-PA109&amp;lpg=RA7-PA109&amp;dq=Lithuanization }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KostRuth&gt;"The son of Gediminas, the Grand Prince Olgerd [(Algirdas)] expanded the Ruthenian lands he inherited from his father: he attached the Polish lands to his state expelling the Tatars out. The Ruthenian lands under his sovereignty were divided between princes. However, Olgerd, the person of a strong character, controlled them. In Kiev, he installed his son, Vladimir, who started the new line of Kiev princes that reigned there for over a century and called commonly the Olelkoviches, from Olelko, Aleksandr Vladimirovich, the grand-son of Olgerd. Olgerd himself, married twice the Ruthenian princesses, allowed his sons to baptize into Ruthenian religion and, as the Ruthenian Chronicles speak, had himself baptized and died as a monk. As such, the princes that replaced the St. Vladimir's [Rurikid] line in Ruthenia, became as Ruthenian by religion and by the ethnicity they adopted, as the princes of the line that preceded them. The Lithuanian state was called Lithuania, but of course it was purely Ruthenian and would have remained Ruthenian if only the successor of Olgerd in the Great Princehood, the Jagiello wouldn't have married in 1386 to the Polish queen Jadwiga"&lt;br&gt;{{ru icon}} [[Nikolay Kostomarov]], ''Russian History in Biographies of its main figures'', section ''[http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Knyaz Kostantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhsky]'' ([[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]])&lt;/ref&gt; In the effect of the processes, Lithuanian higher nobility became largely Ruthenian,&lt;ref name=EB1&gt;"Within the [Lithuanian] Grand Duchy, the Ruthenian lands initially retained considerable autonomy. The pagan Lithuanians themselves were increasingly converting to Orthodoxy and assimilating into Ruthenian culture. The grand duchy's administrative practices and legal system drew heavily on Slavic customs, and Ruthenian became the official state language. Direct Polish rule in Ukraine since the 1340s and for two centuries thereafter was limited to Galicia. There, changes in such areas as administration, law, and land tenure proceeded more rapidly than in Ukrainian territories under Lithuania. However, Lithuania itself was soon drawn into the orbit of Poland."&lt;br&gt;from ''Ukraine''. (2006). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt; while the nobility in the ethnic Lithuania and [[Samogitia]] continued to use their native Lithuanian language.

A notable example of Lithuanization was the 19th century replacement of Jews (many of them [[Lithuanian Jews]], but also [[Polish Jews]]), until then the largest ethnic group among the burghers in the major towns of Lithuania, with ethnic [[Lithuanians]] migrating there from the countryside. As such, the process of Lithuanization was mostly [[demography|demographic]] and not institutionalized.&lt;ref name="CoJR"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Conference on Jewish Relations (corporate author) | year =1939 | title = Jewish social studies| journal =Jewish Social Studies | volume =VIII | issue = | pages =272–274 | id = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=2Jp3-QhefYsC&amp;q=Lithuanization&amp;dq=Lithuanization | publisher =Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until [[Lithuania]] became an independent state in the effect of [[World War I]] that the government of Lithuania turned it into a more institutionalized process.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn"&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Ezra Mendelsohn]] | title =The Jews of East Central Europe Between the World Wars | year =1983 | editor = | pages =225–230 |publisher =[[Indiana University Press]] | location =Bloomington, Indiana | isbn =0-253-20418-6 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=5_OXOwvjqjwC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=Lithuanization }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deak"&gt;{{cite book | author =István Deák | title =Essays on Hitler's Europe | year =2001 | editor = | pages =119–122 | chapter =Holocaust in Other Lands - A Ghetto in Lithuania | chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803217161&amp;id=XlljaRHUA04C&amp;pg=RA1-PA120&amp;lpg=RA1-PA120&amp;ots=fdgG0Au6Mb&amp;dq=Lithuanization&amp;sig=2nGWK-te5iOHnUdxWnMyesR1emI#PRA1-PA120,M1 | publisher =[[University of Nebraska Press]] | location =Lincoln, Nebraska | isbn =0-8032-1716-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number increased to 30 in 1923, but then fell down to 24 in 1926.&lt;ref name=setkus/&gt; The major reason for the decrease was the policy of [[Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party]] which transferred students whose parents had "Lithuania" as their nationality in the passport to Lithuanian schools.&lt;ref name=setkus/&gt; After the party lost control, the number of schools jumped to 91. Soon after the [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état|coup d'état in 1926]], nationalists came to power led by [[Antanas Smetona]]. The nationalists made the decision to forbid attendance of Polish schools by Lithuania. Children from mixed families were also forced to attend Lithuanian schools. Many Poles in Lithuania were signed in as Lithuanians in their passports, and as a result they also were forced to attend Lithuanian schools. The number of Polish schools gradually decreased to 9 in 1940.&lt;ref name=setkus/&gt; In 1936 a new law was passed that allowed a student to attend Polish school only if both parents were Poles.&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; The situation resulted in the opening of unsanctioned schools that numbered more than 40 in 1935 and were largely sponsored by "[[Pochodnia]]" Association.&lt;ref name=setkus/&gt;&lt;ref name=eidintas/&gt; A similar situation developed with regard to German schools in the [[Klaipėda region]].&lt;ref&gt;SILVA POCYTĖ, [http://www.istorija.lt/lim/pocyte2003en2.html DIDLIETUVIAI: AN EXAMPLE OF COMMITTEE OF LITHUANIAN ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVITIES (1934–1939)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204952/http://www.istorija.lt/lim/pocyte2003en2.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Packard Dean, ''Again the Memel Question'', Foreign Affairs, Vol. 13, No. 4 (Jul., 1935), pp. 695-697&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lithuanian attitudes towards ethnic Poles were in large part an effect of the idea to treat them as supposedly native Lithuanians, who got [[Polonized]] over the course of the last centuries and needed to be brought back to their "true identity".&lt;ref name="Budryte"&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Dovile Budryte]] | title =Taming Nationalism?: Political Community Building in the Post-Soviet Baltic States | year =2005 | pages =147–148 | publisher =Ashgate Publishing | location =Aldershot | isbn =0-7546-3757-3 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=UJMzpeUHkQcC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149 | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Żenczykiewicz"&gt;{{cite book | author =Jerzy Żenkiewicz | title =Ziemiaństwo polskie w Republice Litewskiej w okresie międzywojennym (Polish Landowners in the Republic of Lithuania Between the Wars) | year =2001 | publisher =Toruń | location = | isbn =9788391136607 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krajewski"&gt;{{cite book | author =Zenon Krajewski | title =Polacy w Republice Litewskiej 1918-1940 (Poles in the Lithuanian Republic) | year =1998 | editor = | pages =100 | publisher =Ośrodek Studiów Polonijnych i Społecznych PZKS | location =Lublin | isbn =83-906321-3-6|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchowski"&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Krzysztof Buchowski]] | title =Polacy w niepodległym państwie litewskim 1918-1940 (Poles in the Independent Lithuanian State) | year =1999 | editor = | pages =320 | publisher =History Institute of the [[University of Białystok]] | location =Białystok | isbn =83-87881-06-6 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major factor was tense relationship between Lithuania and Poland over the [[Vilnius region]] and cultural or educational restrictions on Lithuanians there; for example, in 1927, chairman of "[[Rytas]]," [[Lithuanian minority in Poland]] counterpart to "Pochodnia," and 15 teachers were temporary arrested and 47 schools closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kulikauskienė |first=Lina |title=Gimtoji istorija.

While the constitution of the Republic of Lithuania guaranteed equal rights to all confessions, Orthodox believers were discriminated against - the Lithuanian state decided to confiscate [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches. Some, but not all, of these had previously been converted from Catholic churches. Former [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] were confiscated as well, for example the Kruonis Orthodox church. Thirteen Orthodox churches were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Regina Laukaitytė | year =2001 | title =Lietuvos stačiatikių bažnyčia 1918-1940 m.: kova dėl cerkvių (Orthodoxy in Lithuania between 1918 and 1940: The struggle for Orthodox churches) | journal =Lituanistica | volume =2 | pages = 15–53| id = | url =http://www.images.katalogas.lt/maleidykla/lit2/Lit-15.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2007-12-17 |language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another target group for discrimination were the Poles. Anti-Polish attitudes had appeared since the [[Lithuanian National Revival]].

"'''Lot No. 249'''" is a [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[short story]] by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], first published in 1892. The story tells of a [[University of Oxford]] athlete named Abercrombie Smith who notices a strange series of events surrounding Edward Bellingham, an [[Egyptology]] student who owns many [[ancient Egypt]]ian artifacts, including a [[mummy (monster)|mummy]]. After seeing his mummy disappear and reappear, and two instances of Belligham's enemies getting attacked, Smith concludes that Bellingham is reanimating his mummy. Smith confronts Bellingham, who denies this is the case; the next day, Smith is attacked by the mummy and escapes. Smith then forces Bellingham to destroy his mummy and the associated artifacts at gunpoint.

Written during a period of great European interest in Egyptian culture known as [[Egyptomania]], Doyle was inspired to write "Lot No. 249" by his interests in the supernatural, crime and [[Egyptology]]. Though reanimated mummies had previously appeared in [[English literature]], Doyle's story was the first to portray one as dangerous. The story was first published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and has since been widely anthologized. "Lot No. 249" has received positive reviews from critics, including praise from authors [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Anne Rice]]. Critics have compared the story to the writings of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[H. Rider Haggard]] and interpreted it as containing themes of imperialism and masculinity. "Lot No. 249" has been adapted for film and television, and has significantly influenced subsequent media that depicts mummies, as well as other works of horror fiction.

==Synopsis==
In 1884, Abercrombie Smith, an athlete and medical student at the [[University of Oxford]], is called to the rooms of his neighbor and fellow student Edward Bellingham.  Bellingham, a fanatical [[Egyptology]] student who owns many [[ancient Egypt]]ian artifacts, has fainted from a severe shock. As Smith uses his medical skills to revive Bellingham, Bellingham's friend William Monkhouse Lee (to whose sister Bellingham is engaged) explains that Bellingham has a curious obsession with an Egyptian [[mummy (monster)|mummy]] that he purchased from an auction sale. Bellingham keeps the mummy in his room, and has named it "Lot 249," as those were the words the auctioneers put on its case.

Over the next few weeks, Smith is frequently disturbed by the sound of mumbling and muttering from Bellingham's room. The building's caretaker, Thomas Styles, confides in Smith that he has heard something walking around Bellingham's room while Bellingham is out. Shortly afterwards, a student called Long Norton, against whom Bellingham bears a long-standing grudge, is violently attacked by a mysterious and seemingly inhuman figure. Suspecting Bellingham is connected with the assault, Smith vows to avoid his neighbor entirely.

Not long afterwards, Monkhouse Lee issues a warning to Smith against Bellingham.  He explains that he has called off his sister's engagement to Bellingham, after Bellingham confided in him a terrible secret about which he has sworn to keep silent. Later, when passing Bellingham's room, Smith witnesses the mummy seemingly vanish and inexplicably reappear in its [[sarcophagus]].

After discovering that Lee has been attacked in a similar manner to Norton, Smith concludes that Bellingham has brought the mummy to life and is sending it to attack people whom he dislikes. Smith confronts Bellingham angrily about the attack on Lee, but Bellingham denies any involvement. The following evening, Smith is pursued by the mummy while strolling along a dark country path. Fleeing in terror, he narrowly escapes the creature. He realizes that his own life is now in danger and he must take action to stop Bellingham's evil. The next day Smith enters Bellingham's room and forces him at gunpoint to burn the mummy and all items associated with its animation. Once everything has been destroyed, Smith vows to return if Bellingham attempts any such activity again. Bellingham quits the university immediately and flees to [[Sudan]].

During the nineteenth-century, [[Napoleon]]'s [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian campaign]] (1798–1801), combined with the translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]], led many [[Europe]]ans to become fascinated with [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]], architecture, science and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], a fascination that became known as [[Egyptomania]].{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=275}}{{sfn|Cardin|2017|page=564}} Egyptomania caused to mummies becoming an "enduring theme in Western fiction".{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=275}} In his ''Horror Literature through History: An Encyclopedia of the Stories that Speak to Our Deepest Fears: Volume 1'', Matt Cardin contextualizes "Lot No. 249" as an example of Egyptomania.{{sfn|Cardin|2017|page=564}} In the early 1880s, the mummy of [[Ramses II]], widely believed to be the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]], was discovered, and the [[History of Egypt under the British|British occupied Egypt with their military]]. These two events sparked a late [[Victorian era]] "fascination with the Egyptian [[undead]]," popularized by [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[Cleopatra (Rider Haggard novel)|Cleopatra]]'' (1889).{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=xxvii}} Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] was motivated to write "Lot No. 249" due to his interest in the supernatural, crime, and Egyptology.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite news | title = Doyle, [Sir] Arthur Conan| work = [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] | url = http://sf-encyclopedia.uk/fe.php?nm=doyle_arthur_conan | accessdate = November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cardin|2017|page=564}} 

"Lot. No. 249" was not the first work of [[English literature]] to include a reanimated mummy; that distinction goes to [[Jane C. Loudon|Jane Webb]]'s ''[[The Mummy!]]'' (1827), a [[science fiction]] novel heavily influenced by [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818).{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}}  Other works of literature about mummies that predate "Lot No. 249" are "[[Some Words with a Mummy]]" (1845), a short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and Doyle's own short story "The Ring of Thoth" (1890). What separates "Lot No. 249" from previous literary depictions of reanimated mummies was that Doyle portrayed its mummy as dangerous.{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} Richard Bleiler writes in ''Mummies around the World: An Encyclopedia of Mummies in History, Religion and Popular Culture'' that Doyle drew from "contemporary archaeological discoveries in Egypt" while writing the story, but not from any literary model.{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=95}} However, Rafe McGregor writes that "Lot No. 249" has an atmosphere reminiscent of Poe's "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]" (1841), a story which Doyle loved. McGregor also hypothesizes that the comparison of the mummy to an ape in "Lot No. 249" could be a direct reference to Poe's story.{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} Matt Cardin, however, views "Lot No. 249" as simply using a "standard" mystery structure.{{sfn|Cardin|2017|page=565}} [[Roger Luckhurst]] identifies Doyle's story as a work of [[Gothic fiction]] which resurrects earlier Gothic tropes of "revenge, inheritance, and the consequences of possession".{{sfn|Luckhurst|2005|page=xxvii}} The story was first published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in September of 1892{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} and was included in Doyle's medical-themed anthology ''[[Round the Red Lamp]]'' (1894).{{sfn|Thornton|2018|page=265}}

==Themes==
===Imperialism===
[[File:HRiderHaggard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Lot No. 249" has garnered multiple comparisons to the writings of [[H. Rider Haggard]].]]
Near the end of the nineteenth-century, many British people felt that Britain was in decline due to a belief that the world was morally and culturally degenerating even as the British Empire expanded. This fear, captured in [[Max Nordau]]'s influential book ''[[Degeneration (Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1895), was aided by the fact that Britain faced economic threats from Europe and the United States. These circumstances led to a sub-genre of Gothic fiction that Emily Adler refers to as the "Imperial Gothic," which is concerned with British fears of being invaded by foreign cultures. Adler cites "Lot. No. 249" and Rider Haggard's novels ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1885) and ''[[She: A History of Adventure]]'' (1887) as examples of this sub-genre.{{sfn|Hughes|Punter|Smith|2016|page=249}} Deaglán Ó Donghaile, however, sees Doyle's story as a critique of imperialism. In ''Blasted Literature'', he writes that "The story calls into question to what extent colonialism, with its absorption of the cultures of the colonised, destabilises the perspective of the imperial, metropolitan subject position. While the process of imperial assimilation is symbolised by the private museum Bellingham keeps in his rooms...it seems in the end that it is the mummy and not he who is in control." Ó Donghaile further argues that the xenophobic portrayal of Egypt in the story actually represents the contemporary threat of Irish political violence against the British.{{sfn|Ó Donghaile|2011|page=66}}

===Masculinity===
Rafe McGregor notes that Abercrombie Smith is a stereotypical "image of a man's man that Doyle admired, and tried to project of himself" and that many Doyle stories, particularly his works of  [[weird fiction]], lack such characters.{{sfn|Doyle|2010|pages=67–68}} In ''Masculinity and the New Imperialism: Rewriting Manhood in British Popular Literature 1870–1914'', Bradley Deane writes that the mummy from "Lot No. 249" is one of the first fictional mummies to be presented as a "masculine competitor".{{sfn|Deane|2014|page=251}} Deane opines that some earlier works of British popular literature, like ''She'', characterized the British as masculine and their enemies as feminine; he feels that Doyle subverted this expectation by making the mummy a "male, mindless but strong and swift [figure] who threatens to defeat a young Oxford athlete in a terrifying footrace." Deane argues that the lack of a masculine/feminine distinction between Smith and the mummy "suggests a darker fragmentation of identity and an emasculating reversal of the imperial hierarchy."{{sfn|Deane|2014|page=193}}

==Critical reception==
[[Rudyard Kipling]] said that the short story gave him his first nightmare in years.{{sfn|Davies|2004|page=xii}} In his essay "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]" (1927), [[H. P. Lovecraft]] writes that "Doyle now and then struck a powerfully spectral note, as in 'The Captain of the ''Pole-Star''', a tale of arctic ghostliness, and 'Lot No. 249', where the reanimated mummy theme is used with more than ordinary skill."{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} [[Anne Rice]] called the story "great".{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=358}} [[David Stuart Davies]] enjoyed the subtlety of Doyle's prose and the tale's "growing sense of horror and unreality," adding that Doyle "carried on the tradition of the great ghost story writers...by allowing the reader's own imagination to enhance the misty picture painted by the writer."{{sfn|Davies|2004|page=xii}} Rafe McGregor writes in ''The Conan Doyle Weirdbook'' that "Lot No. 249" "remains a highly entertaining – not to mention spinetingling – weird tale." McGregor adds that thanks to "Lot No. 249" and his other contributions to the genre, Doyle should be seen as a master of weird fiction.{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} Andrew Barger said that "Not only does this excellent mummy story need more visibility, this Doyle spinetingler is one of the best horror short stories for the last half of the nineteenth century."{{sfn|Barger|2016|page=22}} In a mixed review, Richard Bleiler praises the tale's "narrative vigor" and "brisk" pace. However, he also feels that it is a minor work of [[Victorian literature]] remembered primarily due to its author and subject matter, and is neither Doyle's best work or the best work of fiction involving reanimated mummies.{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=95}}

==Adaptations==
The story is a possible influence for the lost short film ''[[Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb]]'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;Schablitsky, Julie (2007). ''Box Office Archaeology,'' p.21. Left Coast Press. {{ISBN|978-1598740561}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was adapted into a 1967 television production for the [[BBC]] program ''Tales of Conan Doyle'',{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=291}} as well as the lead segment from ''[[Tales from the Darkside: The Movie]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Cardin|2017|page=565}} The ''Tales from the Darkside'' segment contains [[slapstick]] and [[slasher film]] elements.{{sfn|Browning|2009|page=79}} It depicts Bellingham (played by [[Steve Buscemi]]) as a student who funds his studies through antique dealing and the mummy (played by Mike Deak, the film's makeup artist) "as an instrument of [[social justice]], defending the poor-but-able student body against the exploitative, leisured classes, who are corrupting the academic system by plagiarism."{{sfn|Browning|2009|page=79}}{{sfn|van Heerden|1998|page=133}} According to Mark Browning's ''Stephen King on the Big Screen'', the "mummy horror sub-genre" was "largely played out" by the time the film was made.{{sfn|Browning|2009|page=78}}

==Legacy==
"Lot No. 249" has been widely anthologized,{{sfn|Thornton|2018|page=197}} and its titular mummy has become an icon of horror.{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=95}} Rafe McGregor writes in ''The Conan Doyle Weirdbook'' that "Lot No. 249" is "One of the most significant [stories] in the history of supernatural fiction [for] being the first to depict a reanimated mummy as a sinister, dangerous creature."{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} It was also the first work of fiction to feature a modern man reviving a mummy with ancient Egyptian texts as opposed to electricity.{{sfn|Cardin|2017|page=565}} Emily Adler notes that Doyle's story predates [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) and [[Richard Marsh (author)|Richard Marsh]]'s ''[[The Beetle (novel)|The Beetle]]'' (1897) in its portrayal of foreign monsters invading Britain.{{sfn|Hughes|Punter|Smith|2016|page=249}} McGregor identifies the short story as a significant influence on other mummy-related media, such as Stoker's novel ''[[The Jewel of Seven Stars]]'' (1903) and the [[Boris Karloff]] film ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), as well as [[zombie]] fiction.{{sfn|Doyle|2010|page=67}} Bradley Deane feels that the masculinity of [[Kharis]] from [[The Mummy (franchise)|''The Mummy'' franchise]] as played by [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] was inspired by Doyle's story,{{sfn|Deane|2014|page=251}} while Matthew Coniam feels that [[Hammer Film Productions]]' ''[[The  Mummy (1959 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1959) draws from the atmosphere of "Lot No. 249".{{sfn|Coniam|2017|pages=110–111}} Anne Rice cited "Lot No. 249 and "The Ring of Thoth" as inspirations for her novel, ''[[The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned]]'' (1989), which she dedicated to Doyle.{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=358}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11552">'''Madge Allsop''' (born '''Marjorie Kiri McWhirter''') is a fictitious character invented by satirist [[Barry Humphries]] as the long-time companion (and former bridesmaid) of his most popular and enduring character, [[Dame Edna Everage]].  First mentioned in Edna's monologues in the 1960s, Madge was subsequently depicted on stage, TV and film, over three decades, by several people.  The character was discontinued following the retirement of British actress [[Emily Perry (English actress)|Emily Perry]], who played the role for over 15 years.

==Origins of character==
When Barry Humphries first began to perform as Edna Everage during his one-man shows, the character of Madge Allsop, Edna's bridesmaid and companion, was only ever mentioned in passing and never actually depicted on stage.  By the early 1970s, Madge was an increasingly strong presence in Edna's on-stage musings, but still remained unseen.  In Barry Humphries' 1971 Australian show, ''A Load of Old Stuffe'', her monologue was entitled  "Edna and Madge Allsop in Stratford",&lt;ref&gt;Theatre programme for Melbourne production of ''A Load of Old Stuffe'', 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; while a later one, performed in the 1974 show ''At least you can say you have seen it'', was entitled "Polish up your Kiwi (with Madge Allsop)".&lt;ref&gt;Theatre programme for Melbourne production of ''At least you can say you've seen it'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1976, Humphries decided to finally bring Madge Allsop to life with an appearance in his new BBC TV series, ''The Barry Humphries Show''.  She was portrayed by the London-based expatriate Australian actress [[Madeleine Orr]], who appeared as Madge on several subsequent occasions until her death three years later.  Over a period of almost thirty years, from 1976 until 2003, the adult Madge Allsop was portrayed by at least six different people: 

*1976–79 – [[Madeleine Orr]] 
*1982 – Unidentified actress/model, in the book ''Dame Edna's Bedside Companion'' 
*1987 – Connie Hobbs (in the film ''[[Les Patterson saves the world]]'')
*1987–2003 – [[Emily Perry (English actress)|Emily Perry]] (on stage and TV)
*1989 – [[Anne Charleston]] (as a joke, on one episode of ''[[The Dame Edna Experience]]'')
*1998 – Kerris Peeling (who portrayed Madge as a young woman in the stage show ''Dame Edna: The Spectacle'')

==Appearances==

===Film and television===
Madge Allsop was first portrayed on television in 1976, when she appeared (played by actress Madeleine Orr) in an episode of the BBC series ''The Barry Humphries Show''.  Following Orr's death in 1979, the role of Madge was re-cast. She appeared alongside Dame Edna on the BBC [[Parkinson_(TV_series)|Parkinson]] show in 1982, with her face covered in bandages. The character was written into Humphries' 1987 film, ''[[Les Patterson Saves the World]]'', and was portrayed, as a one-off appearance, by Australian actress Connie Hobbs.  Later that same year, Humphries announced his search for "definitive Madge", who would appear alongside Edna in his new BBC TV series, ''The Dame Edna Experience''.  Of the audition, Humphries recalled, "all of them tried too hard. Some were whimsical, some camp, but most were far too over the top to resemble an oppressed, inarticulate New Zealand spinster whom life had passed by."&lt;ref name="Humphries"&gt;Humphries, Barry. ''My Life as Me'', pp 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after they saw Emily Perry's understated performance, they knew that they had found the perfect Madge.  As she later recalled, "I did nothing at the audition, and I've done nothing ever since."&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;Barker, Dennis. "Dame Edna's Doleful Sidekick", ''The Age'' [Melbourne], February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emily Perry's appearance on the Dame Edna Experience was well-received; she subsequently became the definitive Madge Allsop, reprising the role in many of Humphries' other TV specials, including ''One more Audience with Dame Edna Everage'' (1988), ''A Night on Mount Edna'' (1990), ''[[Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch]]'' (1992), ''Dame Edna's Hollywood'' (1993) and ''Dame Edna's Work Experience'' (1996).  Perry's last on-screen appearance as Madge Allsop was a cameo in the TV special ''Dame Edna lives at the Palace'' (2003), in which the then 97-year-old actress was 'caught' in bed with [[Ozzy Osbourne]].  

Emily Perry became so strongly identified with the character of Madge Allsop that, after her retirement in 2004, the character of Madge was also retired, as it was felt that no other actress could ever recreate her.  When Humphries embarked upon a new TV talk show in 2007, ''[[The Dame Edna Treatment]]'', the role of Dame  Edna's silent scapegoat was filled by an actress portraying her errant (and hitherto unseen) daughter, Valmai Gittis.

===In Print===
Madge Allsop has been referenced in a number of books written by Barry Humphries since the mid-1970s.  Photographs of Madge (as portrayed by Madeleine Orr) appeared in ''Dame Edna's Coffee Table Book'' (1976) and ''The Sound of Edna: Dame Edna's Family Songbook'' (1979).  Because of Orr's death from cancer that same year, Madge was subsequently portrayed in Humphries' next book, ''Dame Edna's Beside Companion'' (1982), by an unidentified stand-in, whose entire head was concealed by bandages.  For the purposes of the narrative, this was explained away by the claim that "Madge" had recently undergone cosmetic surgery.

The character of Madge Allsop figured prominently in the book ''My Gorgeous Life'' (1989), which, although written by Humphries, was purported to be an autobiography of Dame Edna herself.  The book provides much background to Madge and Edna's ongoing friendship, and includes a detailed account of the death of Madge's husband, Douglas Allsop, whilst on their honeymoon in [[Rotorua]].  In the line drawings that illustrate the book (drawn by John Richardson), the young Madge is depicted as a recognizable caricature of Emily Perry.

Since the 1980s, theatre programmes for Barry Humphries' one-man shows have frequently included photographs of Madge Allsop (as portrayed by Emily Perry) alongside those of Dame Edna and [[Sir Les Patterson]].  For example, the glossy souvenir programme for  Humphries' Australian tour, ''Dame Edna: Back to my roots and other suckers'' included depictions of Madge in her pink frilly “Edna Loves Me” apron, dancing with Dame Edna while wearing a [[Vivienne Westwood]] outfit, shopping with Dame Edna in an exclusive boutique, posing mournfully along [[Errol Flynn]]'s star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and being attacked by a giant prop shark in Edna's swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre program for Melbourne production of ''Back to my Roots and other Suckers'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Stage===
Madge Allsop's most notable appearance on stage was as part of the 1998 West End production of ''Dame Edna: the Spectacle''.  The First Act of this show was essentially a retelling of Dame Edna's life story in the form of a lavish stage musical, and Madge Allsop was portrayed as a young woman by Kerris Peeling and as a child by either (depending on the performance) Keely Fawcett, Caroline Graham or Gabrielle Hoffman.  Emily Perry, by then 90 years old, also appeared briefly as the present-day Madge.

==Fictional biography==

===Early life===
According to Dame Edna's autobiography,  Madge Allsop was born Marjorie Kiri McWhirter in [[Palmerston North]], New Zealand.&lt;ref name="gorgeous"&gt;Everage, Dame Edna. ''My Gorgeous Life''. South Melbourne: Macmillan Company, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her date of birth has not been confirmed, although the fact that she was reportedly orphaned in 1931 "at a young age", as a result of the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake|Napier earthquake]], implies that she was born in the mid-1920s (and is, therefore, about the same age as Dame Edna herself).&lt;ref name="spectacle"&gt;Theatre programme for London production of ''Dame Edna: The Spectacle'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Madge then lived with an aunt until the age of ten, when she moved to Melbourne, Australia.  It was while attending Moonee Ponds Girls' Grammar School that she met young Edna Mae Beazley, who took pity on her and became a reluctant friend.  It is recorded that the young Madge's cardigan, before it was burnt in the school incinerator, yielded some seeds that took root in the school grounds and produced Australia's first kiwi fruit tree.&lt;ref name="spectacle"/&gt;  

In 1951, when Edna married Norm Everage, she chose Madge as one of her four bridesmaids—Madge caught Edna's bouquet "on the back of her neck".&lt;ref name="gorgeous"/&gt; When Edna was pregnant with her first child, Madge returned to New Zealand to live with her mother's half-sister, Heather McDonald.  In her memoirs, Edna described going down to Melbourne's Station Pier to see her off: “I was naturally very sweet and affectionate to her, since I never expected to see her again”.&lt;ref name="gorgeous"/&gt;  Some years later, as Edna was planning her first trip to London, she received an invitation to act as Matron of Honour at Madge's wedding to Douglas Hugh Allsop, who ran a tourist bus company in Palmerston North.  Edna attended the ceremony in Auckland and, at Madge's request, accompanied the couple on their honeymoon to Rotorua.  Douglas Allsop, however, was killed when, while visiting the famous hot mud pools, he leant too far over the railing and fell in.&lt;ref name="gorgeous"/&gt;  The widowed Madge subsequently returned to Australia with Edna, who "took full responsibility for the life and well-being of her sadly sticken school friend, even charitably incorporating her into some of her theatrrical and television events".&lt;ref name="spectacle"/&gt;

===Personal life===
There is considerable evidence that Madge Allsop is a lesbian, or at least bisexual.  Dame Edna's son, Kenny, has made this suggestion at least twice; it is noted, for example, in the lyrics to the 1978 song “My Bridesmaid and I”, in which Edna sings, “Kenny thinks that she's bi...”.&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, Barry and Nic Rowley. ''The Sound of Edna: Dame Edna's Family Songbook''.&lt;/ref&gt;   His claims were re-iterated in Dame Edna's  autobiography, ''My Gorgeous Life'', when she recalled Kenny's Coming Out, and, after misunderstanding her response, his assumption that she and Madge were also an item.&lt;ref name="gorgeous"/&gt;  Kenny's sister, Valmai Gittis, makes a similar claim about their mothers relationship with Madge in an unpublished memoir, ''Edna Dearest'', excerpts of which were reproduced in the 1982 book, ''Dame Edna's Bedside Companion''.&lt;ref name="bedside"/&gt;   A photograph, published in the same source, shows Madge Allsop watching adult videos with titles such as ''Sapphic Traffic'', ''Loins of Lesbos'' and ''Kinky Konvent Kapers''.  It is also revealed the Edna and Madge have been known to share a bed, although, by Edna's account, this is entirely platonic.

===Later years===
In 1982, Madge Allsop underwent what was described as “some radical naso-labial corrective therapy”, which necessitated her entire head being encased with bandages.&lt;ref name="bedside"&gt;Humphries, Barry. ''Dame Edna's Bedside Companion'', London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of that decade, she underwent a radical facelift under Dr [[Christiaan Barnard]], which made her resemble Australian actress [[Anne Charleston]].  The operation, however, was subsequently reversed.

'''Maithili New Year''' (or, '''Jude Sheetal''') is the celebration of the first day of the Maithili new year. This day which usually falls on 14 April on [[Gregorian calendar]] is celebrated by the [[Maithil]]s in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]]  of India and Nepal. This is also called Nirayana Mesh Sankranti and Tirhuta new year. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/home/mithila/panchang.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The festive occasion is in keeping with the Maithil Panchang, a calendar used in whole of Mithila region.

==Origin and significance==
The Maithili New Year follows the ''Nirayanam'' [[vernal equinox]] and falls on 30 April (may sometimes vary by a day) on the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional [[Tirhuta Panchang]] .&lt;br&gt; Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and adding 23 degrees of trepidation or oscillation to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or ''Nirayana Mesha Sankranti'' (Sun's transition into ''Nirayana'' Aries).&lt;ref&gt;Maithili Panchang, of Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University  Published from [[Darbhanga]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, the '''Maithili calendar''' begins on the same date, with Baishakh as first month of the year. It is also observed by most traditional calendars in India as in Tamil Nadu,  Assam, Bengal, Kerala, Manipur, Orissa, Punjab, Tripura and also in Nepal. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.imsc.res.in/~rahul/articles/calendar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official significance==
Maithili Calendar is the traditional Calendar of [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] region of India and Nepal. 
After a long period of demand, [[Government of Bihar|Bihar government]] in 2011 declared this day as public holiday to be observed state wide. Officially, the Maithili New year day is called as Mithila Diwas by the Government of Bihar. Every year there will be holiday for Mithila Diwas on 14 April in the Indian State of [[Bihar]] on account of the great festival of Juir Sheetal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2012_245.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marooned (close up).jpg|thumb|''Marooned'' by [[Howard Pyle]]]]

'''Marooning''' is the intentional act of abandoning someone in an uninhabited area, such as a [[desert island]]. The word first appears in writing in approximately 1709,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maroon | title=Maroon | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from the term [[maroon (people)|maroon]], a word for a fugitive slave, which could be a corruption of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''cimarrón'', meaning a household animal (or slave) who has run "wild".

The practice was a penalty for crewmen, or for captains at the hands of a crew in cases of [[mutiny]]. Generally, a marooned man was set on a deserted island, often no more than a [[shoal|sand bar]] at [[tide|low tide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kraske, Robert|date=2005|title=Marooned: The Strange But True Adventures of Alexander Selkirk|publisher= Clarion Books|isbn=0-618-56843-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would be given some food, a container of water, and a loaded pistol so he could commit [[suicide]] if he desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hickox, Rex|title=All you wanted to know about 18th century Royal Navy|pages= 121 |publisher=Lulu.com|date=2007|isbn=978-1-4116-3057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of marooning was usually fatal, but William Greenaway and some men loyal to him survived being marooned, as did pirate captain [[Edward England]].

The chief practitioners of marooning were 17th and 18th century [[piracy|pirates]], to such a degree that they were frequently referred to as "marooners". The [[Pirate code|pirate articles]] of captains [[Bartholomew Roberts]] and [[John Phillips (pirate)|John Phillips]] specify marooning as a punishment for cheating one's fellow pirates or other offenses. In this context, to be marooned is euphemistically to be "made governor of an island".

During the late-18th century in the [[Southern United States|American South]], "marooning" took on a humorous additional meaning describing an extended camping-out picnic over a period of several days (''Oxford English Dictionary'').

As a result of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1714, [[Sombrero, Anguilla|Sombrero island]] passed into the hands of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. Captain [[Viscount Lake|Warwick Lake]] of [[HMS Recruit (1806)|''Recruit'']] marooned an [[Impressment|impressed]] seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807. As it turned out, Jeffrey survived. A passing American vessel, the schooner ''Adams'' from Marblehead, Massachusetts, had rescued him. A court-martial later dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.

A Dutch sailor, [[Leendert Hasenbosch]], was marooned on the deserted [[Ascension Island]] in 1725 as a punishment for [[sodomy]]. He is believed to have died there of thirst later that year. In 1726 his tent and diary were discovered by passing British sailors, and his diary was later translated and published in London.

==In literature==

The most famous literary reference to marooning probably occurs in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' in which [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]] is left marooned on the island for three years.

A famous real-life marooning, only partly for punishment, was leaving the sailor [[Alexander Selkirk]] on [[Robinson Crusoe Island|Juan Fernández Island]] off the coast of [[Chile]], in the Pacific Ocean. Selkirk, a sailor with the [[William Dampier|Dampier]] expedition, was worried about the unseaworthy condition of his ship, the ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', and had argued with the captain until he left him ashore on the island where they had briefly stopped for water and food supplies. The ''Cinque Ports'' later sank with the loss of most of her crew. Selkirk was not rescued until four years later, by [[Woodes Rogers]]. Selkirk's travails provided the inspiration for [[Daniel Defoe]]'s novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''. Today, one of the islands on the Chilean coast is named [[Alejandro Selkirk Island]] and another one [[Robinson Crusoe Island]].

==In television==
In 2012, [[Ed Stafford]] marooned himself on an uninhabited island off [[Fiji]] as an experiment for 60 days. He took with him no food, water, or survival equipment of any kind. What he did take were cameras to film the ordeal for [[Discovery Channel]]. Stafford completed the task and documents the psychological repercussions in his book ''Naked and Marooned''.

==History==
The history of migration to the GCC countries can be categorized into three waves.

===First wave===
The first wave concerns migration to the GCC region prior to the British arrival in the so-called [[Trucial States]], being modern-day Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE, in 1820. The oldest known maritime trading route is the one between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] and [[Dilmun]] in modern-day Bahrain. Traders often stayed in the Persian Gulf region for an extended period of time before returning to their port of origin. During the first wave, migrants mainly came from [[Asia]] and settled on the eastern shores of the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name = "Pillalamarri"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pillalamarri |first1=A. |title=Indian and the Persian Gulf States Share a long History |url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/06/india-and-the-gulf-states-share-a-long-history/ |accessdate=11 November 2018 |work=The Diplomat |date=10 June 2016|year=2016 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration was often the result of trade relations between the Gulf and Asia. Migration was mainly undertaken by people from modern-day [[Iran]] and [[India]] who traveled to the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vora |first1=N. |title=Impossible Citizens: Dubai's Indian Diaspora |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham |pages= |ref=harv}}, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Most trading goods were exported to the Gulf, while only a limited amount of goods was exported in the other direction. Pearls were the exception and the main trading product in places like Qatar, [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="Pillalamarri"/&gt; Scholars such as Muhammad Azhar point out the longstanding relationship between Indians and the Persian Gulf, where many stayed for generations and even became citizens.&lt;ref name = "Azhar"/&gt;

===Second wave===
The second wave may be defined as the migration which took place after the British arrived in the Persian Gulf region in 1820.&lt;ref name = "Hamza"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamza |first1=S. |title=Migrant Labor in the Arabian Gulf |journal=Tennessee Research and Creative Exchange |date=2014 |pages= |url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2762&amp;context=utk_chanhonoproj |accessdate=11 November 2018 |ref=harv }}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The British conflict with the [[Al Qasimi]] family, who held control over the [[Strait of Hormuz]], started with the British refusal to pay toll for British ships passing through the Strait. Conflict broke out and the Qawasim fleet was destroyed. [[Pax Britannica]] was applied to the whole region, which included a series of [[treaties]] imposed on the region's leaders and which further cemented the position of [[Great Britain]] as the dominant power in the region.&lt;ref name = "Allday"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allday |first1=L. |title=The British In The Gulf: An Overview |publisher=Qatar Digital Library |url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/british-gulf-overview |accessdate=7 March 2017 |ref=harv|date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British took control over the region and created the structures needed for increased trade.&lt;ref name = "Allday"/&gt; The British interest in the Gulf is often explained by the fact that Great Britain wanted to protect the sea route to India from rival colonial powers. The [[East India Company]] played an important role in this endeavour.&lt;ref name = "Allday"/&gt; Britain made [[Abu Dhabi]] a [[protectorate]] in 1820 and established control over [[Aden]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="Pillalamarri"/&gt; Thereafter Great Britain gained power over Bahrain, Dubai, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar.&lt;ref name="Pillalamarri"/&gt; The power of the British in the Gulf region, combined with the structures put in place to promote trade, strengthened the relationship between the Gulf region and India further. This, in turn, advanced migration from India to the Gulf, especially Indian civil servants who would manage the relations between the Gulf and India.&lt;ref name = "Hamza"/&gt;

===Third wave=== 
The third wave took off due to rapid economic growth related to the intensified [[hydrocarbon exploration]] in the region. This led to the discovery of large quantities of crude oil.&lt;ref name = "Hamza"/&gt; Although oil had already been discovered in GCC region during the beginning of the 20th century, the economic benefits of the oil resources were properly actualised during the 1960s and 1970s, as the GCC countries officially gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1971.&lt;ref name = "Hamza"/&gt; The author Al Shehabi further argues that a [[capitalist]] approach to the economy became increasingly more dominant in the GCC region during this time period. Together with the oil boom, it constituted an important factor explaining the importation of migrant workers and economic development.{{sfn|Al Shehabi|Hanieh|2015|p=3}} 

The third wave of migration in the GCC can be attributed to the 1960s but intensified during the 1970s,&lt;ref name = "Hamza"/&gt; as the increased wealth of the states led to plans of [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]]. The implementation of these plans increased labor demands, but the GCC countries and their populations did not possess the manpower or knowledge to meet these demands.&lt;ref name = "Hamza"/&gt; The relatively small populations in the GCC countries, as well as limited numbers of female workers and male workers of the appropriate age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shah |first1=Nasra M. |title=Labour Migration from Asian to GCC Countries: Trends, Patterns and Policies |journal=Middle East Law and Governance |date=1 January 2013 |volume=5 |issue=1–2 |pages=36–70 |doi=10.1163/18763375-00501002 |url=https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/measterna5&amp;section=6 |accessdate=11 November 2018 |ref=harv |language=en |issn=1876-3375}}, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; combined with a plenitude of foreign workers willing to migrate, constitute important "pull" and "push" factors which explain the migration growth of the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "Azhar"/&gt; While seven of the Trucial States decided to unite and form the United Arab Emirates after gaining independence from the United Kingdom, an initiative taken by [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] of Abu Dhabi and [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] of Dubai, both Qatar and Bahrain decided to found their own independent states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gornall |first1=J. |title=Sun sets on British Empire as UAE raises its flag |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sun-sets-on-british-empire-as-uae-raises-its-flag |accessdate=11 November 2018 |work=The National |date=2 December 2011 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, while the inflow of foreign workers remained steady, the demographic composition of these migration flows changed. While the initial part of the third wave mainly brought Arab migrant workers to the Persian Gulf region, their numbers declined during the 1980s and 1990s as they were replaced with Southeast Asian migrants. In comparison, there were approximately 2.000.000 migrant workers in the oil-producing countries, of which 68% were Arab workers, while in 1983 the total number of migrant workers had risen to 5.000.000, of which only 55% were Arab migrants.&lt;ref name = "Thiollet2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thiollet |first1=Helene |title=Migration as Diplomacy: Labor Migrants, Refugees, and Arab Regional Politics in the Oil-Rich Countries |journal=International Labor and Working-Class History  |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=103–121 |doi=10.1017/S0147547910000293 |url=http://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/centres/oxpo/working-papers/wp_10-11/OXPO_10_11c_Thiollet.pdf |ref=harv |language=en |issn=1471-6445|year=2011 }}, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, in Saudi Arabia the number of Arab migrant workers decreased from 90% to 32% between 1975 and 1985.&lt;ref name = "Thiollet2011"/&gt; This change in composition was caused by a change in attitude towards Arab foreign workers.

==Demographics==

===Bahrain===
In 2015, 51.1% of residents in Bahrain were foreign citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=UNData |title=Country Profile: Bahrain |url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=BAHRAIN |accessdate=12 March 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of non-nationals peaked in 2010, when they constituted 54% of the population.&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"&gt;De Bel-Air 2015a, p. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, approximately 45.5% of the Bahraini residents were Asian migrants, while non-Bahraini Arabs constituted 4.7% of the total population and 1% of the population was European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Middle East: Bahrain |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/ba.html |website=CIA World Fact Book |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=12 March 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, 85% of the non-Bahraini residents were from Asian countries and 50% of the Asian migrants were of Indian origin. In 2014, 84.4% of the non-nationals were from Asia, and 49.4% came from India.&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP3"&gt;De Bel-Air 2015a, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, approximately 80% of all non-Bahraini nationals held some sort of employment, comprising 77% of the Bahraini workforce.&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt; In the private sector, non-nationals constituted up to 81% of the employees.&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt; Non-nationals occupy low-level positions in areas such as construction work and domestic household work, while non-Bahraini Arabs tend to hold higher status jobs, such as manager positions.&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP3"/&gt;

Bahrain differentiates itself from other GCC countries, as in 2013 the majority of Bahraini citizens were employed in the private sector (63%).&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt; However, most migrant workers are also employed in the private sector (78.5%).&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt; A smaller number (20%) are employed in the domestic sector.&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt; Approximately 80% of the non-Bahraini residents are men with a low level of education: 82.5% of non-Bahrainis have not finished [[secondary education]].&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt;  Non-Bahraini residents mainly work in construction (27.9%), wholesale and retail (16.3%), domestic work (16%) and manufacturing (12.4%).&lt;ref name = "De Bel-Air BahrainP5-6"/&gt;

===Kuwait===
{{main|Migrant workers in Kuwait}}
Of the 2,611,292 non-Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait in 2012, 1,864,139 were employed. The large majority worked in the private sector (63%), in contrast to Kuwaiti citizens who were predominantly active in the public sector. Of the total workforce in the private sector, migrant workers made up 93.4% of the total workforce in the Kuwaiti private sector. Most migrant workers were male (65.3%), and 70% had not completed secondary education. The average migrant worker was 32,8 years old and worked either in private households (29%), wholesale and retail (14.8%), construction work (9.9%) or manufacturing (6.1%).&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2013, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most migrant workers in Kuwait were of Asian origin and the largest group consisted of Indian nationals, who constituted 30% of the non-Kuwaiti residents in 2012. Approximately 80% of the foreign residents were active laborers, and made up 83% of the workforce. In the private sector, non-Kuwaitis constituted over 90% of the workforce.&lt;ref name =  "De Bel-Air KuwaitP1"&gt;De Bel-Air 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign nationals from Arab countries tended to hold higher positions with more responsibility, such as manager positions. Asian migrant workers generally worked in crafts or service sectors. Kuwait had a large proportion of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] migrant workers prior to the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]]. The Palestinians had to leave the country once the war was over, as they were accused of supporting [[Saddam Hussein]]. Additionally, the [[Bedoon (ethnicity)|Bedoon]] ethnic minority have gradually been compelled to leave the country since the middle of the 1980s. The ones who still reside in Kuwait are considered to be stateless.&lt;ref name =  "De Bel-Air KuwaitP1"/&gt;

===Oman===
Migration to Oman has increased rapidly since 2000 due to economic growth, which further has resulted in development of infrastructure. After the economic crisis in 2008 the numbers of migrants continued to increase, consequently diverging from the general trend in other GCC countries where the numbers of migrants were decreasing. In 1993, the population constituted 2,017,643 people, of which 26.5% were foreign residents. In 2015, 44.2% (1,849,412 people) of the total Omani population (4,187,516 people) were non-Omanis. This constituted an upsurge of migrants since the second Omani census in 2003, when foreign residents were estimated to account for about 24% of the total populace. In 2013, the majority of migrant workers came from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (87%). 82% of all migrant workers were employed in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2015c, p. 3, 6 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2013 the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman|Shura Council of Oman]] established that the inflow of migrant workers should not surpass 33% of the total populace.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2015c, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Omani leadership carried out extensive deportations of undocumented migrants in 2010, resulting in the return of approximately 70.000 people to their respective countries of origin. At the time of the deportations, Omani authorities estimated that there were approximately 200,000 undocumented migrants in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Al Shaibany |first1=S. |title=Oman sends 70,000 illegal workers home and 30,000 taxis now have no passengers |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/oman-sends-70-000-illegal-workers-home-and-30-000-taxis-now-have-no-passengers |accessdate=12 November 2018 |work=The National |date=February 4, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants from the Middle East are generally located in occupations representing the higher strata of society, in comparison to the average Asian migrant. There is also a recognizable distinction between Middle Eastern and Asian migrants concerning the phenomenon of [[family reunification]]. While the former group often can bring family members with them, the latter group generally do not have this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2015c, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qatar===
Qatar's population has increased with 6.2% annually between 1986 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2014b, p. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt; While Qatari citizens have increasingly less children, the main factor contributing to the population growth is migration. Between 2005 and 2015, the population growth intensified after a period of slower growth and increased with 15.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Qatar´s migrants: how have they changed the country |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/sep/26/qatar-migrants-how-changed-the-country |accessdate=12 November 2018 |work=The Guardian |agency=The Guardian |date=2016 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the total population was expected to be 2,003,700 people, 85.7% of which were foreign residents. Furthermore, foreign residents made up 94.1% of the workforce in the country and approximately 80% of the migrants were estimated to be male. Qatar also had the second highest GDP per capita in  2013, sustaining the cost of migrants coming to the country. However, the labor camps used for over 50% of all residents in Qatar are also home to many Qataris. As demographic statistical data for nationals and non-nationals are not available separately, it is only possible to present the demographics of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2014b, p. 3, 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 80% of all Qatari citizens are employed within white collar work. Non-Qataris dominate all work sectors in the country, from manager positions to unskilled labor. The large majority of migrant workers are employed in the construction sector. Migrants mainly come to Qatar from Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2014b, p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
{{main|Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia}}
Saudi Arabia has one of the fastest growing populations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;De Bel-Air 2014a, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia come from South Asia.&lt;ref name =  "De Bel-Air KSA P3"&gt;De Bel-Air 2014a, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although migrants constitute 33% of the total population, they represent 56.5% of  the total number of employees and 89% of the employees active in the private sector.&lt;ref name =  "De Bel-Air KSA P3"/&gt; While over half of the Saudi citizens worked in the public sector, 99% of the non-Saudi population worked in the private sector. As of 2013, approximately 74% of foreign nationals are male and 62.3% had not finished secondary education. Moreover, approximately 80% of foreign nationals are between the ages of 15 and 64. The most common employment for non-nationals is construction (26.5%), retail and wholesale (22.3%), as well as domestic work (15%). Non-nationals can also be found in the health and education sectors. While the majority of migrant workers are to be found in low income jobs, mostly involving physical labour, the majority of managers and specialists are also of non-Saudi origin.&lt;ref name =  "De Bel-Air KSA P6"&gt;De Bel-Air 2014a, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of remittances, India, Egypt and Pakistan are the main beneficiaries of national citizens working in Saudi Arabia. The data is incomplete but the Gulf Research Center suggests that these nationalities probably constitute the majority of migrant workers in the country.&lt;ref name =  "De Bel-Air KSA P6"/&gt;

===United Arab Emirates (UAE)===
{{main|Migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates}}
The data provided by the federal and emirate-level statistical bureaus is limited in comparison to the other GCC countries. The number of migrants in the UAE has increased rapidly: between 2007 and 2008 the number increased by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janardhan |first1=N. |title=Boom amid Gloom: The Spirit of Possibility in the 21st Century Gulf' |date=2011 |publisher=Garnet Publishing |location=Berkshire  |pages=|ref=harv}}, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, non-nationals made up 88.5% of the total population. In the same year, foreign residents further made up 96% of the country's workforce. The majority of non-nationals were from Asia, especially from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The majority of migrant workers could be found in the private sector, where they constituted 99.5% of the workforce. Migrant workers also held 40% of the jobs in the public sector.&lt;ref name="DeBel-Air UAEp3"&gt;De Bel-Air 2015b, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Employment possibilities in the UAE attracted both high, medium and low-skilled workers and, compared to other GCC countries, migrants generally held higher positions, such as manager-positions.&lt;ref name="DeBel-Air UAEp3" /&gt;

== Government policies ==

== Remittances ==
The GCC countries are among the top [[remittance]] sending countries in the world. In 2013, 23% of all remittances globally were sent from the GCC region. The total official value was estimated to be approximately 90 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;Malit Jr. &amp;  Naufal 2016, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Saudi Arabia was second on the list of remittance sending countries and other GCC member states were also among the top countries concerning outflows of remittances. The estimated value of remittances sent from Saudi Arabia annually is expected to be around 16 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;Naufal &amp; Termos 2010a, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Azhar 2016,  p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; India, Egypt and Pakistan are the main beneficiaries of national citizens working in Saudi Arabia. The data is incomplete, but the Gulf Research Center suggests that these nationalities probably constitute the majority of migrant workers in the country.&lt;ref name= "De Bel-Air KSA P6" /&gt; It is further estimated that outflows of remittances through informal channels are a common phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ratha |first1=D. |last2=Xu |first2=Z. |title=Migration and Remittance Fact Book |publisher=World Bank |pages= |ref=harv |chapter=}}, p. XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of migrant workers are composed of a variety of nationalities, but are generally united by the fact that the large majority send money to family members and relatives in their respective [[country of origin|countries of origin]]. Migrants in the GCC countries are generally denied the right to own property and bring family members with them to the country of employment. These factors generally contribute to migrants' intentions not to stay in the country of employment for the entirety of their life. Contrary, most migrants have the intent to return to their respective countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Naufal &amp; Termos 2010a, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work conducted by migrants in the GCC constitutes an important section of the economy in the country of origin, as money is sent home to family members and relatives. [[India]] receives approximately half of all remittances from Indian migrants in the GCC countries and further constitutes the country sending most migrants to the region.&lt;ref&gt;Azhar 2016, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several state leaders in the GCC regard remittances as an economical “leakage”, as economic capital is leaving the country. Due to the value of remittances, GCC countries have recently started to discuss remittance taxes as a strategy to counterbalance budget deficits.&lt;ref&gt;Malit Jr. &amp;  Naufal 2016, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Monetary Fund]] recently warned the GCC to be ready for profit decrease, as oil prices might go down.

====Kafala system====
An important concept which regulates migrant labor in the GCC countries is the [[kafala system]], a sponsorship system which provides the legal basis for both residency and employment of migrant workers in the GCC countries.&lt;ref name = "Roper"&gt;Roper &amp; Barria 2014a, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaeb2015" &gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malaeb |first1=Hanan N. |title=The "Kafala" System and Human Rights: Time for Decision |journal=Arab Law Quarterly |date=21 October 2015 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=307–342 |doi=10.1163/15730255-12341307 |url=https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/arablq29&amp;section=21 |accessdate=24 November 2018 |ref=harv |language=en |issn=1573-0255}}, pp. 309-310.&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on a citizen or organization, the kafeel (sponsor) within one of the GCC countries employing migrant workers, which is the only manner in which the migrant worker can receive an entry visa, residence permit and work permit.&lt;ref name = "Roper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaeb2015" /&gt; Furthermore, under the kafala system, the sponsor takes on both legal and economic responsibility for the migrant worker.&lt;ref name = "Roper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaeb2015" /&gt; This system binds the migrant worker to the employer, as the migrant is allowed only to work for the kafeel and only for the duration of the contract.&lt;ref name = "Roper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malaeb2015" /&gt; The kafala system remains an important part of the laws regulating migrant workers in all of the Gulf states, even though many of these laws have been amended in the Gulf states in the past 15 years.

====National laws and regulations====
Since its creation in 2006 the Bahraini Labour Market Regulation Authority (LMRA) is tasked, not only with the regulation of, inter alia, employment transfers, recruitment agencies and work visas, but also with informing migrant workers of their rights and obligations.&lt;ref name = "Steps"&gt;{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia: Steps Toward Migrant Workers' Rights |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/15/saudi-arabia-steps-toward-migrant-workers-rights |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=27 November 2018 |ref=harv |date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar: New Reforms Won’t Protect Migrant Workers |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/11/08/qatar-new-reforms-wont-protect-migrant-workers |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kuwait: New Law a Breakthrough for Domestic Workers |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/06/30/kuwait-new-law-breakthrough-domestic-workers |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"&gt;{{cite web |title=For a Better Life: Migrant Worker Abuse in Bahrain and the Government Reform Agenda |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/09/30/better-life/migrant-worker-abuse-bahrain-and-government-reform-agenda |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kuwait: Government Pledges to End Sponsorship System |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/09/28/kuwait-government-pledges-end-sponsorship-system |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the existing legal regime regarding labor is applicable to both national and foreign workers.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010"/&gt;The protections offered by Bahrain's criminal law to workers applies to migrant workers as well.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010"/&gt;

In 2009, Bahrain announced that it would end the kafala system, citing human rights concerns linked to both human trafficking and sexual slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Roper &amp; Barria 2014a, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Market Regulatory Law was amended, making the LMRA the official sponsor of migrant workers and, most importantly, allowing migrant workers to leave their employer without the latter's consent.&lt;ref name="BahrainScrapped"&gt;{{cite web |title=Three Months After the Sponsorship System in Bahrain was “Scrapped”, What Really Changed? |url=https://www.migrant-rights.org/2009/11/three-months-after-the-sponsorship-system-in-bahrain-was-scrapped-what-really-changed/ |website=Migrant-Rights.org |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="KhanHarroff-Tavel2011"&gt; {{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=Azfar |last2=Harroff-Tavel |first2=Hélène |title=Reforming the Kafala: Challenges and Opportunities in Moving Forward |journal=Asian and Pacific Migration Journal |date=September 2011 |volume=20 |issue=3–4 |pages=293–313 |doi=10.1177/011719681102000303 |url=http://www.academia.edu/download/37129775/2_Azfar_Khan_Helene_Harroff-Tavel.pdf |accessdate=17 November 2018 |ref=harv |language=en |issn=0117-1968}}, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the Bahraini government announced the official and total abolition of the sponsorship system once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahrain abolishes sponsorship system for foreign workers |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/economy/2016/12/19/Bahrain-abolishes-sponsorship-system-for-foreign-workers.html |accessdate=1 December 2018 |work=english.alarabiya.net |publisher=Al Arabiya English |date=19 December 2016 |ref=harv |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Review"&gt;{{cite web |title=Migration in the Gulf: 2016 in Review |url=https://www.migrant-rights.org/2017/01/migration-in-the-gulf-2016-in-review/ |website=Migrant-Rights.org |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legislative initiatives to protect labor rights in Bahrain include a 2012 private sector labor law, focusing inter alia on the number of sick days, annual leave, compensation for unfair dismissals, fines for labor law violations and the streamlining of labor disputes.&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahra2015" &gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zahra |first1=M. |title=Bahrain's Legal Framework of Migration |journal=Gulf Labour Markets and Migration |date=2015|volume=1 |issue=2015 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 human trafficking law was presented by the Bahraini government as covering many common labor law violations, for example the withholding of wages.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010"/&gt; Furthermore, in late 2016 Bahrain was considering to allow the issuance of flexible work permits for undocumented workers, providing them with the ability to work for more than one employer even without legal visa.&lt;ref name="FlexibleWork Bahrain2016" &gt;{{cite web |title=Flexible Work Permit for Undocumented Workers: Bahrain |url=https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/10/flexible-work-permit-for-undocumented-workers-bahrain/ |website=Migrant-Rights.org |accessdate=1 December 2018 |ref=harv |date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main legal source for the kafala system in Kuwait is the 1959 Aliens’ Residence Law and its implementing regulations. This law not only provided that all foreign workers should have a local sponsor, but also that the responsibility of monitoring the foreign workers lies with the sponsor.&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016"&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Abuse and Exploitation of Migrant Domestic Workers in Oman”, 13 July 2016, ''available [https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/13/i-was-sold/abuse-and-exploitation-migrant-domestic-workers-oman here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2016"&gt;Human Rights Watch, "Migrant Domestic Workers: Overworked and Underprotected", 15 June 2016, ''available [https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/15/migrant-domestic-workers-overworked-and-underprotected here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW KSA2010"&gt;Human Rights Watch, "Saudi Arabia: Domestic Worker Brutalised", 2 September 2010, ''available [https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/09/02/saudi-arabia-domestic-worker-brutalized here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b"&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Kuwait: For Abused Domestic Workers, Nowhere to Turn”, 6 October 2010, ''available [https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/06/kuwait-abused-domestic-workers-nowhere-turn here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b"&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Walls at Every Turn: Abuse of Migrant Domestic Workers through Kuwait’s Sponsorship System”, 6 October 2010, ''available [https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/10/06/walls-every-turn/abuse-migrant-domestic-workers-through-kuwaits-sponsorship-system here]''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, migrant workers were also covered the 1964 Law concerning Labour in the Private Sector,&lt;ref&gt;Shah 2011, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; the sector in which most foreign workers are active. The legal system regulating foreign workers has been changing since the early 2000s. For example, in 2007, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs implemented a decree which prohibited employers from taking their employees’ passports.&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW KSA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt; In 2009, another decree was issued, which allowed migrant workers to change employers without the employer's consent.&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW KSA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt; However, this would only be a possibility after the initial employment contract was completed, or after the worker had been employed for three consecutive years.&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW KSA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt;

In 2010, the Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs and Labor announced that it would abolish the kafala system, requesting the assistance of the ILO on policy issues related to migrant workers.&lt;ref name="KhanHarroff-Tavel2011"/&gt; New labor laws were implemented in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Shah 2011, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt; One major change was the creation of an agency, the Public Authority for Manpower (PAM), which has the sole responsibility for the importation and employment of foreign workers.&lt;ref name = "Shah"&gt;Shah 2011, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also works to prevent the practice of visa trading, in which sponsors or local agencies would charge potential migrant workers large sums for work visas in exchange for employment, without providing the migrant with actual employment.&lt;ref name = "Shah"/&gt; Additionally, the new labor laws placed limits on daily working hours, while also providing for end-of-service payments, paid maternity leave and access to labor dispute settlement mechanisms.&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW KSA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt; The 2010 laws also incorporated the 2009 ministerial decree regarding the possibility to change employers into actual law, while maintaining the requirements of the 2009 decree.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010" /&gt; However, the new laws did not set a minimum wage requirements, did not allow for the creation of labor unions and did not cover domestic workers.&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.org, “Kuwait Doesn’t Allow Migrants to Form Labor Unions”, 31 March 2010, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2010/03/kuwait-forbids-migrants-from-forming-labor-unions/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs of Kuwait approved a standardized labor contract for foreign workers in the private sector, issued by the PAM, which specifies end-of-contract compensation, holidays and leaves.&lt;ref name = "Unified"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017"&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Kuwait: Events of 2016”, 17 January 2017, available [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/kuwait#b94615 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardized contract allows for additional articles to be added as long as these extra articles comply with Kuwait's labor laws.&lt;ref name = "Unified"&gt;Migrant-Rights.org, “UAE Announces Reforms to Labor Rules: Kuwait and Qatar Move Forward on Unified Contracts”, 11 October 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2015/10/uae-announces-reforms-to-labor-rules-kuwait-and-qatar-more-forward-on-unified-contracts/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government distributed copies of this standardized contract among embassies for translation.&lt;ref name = "Unified"/&gt; In the same year, the government adopted new labor laws which extended labor rights to domestic workers and in 2016 the government set a minimum wage for domestic work.&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.org, “Another Look at Kuwait’s New Laws for Domestic Workers”, 10 August 2015, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2015/08/another-look-at-kuwaits-new-laws-for-domestic-workers/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain, “Kuwait First in GCC to Implement Minimum Wage for Domestic Workers”, 16 July 2016, available [http://www.adhrb.org/2016/07/kuwait-implements-minimum-wage-domestic-workers/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Oman''', the kafala system is regulated by the foreign residency law and accompanying laws, while the system is enforced by the Ministry of Manpower and the Royal Oman Police.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"&gt;Human Rights Watch, "United Arab Emirates: Trapped, Exploited, Abused", 22 October 2014, ''available [https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/22/united-arab-emirates-trapped-exploited-abused here].''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oman's 2003 Labour Law, an employer needs a permit issued by the Ministry of Manpower in order to import foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Manpower, ''Labour Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 35/2003'', art. 18, available [https://www.manpower.gov.om/Portal/Englishpdf/Service/toc_en.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, migrant workers are prohibited from working for another employer.&lt;ref&gt;Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Manpower, ''Labour Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 35/2003'', art. 18(bis), available [https://www.manpower.gov.om/Portal/Englishpdf/Service/toc_en.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Law places responsibility for the migrant worker on the employer.&lt;ref name="Mekheil2016" &gt;Mekheil, M., “Oman Neglects the Rights of Migrant Domestic Workers”, ''Human Rights Brief'', 14 November 2016, available [http://hrbrief.org/2016/11/oman-neglects-rights-migrant-domestic-workers/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Manpower, ''Labour Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 35/2003'', art. 18(bis), available [https://www.manpower.gov.om/Portal/Englishpdf/Service/toc_en.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 Law also sets conditions for the labor contract, as well as the rights and obligations of both employers and migrant workers, including the provision of medical facilities, suitable means of transport and a minimum wage by the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Manpower, ''Labour Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 35/2003'', art. 23, 33-34, 50, available [https://www.manpower.gov.om/Portal/Englishpdf/Service/toc_en.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if a migrant worker wishes to change employers, the employee needs to receive a No Objection Certificate from the employer.&lt;ref name= "Review" /&gt;

The 2009 law provided that migrant workers could only receive residence permits without sponsorship in very limited circumstances, that migrant workers are only allowed to work for the employer which sponsored them and that sponsorships can only be transferred by the Minister of Interior in case of labor disputes or when abuse of the employee could be proven.&lt;ref name = "Jaffir"/&gt; The law additionally required employers to provide employees with exit permits if they wished to leave Qatar either temporarily or permanently, but also forced employers to return passports to employees once the residency procedure is completed.&lt;ref name = "Jaffir"/&gt;

In May 2014, Qatar announced its intentions to reform the labor laws and to abolish the kafala system.&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Bishara, M., “Qatar 2022: New labor laws 'fails to prevent exploitation’ says Amnesty”, CNN, 13 December 2016, available [http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/12/football/qatar-world-cup-2022-migrant-rights-crisis-amnesty-international/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; A new law, titled Law No. 21 on the Entry, Exit and Residency of Foreign Nationals replacing the 2009 Sponsorship Law, was adopted in 2015 and entered into force in December 2016.&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Amnesty Qatar2016"&gt;Amnesty International, “New name old system?

In '''Saudi Arabia''', the kafala system is enshrined in the 1969 Labor Law.&lt;ref name = "Dreams"&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Bad Dreams: Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia”, 2004:16 (No. 5), pp. 19-20, available [https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudi0704.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 law required every migrant worker to have signed a contract with an employer, placing them directly under the responsibility of the sponsor.&lt;ref name = "Dreams"/&gt; The employers were required to subsequently request the Saudi government to grant work permits for these migrant workers.&lt;ref name = "Dreams"/&gt; Work permits were granted upon arrival of the migrant workers, but only if they could show their employment contracts signed by both themselves and the sponsor.&lt;ref name = "Dreams"/&gt;

The 2005 Labour Law constituted a revision of the 1969 Labor Law, but contained many of the kafala elements found in the old 1969 Labor Law. The Ministry of Labor held the responsibility for work and residence permits.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Arabia, ''2006 Labour Law (Royal Decree No. M/51)'', art. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant workers could only receive work permits after signing a contract with an employer and being under the responsibility of the employer.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Arabia, ''2006 Labour Law (Royal Decree No. M/51)'', art. 33(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant workers were not allowed to work for other employers, nor were employers permitted to employ migrant workers belonging to other employers.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Arabia, ''2006 Labour Law (Royal Decree No. M/51)'', art. 39(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The labor contract had to state the duration of the employment.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Arabia, ''2006 Labour Law (Royal Decree No. M/51)'', art. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 Labour Law was amended in 2013, which provided Saudi police and labor authorities with the power to enforce the provisions of the Labor Law against undocumented laborers.&lt;ref name = "Detained"&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Detained, Beaten, Deported: Saudi Abuses against Migrants during Mass Expulsions”, 10 May 2015, available [https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/05/10/detained-beaten-deported/saudi-abuses-against-migrants-during-mass-expulsions#_ftn21 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments included both detention and deportation.&lt;ref name = "Detained"/&gt; The 2005 Labour Law was again amended in 2015, introducing more extensive labor protections. First of all, the amendments criminalized a series of abuse labor practices.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt; Secondly, the amendments increase paid leave and job-related injury compensation and oblige employers, when terminating a worker's contract, to provide the worker with a week's payment so other employment can be found.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt; Thirdly, the amendments enhance the powers of inspection and enforcement of the Ministry of Labor.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt;

Additionally, amendments included the introduction fines for labor rights violations, including the confiscations of passports, excessive working hours, dangerous working conditions, absent labor contracts, delayed salary payments and false reports of unauthorized leave.&lt;ref name = "MigrantRightsSaudiArabia2016"&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Recent Laws in Saudi Reinforce Migrant Workers’ Vulnerability”, 31 July 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/07/recent-laws-in-saudi-reinforce-migrant-workers-vulnerability/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steps" /&gt; Fines, as well as prison sentences, were also introduced for migrant workers who stayed in Saudi Arabia beyond the length of their residency permit and for leaving without the employer's permission.&lt;ref name = "MigrantRightsSaudiArabia2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “New Fines in Saudi Arabia for Employers’ Violations”, 24 January 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/01/new-fines-in-saudi-arabia-for-employers-violations/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the '''United Arab Emirates''', the kafala system was part of the 1980 Federal Law on the Regulation of Labour Relations, which regulated the relationship between the state, the sponsor and the sponsored.&lt;ref name = "KeaneMcGeehan2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keane |first1=David |last2=McGeehan |first2=Nicholas |title=Enforcing Migrant Workers&amp;apos; Rights in the United Arab Emirates |journal=International Journal on Minority and Group Rights |date=1 March 2008 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–115 |doi=10.1163/138548708X272537 |url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/id/eprint/4684 |accessdate=28 November 2018 |ref=harv |language=en |issn=1571-8115}}, pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;The law did not require any written contract to be drawn up between the employer and the migrant worker.&lt;ref name = "KeaneMcGeehan2008"/&gt; Migrant workers required the permission of their employers to change employment and the provided sponsorship could not be transferred to another employer.&lt;ref name = "KeaneMcGeehan2008"/&gt; The 1980 Law did regulate issues such as severance pay, repatriation pay, annual leave, standards for maximum working hours and working conditions, payment for overtime and the payment for treatment of labor-related injuries.&lt;ref name = "KeaneMcGeehan2008"/&gt; However, the law also prohibited labor unions and strikes.&lt;ref name = "KeaneMcGeehan2008"/&gt;
 
Labor law reforms were introduced in the UAE in 2016, which included a standardized offer letter prepared by the UAE's Ministry of Labor, a standardized work contract which must specify duration, nature of the work, place of employment, wages and remuneration.&lt;ref name = "Changes"&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Changes to UAE Labor Law”, 13 March 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/03/new-labor-changes-in-the-uae/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; The changes also specify working hours as 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week.&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt; However, these working hours could be higher for those working in the service industry.&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt; Furthermore, migrant workers are allowed to change employers after six months and only if their employer consents, or if employment is not provided or if a legal complaint of some sort is issued.&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt; Both parties can agree to end the employment contract after six months.&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt; According to the reforms, contracts must be made available in both Arabic, English and a third language if required.&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt; Employers who fail to provide translations are subjected to fines.&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt;

====Specific rights and protections====

* The right to end of service benefits;
* The right to health care benefits; 
* The right to maternity leave; 
* The right to sick pay;
* The right to travel provisions; 
* The right to vacation pay; and 
* The right to work injury benefits.&lt;ref name = "Barria"&gt;Roper &amp; Barria 2014a, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the following rights are not granted to migrant workers by any of the GCC countries:
* The right to access to finance;
* The right to anti-discrimination measures;
* The right to facilitation of remittance transfers;
* The right to family allowance or similar allowances;

* The right to work specific labor market integration.&lt;ref name = "Barria"/&gt;

==Human rights issues==
Multiple human rights organizations, in particular [[Human Rights Watch]], have reported on widespread violations of labor and human rights of migrant workers in the Gulf region. Reported abuses include the confiscation of passports, mobility restrictions, excessive working hours, delayed or absent salary payments, sub par working and living conditions, as well as sexual, physical and psychological abuse of workers by their employers.&lt;ref name="Kakande2016" &gt;Kakande, Y., "Where Are Our Passports?", ''Migrant-Rights.Org'', 5 January 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/01/where-are-our-passports/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Migrant-Rights.Org, "Making Visible the Experiences of Migrant Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia", 3 October 2014, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2014/10/making-visible-the-experiences-of-migrant-domestic-workers-in-saudi-arabia/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner &amp; Pessoa 2013, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain, "Slaving Away: Migrant Labor Exploitation and Human Trafficking in the Gulf", April 2014, available [http://adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ADHRB_Slaving-Away-Migrant-Rights-and-Human-Trafficking-the-the-Gulf-Web-Pre-Publication.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Human Rights Watch, "Kuwait: Events of 2015", 27 January 2016, available [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/Kuwait here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; RT, "Deceived migrant workers in UAE forced to work as slaves – report", 26 July 2016, available [https://www.rt.com/news/353432-uae-migrant-workers-slavery/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014" /&gt;

===Kafala system===
The kafala system has been pointed out by human rights organization as one of the main sources of some of the human rights abuses reported in the GCC countries.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt; As this sponsorship system, often enshrined in labor laws, assigns the employer with the sole responsibility for the migrant worker, it also provides the employer with a large amount of power leverage over their workers. In some GCC countries, employers have the ability to cancel a work permit at any time, while an employee cannot freely leave the employment without the employer's consent – in some cases, for example in Oman, not even when the contract is completed or if their sponsor submits the workers to abuses.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt; It is reported that migrant workers who do leave without their employer's consent have received punishment in some GCC countries, which can include re-entry bans, fines and deportation.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt; Often, migrant workers cannot leave their employment, as their employer has taken their passports. One report stated that in Qatar 90% of low income workers do not have their passports in possession.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner &amp; Pessoa 2013, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

As seen above, some states, such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE,&lt;ref name="Review" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Al Arabiya English, “Bahrain abolishes sponsorship system for foreign workers”, 19 December 2016, available [http://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/economy/2016/12/19/Bahrain-abolishes-sponsorship-system-for-foreign-workers.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KhanHarroff-Tavel2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty Qatar2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; AlJazeera, “UAE announces labour reforms to protect foreign workers”, 29 September 2015, available [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/uae-announces-labour-reforms-protect-foreign-workers-150929143336000.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; have announced their commitment to amend the legal framework of the kafala system and to extend labor protection to migrant workers. Some of these states have made substantial changes to their labor laws to include migrant workers,&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahra2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shah 2011, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty Qatar2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Steps" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Changes"/&gt; other states have not implemented any changes to the kafala system.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt;

===Protection of migrant domestic workers===
The labor rights of migrant domestic workers are a separate category in this regard, as all of the Gulf states, at least until recently, excluded migrant domestic workers from the protection of labor laws.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Bahrain: Abuse of Migrant Workers Despite Reforms”, 30 September 2012, available [https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/30/bahrain-abuse-migrant-workers-despite-reforms here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mekheil2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain, “Slaving Away: Migrant Labor Exploitation and Human Trafficking in the Gulf”, April 2014, pp. 45-46, available [http://adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ADHRB_Slaving-Away-Migrant-Rights-and-Human-Trafficking-the-the-Gulf-Web-Pre-Publication.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, “United Arab Emirates law to protect migrant workers fails to cover domestics”, 1 November 2015, available [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/united-arab-emirates-law-to-protect-migrant-workers-fails-to-cover-domestics-a6717146.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by Human Rights Watch, this leaves these workers vulnerable and open to all kinds of abuses, without any type redress available to them.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt; Some the abuses most regularly committed against migrant domestic workers according to NGO reports include sexual abuse, physical abuse, excessive working hours, the withholding of salaries, the absence of adequate food and living conditions and the confiscation of passports.&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pathirana, S., “Kuwait's abused domestic workers have 'nowhere to turn'”, BBC News, 13 October 2010, available [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11444167 here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mekheil2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, “Foreign domestic workers in Qatar: Shocking cases of deception, forced labour, violence”, 23 April 2014, available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde22/010/2013/en// here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014" /&gt;

Furthermore, while some sending states have prohibited migration of domestic workers to some of the Gulf states, NGOs have argued that such prohibitions only increase the possibility of such workers seeking illegal means to enter and work in Gulf states – which in turn increases the risks of forced labor and human trafficking.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt;

Some states, including Bahrain,&lt;ref&gt;International Domestic Workers Federation, “Bahrain: Passes new Labour Law to protect domestic workers”, 11 October 2012, available [http://idwfed.org/en/updates/bahrain-passes-new-labour-law-to-protect-domestic-workers here]&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwait,&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015" /&gt; Oman,&lt;ref&gt;Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain, “Spotlight on Oman: A Move to Protect Migrant Domestic Workers”, 8 May 2016, available [http://www.adhrb.org/2016/05/spotlight-oman-move-protect-migrant-domestic-workers/ here].&lt;/ref&gt; and Qatar,&lt;ref name = "HRW Qatar2017" /&gt; have announced intentions to amend or have indeed amended existing labor laws to give domestic workers better legal protection.

===Payment of (minimum) wages===
Most of the Gulf states have not adopted any minimum wage requirements,&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain, “Slaving Away: Migrant Labor Exploitation and Human Trafficking in the Gulf”, April 2014, p. 33, available [http://adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ADHRB_Slaving-Away-Migrant-Rights-and-Human-Trafficking-the-the-Gulf-Web-Pre-Publication.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rejimon, K., “'Expat workers should get minimum wage in Oman’”, Times of Oman, 16 June 2015, available [http://timesofoman.com/article/58493/Oman/Call-for-expat-workers-in-Oman-to-get-a-guaranteed-minimum-wage-under-revised-labour-laws here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khoja, S., “Employment &amp; labour law in Saudi Arabia”, Lexology, 20 June 2016, available [http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=6ba28ace-2bcf-49a7-9cba-98b08a8ff5a6 here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Export.gov, “UAE – Labor”, 8 November 2016, available [https://www.export.gov/article?id=United-Arab-Emirates-labor here]&lt;/ref&gt; and migrant workers often fall within the category of “low pay” labor. In 2012, Human Rights Watch reported that Bahraini migrant workers comprised 98% of the “low pay” labor group and most of the migrant workers interviewed by Human Rights Watch earned between BD40 and BD100 ($106 and $265) as their monthly salary.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010"/&gt; However, in 2016 Kuwait became the first Gulf state to set a minimum wage for domestic work and is set at KD60 (approximately $200) per month.&lt;ref&gt;AlJazeera, “Kuwait sets minimum wage for domestic workers”, 14 July 2016, available [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/kuwait-sets-minimum-wage-domestic-workers-160714143830769.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KuwaitWage 2016" &gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Kuwait Sets Minimum Wage for Domestic Workers”, 16 July 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/07/13795/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Another issue concerns delayed or absent salary payments.&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Kuwaiti Migrants Endure Delayed Wages &amp; Government Apathy”, 7 February 2014, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2014/02/kuwaiti-migrants-endure-delayed-wages-government-apathy/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MigrantsOIlCompany Oman2015" &gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Oil Companies Leave Migrants Stranded in Oman Without Pay”, 27 August 2015, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2015/08/oil-companies-leaves-migrants-stranded-in-oman-without-pay/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, A., Pessoa, S. and Harkness, L., “Labour Migrants and Access to Justice in Contemporary Qatar”, ''Middle East Center'', November 2014, p. 15, available [http://www.lse.ac.uk/middleEastCentre/publications/Reports/LabourMigrantsQatarEnglish.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatoum, L. and Alelyan, A., “A Crisis At Hand”, ''Newsweek Middle East'', 10 August 2016, available [http://newsweekme.com/a-crisis-at-hand/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RT, “Deceived migrant workers in UAE forced to work as slaves – report”, 26 July 2016, available [https://www.rt.com/news/353432-uae-migrant-workers-slavery/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Oman it was reported that falling oil prices and the nationalization program not only led to a drop in new projects in the oil sector, but also to stranded migrant workers who often had not been paid for six months, who did not have employment and whose work permits had expired in the meantime.&lt;ref name="MigrantsOIlCompany Oman2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rejimon, K., “Send Stranded Expat Workers Home, Says Oman’s Ministry of Manpower Official”, ''Times of Oman'', 25 September 2016, available [http://timesofoman.com/article/92931/Oman/Government/Send-stranded-expat-workers-home-says-Oman's-Ministry-of-Manpower-official here]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these workers went on to find new employment, and without the permission of their previous employer, lost their work permit and thus became undocumented.&lt;ref name="MigrantsOIlCompany Oman2015" /&gt; Both the delayed and absent salary payments were found to be the greatest violations of labor laws during inspections in Oman in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Migrants in Oman Lodges 2,279 Complaints in the First Quarter of 2013”, 21 November 2013, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2013/11/migrants-in-oman-lodges-2279-complaints-in-the-first-quarter-of-2013/https://www.migrant-rights.org/2013/11/migrants-in-oman-lodges-2279-complaints-in-the-first-quarter-of-2013/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with the payment of salaries, as reported by Migrant-Rights.Org, relates to the creation of so-called Wage Protection Systems in the Gulf states.&lt;ref name = "Earning"&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Oman Announces a New Wage Database… To Make Sure Workers Aren’t Earning Too Much”, 23 January 2017, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2017/01/oman-announces-a-new-wage-database-to-make-sure-workers-arent-earning-too-much/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; While the Gulf's governments claim the aim of the system is to protect labor rights, according to Migrant-Rights.Org the Omani government has recently stated that it intends to use the system to monitor and gather information about the wages and bank accounts of workers – in order to keep an eye on remittances sent back to the home country.&lt;ref name = "Earning"/&gt; According to the same Migrant-Rights.Org report, the Omani government regards remittances as “wasted investment” and wishes to offer its economy better protection against such losses.&lt;ref name = "Earning"/&gt; The government of Saudi Arabia is also reported to use the Wage Protection System to control the finances and spending of migrant workers.&lt;ref name = "MigrantRightsSaudiArabia2016"/&gt; Furthermore, while there have not been any specific proposals in this regard, the [[International Monetary Fund]] has warned against potential plans of Gulf states to implement of remittance taxes to increase state revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Maceda, C., “IMF cautions vs tax on expat remittances, personal incomes”, ''Gulf News'', 29 November 2016, available [http://gulfnews.com/business/economy/imf-cautions-vs-tax-on-expat-remittances-personal-incomes-1.1936961 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportations===
In recent years, Gulf states have implemented policies of large-scale deportations of both undocumented and documented migrant workers, for a variety of reasons. According to Kuwaiti media, 14,400 migrants were deported from Kuwait between January and April 2016.&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt; In 2016, a total of 29,000 migrants were deported from Kuwait, in comparison to about 25,000 migrants in 2015.&lt;ref name = "Parliament"&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Kuwait Deported 29,000 Migrants in 2016 – And the Parliament Wants to Deport More”, 15 January 2017, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2017/01/kuwait-deports-29000-migrants-in-2016-and-the-parliament-wants-to-deport-more/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, almost a million migrants were deported from Saudi Arabia, according to Migrant-Rights.Org, in order to boost employment of Saudi nationals and protect national security.&lt;ref name="GCCStrikes2014" &gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Labor Strikes in the GCC: Deportations and Victories in 2014”, 29 October 2014, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2014/10/labor-strikes-in-the-gcc-deportations-and-victories-in-2014/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, 7,346 undocumented migrants were deported from Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “7,346 Deported from Bahrain in 2013”, 3 January 2014, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2014/01/7346-deported-from-bahrain-in-2013/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 reportedly more than 600 migrants were deported from Oman in just seven day.&lt;ref&gt;Times of Oman, “640 expatriates arrested, 409 deported for violating labour law in Oman”, 7 December 2016, available [http://timesofoman.com/article/98083/Oman/Government/640-expatriates-arrested-409-deported-for-violating-labour-law-in-Oman here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrant workers are reportedly often deported for minor transgressions, such as traffic violations, barbecuing in public spaces, complaints about working conditions, organizing strikes or violations of the terms of the residency and work permits.&lt;ref name="GCCStrikes2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MigrantsKuwaitPrison2016" &gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Detention of Migrant Workers at Kuwait’s Central Prison”, 12 January 2016, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2016/01/detention-of-migrant-workers-at-kuwaits-central-prison/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MEE, “More than 100 migrant workers may be deported after Qatar strike”, 26 November 2014, available [http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/over-100-migrant-workers-threatened-deportation-after-three-day-strike-qatar-2081152951 here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batty, D., “Migrants building UAE cultural hub 'risk abuse if they complain'”, The Guardian, 10 February 2015, available [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch here]&lt;/ref&gt; The arrested migrants often only spend three days to a week in prison before the actual deportation, leaving them without time or means to appeal the deportation decision.&lt;ref name = "Parliament"/&gt; Nevertheless, these mass deportations still lead to overcrowded prisons, human rights organizations have reported.&lt;ref&gt;Migrant-Rights.Org, “Kuwait’s Police Stations “Crammed” With Deportees”, 3 June 2014, available [https://www.migrant-rights.org/2014/06/kuwaits-police-stations-crammed-with-deportees/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that these mass deportations are part of the Gulf States’ policies to increase employment of their nationals and to improve national security.&lt;ref name="MigrantsKuwaitPrison2016" /&gt;

In spring 2013, King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] announced a government policy focused on deportation of irregular migrants, which required these migrants to regularize their status or to leave.&lt;ref name = "Slaving"&gt;Americans for Democracy &amp; Human Rights in Bahrain, “Slaving Away: Migrant Labor Exploitation and Human Trafficking in the Gulf”, April 2014, pp. 47-48, available [http://adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ADHRB_Slaving-Away-Migrant-Rights-and-Human-Trafficking-the-the-Gulf-Web-Pre-Publication.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; While about one million foreign workers left voluntarily, reports estimate that between November 2013 and March 2014 around 370,000 migrant workers were forcibly deported from Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name = "Slaving"/&gt; It was reported that crimes were committed by the Saudi police against these migrants, including extreme violence, torture, rape and killing.&lt;ref name = "Slaving"/&gt;

===Access to legal remedies===
Although access to legal remedies is provided by the 1990 [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]],&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Human Rights: Office of the High Commissioner, International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, 1990 (GA Res. 45/158), art. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975|1975 Migrant Workers Convention (Supplementary Provisions)]],&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization, Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 143), art. 9(2).&lt;/ref&gt; these conventions have not been ratified by the Gulf states.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Human Rights: Office of the High Commissioner, "Status of Ratification: International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families", last accessed 20 February 2017, ''available [http://indicators.ohchr.org/ here'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization, "Ratifications of C143 - Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 143)", last accessed 20 February 2017, ''available [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312288 here'']&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, access to legal redress for labor rights violations is provided in some Gulf states,&lt;ref&gt;Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Manpower, ''Labour Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 35/2003'', art. 104, available [https://www.manpower.gov.om/Portal/Englishpdf/Service/toc_en.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, A., Pessoa, S. and Harkness, L., “Labour Migrants and Access to Justice in Contemporary Qatar”, ''Middle East Center'', November 2014, p. 22, available [http://www.lse.ac.uk/middleEastCentre/publications/Reports/LabourMigrantsQatarEnglish.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, “Bad Dreams: Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia”, 15 July 2004, available [https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudi0704.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; the accessibility of these remedies in practice is often hampered by multiple factors.

One set of issues relates to language and mobility barriers, which hinder migrant workers’ access to institutions, information and services. Many migrant workers do not speak enough Arabic to understand the information needed to receive redress, while the lack of public transportation and the long working hours impede the mobility of migrant workers.&lt;ref name="Mekheil2016" /&gt; In this regard, the reportedly existing perception that the courts will favour nationals over the migrant workers does not improve the accessibility of remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, A., “Migrant Workers in Kuwait: The Role of State Institutions”, ''Middle East Institute'', 2 February 2010, available [http://www.mei.edu/content/migrant-workers-kuwait-role-state-institutions here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue in this regard is the backlog of some of the Gulf countries’ courts. In the UAE, for example, Dubai courts could not keep up with the number of labor complaints filed – especially around 2008, when the global financial crisis inhibited companies from providing their employees with work or salaries.&lt;ref name="Youha" /&gt; Some critics have also pointed to understaffing and underfunding and the absence of coordination between enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="Youha" /&gt;

However, even if migrant workers gain access to legal remedies, they do not always receive redress. In the case of Bahrain, 50 Pakistani workers were detained by the authorities after they filed a complaint with the Bahraini courts concerning a lack of salary payments.&lt;ref name = "Pakistanis"&gt;Bahrain Center for Human Rights, “50 Pakistanis detained in Bahrain for salary payment issue”, 18 January 2017, available [http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/node/8452 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the court ruled in the workers’ favour, they were still detained by the authorities for at least a year and were still imprisoned in January 2017.&lt;ref name = "Pakistanis"/&gt;

===The FIFA World Cup in Qatar===

Since Qatar was elected to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], the country has been heavily criticized for the treatment of migrant workers in the preparations for the tournament. While Qatar has received less criticism in the past for its treatment of migrant workers than other GCC countries, the preparations for the World Cup have drawn more attention to the situation of workers' rights in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, "World Report 2015: Qatar", "Human Rights Watch", 2015, available, [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/qatar here]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers have died at a rate of one death per day, and workers' salaries are being withheld by employers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, O. and Pattisson, P., "Death toll among Qatar’s 2022 World Cup workers revealed", ''The Guardian'', 23 December 2014, available [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/qatar-nepal-workers-world-cup-2022-death-toll-doha here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattisson2013"&gt;Pattisson, P. "Revealed: Qatar's World Cup 'slaves'", "The Guardian", 25 September 2013, available [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/revealed-qatars-world-cup-slaves here]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also stories of Nepalese migrant workers, constituting the single largest migrant group in Qatar, seeking refuge in the Embassy of Nepal in [[Doha]]. [[The Guardian]] stated that most Nepalese migrant workers have large debts, as they borrowed money to pay their recruitment agents.&lt;ref name="Pattisson2013" /&gt;

Amnesty International argues that labor migration to Qatar will continue to increase, due to the World Cup constructions and labels the conditions for workers as "grim".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; An additional pull factor is the intention of the Qatari government, in light of the World Cup, to transform Doha into an international hub. Government bodies in Qatar have dismissed critiques regarding the exploitation of migrants and have referred to the exploitation of migrant workers as isolated incidents.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Amnesty International, "The Dark Side of Migration", 17 November 2013, p. 5-6, available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE22/010/2013/en/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International, regional and local responses==
Multiple initiatives have been undertaken on the local, regional and international level, by both non-governmental organizations as well as governmental organizations. Responses from international organizations, civil society organizations, trade unions concerning the protection of migrant workers have increased, as have initiatives to report migrant workers' rights violations.

On the international level, several large NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], have frequently reported on different issues regarding migrant workers' rights. Human Rights Watch has reported, ''inter alia'', on different foreign workers' rights abuses,&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW UAE2014"/&gt; on specific vulnerable categories of migrant workers,&lt;ref name="HRW Oman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW KSA2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015b" /&gt; and on new policies and legislation implemented by the Gulf states aimed at protecting migrant workers.&lt;ref name = "Steps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Qatar2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW Kuwait2010"/&gt; Amnesty International has produced similar reports,&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, "Amnesty International Annual Report 2016/17", 22 February 2017, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/4800/2017/en/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Amnesty International, "India: Exploited dreams: Dispatches from Indian migrant workers in Saudi Arabia", 4 July 2014, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA20/025/2014/en/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Amnesty International, "Kuwait must reject proposed homophobic ‘medical tests’ on migrant workers", 11 October 2013, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/10/kuwait-must-reject-proposed-homophobic-medical-tests-migrant-workers/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Amnesty International, "Gulf Cooperation Council: Protect Domestic Migrant Workers from Abuse", 1 May 2007, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/fr/documents/mde04/001/2007/en/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt; recently focusing strongly on the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, "Ruggie Report: Migrant workers in Qatar cannot afford more broken promises from FIFA", 14 April 2016, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/04/migrant-workers-in-qatar-cannot-afford-more-broken-promises-from-fifa/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, "Qatar: World Cup 2022 Forced Labour", 31 March 2016, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/03/qatar-world-cup-2022-forced-labour/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, "Qatar: Abuse of World Cup workers Exposed", 31 March 2016, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/03/abuse-of-world-cup-workers-exposed/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, "Five years of human rights failure shames FIFA and Qatar", 1 December 2015, ''available [https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/12/five-years-of-human-rights-failure-shames-fifa-and-qatar/ here].''&lt;/ref&gt; The International Organisation for Migration has also published reports on migrant workers, covering both the Asian sending states and Gulf receiving states.&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, S. and Larsen, J.

Another organisation is the  Migrant Forum Asia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfasia.org/about-us/the-organization/|title=The Organization - Migrant Forum in Asia|author=|date=|website=mfasia.org|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a regional network of NGOs, trade unions, associations and individuals created for the protection of migrant workers' rights and the promotion of their wellbeing. They have reported on multiple issues involving Asian migrant workers in the Gulf region.&lt;ref&gt;MFA, "Call for immediate intervention on the massive arrests of undocumented Indian migrant workers in Oman", 8 December 2016, ''available [http://mfasia.org/call-for-immediate-intervention-on-the-massive-arrests-of-undocumented-indian-migrant-workers-in-oman-2/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MFA, "Jennifer Dalquez – Migrant Worker Sentenced to Death by U.A.E Court", 11 March 2017, ''available [http://mfasia.org/jennifer-dalquez-migrant-worker-sentenced-to-death-by-u-a-e-court/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a national organisation is Lawyers for Human Rights International &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.lfhri.org/ | title=LFHRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an India-based NGO which campaigns for the protection of Indian migrant workers overseas. One of the main objectives of the NGO is to raise awareness about human rights abuses taking place in the GCC.&lt;ref name="Youha" /&gt; Furthermore, in 2003 the UAE chapter of the Migrante International was created, an alliance of Filipino migrant worker organizations across the world.&lt;ref name="Youha" /&gt; The objectives of the organisation are mainly to strengthen labor protection, and to increase penalties for recruitment agencies which violate Filipino laws and for employers who violate UAE labor laws.&lt;ref name="Youha" /&gt; The organisation additionally provides services such as training, legal advice, counseling and temporary shelter for Filipinos who experience abuse from their employers.&lt;ref name="Youha" /&gt; Two other organisations active in Bahrain are the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahrainrights.org/issue/term/16|title=Migrant workers - Bahrain Center for Human Rights|author=|date=|website=www.bahrainrights.org|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; , focusing on migrant workers' rights amongst other issues, and the Migrant Workers Protection Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwpsbahrain.com/|title=MWPS - The Migrant Workers Protection Society|author=|date=|website=www.mwpsbahrain.com|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; , created in 2005 to assist migrant workers in receiving full human rights protection. An example of an individual initiative is the development of a smartphone app for migrant workers, created by an Indian journalist in Oman in 2016 together with the Migrant Forum Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Singh, T., "Indian Workers Facing Trouble in Gulf Countries Can Instantly Get Help with This App", ''The Better India'', 26 February 2016, ''available [http://www.thebetterindia.com/46901/migcall-app-for-migrant-workers-in-gulf-countries/ here]''&lt;/ref&gt; On downloading, the app, called MigCall, saves ten helpline telephone numbers which provides access to services in six different languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During registration, the user must also supply an emergency contact number. In case of an emergency, the user can press the SOS button in the app and a message will be sent to the emergency contact, while the user's GPS location will be sent to the closest Indian embassy or consulate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In February 2016, the app had been downloaded 12.000.000 times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because of the activities of these NGOs, international organisations and local initiatives, large proportions of available data concerning migrant workers and their working conditions come from organisations.&lt;ref name="Sonmez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sönmez |first1=Sevil |last2=Apostolopoulos |first2=Yorghos |last3=Tran |first3=Diane |last4=Rentrope |first4=Shantyana |title=Human rights and health disparities for migrant workers in the UAE |journal=Health and Human Rights |date=2011 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=17–35 |url=https://www.hhrjournal.org/2013/08/human-rights-and-health-disparities-for-migrant-workers-in-the-uae/ |accessdate=28 November 2018 |ref=harv}}, pp. 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; During the past decades, these actors have investigated labor conditions, human rights violations, demographics and movements, and have further created guidelines for both recipient and sending countries in order to monitor, investigate, report and strengthen policies aimed at protecting migrant workers in the GCC.&lt;ref name="Sonmez" /&gt;

== Impact of migrants ==
The GCC constitutes one of the most attractive geographical regions for migrants globally, mainly due to its economic pull factors. International migrants have further contributed to a large proportion of the [[economic growth]] in the GCC.&lt;ref&gt;Naufal &amp; Termos 2010a, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colton, N. a. “The International Political Economy of Gulf Migration,” Middle East Institute Viewpoints, 2010 p. 34, available [http://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Migration_and_the_Gulf.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;  The national populace did generally not have the numbers or [[know-how]] to implement the development objectives set by the respective national leaderships of the GCC countries. Development plans outlined by several political leaders in the GCC were therefore in need of a high amount of labor migrants. These labor migrants are mainly linked to the [[private sector]], where salaries are lower and hours longer. On the other hand, national citizens in the GCC mainly work in the government-sponsored [[public sector]] where labor conditions are generally better.&lt;ref name = "Colton"&gt;Colton, N. A. “The International Political Economy of Gulf Migration”, ''Middle East Institute Viewpoints'', February 2010, p. 34-36, available [http://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Migration_and_the_Gulf.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
After the [[first Gulf War]] in 1990-1991, Kuwait was especially affected. The immense deprivation of the country required Kuwait to rebuild the country's economy and infrastructure, mainly through the reconstruction of the [[petroleum industry]]. Although the pre-war level of the GDP per capita was achieved already in 1992, it constituted a costly the process.&lt;ref&gt;Shehabi, M., R., "An extraordinary Recovery: Kuwait Following the Gulf War," Business School University of Western Australia, 2015, p. 1-28, available [http://www.business.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/2765850/15.20-Shehabi,-M.-An-Extraordinary-Recovery-Kuwait-Following-the-Gulf-War.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome was that a large number of Kuwaitis started to push for [[workforce nationalization]] through “Kuwaitization” of the labor force in the country, as it was argued that migrants took work opportunities away from the national citizens. According to Nora Ann Colton, a Professor of [[International Economics]] at [[Drew University]], the "Kuwaitization" movement  was a product of poor planning by the authorities in charge and could have been avoided. However, Kuwaiti authorities enforced policies which required nationals to have a lower skill set than non-Kuwaitis. Similar policies were spread throughout the GCC-region during a relatively short time period. There still exists the concern today that national unemployment will increase, and therefore authorities work to integrate nationals within the private sector. The verdict so far is that these initiatives have proven to be largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref name = "Colton"/&gt;

The '''National Hero of Azerbaijan''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan milli qəhrəmanı}}) is the highest [[Hero (title)|national title]] in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]. The title was named the highest national award on March 25, 1992, and the [["Qizil Ulduz" Medal]] awarded as a sign of receiving this title was established by a separate law in July 1992&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerbaijans.com/content_418_en.html On the title of "National Hero of Azerbaijan"]&lt;/ref&gt; The law on the title has been in effect since December 25, 1995.  It can be awarded only once to the same person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mia.gov.az/qulievmadat_en.html Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan]. Retrieved May 29, 2007 - DEAD LINK&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is awarded for outstanding services of national importance to Azerbaijan in defense and strengthening of the state system and creation of important national values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-qanun.az/print.php?internal=view&amp;target=1&amp;docid=7454&amp;doctype=0 ''""Azərbaycanın Milli Qəhrəmanı" adının təsis olunması haqqında" Azərbaycan Respublikasının Qanununda dəyişikliklər edilməsi barədə"'' Azərbaycan Respublikasının 15 iyul 1992-ci il tarixli, 210 nömrəli '''Qanunu'''] {{az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[book]] tells the [[narrative|story]] of a [[fairy]] that has come to the world to try to understand and to bypass the difficulties that was faced by children. She is arrested and then turns again into an "idea".

== Award ==
The book won the [[award]] "The Better for the Child", in 1979, by the [[:pt:Fundação Nacional do Livro Infantil e Juvenil|National Foundation for the Infantile and Juvenile Book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_lit/index.cfm?fuseaction=biografias_texto&amp;cd_verbete=5810&amp;cd_item=36|title=Queirós, Bartolomeu Campos de (1944 - 2012)|date=4 May 2009|publisher=Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural de Literatura Brasileira|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
:"This is [[fairy]] story, but a different story. In a [[poetic language]], the author tells the story of a fairy that returns to the nowadays world that doesn't have place for fairies anymore. The [[magician (paranormal)|magicians]] or [[wizard (fantasy)|wizards]] and [[witch]]es take part of the [[allegory]] that subtly criticizes those who don't know how to dream, who change the [[fantasy]] and pure [[desire (emotion)|desires]] for needs artificially stimulated, who only conceive a "registered, stamped, controlled" world. The [[children]] themselves, used to that, don't know how to identify their desires anymore. Although this is an elaborate criticism to [[modern world]],  the text fortunately shows us a [[counterpoint]] and a real hope light - the fact that in dreams, intimately, children know that fantasy is possible and necessary and the [[incantation|enchantment]] is more important that the [[magic (illusion)|magic]]. Beyond surveying a beautiful work with [[language]], the book opens doors to fundamental discussions for who will be the [[adult]] of tomorrow.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivreiro.com.br/livros/1430629-onde-tem-bruxa-tem-fada|title=Onde Tem Bruxa Tem Fada|publisher=Livreiro|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"To where does the world go without [[imagination]] and fantasy? Imagine the disappointment of Mary Heaven, a fairy that comes to earth and discovers that [[consumerism]] has dominated everyone and there is no more space to dream and fantasy! A [[legend]] full of fascinating themes, making us think of conventions imposed by [[progress (history)|progress]]. Would be the sacrifice of [[love]] and liberty in change to material comfort?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skoob.com.br/livro/14539-onde-tem-bruxa-tem-fada|title=Onde Tem Bruxa Tem Fada|publisher=Skoob|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pan African Federation of Filmmakers''' ('''Fédération Panafricaine des Cinéastes''', or '''FEPACI'''), formed in 1969 and inaugurated in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;Clement Tapsoba, [http://fepaci.org/congress1/archives/Origins%20Of%20Fepaci.pdf "The history of African Cinema and the origins of FEPACI"]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Updated by FEPACI Secretariat.&lt;/ref&gt; is "the continental voice of filmmakers from various regions of Africa and the Diaspora",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fepaci.org/aboutus.htm "About FEPACI"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718234815/http://www.fepaci.org/aboutus.htm |date=2015-07-18 }}, official website.&lt;/ref&gt; focusing attention on the promotion of African film industries in terms of production, distribution and exhibition.

==History==

At the forefront of the creation of FEPACI were individual film practitioners who were passionate about African cinema. In 1952, [[Paulin Vieyra]] and his friends formed a group called African Cinema, an informal body that had no legal status at the time. At the birth of African Cinema it was evident that the commitment from filmmakers to produce films was mainly for ideological, economic and cultural development. Film-makers and other African intellectuals also organized themselves through unions, political parties, associations of writers were participating in a civil movement aimed at the emancipation of African Cinema and other artistic formations from colonial dominated structures. The era played an important role introducing film as a medium of expression and a transformational tool for achieving not only political freedom but cultural and ideological freedom as well.

In 1955, black Africa was still largely under European colonial domination. The fight for independence by colonized peoples took a new turn and tone, a new lexicon and vocabulary of intellectual thought was found in the speech against colonialism delivered in the 1950s by [[Aimé Césaire]], ''[[Discourse on colonialism|Discours sur le colonialisme]]'' (''Discourse on Colonialism''), subsequently published in 1956 by ''[[Présence Africaine]]''. Ideas expressed by African and Caribbean intellectuals about the role of the colonial enterprise in the disruption of African societies and the negation of their indigenous cultures became more succinct and radical. 
The [[Bandung conference]] held in [[Indonesia]] in 1955 allowed for the first time the peoples of Africa and Asia, to raise their voices farther and beyond their continents to demand the right to equal emancipation and freedom of their Continents.

It was in the Second [[Congress of Black Writers and Artists]], held in [[Rome]] in 1959, that a group led by Paulin Vieyra called for a resolution to develop art in Africa. The resolution stressed the need for African ownership of the means of expression, control of production and strategic proprietorship of public platforms that disseminated the African story and its imagery. The resolution also requested that future congresses be accompanied by an African Art Festival. The resolution was implemented in April 1966 in [[Dakar]], where the first [[World Festival of Black Arts]] was hosted. 26 films from 16 African countries were screened at this festival. At the end of the festival a resolution for the creation of an inter-African body of cinematography was made and this was led by the African Cinema group. The headquarters of this body was to be in Dakar and the office’s mandate was to organize meetings of African cinema professionals, film directors, technicians, actors, students from all over Africa to ensure a strong activist movement set to work collectively in the development and advancement of the audiovisual film industry. 

'''Creating FEPACI'''

[[Tunisia]] created the [[Carthage Film Festival]] in 1966. Three years later in 1969, FEPACI, a continent body was formed and inaugurated in 1970. The African Cinema group led by Paulin Vieyra helped lay the groundwork at the Pan African Cultural Festival held in [[Algiers]] in 1969 for the establishment of the Pan African Federation of Film-Makers (FEPACI).

'''FEPACI Secretaries General'''

The first FEPACI Secretary General elected was Senegalese [[Ababacar Makharam Samb]] in the 1970s, followed by [[Johnson Traore]] in and then [[Gaston Kabore]]. After the Congress in 1997, FEPACI went into a transitional period with its constitution from a mother body strictly for membership by national organizations to the constitution that was adopted in 2001. [[Pierre Rwamba]] was chair of the interim committee that was given the task to reformulate the constitution. The 7th congress of FEPACI in 2001 adopted the new constitution and [[Jacques Behanzin]] was voted as secretary general. He was followed by Mrs. [[Seipati Bulane-Hopa]]; the incumbent secretary general Mr. [[Cheick Oumar Sissoko]] was elected at the 2013

FEPACI remains a unique organization of its kind with no equivalent in either Europe, America or Asia. FEPACI reflects the commitment of filmmakers who were anti-imperialist and who in demonstration of their resistance and fight against colonialism drafted the famous Charter of Algiers adopted unanimously on January 18, 1975, at the Second Congress of the FEPACI in Algiers.

FEPACI Policies FEPACI policies were driven by a "political militancy" that waged an ideological warfare against cultural imperialism, against the political and economic subversion of Africa. The militancy was led by film pioneers who were not only vocal about the status quo but who made films that interrogated and challenged Africa’s leadership, putting a lot of scrutiny on their ability and capacity to govern in a just and accountable manner. 
There was some policy changes that positively impacted the production and distribution of African films so FEPACI made some achievements while realizing that a lot more still had to be achieved. 
FEPACI's achievements include: 
# The establishment of FESPACO, the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]]. 
# The drafting and adoption of The Algiers Charter on African Cinema in 1975 and the Niamey Manifesto of African Filmmakers in 1982 
# The issuing of the Final Communiqué of the First Frontline Film Festival and Workshop in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]], in 1990 
# The establishment of the Southern African Film Festival (SAFF) that was organized as the First Frontline Film Festival in Harare in 1990 
# The issuing of the Statement of African Women Professionals of Cinema, Television and Video, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in 1991 and the establishment of UPAFI, The Union of African filmmakers. 
# The establishment of the magazine/journal ''[[Ecrans d'Afrique]]'' (African Screens) in collaboration with the Centro Oriamento Educativo (COE) in Milan, Italy, around 1993. 
# The Distribution Workshop in Victoria Falls and the founding of the Southern African Broadcasters Association in 1993 
# Contribution to the founding of SITHENGI (now defunct) in 1994 and the publication of the book in celebration of a centenary African Cinema L’Afrique et le Centenaire du Cinéma - Africa and the Centenary of Cinema in 1995 
# The founding of the Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF) in 1995–96 
# The Agreement by African Heads of State in [[Maputo]] on the principle of the establishment of the Audio Visual and Cinema Committee in 2003. 
# The hosting of the First African Film Summit in collaboration with the South African Department of Arts and Culture and the NFVF in Tshwane South Africa in April 2006.
# [[Martin Scorsese]]'s [[The Film Foundation|Film Foundation]] World Cinema Project, [[UNESCO]] and FEPACI sign a letter of agreement formalising their partnership on the African Film Heritage Project, a joint initiative to preserve African cinema. 2017

FEPACI has observer status of the Organization of African Unity and as an NGO representative by UNESCO and other international bodies, among them the Inter-governmental Agency of La Francophonie, the [[Arab League]] and the [[European Union]].

'''Militancy and thematic and aesthetic choices'''

What was the impact of aesthetic choices of films made during this period?
 
Films such as ''Africa on seine'', ''[[Borom Sarret]]'' and ''[[Black Girl (1966 film)|Black Girl]]'' (1966) that were shot in the first decade of independence were precursors of militant and radical film-making whose content and themes were aligned to the spirit of the Charter of Algiers. During this period of political activism - with the exception of [[Ousmane Sembène]], who recalls his film ''[[Emitaï]]'' (1971) the resistance of peasants and farmers in Casamance to requisitioning of rice during the Second World War - few filmmakers were interested in making films on resistance and colonialism – while filmmakers in the Maghreb or Arabic countries were focused on that genre. The majority of films shot in black francophone Africa were characterized mainly by social disputes, which illustrated themes that spoke of social ills and difficulties common in films such as ''Borom Sarret'' (1963, by Ousmane Sembène), regarded as the first short film to denounce neo-colonialism. In his other film ''[[Xala]]'' (1974) Sembène juxtaposes tradition and modernity. ''[[Touki Bouki]]'' (1972), by [[Djibril Diop Mambety]], marked a break with the narrative form of classical films of this period and was seen as among the most militant. The time for questions and the crisis The awakening of conscientious filmmakers to renew their activist past was supported by the revolutionary regime of Burkina headed by Captain Sankara in 1983. The third FEPACI congress was held on the ninth edition of FESPACO in 1985. The FEPACI headquarters was moved to Ouagadougou and filmmaker Gaston Kabore was appointed to the post of Secretary General and remained there until 1997. [[Gaston Kabore]] restored the Film Federation.

While support came from Burkina Faso and a more substantial one comes from the European Union, which financed a plan to revive the African Cinema and the production of African films. FEPACI’s ensuing collaboration with Latin American filmmakers during Gaston’s custodianship allowed filmmakers to train in Cuban schools. The visibility of African cinema was further made greater at the [[Cannes Festival]], also via the publication of the cinema magazine ''Ecrans d'Afrique'', which was produced with the support of the Italian NGO Centro Orientamento educativo (COE).

In terms of thematic and aesthetic genres, cinema in Africa matured further during the mid-1980s to late '90s and attracted international screens with films such as ''[[Yeelen]]'' (1987), ''[[Wend Kuuni]]'' (1982), ''Bal Dust'' (1988), ''[[Tilaï]]'' (1989), ''[[Yaaba]]'' (1989), ''[[Hyenas (1992 film)|Hyenas]]'' (1992), and ''Sankofa (film)|Sankofa]]'' (1993). However, it was during this period that FEPACI had to assess the economic crisis and creative impact the lack of funds for films had on the developing production sector had on making African films. The crisis can be traced back to 1980 during the severance tax subsidies from French cinemas by the French ministry of cooperation which before the cut had helped with the production of films.

The combined effects of the failures of national distribution organizations and CIDC CIPROFILM, the lack of funding policies at state levels, the socio-political and economic changes (including the devaluation of the [[CFA franc]] in 1994) occurred in the early 1990s and contributed to diminishing the collective commitment and also the political activism. In the mid-1990s a proliferation of a group of filmmakers formed private productions and associations aimed at complementing aims of FEPACI.

Among them were: 
* UCECAO in Mali (1995), 
* The Guild of African Directors and Producers (by established film-makers in the diaspora in Paris) in 1998 
* ARPA (Association of Producers African directors created in 2001 in Ouagadougou) and others

Since the last congress in 2001, FEPACI hopes for a rebirth of a powerful FEPACI again, a renaissance of the organization that proves the vision began African cinema to advance develop and grow the audiovisual cinema industry is not over. FEPACI today remains inspired by the great militant spirit borne by pioneer film-makers in the Charter of Algiers to further the vision of creating a viable and sustainable audiovisual environment in Africa.

'''Development of FEPACI throughout its Congresses''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fepaci.org/congress1.htm Morabane Modise]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 28, 2001, filmmakers gathered in the Dassasgho suburb of Ouagadougou, [[Burkina Faso]], to reconstitute the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), it was the Seventh Congress of the Federation. The Sixth Congress in 1997 had mandated a committee to make a study of the status of the audio-visual industries and contextualise the constitution of FEPACI. It took four years before the next new constitution was presented, so it went to Congress. It was a Congress that marked a major transformation of the nature of the Federation.
 
Whereas the founding constitution of FEPACI was open only to national association of filmmakers within the continent,&lt;ref name=Diawara&gt;[[Manthia Diawara| Diawara, Manthia]] (1992), ''African Cinema: Politics and Culture'', Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN| 0-253-20707-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the new constitution allowed for individual membership, related industries and associations as well as those in the global African diaspora. Although the 2001 constitution was a major change to the structure of the organisation, FEPACI had several strategic and principle re-adjustments following trends and developmental challenges of the time on the continent.
 
The formation of the federation in 1969 was more of a consolidation of filmmakers' efforts to create a film industry in the continent. Most of the filmmakers were driven by anti-colonial spirit of the time. Having a profound understanding of the power the medium at their hands had to influence and shape the minds, they immediately aligned themselves as a sister body to the continental body [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) that was formed in 1963 to promote the unity and solidarity of African Countries, to defend the sovereignty of members to eradicate all forms of colonialism, to coordinate and harmonise Member States economic, educational, scientific policies among others. As with the case of the OAU membership to FEPACI was open only to National Association of Filmmakers&lt;ref name=Diawara /&gt; Filmmakers had to unify themselves within their country of origin to take membership of FEPACI the exception to this rule was for those filmmakers who were in "occupied" or "troubled" countries - a condition (status) the late [[Lionel Ngakane]] (Doctor - honoris causa) was under for a very long time due to [[Apartheid]], and its racial policies.
 
The development of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers – La Federation Panafricaine des Cineastes (FEPACI) – has been closely related to attempts at developing a film industry in the continent and there were success stories in some Francophone countries. Affected by lack of national and international industries, non existent structures of production, distribution and exhibition, filmmakers would discuss their material condition looking at their individual and national battles at various art and cultural forums that were organised by some of their governments. They would look at finding workable solutions as well as getting their respective national governments' intervention.
 
For an organisation with more than 40 years of existence FEPACI has had very few General Congresses. Perhaps this is because of how FEPACI was founded, from deliberations of cultural industry thinkers. This also reflects the nature of the organisation as a self-conscious organisation that involves a constant reflection upon itself to be at par with the rapid changes in technologies and trends in the overall discipline of the "seventh art" within the cultural industries.
 
Every Congress of FEPACI has been necessitated by a need to re-focus the federation on politico-socio and economic principles with the milieu at the time, whether internal or [[www.fepacisecretariate.org|external]].

* 1969 Algiers, Algeria: FEPACI is formed; it is inaugurated in 1970 as Le Federation Panafriçaine des Cineastes in Carthage, Tunisia
 
* 1975 Algiers, Algeria: the meeting that was referred to as the 2nd Congress. The discussion was the future of African Cinema.
 
* 1982 Niamey, Niger: 3rd Congress of FEPACI. which formulated what came to be known as "Le Manifeste de Niamey"
 
* 1985 Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: 4th Congress of FEPACI, referred to as the re-foundation of FEPACI.

* 1993 Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: 5th Congress of FEPACI and the longest that made filmmakers miss viewing films during the FESPACO Film Festival.
 
* 1997 Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: 6th Congress of FEPACI. Filmmakers requested a more relevant constitution that reflects the state of production of African cinema and where producers live as some had moved to the Diaspora, so they could not be expected to affiliate to National Associations in the continent.
 
* 2001 Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: 7th Congress, the new constitution of FEPACI is adopted.'''
 
* 2006 Tshwane, Republic of South Africa: 8th Congress of FEPACI. Congress was held after the first African Film Summit. The Summit delegates unanimously endorsed FEPACI as the sole representative body of the interest of African filmmakers in Africa and in the Diaspora at a continental level and recommended that: secretariat is separated from the Head Office and should be accommodated wherever it is possible every four years in order to facilitate both the activities and needs of its members.  It was moved to South Africa, where it was hosted through the support of the South African government. The Head Office remains in Burkina Faso.
•	The Constitution/ statutes of FEPACI were to be reviewed and amended. 
•	FEPACI be strengthened in terms of its capacity and means to deliver on its mandate in a transparent and accountable manner
•	FEPACI to facilitate unity among African filmmakers
 
* 2013 Sandton, Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa: 9th Congress of FEPACI &lt;!--more to come on this...--&gt;

The Congress of FEPACI always takes a very critical introspective outlook at the state of the organisation vis-a-vis the state of the industry throughout the continent, hence the theme "Film Making in the 21st century, a contribution to a sustainable economy", a theme that reflects where audiovisual industries as we know them now have developed from.

2019 will mark the 50th centenary of the existence of FEPACI.

Accessed 31 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[pejorative]] [[colloquialism]] applied to individuals who are attempting to pass themselves off as [[shaman]]s, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent.&lt;ref name=Reed&gt;Sheets, Brian, "[http://law.lclark.edu/live/files/14090-lcb172art8sheetspdf Papers or Plastic: The Difficulty in Protecting Native Spiritual Identity]", ''[[Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review]]'', 17:2, p.596.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the "plastic shaman" may have some genuine cultural connection, but is seen to be exploiting that knowledge for ego, power, or money.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;G. Hobson, "The Rise of the White Shaman as a New Version of Cultural Imperialism." in: Hobson, Gary, ed. ''The Remembered Earth''. Albuquerque, NM: Red Earth Press; 1978: 100-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chidester1"&gt;Chidester, David, ''Authentic Fakes: Religion and American Popular Culture''. University of California Press; 2005; p.173: "Defenders of the integrity of indigenous religion have derided New Age shamans, as well as their indigenous collaborators, as 'plastic shaman' or 'plastic medicine men.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic shamans are believed by their critics to use the mystique of these cultural traditions, and the legitimate curiosity of sincere seekers, for their personal gain. In some cases, exploitation of students and traditional culture may involve the selling of fake "traditional" spiritual ceremonies, fake artifacts, fictional accounts in books, illegitimate tours of sacred sites, and often the chance to buy spiritual titles.&lt;ref name="Hobson" /&gt; Often [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] symbols and terms are adopted by plastic shamans, and their adherents are insufficiently familiar with [[Native American religion]] to distinguish between imitations and actual Native religion.&lt;ref name=hagan/&gt;

== Overview ==
The term "plastic shaman" originated among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] activists and is most often applied to people fraudulently posing as Native American traditional healers.&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Lisa, "Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' issn.24.3 (2000) pp.329-352. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieg1"&gt;Sieg, Katrin, ''Ethnic Drag: Performing Race, Nation, Sexuality in West Germany'';  University of Michigan Press (Aug 20, 2002) p.232&lt;/ref&gt; People who have been referred to as "plastic shamans" include those believed to be fraudulent, self-proclaimed spiritual advisors, seers, psychics, self-identified [[New Age]] shamans, or other practitioners of non-traditional modalities of spirituality and healing who are operating on a [[fraudulent]] basis.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; "Plastic shaman" has also been used to refer to non-Natives who pose as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] authors, especially if the writer is misrepresenting Indigenous spiritual ways (such as in the case of [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[Asa Earl Carter]] and the scandal around his book ''[[The Education of Little Tree]]'').&lt;ref name=hagan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis1"&gt;Francis, Daniel, ''The Imaginary Indian: The Image of the Indian in Canadian Culture''; Arsenal Pulp Press (July 1, 2002); pp.109-110: "A particularly bizarre example of the 'plastic shaman' phenomenon occurred as recently as 1991, much to the embarrassment of ''The New York Times'', which for several weeks listed as the top of its nonfiction bestseller list a book called ''The Education of Little Tree''. Supposedly the autobiography of a young Indian orphan... But it soon turned out that Forrest Carter, author of ''Little Tree'' (along with several western novels, including one that became the movie ''The Outlaw Josey Wales''), was not an Indian at all: the autobiography was fiction. And there was more: Forrest Carter... had in real life been a man named Asa Earl Carter, a Ku Klux Klan thug and virulent racist."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in ''Akwesasne Notes'', along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.&lt;ref name="Sieg1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of plastic shamans&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt; believe there is legitimate danger to seekers who place their trust in such individuals. Those who participate in ceremonies led by the untrained may be exposing themselves to various psychological, spiritual and even physical risks. The methods used by a fraudulent teacher may have been invented outright or recklessly adapted from a variety of other cultures and taught without reference to a real tradition. In almost all "plastic shaman" cases a fraud is employing these partial or fraudulent "healing" or "spiritual" methods without a traditional community of legitimate elders to provide checks and balances on their behaviour. In the absence of the precautions such traditional communities normally have in place in regard to sacred ceremonies, and without traditional guidelines for ethical behavior, abuse can flourish.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

People have been injured, and some have [[Sweat lodge#Risks|died]], in fraudulent [[sweat lodge]] ceremonies performed by non-Natives.&lt;ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death"&gt;{{cite news|first=RW|last=Byard|work=Forensic Science SA|title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16121078&amp;dopt=Abstract|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taliman2"&gt;{{citation | first = Valerie |last = Taliman | title = Selling the sacred | publisher = Indian Country Today | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Bob |last = Goulais | title = Editorial: Dying to experience native ceremonies | newspaper = North Bay Nugget | date = 2009-10-24 | url =http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hocker, Lindsay.

Among critics, this [[Cultural appropriation|misappropriation]] and misrepresentation of [[Indigenous intellectual property]] is seen as an exploitative form of [[colonialism]] and one step in the destruction of Indigenous cultures:&lt;ref name="Wernitznig2"&gt;Wernitznig, Dagmar,  ''Europe's Indians, Indians in Europe: European Perceptions and Appropriations of Native American Cultures from Pocahontas to the Present''. University Press of America, 2007: p.132. "What happens further in the Plastic Shaman's [fictitious] story is highly irritating from a perspective of cultural hegemony. The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones. The messianic element, which Plastic Shamanism financially draws on, is installed in the Yoda-like elder themselves. They are the ones - while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot - who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones. Licensed by the authority of an Indian elder, they now have every right to spread their wisdom, and if they make (quite more than) a buck with it, then so be it.--The neocolonial ideology attached to this scenario leaves less room for cynicism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The para-esoteric Indianess of Plastic Shamanism creates a neocolonial miniature with multilayered implications. First and foremost, it is suggested that the passé Injun elder is incapable of forwarding their knowledge to the rest of the white world. Their former white trainee, once thoroughly briefed in Indian spirituality, represents the truly erudite expert to pass on wisdom. This rationale, once again, reinforces nature-culture dualisms. The Indian stays the doomed barbaric pet, the Indianized is the eloquent and sophisticated medium to the outer, white world. Silenced and visually annhilated like that, the Indian retreats to prehistory, while the Plastic Shaman can monopolize their culture.&lt;ref name="Wernitznig3"&gt;Wernitznig, 2007: p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Defenders of the integrity of indigenous religion use the term "plastic shaman" to criticize those they believe are potentially dangerous and who may harm the reputations of the cultures and communities they claim to represent.&lt;ref name="Chidester1"/&gt; There is evidence that, in the most extreme cases, fraudulent and sometimes criminal acts have been committed by a number of these imposters.&lt;ref name="RayLATimes1"&gt;Such as [[James Arthur Ray]], convicted of three counts of negligent homicide.{{cite news|title=Self-help guru convicted in Arizona sweat lodge deaths|first=Nicholas |last=Riccardi|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 22, 2011|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-sweat-lodge-trial-20110623,0,7374542.story?track=rss}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTCagle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man claiming to be Northern Cheyenne "Shaman" convicted on eight felony counts|first=James |last=May |work=Indian Country Today Media Network|date=18 Feb 2002 |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2002/02/18/man-claiming-be-northern-cheyenne-shaman-convicted-eight-felony-counts-87509}}: "A letter from the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Council obtained by Indian Country Today and signed by three tribal council members, said that Cagle is in no way associated with the tribe...The letter further stated that the Northern Cheyenne do not use the term "shaman" when referring to their religious leaders"&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed by traditional peoples that in some cases these plastic shamans may be using corrupt, negative and sometimes harmful aspects of authentic practices. In many cases this has led to the actual traditional spiritual elders declaring the plastic shaman and their work to be "dark" or "evil" from the perspective of traditional standards of acceptable conduct.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

Plastic shamans are also believed to be dangerous because they give people false ideas about traditional spirituality and ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt; In some cases, the plastic shamans will require that the ceremonies are performed in the nude, and that men and women participate in the ceremony together, although such practices are an innovation and were not traditionally followed.&lt;ref name="LakotaJournal2003"&gt;"[http://www.linkcenterfoundation.org/wambliho/LakotaJournal_Apr_7_2003.html Sacred Ceremonies Must Be Protected]," ''Indian Country Today / Lakota Journal'', April 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Another innovation may include the introduction of sex magic or "[[Tantra|tantric]]" elements, which may be a legitimate form of spirituality in its own right (when used in its original cultural context), but in this context it is an importation from a different tradition and is not part of authentic Native practices.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

The results of this appropriation of Indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, intertribal councils, and the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to issue several declarations on the subject: 

{{quote| 4. We especially urge all our [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Dakota people|Dakota]], and [[Assiniboine|Nakota]] people to take action to prevent our own people from contributing to and enabling the abuse of our sacred ceremonies and spiritual practices by outsiders; for, as we all know, there are certain ones among our own people who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole.

5.

Many of those who work to expose plastic shamans believe that the abuses perpetuated by spiritual frauds can only exist when there is ignorance about the cultures a fraudulent practitioner claims to represent. Activists working to uphold the rights of traditional cultures work not only to expose the fraudulent distortion and exploitation of [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] traditions and Indigenous communities, but also to educate seekers about the differences between traditional cultures and the often-distorted modern approaches to spirituality.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieg1"/&gt;

One indicator of a plastic shaman might be someone who discusses "Native American spirituality" but does not mention any specific [[federally recognized tribes|Native American tribe]]. The "New Age Frauds and Plastic Shamans" website discusses potentially plastic shamans.&lt;ref&gt;Lupa 37&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The word "[[Shamanism|shaman]]" originates from the [[Evenki language|Evenki]] word "''šamán''".&lt;ref name="Eliade1"&gt;[[Mircea Eliade|Eliade, Mircea]]; ''Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy.'' 1964; reprint, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-691-11942-2}}. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The term came into usage among Europeans via Russians interacting with the Indigenous peoples in Siberia. From there, "[[shamanism]]" was picked up by anthropologists to describe any cultural practice that involves vision-seeking and communication with the spirits, no matter how diverse the cultures included in this generalisation. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] spiritual people use terms in their own languages to describe their traditions; their spiritual teachers, leaders or elders are not called "shamans".&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICTCagle"/&gt; However, with [[Michael Harner]]'s invention and promotion of "[[core shamanism]]" in the 1980s, the term "shaman" began to be misapplied to Native American ways by cultural outsiders; this is due to Harner's unfounded claim that the ways of several North American tribes share core elements with those of the Siberian Shamans.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harner1"&gt;Harner, Michael ''The Way of the Shaman.'' 1980, new edition, HarperSanFrancisco, 1990, {{ISBN|0-06-250373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This misappellation led to many non-Natives assuming Harner's inventions were traditional Indigenous ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Geary Hobson sees the [[New Age]] use of the term [[shamanism]] as a [[cultural appropriation]] of Native American culture by "white" people who have distanced themselves from their own history.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt;

In Nepal, the term ''Chicken Shaman'' is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Polyball-Haupthalle.jpg|thumb|right|The ETH main hall during the Polyball (2005)]]
The '''Polyball''' is the most prestigious public event of the [[ETH Zurich]]. It has a long tradition since the 1880s and takes place annually at the end of November. The Polyball is the biggest decorated [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] in Europe with approximately 9’000 visitors and is a classic dance event.

== History ==
The exact year and the location of the first Polyball - then known as ''Akademie'' - is unknown. A general assumption is that the first ball took place in 1880. In 1929 the name changed from Akademie to Polyball. Since the 1940s each Polyball has its one theme with respective decorations of the ballrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Westermann,[http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/besichtigungen/orte/polyball/ "Der Polyball"], ''History Department of the ETH Zurich'', May 25th 2005. Retrieved 2018-01-21. ([[German language|German]])&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its beginning in the Stadttheater Zürich (municipal theatre, now [[Zürich Opera House]]) the location has changed several times, such as Tonhalle Zürich, [[Dolder Grand|Grand Hotel Dolder]], Zürcher Messegelände (Zürich fair areal) as well as the ETH main building where it takes place today.

== The ball ==
The Polyball takes place within the main building of the ETH including the multifunctional hall. It starts at 19:00 on the last Saturday in November and ends at 05:00 on Sunday morning. The ball comprises 16 to 20 ballrooms decorated according to the ball theme. A variety of bands, from street performer to ballroom orchestra, entertain the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Organisation ==
The Polyball is organized by the KOSTA foundation. It is an officially approved organisation of the [[VSETH]] and the University of Zurich (UZH) student societies. Students and former students of ETH, UZH and other colleges form the functional body of KOSTA. The planning and preparation of the ball takes place throughout the year. The decorations are created within 4 weeks in November by numerous students who in return earn their tickets for the Polyball. The decoration includes the interior as well as the exterior of the ETH main building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1008">'''Presidents' Day''' is a holiday in [[Botswana]]. Since 2006, it has been a one-day holiday held on the third Monday of July.&lt;ref&gt;http://aglobalworld.com/holidays-around-the-world/botswana-presidents-day/&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous to that, it was a two-day holiday, held on Monday and Tuesday of the 3rd week in July, but the Public Holidays Amendment of 2006&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/1766/Public%20Holidays%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; modified the holiday to a single day.  Nevertheless, many public and private institutions such as the [[Botswana Stock Exchange]] still typically observe a two-day holiday at this time of year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bse.co.bw/holidays.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slab city''' is a somewhat derogatory term for an area which surrounded a [[sawmill]] in [[American frontier]] times. De-limbed timber was placed in the mill. The timber was cut from its somewhat rounded shape to a four-sided piece of lumber, which would be further sawed into lumber of useful sizes. The original pieces that were cut, along with the bark, was called "slabs" and discarded nearby until a use was found for them. Eventually, the slab piles became the most visible part of the area. Other specialists would construct businesses in the area, such as a [[blacksmith]], a [[general store]], a [[post office]], and a [[wheelwright]]. Sometimes a village or town would form around the place and the sobriquet "slab city" was replaced by a place name.&lt;ref name=jr&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyTUUvwICYQC&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=vermont+slab+city+nine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UY7KJQIIjn&amp;sig=_EfYGB7DIOYSNf5YgU3N4OjtcxA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju7Y3C8YfYAhUKSyYKHXqrApEQ6AEIVjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=vermont%20slab%20city%20nine&amp;f=false |title=Diary of a Country Clergyman 1848-1851 |author1=James Reid |publisher=McGill-Queen University Press | accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vermont]] had nine such slab cities.&lt;ref name=jr/&gt; [[Massachusetts]] had at least one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shirleyhistory.org/mills.htm|title=mills|first=Shirley Historical|last=Society|website=www.shirleyhistory.org|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term persisted in the [[Western United States]] to 2017 as a name for an area considered unaesthetic by some observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/slab-city-california|title=Slab City|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Terminator Genisys''''' is a 2015 American [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]] and written by [[Laeta Kalogridis]] and [[Patrick Lussier]]. The fifth installment in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]], it serves as a [[Reboot (fiction)|soft reboot]] of the series, using the plot element of [[time travel]] to erase the events of the previous films from the series' continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/terminator-genisys-sequel/|title=Abandoned 'Terminator Genisys' Sequel Plot Focused on Cyborg John Connor|date=2018-04-06|work=/Film|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who reprises his role as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], alongside [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]], [[Emilia Clarke]], [[Jai Courtney]], [[J. K. Simmons]], [[Dayo Okeniyi]], [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]], [[Courtney B. Vance]], and [[Lee Byung-hun]]. It follows soldier [[Kyle Reese]], a soldier in the war against [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], who is sent from 2029 to 1984 by [[John Connor]], leader of the Human Resistance, to protect his mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]]. When Kyle arrives in the past, he discovers that [[Alternate history|the timeline has been altered]] and Sarah has been raised by a reprogrammed Terminator.

[[Megan Ellison]] and her production company [[Annapurna Pictures]] acquired the franchise rights in May 2011. The following year, production of another installment in the series was set up in collaboration with [[Skydance Media|Skydance Productions]], owned by Ellison's brother [[David Ellison|David]]. The Ellisons consulted ''Terminator'' creator [[James Cameron]] in the hope of returning to the spirit of ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and its sequel ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991). Principal photography was primarily in [[New Orleans]], with some in the on-screen setting of [[San Francisco]]. Six companies handled the film's [[visual effects]], with its prosthetic make-up and animatronics created by [[Legacy Effects]].

The film was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on July 1, 2015, in [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. It &lt;!-- Per talk page discussion, do not insert "negative reviews" here. --&gt;was not well-received by critics&lt;!-- Discuss on talk page before changing. --&gt;, who found its story and performances unsatisfactory, although Schwarzenegger's return to the franchise was praised. ''Terminator Genisys'' grossed over $440 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of the franchise and of Schwarzenegger's career, behind ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dangers-financiers-think-they-can-827843&lt;/ref&gt; Originally planned as the first film of a new trilogy, it was announced in 2017 that the film franchise would be [[Terminator 6|rebooted]] once again following the return of creative control to Cameron.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. The plot summary does ''not'' intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY detail. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events. --&gt;
Human Resistance leader [[John Connor]] launches a final offensive against [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], an [[artificial general intelligence]] system in 2029. Before the Resistance can triumph, Skynet activates a [[Time travel|time machine]] and sends a [[Terminator (character)|T-800 (Model 101) Terminator]] back to May 12, 1984, to kill John's mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]]. John's right-hand man, [[Kyle Reese]], volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. As Kyle floats in the machine's magnetic field, he sees John being attacked by another Resistance soldier and has visions from his childhood about Sarah Connor.

When it arrives in [[Los Angeles]] 1984, Skynet's T-800 is disabled by Sarah and "Pops", a reprogrammed T-800 sent to protect Sarah when she was nine years old. Kyle arrives shortly afterwards, and is intercepted by a [[T-1000]]. Sarah and Pops join Kyle and destroy the T-1000 with acid; she and Pops reveal that they have constructed a makeshift time machine similar to Skynet's, and Sarah plans to travel to 1997 (the year Skynet becomes self-aware). Realizing that the timeline has been altered, Kyle is convinced that the future has changed because of the warning he received in his childhood vision and persuades Sarah to travel to 2017 to stop Skynet.

In 2017, Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of a busy [[San Francisco]] highway and are apprehended by [[San Francisco Police Department|city police]]. While they are treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn that Skynet is called "Genisys" (a soon-to-be-unveiled global [[operating system]] which is embraced by the public). John suddenly appears and rescues Sarah and Kyle; Pops arrives and unexpectedly shoots John, revealing that John is an advanced [[T-3000]] Terminator. While Kyle was traveling back in time a [[T-5000]], the physical embodiment of Skynet disguised as a member of the Resistance, attacked John and transformed him into a [[Nanotechnology|nanocyte]] infiltrator. John, tasked with ensuring [[Skynet (Terminator)#Before Judgment Day|Cyberdyne Systems']] survival, traveled back in time to assist them with the development of Genisys and hence securing Skynet and its machines' rise.

A day before Skynet's worldwide attack, Sarah, Kyle and Pops escape to a [[safe house]] and make final preparations to destroy Cyberdyne's Genisys mainframe. They head toward Cyberdyne's headquarters with the T-3000 in close pursuit. During an airborne chase, Pops dive-bombs into the T-3000's helicopter and causes it to crash. The T-3000 survives the crash and enters the Cyberdyne complex, where it advances the countdown from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah and Pops plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off the T-3000.

In a final battle, Pops traps the T-3000 in the magnetic field of a prototypical time machine. Both are destroyed, but just before the explosion the remains of Pops are [[Centrifugal force|flung out]] of the apparatus into a nearby experimental vat of [[Terminator (character concept)#Liquid metal nanorobotics|mimetic polyalloy]]. Kyle and Sarah reach a bunker beneath the facility and the explosion sets off the bombs, preventing Genisys from coming online. Pops appears, upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components similar to that of the T-1000, and helps them escape from the debris.

The trio travels to Kyle's childhood home, where Kyle tells his younger self about Genisys and instructs him to repeat the warning to himself, securing the trio's arrival from 1984. Sarah and Kyle finally kiss and they along with Pops drive off into the countryside. A [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] reveals that the system core of Genisys, located in a protected subterranean chamber, has survived the explosion.

Although ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' was intended to begin a new [[trilogy]], the production of a fifth film was put on hold because of legal issues with franchise owner [[the Halcyon Company]] (which filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy in August 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/08/terminator-producers-file-for-bankrupcty-creditors-include-schwarzenegger-christian-bale-mcg.html |title='Terminator' producers file for bankruptcy [updated&amp;#93; |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Fritz |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/18/business/fi-ct-terminator18 |title='Terminator Salvation' producers sue hedge fund Pacificor |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/terminator-producers-sue-fraud_5258 |title='Terminator' Producers Sue for Fraud |publisher=TheWrap |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid bankruptcy, Halcyon later decided to sell the rights to the franchise and valued the property at $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/09/terminator-rights-may-change-hands-again.html |title='Terminator' rights may change hands again |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/news/halcyon-puts-terminator-on-block-1118010756/ |title=Halcyon puts ‘Terminator’ on block |work=Variety |date=November 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 22, 2014 |first=Dave |last=McNary}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 2010, the franchise was auctioned for $29.5 million to Pacificor, a hedge fund which was the largest creditor in Halcyon's bankruptcy proceedings.&lt;ref name="Halcyon-Pacificor auction"&gt;{{cite web|author=NIKKI FINKE, Editor in Chief |url=http://www.deadline.com/hollywood/terminator-rights-sell-for-29-5-mil |title='TERMINATOR' RIGHTS SELL FOR $29.5 MIL |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halcyon bankruptcy-Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/11/us-terminator-auction-idUSTRE6194G520100211|title=U.S. judge OKs "Terminator" sale to hedge fund|last=Dobuzinskis|first=Alex|date=February 10, 2010|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal erased Halcyon's debts to Pacificor and guaranteed Halcyon $5 million for each additional Terminator sequel produced, to pay other outstanding debts.&lt;ref name="Halcyon-Pacificor auction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Halcyon bankruptcy-LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/10/business/la-fi-ct-terminator11-2010feb11|title=Hedge fund Pacificor wins rights to 'Terminator' franchise|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=February 10, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificor sold the franchise again in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/27/us-terminator-idUSTRE64Q58I20100527 | title=Pacificor hires agency to sell "Terminator" rights| date= May 27, 2010 |agency=[[Reuters]] | accessdate= February 15, 2014 | archivedate= February 15, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140215205833/https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/27/us-terminator-idUSTRE64Q58I20100527 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August of that year, [[Hannover House]] announced plans to develop a 3D animated film titled ''Terminator 3000''.&lt;ref name="Terminator3000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/terminator-rights-holder-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-kill-proposed-3d-animated-feature/ |title='Terminator' Rights Holder Sends Cease And Desist Letter To Kill Proposed 3D Animated Feature |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificor responded with a [[cease and desist]] letter, declining a $20–30&amp;nbsp;million offer from Hannover for the rights to produce the film.&lt;ref name="Terminator3000" /&gt; In February 2011, [[Universal Studios]] considered investing in a fifth ''Terminator'' film with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to the title role, ''[[Fast &amp; Furious (2009 film)|Fast &amp; Furious]]'' director [[Justin Lin]] at the helm and [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] as the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/02/16/arnold-schwarzenegger-terminator |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger Back For 'Terminator 5' With 'Fast Five' Director Justin Lin? |publisher=MTV |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April 2011, a proposed ''Terminator'' package, dropping Morgan and adding producer [[Robert W.

It was eventually picked up by [[Megan Ellison]] and her production company, [[Annapurna Pictures]], in May 2011 after they purchased at auction the rights to make at least two more ''Terminator'' films (including ''Terminator 5'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Will|last=Chadwick |url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/terminator-5-rights-fall-megan-ellison/ |title=Terminator 5 Rights Fall To Megan Ellison |publisher=Wegotthiscovered.com |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was finalized on December 4, 2012; the final price was reportedly less than the auction pledge because new copyright laws had raised concerns that the rights would revert to ''Terminator'' creator [[James Cameron]] in 2019.

After acquiring the rights to the franchise, Megan Ellison asked Cameron for input on the new film. Cameron met several times with David Ellison, where they discussed Schwarzenegger's role and how to remain true to the T-800 character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/james-cameron-terminator-genesis-spider-man/#d0lLDvM7FiScxZpx.99 |title=James Cameron Talks TERMINATOR: GENESIS and SPIDER-MAN |publisher=Collider.com |date=June 1, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2014, Schwarzenegger posted a picture on his [[Twitter]] account of himself in a production chair on set.

==={{anchor|Writing}}Screenplay===
[[Laeta Kalogridis]] and [[Patrick Lussier]] were invited to write the script while they worked on another project with David Ellison and Dana Goldberg. They agreed to write a ''Terminator'' film when Cameron, a friend of Kalogridis who worked with her in ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', gave it his blessing. The starting point of the script was to retain Schwarzenegger as a central character, unlike the ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot with [[Leonard Nimoy]] as an older [[Spock]] in a minor role. They had to write in the actor (now 67 years old), and followed a suggestion by Cameron that the Terminator's living-tissue exterior was vulnerable to [[aging]] and their idea of Skynet sending a Terminator after an infant Sarah Connor. Kalogridis and Lussier extended this to the core characters of Kyle, Sarah, and John Connor, despite each being from a different time period. Although the writers reportedly enjoyed ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', they opted to escape its suggestion that Judgment Day is inevitable because of a [[causal loop]] in favor of all ''Terminator'' timelines existing simultaneously in a [[multiverse]]. To map out the timelines and plot, Kalogridis and Lussier had five [[whiteboard]]s "covering every wall in the office". They eventually reached a central plot thread in which the Skynet of one universe, defeated in several timelines, sent the T-5000 to the ''Genisys'' timeline hoping to defeat the humans by "having the best weapon that humans have": John Connor. The first draft of the screenplay, to attract a director, was delivered in July 2013.&lt;ref name="Screenwriters hired" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/873983-exclusive-terminator-genisys-screenwriters-reveal-big-secret#S69fldlY16wsSpau.99|title=Interview: 'Terminator Genisys' Screenwriters Reveal a Secret|work=CraveOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=den&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/terminator-genisys/247414/terminator-genisys-writers-we-have-unanswered-questions|title=Terminator Genisys Writers: ‘We Have Unanswered Questions’|work=Den of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production tried to match the cinematography of the first two ''Terminator'' films. Scenes set in 1984 favored blue, green, and black tones to match the look of ''[[The Terminator]]'', and those set during the future war against the machines were modeled after similar scenes in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/terminator-genisys-will-match-colour-tone-first-two-movies-report-1414114 |title=‘Terminator: Genisys’ Will Match The Colour And Tone Of The First Two Movies—Report |work= International Business Times |date= January 25, 2015|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
[[File:Terminator T-3000.jpg|thumb|T-3000]]
Visual-effects supervisor Janek Sirrs oversaw approximately 1,200 visual-effects shots generated at [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, One of Us and [[Method Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinefex.com/next_issue.htm|title=Next Issue :: Cinefex|author=Gregg Shay|work=Cinefex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; Double Negative was the lead company, with 900 shots which included the T-1000, T-5000, and T-3000 Terminators, the helicopter and bus-chase scenes and the Cyberdyne explosion. The complexity of the T-3000, which had to be shown as a living mass of [[Nanorobotics|nanomites]] with the ability to transform in successive layers, required as much as 20 hours to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] a single frame. The mechanical cells aimed to resemble the material on [[stealth aircraft]], with a result described as "more [[Gloss and matte paint|matte]] than metal" and resembling a slightly-[[Iridescence|iridescent]] [[ceramic matrix composite|ceramic carbon]]. Since the T-3000 was a man transformed into a robot, the design aimed for a human shape streamlined for better combat efficiency. The T-1000 was built from [[fluid simulation]]s, their environments filmed with high-resolution cameras to ensure proper reflection. Its acid destruction was realistically depicted after studies of acids burning aluminum ingots and other metal. Double Negative's artists shot many reference plates of San Francisco, including scans of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], to ensure that the city was recreated properly in the bus and helicopter chases.&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/terminator-new-makes-new-models-new-vfx/|title=Terminator: New makes.

MPC's most elaborate effect was the digital recreation of the original Terminator, which required 12 months for 35 shots (completed 30 minutes before the final print was submitted to the studio). [[Performance capture]] was used only for facial animation, since Schwarzenegger was scanned reading his lines. The studio's artists studied archive footage of the actor, focusing mainly on ''The Terminator'' and ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', and were given a 1984 [[plaster cast]] of him. On set, the fight between both Terminators had Schwarzenegger and Brett Azar (a bodybuilder chosen for his resemblance to the actor in 1984) and, in more dangerous scenes, Azar and a stunt double—requiring effects artists to replace the face of Pops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/terminator-genisys-a-cg-schwarzenegger-806508|title='Terminator: Genisys:' A CG Schwarzenegger Is the Latest in Hollywood's Work Toward Digital Humans|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/01/terminator-genisys-building-young-arnold|title=Terminator Genisys: Re-creating 1984 Arnold Schwarzenegger for the summer's coolest fight scene - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPC also handled the future battle, with set extensions and Skynet robots and vehicles based on models by [[Legacy Effects]]. Industrial Light &amp; Magic did the opening scene in which San Francisco is wiped out on Judgement Day, inspired by the Los Angeles nuclear destruction in ''Terminator 2'', and the Terminator vision.&lt;ref name=fxguide/&gt; For the IMAX 3D release, the film was remastered with [[IMAX DMR]] technology to create 3D effects and a high-resolution film print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terminator Genisys to be Released in IMAX Globally Starting July 1|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/411443-terminator-genisys-to-be-released-in-imax-globally-starting-july-1|date=Feb 19, 2015|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]]|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' enjoyed the film: "''Genisys'' goes back to what made the franchise work in the first place: not the machine inside the man, but vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/review-terminator-genisys-mixes-visceral-thrills-with-logic-holes/2015/06/30/b5dc6040-1f35-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55_story.html|title=Review: ‘Terminator Genisys’ mixes visceral thrills with logic holes|author=Michael O'Sullivan|date=June 30, 2015|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Lawson of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' also gave a positive review, writing that the film "makes a surprisingly compelling case" for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawson |first=Richard |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/terminator-genisys-review |title=Terminator Genisys Review |work=Vanity Fair |date=January 2, 2014 |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Hughes of ''[[Forbes]]'' called many of the negative reviews a result of "cynical nostalgia" which "distrusts change and anticipates failure", calling the review-aggregator ratings "ridiculously and undeservedly low".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2015/07/03/review-terminator-genisys-is-true-heir-to-camerons-films/ |title=Review: 'Terminator: Genisys' Is True Heir To Cameron's Films |work=Forbes |date=March 7, 2015 |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |first=Mark |last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing a pre-release screening of the film, Cameron voiced his support for ''Terminator Genisys''. Describing it as respectful to the first two films, Cameron said he felt like "the franchise has been reinvigorated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Lee|title=Director James Cameron voices support for Terminator Genisys|url=https://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2015/06/director-james-cameron-voices-support-for-terminator-genisys/|website=Condé Nast|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2017, James Cameron said that he had supported ''Terminator Genisys'' only because of his friendship with Schwarzenegger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/james-cameron-plans-to-produce-three-new-terminator-films/5120302.article|title=James Cameron plans to produce three new 'Terminator' films|last=Parfitt|first=Orlando|work=Screen Daily|date=July 26, 2017|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilia Clarke expressed relief to discover there wouldn't be any sequels following the film's poor box office performance. In reference to the film's director Alan Taylor, with whom she had worked on ''Game of Thrones'', Clarke said, "He was eaten and chewed up on ''Terminator''. He was not the director I remembered. He didn’t have a good time. No one had a good time."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/emilia-clarke-cover-story

'''Third Party Non-violent Intervention''' (sometimes called '''TPNI''') refers to the practice of intervening from the outside in violent conflicts with the aim of reducing violence and allowing "space" for [[conflict resolution]]. Two common forms of intervention are as an intermediary in a negotiating capacity or, physically, by interposing one's body between two factions.

TPNI work is sometimes categorized into four main areas:
# Interpositioning
# Observation and Documentation
# Protective Accompaniment
# Modeling [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behavior in a conflict situation

Examples of groups that espouse this practice are [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]], [[International Solidarity Movement]], [[Muslim Peacemaker Teams]], [[Meta Peace Team]],  [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]].

{{for|the architectural movement|Traditionalist School (architecture)}}

The '''Traditionalist School''' is a group of 20th- and 21st-century thinkers concerned with what they consider to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The principal thinkers in this tradition are [[René Guénon]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]]. Other important thinkers in this tradition include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Jean Borella]], and [[Julius Evola]]. A central belief of this school is the existence of a perennial wisdom, or [[perennial philosophy]], which says that there are primordial and universal truths which form the source for, and are shared by all the major world religions.

==Ideas==
According to the Traditionalists, there are primordial and universal religious truths which are at the foundations of all major world religions. The Traditionalists speak of "absolute Truth and infinite Presence".{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Absolute Truth is "the perennial wisdom (''sophia perennis'') that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} According to Traditionalists, "the primordial and perennial truth" is manifested in a variety of religious and spiritual traditions.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} Infinite Presence is "the perennial religion (''religio perennis'') that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|The term ''philosophia perennis'', which has been current since the time of the Renaissance and of which neo-scholasticism made much use, signifies the totality of the primordial and universal truths — and therefore of the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] axioms — whose formulation does not belong to any particular system. One could speak in the same sense of a religio perennis, designating by this term the essence of every religion; this means the essence of every form of worship, every form of prayer, and every system of morality, just as the sophia perennis is the essence of all dogmas and all expressions of wisdom.{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010}}}} 

Although the Traditionalist school is often said to be a "perennial philosophy", its members prefer the term ''sophia perennis'' ("perennial wisdom").{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|We prefer the term sophia to that of philosophia, for the simple reason that the second term is less direct and because it evokes in addition associations of ideas with a completely profane and all too often aberrant system of thought.{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010}}}}

The Traditionalist vision of a perennial wisdom is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions.{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}}{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010|p=vii}} It is "intuited directly through divine intellect."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} This divine intellect is different from reason, and makes it possible to discern "the sacred unity of reality that is attested in all authentic esoteric expressions of tradition";{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} it is "the presence of divinity within each human waiting to be uncovered."{{sfn|Taylor|2008|p=1270}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|The key to the eternal sophia is pure intellection or in other words metaphysical discernment. To "discern" is to "separate": to separate the Real and the illusory, the Absolute and the contingent, the Necessary and the possible, Atma and Maya. Accompanying discernment, by way of complement and operatively, is concentration, which unites: this means becoming fully aware — from the starting point of earthly and human Maya — of Atma, which is both absolute and infinite.{{sfn|Oldmeadow|2010}}}}

Traditionalists discern a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or Absolute, c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional "mystical concentration on the Real".{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xiii}} 

According to the Traditionalists, this truth has been lost in the modern world through the rise of novel secular philosophies stemming from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J Schwindt, [https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Modern-World-Traditionalist/dp/153282534X/ The Case Against the Modern World: A Crash Course in Traditionalist Thought], 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and modernity itself is considered as an "anomaly in the history of mankind."{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} Traditionalists see their approach as a justifiable "nostalgia for the past".{{sfn|Schuon|1982|p=8}}{{refn|group=note|Guénon rejected the term, because "it implies in his view a kind of sentimental attachment to a tradition which, most of the time, has lost its metaphysical foundation.&lt;ref group=web name="fabbriintro"&gt;[http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Fabbri/Perennialism.pdf An Introduction to the Perennialist School].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="SaintAidan"&gt;[http://www.saintaidan.ca/2011/04/problem-with-isms.html Saint Aidan Orthodox Church, ''The Problem with "isms"'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Frithjof Schuon,
{{quote|... "traditionalism"; like "esoterism" [...] has nothing pejorative about it in itself [...] If to recognize what is true and just is "nostalgia for the past," it is quite clearly a crime or a disgrace not to feel this nostalgia.{{sfn|Schuon|1982|p=8}}}}

Traditionalists insist on the necessity for affiliation to one of the "normal traditions", or great ancient religions of the world.{{refn|group=note|See Titus Burckhardt, "A Letter on Spiritual Method" in ''Mirror of the Intellect'', Cambridge (UK), Quinta Essentia, 1987 ({{ISBN|0-946621-08-X}}), where a rather strict list is given.}} The regular affiliation to the ordinary life of a believer is crucial, since this could give access to the [[Western esotericism|esoterism]] of that given religious form.{{sfn|Guénon|2001|p=48}}

==People==
The ideas of the Traditionalist School are considered to begin with [[René Guénon]]. Other people considered Traditionalists include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Jean Borella]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Dragoš Kalajić]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Frithjof Schuon]] and [[Julius Evola]].{{refn|group=note|Renaud Fabbri argues that Evola should not be considered a member of the Perennialist School. See the section ''Julius Evola and the Perennialist School'' in Fabbri's [http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Fabbri/Perennialism.pdf Introduction to the Perennialist School].}}

===René Guénon===
A major theme in the works of René Guénon (1886-1951) is the contrast between traditional world views and modernity, "which he considered to be an anomaly in the history of mankind."{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} For Guénon, the physical world was a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} For Guénon, "the malaise of the modern world lies in its relentless denial of the metaphysical realm."{{sfn|Kalin|2015}}{{refn|group=note|According to Wouter Hanegraaf, "modernity itself is in fact intertwined with the history of esotericism."{{sfn|Sedgwick|2004|p=13}} Western esotericism had a profound influence on Hindu and Buddhist modernisers, whose modernisations in turn had a deep impact on modern western [[spirituality]]. See:&lt;br/&gt;*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Michelis|first=Elizabeth De|title=A History of Modern Yoga: Patanjali and Western Esotericism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HTUAwAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-8772-8}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharf|first1=Robert|title=Buddhist Modernism and the Rhetoric of Meditative Experience|journal=NUMEN|date=1 January 1995|volume=42|url=http://buddhiststudies.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/sharf/documents/Sharf1995,%20Buddhist%20Modernism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =De Michelis | first =Elizabeth | year =2005 | title =A History of Modern Yoga | publisher =Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=McMahan|first=David L.|title=The Making of Buddhist Modernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU6HNwlxhCAC|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early on, Guénon was attracted to [[Sufism]], which he saw as a more accessible path of spiritual knowledge. In 1912 Guénon was initiated in the [[Shadhili]] order. He started writing after his doctoral dissertation was rejected, and he left academia in 1923.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} His works center on the return to these traditional world views,{{sfn|Kalin|2015}} trying to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy.&lt;ref group=web name="OUP-D-ATMW" /&gt;

In his first books and essays he envisaged a restoration of traditional "''intellectualité''" in the West on the basis of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Freemasonry]].{{refn|group=note|Cf. among others his ''Aperçus sur l'ésotérisme chrétien'' (Éditions Traditionnelles, Paris, 1954) and ''Études sur la Franc-maçonnerie et le Compagnonnage'' (2 vols, Éditions Traditionnelles, Paris, 1964-65) which include many of his articles for the Catholic journal ''Regnabit''.}} He gave up early on a purely Christian basis for a traditionalist restoration of the West, searching for other traditions. He denounced the lure of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-occultism in the form of [[Spiritism]],{{refn|group=note|Cf. his ''Le Théosophisme, histoire d'une pseudo-religion'', Paris, Nouvelle Librairie Nationale, 1921, and ''L'Erreur spirite'', Paris, Marcel Rivière, 1923. Both books exist in English translation.}} two influential movements that were flourishing in his lifetime.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 1930 he moved to Egypt, where he lived until his death in 1951.{{sfn|Kalin|2015}}

==Influence==
Traditionalism had a discrete impact in the field of [[comparative religion]],&lt;ref group=web name="OUP-D-ATMW"&gt;[https://global.oup.com/academic/product/against-the-modern-world-9780195396010?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp;# Oxford University Press, ''Description: "Against the Modern World. Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century"'']&lt;/ref&gt; particularly on the young [[Mircea Eliade]], although he was not himself a member of this school. Contemporary scholars such as [[Huston Smith]], [[William Chittick]], [[Harry Oldmeadow]], [[James Cutsinger]] and Hossein Nasr have advocated Perennialism as an alternative to secularist approach to religious phenomena.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Through the close affiliation with Sufism, the traditionalist perspective has been gaining ground in Asia and the Islamic world at large.{{refn|group=note|Witness the works by Mahmoud Bina at the Isfahan University of Technology, the Malay scholar Osman Bakar, and the Ceylonese Ranjit Fernando. This is probably also related to the expansion of the [[Shadhili#Maryamiyya|Maryamiyya]] branch of the [[Shadhili|Shadhili Sufi order]], as studied by Sedgwick, ''Against the Modern World'', always within the pale of [[Sunni Islam]]. Cf. also a review by [[Carl W. Ernst]]: [http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/Traditionalism.htm "Traditionalism, the Perennial Philosophy, and Islamic Studies]," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin'', vol. 28, no. 2 (December 1994), pp. 176-81.}}

==Association with far right movements==
The Traditionalist School has been associated with some far right movements. Critics of Traditionalism cite its popularity among the European ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' ("New Right"),{{sfn|Davies|Lynch|2004|p=322}} while [[Julius Evola]]'s ideas were used by [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascists]] during the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]. [[Mark Sedgwick]]'s ''Against the Modern World'', published in 2004, gives an analysis of the Traditionalist School and its influence.
{{quote|A number of disenchanted intellectuals responded to Guénon's call with attempts to put theory into practice. Some attempted without success to guide Fascism and Nazism along Traditionalist lines; others later participated in political terror in Italy. Traditionalism finally provided the ideological cement for the alliance of anti-democratic forces in post-Soviet Russia, and at the end of the Twentieth Century began to enter the debate in the Islamic world about the desirable relationship between Islam and modernity.&lt;ref group=web name="OUP-D-ATMW" /&gt;}}

In his book ''Guénon ou le renversement des clartés'', the French scholar [[Xavier Accart]] questions the connection sometimes made between the Traditionalist School and [[far-right politics]]. According to Accart, René Guenon was highly critical of Evola's political involvements and was worried about the possible confusion between his own ideas and Evola's.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Accart finally claims that the assimilation of Guénon with Evola and the confusion between Traditionalism and the [[New Right]] can be traced back to [[Louis Pauwels]] and Bergier's ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' (1960).{{sfn|Accart|2005}}

[[Alain de Benoist]], the founder of the Nouvelle Droite declared in 2013 that the influence of Guénon on his political school was very weak and that he does not consider him as a major author.{{refn|group=note|On [[Radio Courtoisie]] (20 May 2013), during the programme ''Le Libre Journal de la resistance française'' presented by Emmanuel Ratier and Pascal Lassalle.}}

'''The Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies''' (UAJS) is a non-profit academic and professional non-governmental organization that brings together Ukrainian scholars and students who work in the field of  [[Jewish studies]]. The UAJS was established in 2015. 

The mission of the UAJS is to coordinate efforts of the scholars resident in Ukraine and abroad, aimed at the development of research on history, languages, art and other aspects of Jewish life in Ukraine and worldwide. There are two membership categories, Full membership and Student membership. The UAJS’ Articles of Association allows membership for foreign academicians &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/3|title=Membership - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Current UAJS President is [[Vitaly Chernoivanenko]], PhD, Associate Professor in the History Department at the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] (NaUKMA), the Vice President is [[Oleksiy Khamray]], Dr. hab. in Philology, Director of the Near and Middle East Department at the [[Ahatanhel Krymskyi Institute of Oriental Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. Secretary of the UAJS is [[Serhiy Hirik]], PhD in History, Senior Research Fellow at the [[State Research Institution "Encyclopedia Press"]].

Practical activity of the UAJS includes the organization of the academic conferences, roundtables, workshops, public talks, and mini courses on Jewish Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/5|title=Projects - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The UAJS publishes an annual academic journal [[Judaica Ukrainica]], established in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua/content/volumes|title=Volumes - Judaica Ukrainica|website=judaicaukrainica.ukma.edu.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The UAJS also is a publisher of “Library of ''Judaica Ukrainica'' journal”.

The Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies co-administers the MA in Jewish Studies Program at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy (founded in 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/8|title=Master in Jewish Studies Program at NaUKMA - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hromadskeradio.org/programs/zustrichi/shcho-take-yudayika-abo-yak-vidkryti-universytety-poyednuyut-istoriyu-movy-ta-religiyu|title=Що таке юдаїка, або Як «відкриті університети» поєднують історію, мови та релігію?|date=21 January 2018|website=Громадське радіо}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The organization cooperates with a number of academic and educational institutions and non-governmental organizations from Ukraine and abroad: [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], [[Ukrainian Catholic University]], Institute of Jewish Studies of the [[Jagiellonian University]], [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[Université de Montréal]], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], [[Ukrainian Jewish Encounter]] Initiative, [[Nadav Foundation]], [[:uk:Асоціація єврейських громадських організацій та общин України|Vaad of Ukraine]], [[European Association for Jewish Studies]], [[:he:האיגוד העולמי למדעי היהדות|World Union of Jewish Studies]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/6|title=Partners - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with its partner institutions the UAJS acts as a co-organizer of academic events in educational and research institutions of Ukraine.

In 2015–2016 academic year, in partnership with the [[Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy]] (Canada–USA), the UAJS organized at the NaUKMA the series of public lectures and discussions "Contemporary Antisemitism in Ukraine and Worldwide" by well known researchers, public figures and journalist from Ukraine and abroad: [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]], [[Yosyf Zisels]], [[Vakhtang Kipiani]], [[Taras Voznyak]], [[Vitaly Portnikov]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isgap.org/seminar-series/national-university-ukraine/|title=National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy » ISGAP|website=isgap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies and the NaUKMA’s Master Program in Jewish Studies with the support of the [[European Association for Jewish Studies]] organized the International conference “Ukrainian Jews: Revolution and Post-Revolutionary Modernization. Policy, Culture, and Society”, dedicated to the destiny of Ukrainian Jews during 1917–1920s. The event brought together the scholars from Ukraine,  Austria, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the UK, the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaadua.org/news/uayu-i-naukma-proveli-mizhnarodnu-konferenciyu-ievreyi-ukrayini-revolyuciya-y|title=УАЮ і НаУКМА провели Міжнародну конференцію «Євреї України: Революція й післяреволюційна модернізація»|date=23 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uajs.org.ua/en/node/131|title=UAJS and NaUKMA organized the International conference “Ukrainian Jews: Revolution and Post-Revolutionary Modernization” - Ukrainian Association for Jewish Studies|website=uajs.org.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odessareview.com/vitaly-chernoivanenko-jewish-studies-ukraine/|title=Vitaly Chernoivanenko On Jewish Studies In Ukraine.

In October 2018 the UAJS has organized the international conference "Modern Israel: From State in Construction to State Facing Challenges" on occasion of the 70th anniversary of the State of Israel. The researchers from Canada, the USA, Germany, Israel, Poland, Sweden, the UK, and Ukraine participated in this event. The topics of the history of Israel and Zionism, relations between Israel and another countries, Israeli society and culture etc. were discussed during the conference. The event was supported by the Nadav Foundation, the European Association of Israel Studies and the Masoret Kiev community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hadashot.kiev.ua/content/pervaya-v-ukraine-nauchnaya-konferenciya-ob-izraile-proshla-v-kieve/|title=Юрий Корогодский.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">'''Unconditional convergence''' is a topological property (convergence) related to an algebraic object (sum). It is an extension of the notion of [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] for series of countably many elements to series of arbitrarily many. It has been mostly studied in [[Banach space]]s. 

A series of numbers is unconditionally convergent if under all reorderings of the numbers, their sum converges to the same value as under the given ordering—their sum is not conditional on the particular arrangement. In contrast, a series is [[conditional convergence|conditionally convergent]] if it converges but different orderings do not all converge to that same value.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological vector space]]. Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be an [[index set]] and &lt;math&gt;x_i \in X&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

The series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{i \in I} x_i&lt;/math&gt; is called '''unconditionally convergent''' to  &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if
* the indexing set &lt;math&gt;I_0 :=\{i\in I: x_i\ne 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[countable]] and
* for every [[permutation]] of &lt;math&gt;I_0 :=\{i\in I: x_i\ne 0\}&lt;/math&gt; the relation holds:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i = x&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative definition==
Unconditional convergence is often defined in an equivalent way: A series is unconditionally convergent if for every sequence &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon_n)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_n\in\{-1, +1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \varepsilon_n x_n&lt;/math&gt;

converges.

If ''X'' is a Banach space, every [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] series is unconditionally convergent, but the [[converse (logic)|converse]] implication does not hold in general. Indeed, if ''X'' is an infinite dimensional Banach space, then by [[absolute convergence#Rearrangements and unconditional convergence|Dvoretzky&amp;ndash;Rogers theorem]] there always exists an unconditionally convergent series in this space that is not absolutely convergent. However, when ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then, by the [[Riemann series theorem]], the series &lt;math&gt;\sum x_n&lt;/math&gt; is unconditionally convergent if and only if it is absolutely convergent.

The '''World Heritage Committee''' is a committee which selects the sites to be listed as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]s, including the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger, monitors the state of conservation of the World Heritage properties, defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties. It is composed of 21 [[Sovereign state|states parties]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the UNESCO World Heritage [[website]], [http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ States Parties] are countries that signed and ratified [http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention]. As of March 2013, there were a total of 190 State Parties.&lt;/ref&gt; that are elected by the '''General Assembly of States Parties''' for a four-year term.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/
|title=The World Heritage Committee
|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site
|accessdate=2006-10-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the World Heritage Convention, a committee member's term of office is six years, however many State's Parties choose to voluntarily limit their term to four years, in order to give other States Parties an opportunity to serve.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;  All members elected at the 15th General Assembly (2005) voluntarily chose to reduce their term of office from six to four years.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

==Sessions==
{{see also|List of World Heritage sites by year of inscription}}
The World Heritage Committee meets once a year to discuss the management of existing World Heritage sites, and accept nominations by countries.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

A '''Zero Waste Event''' (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as [[paper cup]]s, food scraps, and plastic [[water bottle]]s that are generated by the event.  ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/conference/ |title=Future of Business Conference- Sustainable Strategies for 2013 — Sustainable Connections |publisher=Sconnect.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/tzw/TZW08_insert_v4.pdf/ |format=PDF |title=Think Local - Buy Local : Be waste Free |publisher=Sconnect.org|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabletransforum.ca/presentations.html] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/jill-donello-zero-in-on-zero-waste/ |title=Jill Donello – Zero In on Zero Waste &amp;#124; |publisher=Theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of [[Zero waste|Zero Waste]] Events is spreading.  Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations. Increasingly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322144442/http://zerowasteevents.org/protocol/ Zero Waste Events] are sharing best practices and developing new ways to divert event materials from landfills.

==Strategy==
ZeeWee's utilize many if not all of the following strategies.

'''Front-end waste prevention'''
* Eliminating race packets in favor of emailed sponsor coupons for participants;
* Eliminating commercial [[bottled water]] distribution in favor of bulk water stations and compostable cups;
* Purchasing recycled content products, from event [[t-shirt]]s to paper products; and
* Providing discounted entries or incentives for participants who travel to the event using alternative transportation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153628/http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp |date=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse of event equipment'''
* Reusable, weatherproof banners and stands;
* Adaptable date panels on banners and signs so they can be reused year after year; and
* Use of durable dishware "lending libraries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925211512/http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of always buying disposables.

'''Recycling event materials'''
* Many items from unsoiled paper, cardboard, glass, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, aluminum cans and plastic tarps to corrugated polypropylene signs can be recycled depending on the services available in a given municipality or county.  In many cases, such services are less costly than disposal of the same items;
* Having a dedicated Recycling Team onsite throughout the event to supervise recycling stations and sort materials to maximize landfill diversion and minimize contamination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dunn |url=http://runningmagazine.ca/sections/news/vancouver-half-recycles-95-of-waste/ |title=Vancouver half-marathon produces only four bags of garbage - Canadian Running Magazine |publisher=Runningmagazine.ca |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Where programs require subsidy, ZeeWee organizers may use a "green fee" to help move the event toward sustainability by paying for [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]], buying recycled products, or more recently purchasing carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norkarecreation.com/hcrewards.htm |title=Bellingham/Whatcom County Washington |publisher=NorKarecreation.com |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Olympics==
When the bid was submitted for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], [[LOCOG]], The London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, pledged not just to host the biggest sporting event in the world but also to stage the first truly sustainable Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13160540 |title=London 2012 Olympics team publishes first green report - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this was an ambitious target to send zero waste from Games-time venues directly to landfill &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/locog-publications/london-2012-sustainability-plan.pdf |title=Official Reports, Studies, Publications &amp;#124; Downloads &amp;#124; Olympic.org |publisher=London2012.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – something that no Games has attempted before. 
In February 2012 an initiative was launched to share the lessons learnt from delivering a zero waste games with the wider waste and events community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerowasteevents.org/front/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327035411/http://zerowasteevents.org/front/ |date=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
