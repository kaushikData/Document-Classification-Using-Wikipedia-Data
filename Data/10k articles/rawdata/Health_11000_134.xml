The '''[[influenza A virus subtype H1N1]]''' (initially known as '''''[[swine]] [[influenza]] virus''''' or as '''''new flu''''') arrived in [[Argentina]] in late April 2009, through air traffic contact with [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas, especially [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]].

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the Argentine health authorities expressed their concern from the beginning of the outbreak, that the imminent arrival of the southern winter could cause "more serious" effects in the southern hemisphere than those caused in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/04/30/um/m-01909057.htm | title = Gripe porcina: el Gobierno advierte que el invierno agravará la situación | date = April 30, 2009 | author=Clarín|language=Spanish| accessdate= 19 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/1218316/05/09/OMS-pide-seguir-atentos-a-gripe-porcina-y-alerta-de-llegada-a-hemisferio-sur.html | title = OMS pide seguir atentos a gripe porcina y alerta de llegada a hemisferio sur | date = May 5, 2009 | author=El Economista|language=Spanish| accessdate= 19 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could lead to a rebound of the epidemic around the world. The [[flu]] or ''influenza'' is mainly a seasonal disease that becomes most prevalent in winter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1551913 "Weather and the Flu Season"], ''NPR Day to Day'', December 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first infection was confirmed on May 7 in a man who had come from [[Mexico City]] and had entered the country without symptoms on April 24. The second case was detected on May 22. Towards the end of May infection started in some schools in the northern community of the [[City of Buenos Aires]] and its suburbs, the main part of the country affected by the epidemic.

On June 15 the first death was announced: a three-month-old baby in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/15/um/m-01939573.htm |title=Un beba de tres meses es la primera víctima fatal de Gripe A en la Argentina | date = June 15, 2009 |language=Spanish| accessdate= 19 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of June, coinciding with the onset of winter, the virus was widely transmitted in Buenos Aires and spread to other parts of the country, especially the [[Province of Santa Fe]], with its center in the [[city of Rosario]].

On June 29, the Government decided to close schools throughout the month of July, a measure which affected 11 million students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The peak of infection lasted from the end of June until the beginning of July, increasing normal hospital demand fivefold and causing the collapse of the systems organizing hospital wards, home doctors and work place doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was estimated that up to 10% of the population of that region (approximately 1,200,000 people) could be affected by the pandemic of influenza A.&lt;ref name="Máxima alerta sanitaria"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1142814|title= Máxima alerta sanitaria: Hay 335 pacientes hospitalizados.

In Argentina, seasonal flu outbreaks kill about 4,000 people each year, equivalent to a rate of 10 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/07/04/sociedad/s-01952450.htm|title= Cristina cruzó a Manzur por hablar de 100.000 infectados|accessdate=4 July 2009 |date= 4 July 2009|work= Clarín|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contingency plan developed in 2006 to face a possible influenza pandemic estimated that the dead could reach 13,000 in the event of a moderate rate of infection (15%) and 30,000 in the event of a serious infection rate (35%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.msal.gov.ar/archivos/plan-contingencia-2009.pdf| title = Plan de Contingencia Integrada para Pandemia de Influenza y SARS| year = 2009| author = Poder Ejecutivo Nacional| work = Ministerio de Salud| language = Spanish| accessdate = 19 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620001321/http://www.msal.gov.ar/archivos/plan-contingencia-2009.pdf| archive-date = June 20, 2009| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===April===
'''April 26:'''
The Ministry of Health issued an Epidemic Alert order asking airlines to report passengers with influenza symptoms arriving from Mexico and United States. The government also stepped up safety checks, and thermal scanners were used in airports to detect passengers running fevers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Heguy, Silvina| title= La Argentina ya controla a los pasajeros que llegan a Ezeiza|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/04/26/elmundo/i-01906060.htm |work=''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''|date= April 26, 2009|accessdate=April 28, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''April 28:'''
The Argentine government suspended all flights originating in Mexico until May 15 as a precautionary measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Por la gripe porcina, el Gobierno suspende los vuelos con México|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/04/28/um/m-01907438.htm |work=''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''|date= April 27, 2009|accessdate=April 28, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first flight coming from Mexico arrived at [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza International Airport]] on May 20.

===May===
'''May 1:'''
The Argentine government sent charter flights to Mexico to pick up all Argentine tourists abroad who wished to return.

'''May 7:'''
The first case of Influenza A (H1N1) was confirmed in the country, a tourist who had recently returned from Mexico. This man was from [[Puerto Madryn]], [[Chubut Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Argentina confirms first H1N1 flu case|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-SwineFlu/idUSTRE5468RC20090507 |agency=Reuters  |date= May 7, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511163433/https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-SwineFlu/idUSTRE5468RC20090507| archivedate=May 11, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''May 22:'''
Health Authorities confirmed the second case, a woman who had arrived from the United States about 20 days before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2nd case confirmed – Swine flu |url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/argentina/note.jsp?idContent=602211 |work=Buenos Aires Herald |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 22, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611001823/http://www.buenosairesherald.com/argentina/note.jsp?idContent=602211 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===June===

'''June 25:'''
A case of human-to-swine transmission was discovered in Buenos Aires province. The [[Intensive pig farming|hog farm]] where it occurred was interdicted. This was the second known case of reverse-zoonosis in the world.&lt;ref&gt;MercoPress, [http://en.mercopress.com/2009/06/26/human-to-swine-ah1n1-virus-contagion-in-argentine-hog-farm "Human-To-Swine A/H1N1 Virus Contagion In Argentine Hog Farm"], June 26, 2009, (accessed June 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''June 28:'''
Due to the ongoing legislative elections and the possible resignation of the Health Minister, [[Graciela Ocaña]], reports of confirmed cases and deaths were suspended.

'''June 29:'''
Argentina's Health Minister, Graciela Ocaña, announced her resignation due to some political instability in the country and stated that the current government did not support her on some projects and plans she recommended for the betterment of the country. The Provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] (after confirming the first two deaths), [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] (with 5 confirmed cases and more than 30 suspected cases) and [[Santiago del Estero]] (which on the same day confirmed 12 cases of swine flu) each decided to suspend all classes of elementary, primary and secondary schools, and recommended that the universities adopt the same procedure.

'''June 30:'''
The government of the [[Autonomous City of Buenos Aires]] alongside the government of the Buenos Aires province, decreed a ''Health Emergency'', though public services continued their operations. Winter holidays for students had started two weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/30/um/m-01949718.htm |title=Gripe A: la Ciudad declaró la emergencia sanitaria, pero no suspende actividades públicas |date=June 30, 2009 |work=Clarin |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jeJLQevd?url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/30/um/m-01949718.htm |archivedate=September 9, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July===
'''July 2:'''
The newly appointed Health Minister [[Juan Luis Manzur]] estimated the number of affected people to be as high as 100,000, as well as 44 confirmed deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ya hay en el país 100.000 contagiados por la gripe A |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1146304&amp;pid=6796181&amp;toi=6256 |work='''[[La Nación]]''' |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=July 2, 2009 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jeGLfSiD?url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1146304&amp;pid=6796181&amp;toi=6256 |archivedate=September 9, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''July 14:'''
The number of officially recognised cases skyrocketed, with 137 deaths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= La Argentina es el segundo país en cantidad de muertos por gripe A|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1150437&amp;pid=6880178&amp;toi=6256 |work=[[La Nación]]|date= July 14, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the death toll in Argentina the second highest in the world, only behind the United States and surpassing confirmed cases in Mexico.

'''July 28:'''
Impact on health services diminished significantly according to various specialists, though the death toll continued to increase, partly because of the delay in confirming previous fatalities. There had been no official report by the national Health Ministry since July 14.

'''July 30:'''
Official reports of confirmed deaths from the provinces put the death toll around 260, while ''Critica'' newspaper&lt;ref name="yabkowski"&gt;{{cite news|title=Critica Digital |url=http://www.criticadigital.com.ar/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=27178 |date=July 30, 2009 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jeJM5Tue?url=http://www.criticadigital.com.ar/index.php?secc=nota&amp;nid=27178 |archivedate=September 9, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published an interview with Jorge Yabkowski, president of the Sindical Federation of Health Professionals of Argentina (Fesprosa), giving an estimate death toll from H1N1 flu of above 400 (while USA was at 340), based on the false death count in Buenos Aires, where many patients may have "entered the hospitals almost dead and were not tested for H1N1".

===August===
'''August 3:'''
The students returned to schools in all except 3 provinces, while awaiting a possible second wave. The estimated cumulative number of H1N1 cases was more than 400,000 Argentinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title Unknown |url=http://www.el-litoral.com.ar/leer_noticia.asp?IdNoticia=115370 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jeJNXXfr?url=http://www.el-litoral.com.ar/leer_noticia.asp?IdNoticia=115370 |archivedate=September 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12113">'''''String Quartet: An AIDS Activist's Memoir in Music''''', commonly abbreviated to '''''AIDS Memoir Quartet''''', is a [[musical composition]] by [[composer]] [[Lyle Chan]] which premiered in 2014. The work has been exclusively performed by the [[Acacia Quartet]].

The work chronicles Chan's 6 years as an [[HIV/AIDS]] activist at the height of the [[epidemic]] in [[Australia]], including importing experimental medications from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Sydney]]. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia

==About==
The 90-minute work was sketched in the during the years 1991-1996, but only completed some 20 years later. It contains reflections of historic events, portraits of famous activist friends now dead, and unusual effects like the use of police whistles to recall street demonstrations by [[ACT UP]], the direct action protest group of which Lyle Chan was a core member. In those crisis years, he and fellow activists couriered AIDS treatments from the US that were unavailable in Australia, fiercely lobbied federal government to approve experimental treatments more quickly, and collaborated with drug companies to design clinical trials of promising new treatments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/content/2014/07/18/4028156.htm|title=ABC Classic FM - Evenings - String Quartet: An AIDS Activist's Memoir|website=ABC Classic FM|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/music/composer-lyle-chans-musical-reflections-on-an-epidemic/news-story/bdc6a9c38e3541300469c0d797214e2b|title=Composer Lyle Chan's musical reflections on an epidemic|last=Westwood|first=Matthew|date=4 September 2014|website=theaustralian.comau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Melbourne Recital Centre]], one of the first presenters of the work, states, "This work tells the story of how activists transformed a stigmatized, fatal disease. Like the autobiographical [[quartets]] of [[Steve Reich]] or [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], Lyle Chan's [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] memoir is in turn harrowing and touching but ultimately an intensely uplifting story of a community that fought against all odds for their lives and won."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.melbournerecital.com.au/events/2014/acacia-quartet/|title=Acacia Quartet - Melbourne Recital Centre|website=Melbourne Recital Centre|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Activism is an attempt to reach some kind of normality", he reflected in a 2014 interview, "that you feel is being denied for some reason. Once it became clear, between 1994 and 1996, that we were no longer fighting against a constant backdrop of death, it became possible to imagine a future where every day was not a state of emergency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afao.org.au/library/hiv-australia/volume-12/vol.-12-number-2/a-time-to-be-loud-and-furious-aids-activism-in-australia#.WM0VQhJ95E4|title=A TIME TO BE LOUD AND FURIOUS: AIDS ACTIVISM IN AUSTRALIA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked about the message of the work, he replied, "I don't have an overt 'message', aside from the message that we all should bring beauty into the world, in our deeds and in our relationships. Sometimes, there are obstacles to be overcome in order to do that. For two decades, AIDS was one such obstacle to beauty and love."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cutcommonmag.com/how-can-we-use-music-to-achieve-social-change/|title=How can we use music to achieve social change?|date=2017-03-25|work=CutCommon|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical complete performance lasts 2 hours, without interval. In performance, Lyle Chan speaks onstage between sections of the music – a narrative entirely from memory, telling vivid stories about the events and people of this era.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/aids-activists-musical-memoir-a-triumph-20140725-zwpm2.html|title=AIDS activist's musical memoir a triumph|last=Carnegie|first=Joel|date=2014-07-25|work=The Age|access-date=2017-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Structure ==
The work is made up of 17 sections played continuously, lasting approximately 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/content/aids-activists-memoir-music-lyle-chan|title=An AIDS Activist's Memoir in Music (Lyle Chan)|website=www.limelightmagazine.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In performances where the composer narrates between sets of music, the entire show lasts 2 hours without any breaks.

== Notable performances ==
Organised by the presenter Music By The Sea, the world premiere performance of the entire work took place on 5 July 2014 at the [[Sandgate Town Hall]] in [[Brisbane|Brisbane, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Event/388672,music-by-the-sea-presents-the-world-premier-performance-of-string-quartet-an-aids-activist-s-memoir-in-music-by-lyle-chan.aspx|title=Music By The Sea Presents the World Premier Performance of 'String Quartet - An AIDS Activist's Memoir in Music' by Lyle Chan|website=www.limelightmagazine.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sydney premiere occurred on 18 July of the same year, organised by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] as a live broadcast concert from its Eugene Goossens Hall in Ultimo. Preceding the performance, ABC Classic FM's presenter Julian Day interviewed the composer on air amid breaking news that [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Malaysian Airlines flight MH17]] had been shot down over the Ukraine while carrying passengers destined for the [[XX International AIDS Conference, 2014|20th International AIDS Conference]] that was to be held in Melbourne only a few days later. The performance was dedicated to those killed on Flight MH17 and their loved ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the time of the broadcast, a large number of international media reports claimed that over 100 of the passengers were conference delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2014/07/23/100-aids-researchers-on-mh17-why-and-how-the-media-got-it-wrong/|title=100 AIDS researchers on MH17? Why and how the media got it wrong|date=2014-07-23|website=Crikey|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently confirmed that the true number of conference delegates on the flight was 6, but it included the scientist Dr [[Joep Lange]], known for his pioneering research on combination therapy to treat HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-crash-joep-lange-among-up-to-100-aids-researchers-and-activists-on-board-flight-9613821.html|title=Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash: Was the cure for Aids lost along|date=2014-07-18|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne Recital Centre organised a complete performance in conjunction with the 20th International AIDS Conference on 23 July 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The North American premiere took place on 22 June 2016 in Vancouver, Canada, at the invitation of Pride In Art Society for its annual [[Queer Arts Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://queerartsfestival.com/event/lyle-chan-string-quartet-aids-activists-memoir/|title=Lyle Chan's String Quartet: An AIDS Activist's Memoir - Queer Arts Festival|work=Queer Arts Festival|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other notable performances'''

Along with ''Dextran Man, Part 1'', the 14-minute section ''Don't Leave Me This Way'' was performed at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]'s exhibition ''When This You See Remember Me'', a retrospective of the work of artist [[David McDiarmid]]. This section relates to the underground drug trials that Chan helped organise and in particular tells the story of how the experimental lipid amphotericin was obtained to treat McDiarmid's [[lymphoma]]. Chan was one of McDiarmid's medical carers in the year leading to the artist's death from AIDS-related complications in May 1995. The performance was preceded by a 40-minute conversation between the composer and Justice [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liveguide.com.au/Events/995022/Artists/Hon_Michael_Kirby_and_Lyle_Chan|title=Hon Michael Kirby and Lyle Chan @ Ian Potter Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several excerpts were performed by Acacia Quartet on the Global Village stage of the [[XX International AIDS Conference, 2014|2014 International AIDS conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afao.org.au/library/topic/annual-report/AFAO_AR-1314_HIGH-RES.pdf|title=AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION OF AIDS ORGANISATIONS, ANNUAL REPORT 2013–2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The Quartet has met with widespread critical and audience acclaim.

In its review, The Age described the work as "triumphantly articulating a story of humanity amid the gloom of disaster … sometimes words can fail to adequately describe what one witnesses."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Limelight Magazine called it "A crushingly powerful work of musical history … A towering piece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/review-blackwattle-trio-bellingen-music-festival|title=Review: Blackwattle Trio (Bellingen Music Festival)|website=www.limelightmagazine.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBS newscaster [[Anton Enus]] wrote in his personal Twitter account: "Impressive, admirable, so very moving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/AntonEnus/status/490127762166796288|title=Anton Enus on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned American composer [[John Corigliano]] said, "Lyle Chan's string quartet is a very ambitious work born out of a seemingly endless plague. Its composer has taken his experiences of living through the enormous tragedy of AIDS and from them has molded a serious and deeply felt work of art."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The work was the subject of a half-page feature article in The Australian.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In December 2015, [[LA Weekly]] contacted Lyle Chan to obtain permission to quote the ''AIDS Memoir Quartet''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s program notes about Jim Corti (the real identity of 'Dextran Man' referred to in the music), stating "Chan's post is a fascinating chronicle of what people were willing to do to be of service to a cause, including manufacturing caplets of ddC ("the most illegal thing Jim had ever done") when the FDA refused to approve it and the [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] companies refused to expand [[clinical trial|clinical]] trials. In a second post, Chan recalls when the supply of ddC was interrupted by the '92 L.A. riots — Corti, who was white, lived in South Central."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-la-man-behind-an-actual-west-coast-buyers-club-6369812|title=The L.A.

[[File:Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé (logo).svg|thumb|right|Logo of the Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé]]
The '''Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé''' ('''French Agency for the Safety of Health Products'''), often abbreviated AFSSAPS or AFSSaPS, was a [[French government]] institution whose main mission was to assess health risks posed by health products intended for human consumption, particularly [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. It was responsible for issuing permits for marketing approval and became the single authority in the regulation of biomedical research.

The agency was latest headed by [[Dominique Maraninchi]] and had about 1,000 employees plus 2,000 experts. Its budget amounts to approximately 157 million euros, with the bulk of revenue came from taxes and charges levied on the activity of the pharmaceutical industry.

The Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM), superseded the tasks and duties of the AFSSAPS on 1 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ansm.sante.fr/L-ANSM2/Une-agence-d-expertise/L-ANSM-agence-d-evaluation-d-expertise-et-de-decision/(offset)/0 |title=L'ANSM, agence d'évaluation, d'expertise et de décision - ANSM : Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé |language=fr |publisher=Ansm.sante.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities''' (ALSAC) is the fundraising and awareness organization for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. Its sole mission is to raise the funds and awareness necessary to operate and maintain St. Jude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Careers at ALSAC/St. Jude|url = http://www.stjude.org/careersalsac|website = www.stjude.org|access-date = 2016-02-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
ALSAC is the largest healthcare related [[charitable organization|charity]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle of Philanthropy, Philanthropy 400 -- https://www.philanthropy.com/interactives/philanthropy-400#id=details_cop40&lt;/ref&gt; The National Executive Office is located in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. ALSAC also has over 30 local fundraising offices located in cities throughout the United States that hold over 30,000 fundraising events annually.

==Purpose and activities==
As of 2017, [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] requires more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day, and public contributions provide more than 75 percent of the funds necessary to operate the hospital. Only 14% of the money to operate the hospital comes from insurance recoveries and 9% comes from grants.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.stjude.org/content/dam/en_US/shared/www/about-st-jude/financial-information/fy16-combined-audited-financial-statements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To cover these costs, ALSAC has been raising more than $1 billion annually for the hospital through its more than 30,000 fund-raising activities.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.stjude.org/content/dam/en_US/shared/www/about-st-jude/financial-information/fy16-combined-audited-financial-statements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[FedEx St. Jude Classic]], which is a [[PGA Tour]] event and one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, [[Up 'til Dawn]], direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing. 

St. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to "Give Thanks" wristbands. 

One of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway. The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued up to $500,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the [[United States]]. 

In November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural [[Thanks and Giving]] campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, featured content on the TODAY show, interactive marketing on AOL and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide. Corporations such as [[Best Buy]], [[Domino's Pizza]], the [[Williams-Sonoma]] family of brands, [[Carnival]], [[Kay Jewelers]], [[K-Mart]], [[7-Eleven]], Inc., [[American Airlines]], American Kiosk Management, [[AutoZone]], [[Toys “R” Us]], [[Brooks Brothers]], [[Delta Airlines]], Casual Male XL, Claire’s, Expedia, Mazda, TUMI, Dollar General, Lancome, [[GNC (store)|GNC]], Ann Taylor, [[Home Shopping Network]], HomeGoods, [[Marshalls]], The Melting Pot, PayPal, New York &amp; Company, Rochester, Chili’s Grill &amp; Bar, Christopher &amp; Banks, eBay, Charlotte Russe, [[West Elm]], [[Westfield Shoppingtowns]], and Hammermill give customers a host of opportunities to support St. Jude.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/other-ways/st-jude-thanks-and-giving/shop-and-support-st-jude.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude]] has been named one of two International Philanthropic Projects of [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]] International, a women's service sorority. Since 1972, ESA has raised more than $200 million for St. Jude.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.epsilonsigmaalpha.org/service-projects/st-jude-children-s-research-hospital&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund usage==
From 2013 to 2016, 81 cents of every dollar received has supported the research and treatment at St. Jude. In FY2016, 72% of ALSAC and St. Jude expenses were allocated to program services (33.3% patient care, 30.8% research, 7.5% education and training).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stjude.org/content/dam/en_US/shared/www/about-st-jude/financial-information/fy16-combined-audited-financial-statements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The above statement conflates ALSAC and St. Jude, however. More precisely, as a separate entity, ALSAC's FY2016 IRS Form 990 for FYE 6/30/2016 shows that of the $1.156 billion of Fundraising Revenue (that is, not including investment returns from the nearly $4.0 billion "Fund" that ALSAC has accumulated), only $807 million was granted to the St. Jude Hospital. This represents only 69.8% of Fundraising Revenue to St. Jude for FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016). Total ALSAC Revenue for FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016) was $1.260 billion; this includes Fundraising Revenue of $1.156 billion, Investment Returns of $104 million, and Other Revenue of $26 million. Using ALSAC Total Revenue of $1.260 billion, St. Jude Hospital received 64% of ALSAC Revenue in FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016).

'''Argus retinal prosthesis''', also known as a '''bionic eye''', is an electronic [[retinal implant]] manufactured by the [[United States|American]] company Second Sight Medical Products. It is used as a [[visual prosthesis]] to improve the vision of people with severe cases of [[retinitis pigmentosa]]. The Argus II version of the system was approved for marketing in the [[European Union]] in March 2011, and it received approval in the US in February 2013 under a [[humanitarian device exemption]].  The Argus II system costs about US$150,000, excluding the cost of the implantation surgery and training to learn to use the device.

==Medical use==
The Argus II is specifically designed to treat people with [[retinitis pigmentosa]].&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuang|first1=AT|last2=Margo|first2=CE|last3=Greenberg|first3=PB|title=Retinal implants: a systematic review|journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=July 2014|volume=98|issue=7|pages=852–6|pmid=24403565|doi=10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-303708}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was approved with data from a single-arm [[clinical trial]] that enrolled thirty people with severe retinitis pigmentosa; the longest follow-up on a trial subject was 38.3 months.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt; People in the trial received the implant in only one eye and tests were conducted with the device switched on, or switched off as a control.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt; With the device switched on, about 23% of the subjects had improvements in their [[visual acuity|ability to see]]; all had been at 2.9 or higher on the [[LogMAR chart|LogMAR scale]] and improvements ranged from just under 2.9 to 1.6 LogMAR – the equivalent of 20/1262 reading ability.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|18}} 96% of the subjects were better able to identify a white square on a black computer screen; 57% were more able to determine the direction in which a white bar moved across a black computer screen. With the device switched on, about 60% were able to accurately walk to a door that was 20 feet away, as opposed to only 5% with the device switched off; 93% had no change in their perception of light.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|18}}

==Side effects==
Among the thirty subjects in the clinical trial, there were nine serious adverse events recorded, including lower than normal [[intraocular pressure]], erosion of the [[conjunctiva]], [[wound dehiscence|reopening of the surgical wound]], [[endophthalmitis|inflammation inside the eye]], and [[retinal detachments]].&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|19}}  There is also a risk of bacterial infection from the implanted cables that connect the implant to the signal processor.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;

==Surgical procedure==
The implantation procedure takes several hours, with the person receiving the implant under [[general anaesthesia]]. The surgeon [[Vitrectomy|removes the vitreous humor]] and any membranes on the retina where the implant will be placed. The implant is attached to the surface of the retina with a tack. The cables connecting the implant to the processor are run through the [[pars plana]], a region near where the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[sclera]] touch.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev&gt;[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg519/evidence/insertion-of-an-epiretinal-prosthesis-for-retinitis-pigmentosa-overview2 "IPG519: Interventional procedure overview of insertion of an epiretinal prosthesis for retinitis pigmentosa"]. [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] Interventional Procedures Programme. Updated December 2014. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Device==
The Argus implant's primary external element is a [[digital camera]] mounted on eyeglass frames, which obtains images of the user's surroundings; signals from the camera are transmitted wirelessly to a computerised image processor. The processor is in turn connected by cables to the implant itself, which is surgically implanted on the surface of the person's retina and tacked into place. The implant consists of 60 [[electrode]]s, each 200 [[micron]]s in diameter.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/15/fda-clears-argus-ii-bionic-eye-for-sale-in-the-us-video/|title=FDA clears Argus II 'bionic eye' for sale in the US (video)|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The implant's manufacturer, Second Sight Medical Products, was founded in [[Sylmar]], California, in 1998, by Alfred Mann, Samuel Williams, and Gunnar Bjorg.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. White.

The '''Australian Medical Students' Association''' ('''AMSA''') is an independent association of the 17,000 [[medical student]]s in [[Australia]]. AMSA was formed in 1960 in [[Brisbane]], as a conference organised to network medical students from Australia. It has since grown to become the peak representative body for Australia's medical students—serving a mandate to connect, inform and represent medical students in Australia. Its tri-annual Council meetings include representatives from medical societies at each of Australia's 22 medical schools.

AMSA is a member of the [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations]].

==History==
In 1960, medical students from around Australia met in Brisbane for their first national conference. Never before had Australian medical students come together as one body to discuss ideas, share information and voice their opinions and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org.au/about/history/ |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626055843/http://www.amsa.org.au/about/history/ |archivedate=June 26, 2013|title=History of the AMSA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Australian Medical Students' Association has grown and evolved into one of Australia's largest student representative bodies.

===Advocacy activities===
AMSA has independently or in partnership pursued a wide range of advocacy issues, such as:
# Supporting and campaigning for marriage equality in Australia;
# Establishing and continuing funding for the Commonwealth Medical Internships initiative; and
# Blocking medical schools from enrolling domestic full-fee-paying students in Doctor of Medicine degrees&lt;ref&gt;https://ama.com.au/ausmed/ama-amsa-win-victory-block-md-cash-cow&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Annual conferences==

===AMSA National Convention===
The AMSA National Convention is an annual conference gathering 1,500 medical students from every corner of Australia as well as students from New Zealand. Since its inception in 1960, Convention has grown and evolved to be the highlight of the medical student calendar. Since the 2013 Convention on the Gold Coast, AMSA Convention is the largest student run conference in the world. The Convention program consists of four academic day sessions, one sports day including the annual Emergency Medical Challenge, and seven social evenings culminating a Gala Ball to close Convention. 
With the tagline of 'Unconventional', the 2014 AMSA National Convention was the largest AMSA Convention held to date, and was hosted by the city of Adelaide at the Adelaide Convention Centre. It delivered on its promise to be unparalleled, unconventional and unrelenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://un.convention.al/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913075958/http://un.convention.al/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-09-13 |title=AMSA National Convention Adelaide 2014 |publisher=Un.conventional.al |date= |accessdate=2015-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMSA Global Health Conference===
Originally known as the Developing World Conference, and established in 2005 by members of the Australian Medical Students' Association, the Global Health Conference is a meeting of medical students from around Australia that aims to fulfill the desire of medical students to discuss broader issues relevant to global health.

The inaugural conference hosted 200 delegates in Sydney, whilst the 2006 conference in Perth saw more than 250 students attend. In 2007, Adelaide took the conference to new heights, hosting over 300 delegates at an event that sold out nationwide in less than 12 hours.

The academic programme is filled with speakers from many disciplines, including workers from Medecins Sans Frontieres, Health Advisors to Non-for-profit organisations, Politicians and many many more; while the social programme allows students to meet like-minded individuals from around the country.

The Global Health Conference aims to educate and empower medical students with knowledge about global health.

2016 will see the Global Health Conference come to Newcastle for the first time drawing students from across the Asia-Pacific, New Zealand and all 20 Medical Schools. More information can be found on the website [http://www.newghc.com.au New Global Health Conference].

In 2018, the conference will be held in Melbourne for the first time in ten years.

===AMSA National Leadership Development Seminar===
AMSA's National Leadership Development Seminar (NLDS) is held each year in the nation's capital, Canberra. Running over three days, the seminar is an exclusive conference on the medical student calendar with only 80-100 students selected to attend. The seminar aims to bring together some of the brightest minds and challenge and develop their leadership and opinions.

==Community engagement==

===Vampire Cup===
The Vampire Cup is AMSA's national blood drive run in association with the Australian Red Cross. The drive is run over the months of July/August each year. The 20 Australian medical societies compete for the prestigious cup with the society with the highest number of donations per capita being awarded victory. In 2015, there were 1797 donations nationally with Deakin University Medical Society (MeDUSA) winning the Vampire Cup with 249 donations, the highest number of donations in the history of Vampire Cup. This is the fifth year in a row that Deakin has claimed the Cup.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">'''Biomechatronics''' is an applied [[interdisciplinary]] science that aims to integrate [[biology]], [[mechanics]], and [[electronics]]. It also encompasses the fields of [[robotics]] and [[neuroscience]]. Biomechatronic devices encompass a wide range of applications from the development of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic limbs]] to engineering solutions concerning respiration, vision, and the cardiovascular system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Biomechatronics|last=Brooker|first=Graham|publisher=University of Sydney, Australia|year=2012|isbn=978-1-891121-27-2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
Biomechatronics mimics how the human body works. For example, four different steps must occur to be able to lift the foot to walk. First, [[Action potential|impulses]] from the motor center of the [[brain]] are sent to the foot and [[leg muscles]]. Next the [[nerve cells]] in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the [[muscle]] groups or amount of [[force]] required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of [[force]] are applied depending on the type of surface being walked across. The leg's [[muscle spindle]] [[nerve cells]] then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the [[brain]]. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to [[muscles]] in the leg and foot to set it down.

===Biosensors===
[[Biosensors]] are used to detect what the user wants to do or their intentions and motions. In some devices the information can be relayed by the user's [[nervous system]] or [[muscle system]]. This information is related by the biosensor to a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which can be located inside or outside the biomechatronic device. In addition biosensors receive information about the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] position and force from the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] and [[actuator]]. Biosensors come in a variety of forms. They can be [[wire]]s which detect [[electrical activity]], needle electrodes implanted in [[muscles]], and [[electrode array]]s with [[nerves]] growing through them.

===Mechanical sensors===
The purpose of the mechanical sensors is to measure information about the biomechatronic device and relate that information to the biosensor or controller.

===Controller===
The controller in a biomechatronic device relays the user's intentions to the actuators. It also interprets feedback information to the user that comes from the biosensors and mechanical sensors. The other function of the controller is to control the biomechatronic device's movements.

===Actuator===
The actuator is an artificial muscle. Its job is to produce force and movement. Depending on whether the device is [[orthotic]] or [[prosthetic]] the actuator can be a motor that assists or replaces the user's original muscle.

==Research==
Biomechatronics is a rapidly growing field but as of now there are very few labs which conduct research. The [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[MIT]], and [[University of Twente]] in the Netherlands are the researching leaders in biomechatronics. Three main areas are emphasized in the current research.
#Analyzing human motions, which are complex, to aid in the design of biomechatronic devices
#Studying how electronic devices can be interfaced with the nervous system. 
#Testing the ways to use living muscle tissue as actuators for electronic devices

===Analyzing motions===
A great deal of analysis over human motion is needed because human movement is very complex. [[MIT]] and the [[University of Twente]] are both working to analyze these movements. They are doing this through a combination of [[computer models]], [[camera]] systems, and [[electromyograms]].

===Interfacing===
Interfacing allows biomechatronics devices to connect with the muscle systems and nerves of the user in order send and receive information from the device. This is a technology that is not available in ordinary [[orthotics]] and [[prosthetics]] devices. Groups at the [[University of Twente]] and [[University of Malaya]] are making drastic steps in this department. Scientists there have developed a device which will help to treat [[paralysis]] and [[stroke]] victims who are unable to control their foot while walking. The researchers are also nearing a breakthrough which would allow a person with an [[amputated]] leg to control their [[prosthetic]] leg through their stump muscles.

===MIT research===
[[Hugh Herr]] is the leading biomechatronic scientist at [[MIT]]. Herr and his group of researchers are developing a [[sieve]] [[integrated circuit]] [[electrode]] and prosthetic devices that are coming closer to mimicking real human movement. The two prosthetic devices currently in the making will control knee movement and the other will control the stiffness of an ankle joint.

====Robotic fish====
As mentioned before Herr and his colleagues made a robotic fish that was propelled by living muscle tissue taken from frog legs. The robotic fish was a prototype of a biomechatronic device with a living actuator. The following characteristics were given to the fish.&lt;ref name=" How Biomechatronics Works "&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/biomechatronics4.htm|title= How Biomechatronics Works|work=HowStuffWorks|author=Craig Freudenrich|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A styrofoam float so the fish can float
* Electrical wires for connections
* A silicone tail that enables force while swimming
* Power provided by lithium batteries
* A microcontroller to control movement
* An infrared sensor enables the microcontroller to communicate with a handheld device
* Muscles stimulated by an electronic unit

===Arts research===
New media artists at UCSD are using biomechatronics in performance art pieces, such as Technesexual ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100213084238/http://bang.calit2.net/wiki/Mixed_Relations more information], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157621943139937/ photos], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100204233552/http://vimeo.com/7240418 video]), a performance which uses biometric sensors to bridge the performers' real bodies to their Second Life avatars and Slapshock  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100124144847/http://life.calit2.net/archives/2009/06/slapshock-by-elle-mehrmand-and.php more information], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157620312879150/ photos],[http://www.vimeo.com/5532433 video]), in which medical TENS units are used to explore intersubjective symbiosis in intimate relationships.

==Growth==
The demand for biomechatronic devices are at an all-time high and show no signs of slowing down. With increasing technological advancement in recent years, biomechatronic researchers have been able to construct prosthetic limbs that are capable of replicating the functionality of human appendages. Such devices include the "i-limb", developed by prosthetic company Touch Bionics, the first fully functioning prosthetic hand with articulating joints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Touch Bionics|url=http://www.touchbionics.com/about/history|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Herr's PowerFoot BiOM, the first prosthetic leg capable of simulating muscle and tendon processes within the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/future-robotic-legs-180953040/?no-ist=&amp;preview=&amp;page=1|title=Is This the Future of Robotic Legs?|author=Shaer, Matthew|date=November 2014|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomechatronic research has also helped further research towards understanding human functions. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State have created an exoskeleton that decreases the metabolic cost of walking by around 7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers improve efficiency of human walking|type=Press Release|publisher=NSF|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134667|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many biomechatronic researchers are closely collaborating with military organizations. The [[US Department of Veterans Affairs]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] are giving funds to different labs to help soldiers and war veterans.&lt;ref name=" How Biomechatronics Works "/&gt;

Despite the demand, however, biomechatronic technologies struggle within the healthcare market due to high costs and lack of implementation into insurance policies. Herr claims that Medicare and Medicaid specifically are important "market-breakers or market-makers for all these technologies," and that the technologies will not be available to everyone until the technologies get a breakthrough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2014/04/22/will-medicare-patients-be-left-out-of-the-bionics-revolution/|title=Will Medicare patients be left out of the bionics revolution?|author=Johnson, Brian|work=Boston Globe|date=2014-04-22|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomechatronic devices, although improved, also still face mechanical obstructions, suffering from inadequate battery power, consistent mechanical reliability, and neural connections between prosthetics and the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How biomechatronic prosthetics are changing the face of disability|date=March 13, 2014|url=http://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/design-engineering-features/technology/how-biomechatronic-prosthetics-are-changing-the-face-of-disability/60092/|accessdate=July 29, 2016|author=Fanning, Paul|work=Eureka Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The current Executive Board (2008–2010) is led by Dr. [[Cláudio Giulliano Alves da Costa]] (President). Former presidents were: Roberto J. Rodrigues, [[Renato M.E. Sabbatini]], Mariza Machado Klück, [[Beatriz de Faria Leão]], [[Daniel Sigulem]], [[Umberto Tachinardi]], [[Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr.]] and [[Heimar de Fátima Marin]]. Short histories of Health Informatics in Brazil have been published elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaim.com.ar/paneles/PN20-1.pdf Marin, H.F. Informática em Saúde no Brasil. 2008 Conference of IMIA-LAC, International Medical Informatics Association Federation for Latin America and the Caribbeam. Published by the Argentinian Association of Medical Informatics, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2008 (in PDF, in Portuguese)]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaticamedica.org.br/informaticamedica/n0105/sabbatini.htm Sabbatini, R.M.E. História da Informática em Saúde no Brasil. Revista Informática Médica, 1(5), Set/Out 1998. (In Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt; by former presidents of the Society.

==Conferences and Meetings==
SBIS organizes since 1986 a biannual national conference, the [[Brazilian Congress of Health Informatics]] and a biannual specialized conference on [[Electronic Health Record]]s (PEP); besides other, smaller and less periodical meetings.

The '''Brazilian Congress on Health Informatics''' takes place in different cities every two years and has as its main subjects the applications of [[information technology]] and [[telematics]] to [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[dentistry]] and allied [[health care]] sciences, from the point of view of the expert scientific and technical worker in these areas. The first conference was organized in November 1986, in the city of [[Campinas]] by Dr. [[Renato M.E. Sabbatini]]. The vice-president was Dr. [[Hugo Sabatino]], and the editor-in-chief of the Conference's proceedings was Dr. [[Renato G.G. Terzi]], all with the [[Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Universidade Estadual de Campinas|Medical School]] at the same university. During this conference, the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics was launched, as well as the ''Brazilian Journal of Health Informatics''. The conference was then repeated in 1988 ([[São Paulo]]), 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 ([[Campos do Jordão]]), 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 ([[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]]), 2006 ([[Florianópolis]]) and 2008 (Campos do Jordão). The next conference will be held in November 2010, in [[Porto de Galinhas]], [[Pernambuco]].

==Publications==
SBIS' flagship [[periodical]] is the on-line [[scientific journal]], ''[[Journal of Health Informatics]]'' (Heimar Marin, Editor-in-Chief). It also publishes ''SBIS News'', an electronic bulletin hosted by [[Yahoo! Groups]] ([[Renato M.E. Sabbatini]], editor-in-chief), and coordinates the SBIS-L [[e-mail discussion list]].

==Electronic Health Record Certification Project==

In collaboration with the Brazilian [[Conselho Federal de Medicina|Federal Council of Medicine]] since 2007, SBIS has developed one of few programs in the developing world geared towards the [[certification|software certification]] in the area of electronic health records. The standards for access, [[information security]], [[digital certification]], patient [[confidentiality]], storage of records, etc., have been discussed together and officially approved by a number of decrees enforced by CFM and are part now of a Manual, a course for buildup of a task force of specialized consultants. The certification standards cover ambulatory healthcare, clinical laboratory and other areas, and in the future will be expanded for inpatient health records and [[Picture archiving and communication system]].

==Professional Education==

In 2008 the Society approved the creation of a new initiative and a directorship to boost educational activities in health informatics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbis.org.br/site/site.dll/noticia?pagina=1&amp;item=111 Costa, CGA: Retrospectiva 2009 e Planos para 2010 da SBIS, Published December 29, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727010231/http://www.sbis.org.br/site/site.dll/noticia?pagina=1&amp;item=111 |date=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbis.virtual.org.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=22 Sociedade Brasileira de Informática em Saúde. Diretoria de Educação e Capacitação Profissional. São Paulo, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; A website and a [[Learning Management System]] based on [[Moodle]] server were created in 2009 (address [http://www.sbis.virtual.org.br]). The site is used to support presential courses as well as to offer purely distance courses, seminars, lectures, and other educational activities. The site has also a [[digital library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbis.virtual.org.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=65 Biblioteca Virtual em Informática em Saúde, São Paulo, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; with on-line references to papers, reviews, [[e-book]]s, [[multimedia]] files, etc., which are deemed useful for education and learning purposes. In addition, [[webconferencing]] facilities using [[DimDim]] have been added and can be used by associated individuals and institutions.

==Professional Certificate in Health Informatics==
In October 2009 the Society launched a program for [[professional certification|certificating]] health care professionals as specialists, in a  manner similar to medical specialties coordinated by the [[Brazilian Medical Association]] and the [[Conselho Federal de Medicina|Federal Council of Medicine]] in Brazil. The program entails a minimum list of technical proficiency, a written and oral annual examination, and the issue of a certificate which is valid for five years. The revalidation of the certificate will be mandatory by means of [[continuing education]] credits. The Society installed also an educational [[accreditation]] program in place, for recognizing courses and [[curriculum|curricula]] in health informatics, for this purpose, with a point-based system of credits. The entire program is under the responsibility of a new Directorship of Professional Education, coordinated by Prof. Renato M.E. Sabbatini.

The '''Children Affected by AIDS Foundation''' (CAAF) is devoted to providing social, educational, recreational and other critical support programs to vulnerable children impacted by HIV/AIDS in the U.S. and other countries.  CAAF accomplishes its mission to help HIV-impacted children domestically and abroad through four district programs.

==Mission==
The mission of the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation (CAAF) is to make a positive difference in the lives of children infected with HIV and affected by AIDS. CAAF accomplishes this by helping meet their diverse special needs, advocating and educating on their behalf, and bringing joy and fun into their lives.

==U.S. Initiatives==
#Camp Network - Allow more children affected by AIDS to attend summer camp by making grants, facilitating communication between agencies helping such children to attend a camp, developing new camps, and hosting meetings of camp providers to enhance the experience of children affected by AIDS.
#Family Assistance - Families who experience financial hardships as a result of medical bills or other expenses brought on by the impact of HIV/AIDS often request relief from their local social services agencies. The Children Affected by AIDS Foundation awards small grants to these agencies for the immediate use of families.

==Latin America and Caribbean Program==
In collaboration with a local partner, the foundation has implemented its Prevention by Intervention initiative in 22 healthcare sites in Guatemala.  The initiative is increasing HIV awareness, access to HIV pre and post test counseling for pregnant woman and rapid HIV testing to prevent children from being born with the virus.  As a result, Prevention by Intervention is decreasing the rates of mother to child transmission of HIV and, consequently AIDS orphanhood in Guatemala.

After entering the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region in 2005, CAAF has spread throughout the region and touched the lives of more than 28,000 children in 2008. CAAF has worked in Brazil to accelerate adoption procedures and offer legal aid to families adopting AIDS-orphaned children.  Food was supplied and psychological support services were provided for Argentinean families affected by AIDS. In Peru, CAAF engaged healthcare workers, families, and children to promote medication adherence, among other programs.

CAAF's international efforts have given funds to 31 nonprofits to support care, stability and well-being of Latin American and Caribbean children who are infected, affected or orphaned by HIV/AIDS.

==Fundraising==
The Foundation's premiere fundraising effort is Dream Halloween, kid-friendly costume parties held in October in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]].

What is Dream Halloween?  Since 1993, The Children Affected by AIDS Foundation has raised millions through its
nationally recognized Dream Halloween special events. These events were created for a very special reason – to provide children with a safe, secure opportunity to enjoy Halloween through an experience that goes far beyond a child’s imagination. The goal of the events is to create an experience that exemplifies what every child would dream of when celebrating Halloween.

Now, Dream Halloween is a unique national awareness and fundraising campaign launched annually in October to expand the efforts of the foundation. Incorporating the signature events with corporate cause
marketing efforts, a full media campaign and innovative new fundraising initiatives, Dream Halloween will highlight the unique work of the foundation and provide new opportunities to support the mission of the organization. The nation will be invited to join the campaign and dream…Dream of a day when all children living

==History==
[[File:JoeCristinaApr2011.jpg|thumb|right|Cristina at an event for CAAF in April 2011]]
As a Mattel, Inc. executive, Joe Cristina’s professional life has centered on children for more than 22 years.  In 1993, Joe was faced with a dilemma—his health had been deteriorating due to HIV, he had lost two life partners to AIDS, and he was contemplating a quiet disability leave.

But his boss, Jill Barad (then President of Mattel), proposed instead to Joe that he take a few weeks off to think about what he wanted to do with the rest of his life and trust that his friends and business colleagues would be there to support him.  Joe decided to publicly disclose his HIV+ status, and he was overwhelmed by the enormous outpouring of support he received.  The response from everyone was the same: “What can I do to help?”

Joe realized that he was being faced with a once in a lifetime opportunity to help make a difference in the world. The encouragement and support that he received from those at Mattel and throughout the children’s industry inspired him. That inspiration, along with an improvement in his health due to the advent of “HIV cocktail therapy”, convinced him to stay at Mattel and find a way to mobilize this network of diverse resources to make a positive difference in the lives of children affected by HIV/AIDS.  Hence, the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation was born.  Through Joe’s vision and leadership, the Foundation has raised more than $33 million since its inception.  In 2007, Joe’s health again began to falter due to the long-term effects of HIV coupled with medication side effects, and it became necessary for him to go on an extended medical leave from Mattel. Joe now focuses all of his time and energy on taking care of his health and continuing to help children affected by HIV/AIDS.  Mattel, Inc. continues to provide major funding and support to the Foundation.

Joe Cristina currently serves as the Board Chair for CAAF.

==Administration==
CAAF has a staff of 7 led by President Catherine Brown. The group has its headquarters in [[Los Angeles]] and maintains a satellite office in [[Chicago]].

'''Cohiba''' is a [[Cuba|Cuban]] brand of cigarettes which were created by Habanos S.A. to diversify from its cigar brand names and are currently manufactured by the [[France|Franco]]-[[Spain|Spanish]] company [[Altadis]], which is a subsidiary of [[Imperial Tobacco]]. Since 2003, ''"Brascuba"'' produces the brand in [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Russia]]. Cohiba is the Cuban Indians' name for tobacco.&lt;ref name="thehumidoraruba.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehumidoraruba.com/products/cigarettes/cohiba-cigarettes/|title=Cohiba Cigarettes - The Humidor|website=Thehumidoraruba.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohibacigarettes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cohibacigarettes.com/products/|title=Buy Cohiba ORIGINAL, PREDILECTO, WHITE Cigarettes|website=Cohibacigarettes.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Production of Cohiba cigarettes began in 1987 in [[Cuba]] as a joint venture between Habanos, S.A. and Cita Tobaccos de Canarias, S.L.. They are made entirely of a blend of Cuban black leaf tobacco from the [[Vuelta Abajo]] region, and the tobacco is 100% additive free.&lt;ref name="thehumidoraruba.com"/&gt; Cohiba cigarettes are called cigarillos negros (black cigarettes) and known for their very strong flavour.

The brand is mainly sold in [[Cuba]], but was or still is sold in [[Spain]] and [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cigarettespedia.com/index.php/BrandCohiba|title=BrandCohiba - Cigarettes Pedia|website=Cigarettespedia.com|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zigsam.at/B_Cohiba.htm|title=Cohiba|website=Zigsam.at|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cigarety.by/brand.php?n=10&amp;l=2&amp;p=0&amp;w=COHIBA|title=Brands|website=Cigarety.by|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cold Turkey''''' is a 1971 [[satire|satirical comedy]] [[film]].  It stars [[Dick Van Dyke]] plus a long list of comedic actors. The film was directed, co-produced and co-written by [[Norman Lear]] and is based on the unpublished novel ''I'm Giving Them Up for Good'' by Margaret and Neil Rau.

The film was made in 1969, but was shelved for two years by the distributor due to concerns about its box-office potential.

A [[musical theatre]] version of ''Cold Turkey'' was workshopped at the Village Theatre in Issaquah, Washington in February 2005.

==Plot==
As part of a public relations and marketing strategy to compare the empathy of [[Big Tobacco]] to the nobility of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], advertising executive Merwin Wren convinces the Valiant Tobacco Company to propose a challenge: a tax-free check for $25,000,000 (${{Inflation|US|25|1969|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) to any city or town in America that can stop [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], going [[cold turkey]], for thirty days.

According to Wren, the offer will generate Valiant worldwide free publicity and praise as a humanitarian gesture, but no town in America would ever be able to claim the prize, with cigarette smoking being too addictive to stop.

The Reverend Clayton Brooks, a kindly but fearsome [[Minister of religion|minister]] of the Eagle Rock Community Church, takes up the challenge as a spiritual call. He urges the economically depressed (fictional) community of Eagle Rock, Iowa, population 4,006, to go for the prize.

The town council has been trying to woo back the military ever since it closed a base a few years earlier, hoping its return would help the local cash flow. Families have been moving out almost on a monthly basis and the town center is almost deserted.

Reverend Brooks recruits every smoker in the town to sign up. Needled for being a former smoker, he begins smoking again to find solidarity with his "flock."

As the deadline to start the thirty-day clock approaches, only a very few of the town's residents haven't signed the no smoking pledge. One of them is alcoholic Edgar Stopworth, who Reverend Brooks decides to pay a house call on, to convince him to take the pledge. But Edgar knows himself pretty well and in desperation tells the Reverend "My drinking is directly connected to my smoking. The booze bone's connected to the smoke bone." The Reverend looks defeated but comes up with the idea of Edgar leaving town for a thirty-day vacation, which Edgar immediately departs on. Problem solved.

At midnight, the challenge begins. For the next thirty days, no smoking is permitted, with Eagle Rock being the only city in America that got all of its smokers to pledge.

Once the no smoking ban begins, Reverend Brooks gets extremely frustrated with not being able to smoke. His only relief is having frequent sex with his wife Natalie. At one point she barely gets finished making the bed and straightening up from the preceding episode before the Reverend is back home again for more.

The tobacco company sends Merwin to report the progress of the townspeople's commitment. The company needs just one person to fail. Among the weakest: the elderly Doctor Proctor, who must always have a cigarette before surgery, and the anxiety-ridden wife of the mayor, Mrs. Wappler, who counts the small gherkin pickles she eats as the hours pass.  However, a group of 29 non-smoking residents, all members of the ultra-conservative Christopher Mott Society (based on the [[John Birch Society]]) have been asked by Brooks to police all traffic entering Eagle Rock to ensure no tobacco products enter.

Eventually, the attention of the nation's leading newscasters at the time (all played by the comedy duo [[Bob and Ray]]), turns the small community's efforts into a matter of highly publicized failure or success. Soon the community is invaded by buxom "massage therapists," beer vendors, souvenir shops and more. Rev. Brooks appears on a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover, which leads him to another epiphany: if he can save the town, he will be a hero.

Merwin is told by Valiant's board members to undermine the town's efforts at all costs, doing whatever he must to get someone to smoke before the thirty days are up, which includes speeding up the large clock in the town center prior to the end of the 30 day deadline, in the hopes that people will be tricked into starting to smoke again before they are allowed to.  

Ultimately Eagle Rock succeeds and wins the $25 million prize. To cash in on the publicity, The President Of The United States (as seen from the side and back, then President [[Richard M. Nixon]]) arrives in a motorcade and makes an announcement that Eagle Rock will be the home of the new missile plant. As the film ends, it shows the huge smokestacks of the new plant spewing volumes of black smoke into the air around Eagle Rock.

==Cast notes==
*Veteran actor [[Edward Everett Horton]], whose career began in 1906, plays [[tobacco]] company president Hiram C. "Mr. Tobacco' Grayson in a [[wheelchair]] and without dialogue.  He is shown later in a [[limousine]] where Grayson [[fart]]s, possibly the first time that flatulence is depicted in a U.S. movie.  This was Horton's final role, and he died before the film was released.
*Director/Producer [[Norman Lear]] has a three-second cameo approximately 2/3 of the way into the film.  He is shown as one of the townspeople sitting down and crying because he is unable to get a cigarette fix.
*[[Maureen McCormick]], best known for her role as Marcia Brady on television's ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', provides the voice of a talking doll in the film, which says "I love you! – smoking gives you cancer!"
*The characters played by [[Bob and Ray]] are parodies of real-life news and broadcasting personalities: "Walter Chronic" ([[Walter Cronkite]]), "Hugh Upson" ([[Hugh Downs]]), "David Chetley" ([[Chet Huntley]]/[[David Brinkley]]), "Arthur Lordly" ([[Arthur Godfrey]]), "Paul Hardly" ([[Paul Harvey]]), and "Sandy Van Andy" ([[Sander Vanocur]]).  
*The film's promotional trailer is hosted by newscasters "Hardly Reasonable" ([[Harry Reasoner]]) and "Mike Walrus" ([[Mike Wallace]]).  Neither the characters nor the actors who play them appear in the actual film; "Walrus" is played by [[Paul Dooley]].
*A number of actors appearing in the film – [[Jean Stapleton]], [[Vincent Gardenia]], [[Paul Benedict]] and [[Barnard Hughes]]—would go on to work with Lear in the coming years on his various television projects.

==Filming locations==
Most of the film, which is set in the fictional small town of "Eagle Rock, Iowa", was shot in and around [[Greenfield, Iowa]], and many local people were used as [[Extra (actor)|extras]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omaha.com/go/years-after-filming-of-cold-turkey-greenfield-iowa-rolls-out/article_4df86a8e-da38-5190-81e3-937a2ace300d.html "45 years after filming of ‘Cold Turkey,' Greenfield, Iowa, rolls out red carpet for director Norman Lear’s return," by Andrew J. Nelson (Omaha World-Herald; December 13, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some neighborhood scenes were shot in [[Winterset, Iowa]]. The Methodist church in [[Orient, Iowa]], and the bank in [[Macksburg, Iowa]], were used as well. The Grayson Mansion scenes were filmed at [[Terrace Hill]], official residence of the [[Governor of Iowa]], located in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. Some were also shot in the town of [[Columbia, Kentucky|Columbia]] in south central [[Kentucky]].

==Soundtrack==
''Cold Turkey'' features original music by [[Randy Newman]], including "[[He Gives Us All His Love]]", a ballad with a [[gospel music|gospel]] influence that serves as the film's theme song. This was Newman's first film soundtrack.

In 2007 the Percepto Records label issued a limited-edition [[soundtrack album|soundtrack CD]] for the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/board/posts.cfm?threadID=46267&amp;forumID=1&amp;archive=0 Filmscoremonthly.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234850/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/board/posts.cfm?threadID=46267&amp;forumID=1&amp;archive=0 |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film earned $5.5 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office.&lt;ref&gt;"All-time Film Rental Champs", ''Variety'', January 7, 1976, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Krim]] of United Artists later did an assessment of the film as part of an evaluation of the company's inventory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An old commitment to Dick Van Dyke, and what seemed to be a good idea for the American market, became an overpriced film with a has-been personality by the time of it's [ [[sic]] ] release. Albeit funny, the picture is way overpriced for its value, which is strictly for the American market – mainly for mid America. The producer and director went over a million dollars over budget on the film to deliver a minor American comedy with no overseas value. This film would be programmed today only if it could be made at one-half the cost.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company that Changed the Film Industry'', Wisconsin Press, 1987, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Critical===
[[Vincent Canby]] of [[The New York Times]] wrote that "it is, within its limitations, a very engaging, very funny movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=March 18, 1971 |title=A Satirical Visit to a Greedy Small Town |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "an often-hilarious, partly-muffed contemporary comedy" marred by "sluggish pacing" and a climax called "bizarre: Lear seems to have written himself into a corner, with no way out except to shift abruptly from human comedy to stylistic nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 3, 1971 |title=Cold Turkey |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave it four stars and praised several aspects of the production before concluding "Even if you don't smoke, you'll find Cold Turkey funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cold-turkey-1971 |title=Cold Turkey |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=April 14, 1971 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=November 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it "a fine and funny idea for a short film," but "scene after scene runs too long. Too many gags are repeated too often."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (April 6, 1971). "Cold Turkey". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "an enterprising, very amusing, very contemporary social commentary."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (March 5, 1971). "'Cold Turkey' Views Greed". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "A shallow, self-deluding sort of comedy, it fails to make sense out of its own premise and characters and then tries to cover up by getting cynical about everything-in-general. It's as if Lear had been inspired to imitate [[Billy Wilder]] at his worst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=March 9, 1971 |title='Cold Turkey': Cold Turkey |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=B8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home video releases==
In 1993 ''Cold Turkey'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]], in the [[pan-and-scan]] format. In 2010, the film was released on [[DVD]] through [[Amazon.com]] with manufacturing on demand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Turkey-Dick-Van-Dyke/dp/B003B3O5GS/ Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Columbia Asia''' is a multinational chain of hospitals in [[Asia]], with 28 medical facilities across [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Indonesia]]. Columbia Asia is one of the largest and fastest-growing healthcare companies in Asia and owned by an investment fund : International Columbia USA LLC (ICU)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.columbiaasia.com/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;. The Group started operations in 1997 with a simple goal to "deliver accessible, quality, cost-effective specialist care to people where they live.". However, the costing provided by the hospital services are considered to be much higher to the living standards of that area. Some even consider that the chain of hospitals are only catering for high-class citizen and not sticking to orignal motive.
 
The company offers full-service hospitals usually built in the suburbs, mostly where there are rich industrial belts, rather than the central city.&lt;ref name=IndUS_Business_Journal&gt;{{cite news |title= Columbia Asia raises $135M for hospitals|url= http://www.indusbusinessjournal.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=57085B8DFC784786B850F4567A32D139|publisher=IndUS Business Journal|date= 2008-09-19|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Columbia Asia has a cluster strategy where multiple hospitals are grouped to complement each facility, providing accessibility in the community. Columbia Asia's target market is the fast-growing middle income group.

Columbia Asia believes in setting up smaller hospitals; less than 200 beds; built in residential areas for accessibility and efficiency.&lt;ref name=Seattle_Times&gt;{{cite news |title= Seattle fund bankrolls Asian private hospital chain|url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008140676_columbiaasia270.html|publisher= The Seattle Times|date= 2008-08-27|accessdate=2008-10-30 | first=Ángel | last=González}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical hospital has about 90-150 beds, costing roughly $30 million to build. Each hospital sees about sees about 8,000 - 15,000 patients a month, and brings in about $1-2 million in monthly revenue. All hospitals in the group have the standardized design, which gives the same look and feel throughout all geographies under one unified brand.

Most of the company’s 12,000 employees are from the host countries.&lt;ref name=NRI_Internet&gt;{{cite news | title= NRI, US investors setting up hospital chain in India |url= http://www.nriinternet.com/NRIhospitals/India/Columbia_Asia/1_US_Investers.htm |publisher= NRI Internet|date= 2005-06-30|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia Asia hires its doctors and staff largely from the local areas.

The company is in the midst of expansion and upon completion of this phase the company will have 12 facilities in India, 14 facilities in Malaysia, 3 facilities in Vietnam and 3 faciliites in Indonesia, together representing an investment of over $600 million (U.S.). Addition to the pipeline projects, expansion of the existing facilities are also planned to cater to the growing healthcare demand in the community. &lt;ref name=New_Straits_Times&gt;{{cite news | title= Columbia Asia plans US$150m expansion |url= http://dev.nst.com.my/node/32045 |publisher= NST|date= 2014-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Venturebeat&gt;{{cite news | title= Columbia Asia Launches $150M Expansion of its India and Southeast Asia Hospital Network |url= https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/09/columbia-asia-launches-150m-expansion-of-its-india-and-southeast-asia-hospital-network |publisher= Venturebeat|date= 2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Columbia Asia Receives $101M Investment from Mitsui &amp; Co. |url= http://www.columbiaasia.com/malaysia/news}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Columbia Asia Receives Additional Equity Investment Of USD210 Million |url= https://www.businessinsider.my/columbia-asia-receives-additional-equity-investment-of-usd210-million/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2086">The '''Federal School of Dental Technology &amp; Therapy''' is a higher education institute in [[Trans-Ekulu]], [[Enugu State]], [[Nigeria]]. It was established in 1955 in [[Lagos]] as the Federal School of Dental Technology and Hygiene, training dental technicians and hygienists. It became the Federal School of Dental Technology and Therapy in 1978, with the larger goal of training dental technologists and therapists. The school moved to its present location in 1982. The school is funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria. 
Graduates of school of Dental Technology are awarded a professional degree equivalent to Bachelor of science degree, and graduates will go for one-year internship before professional registration.
Graduates may practice as professionals after registration with the Dental Technologists or Dental Therapists Registration Boards of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The school was once the only school which trained dental technologists and therapists in Nigeria, until recently when other schools were established for this purpose.

In August 2009, the new chairman of the board said it had been largely static over the years, and that he was looking for federal and state funding for upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Freedom Fund''' is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to identifying and investing in the most effective frontline efforts to end slavery.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;&lt;ref name="Omidyar Forbes"/&gt; In 2017, the [[International Labour Organization]] reported that on any given day in 2016, there were 40 million people living in modern slavery worldwide across a wide range of industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alliance87.org/2017ge/modernslavery#!section=0|title=2017 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery and Child Labour|last=FFunction|website=2017 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery and Child Labour|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freedom Fund was founded in September 2013, by three leading anti-slavery donors, [https://humanityunited.org/ Humanity United], the [[Legatum|Legatum Foundation]] and the [[Walk Free Foundation]]&lt;ref name="Market Watch"/&gt; and officially announced by President [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] on September 26, 2013 where he declared "this is a huge deal and we should all support this."&lt;ref name="Clinton Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Our Story"/&gt;

==Freedom Fund’s Mission and Values==

The Freedom Fund has set a target of raising USD $100million by 2020 and investing it to bring about much needed strategic focus to the fight against modern slavery.&lt;ref&gt;http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/68/66&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, The Freedom Fund has focused its activities on three main areas:&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomfund.org/programs/our-approach/&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Hotspot projects''' – The Freedom Fund partners with frontline organisations to directly combat slavery in defined regions with a high concentration of slavery .&lt;ref name = ihrfg/&gt; They do this by setting up "hotspot" projects - clusters of the most effective community-based organisations in these regions. Partnering with these organisations in some of the world's poorest and most marginalised communities is difficult, demanding and time intensive, but it is also one of the most effective ways to achieve large scale and sustainable change. The Freedom Fund's northern India hotspot has been in place since 2014, and as of December 2017, had [http://freedomfund.org/impact/hotspot-impact/northern-india/ liberated over 11,000 people] from modern slavery.&lt;ref name="The Economist one brick at a time"/&gt; The Freedom Fund's hotspots are located in [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/central-nepal-hotspot/ central Nepal], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/ethiopia-hotspot/ Ethiopia], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/northern-india-hotspot/ northern India], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/south-eastern-nepal-hotspot/ south-eastern Nepal], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/southern-india-hotspot/ southern India] and [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/thailand-hotspot/ Thailand].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/lifestyle/modern-slavery-britain/11109547/suburbia-domestic-slaves.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Global initiatives''' - The Freedom Fund tackles underlying systems that allow slavery to persist. They do this in their hotspots, engaging the government, private sector, media, social movements, and other key drivers of change. They also do it by catalysing action on selected global issues and industries that have a direct link to their hotspots. This allows the Freedom Fund to tackle systemic issues like slavery in fishing, migration, or to help develop new technological tools or legal initiatives.&lt;ref name="Thomson Reuters Foundation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grono|first1=Nick|title=Using the law to defeat modern slavery|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20150224192144-q3sgb/?source=search|accessdate=2 April 2015|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the Freedom Fund and C&amp;A Foundation announced a partnership to tackle forced labour in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C&amp;A Foundation Launches New Partnership Strategy to Address Fight Bonded Labour in Apparel Industry|url=http://textilesupdate.com/ca-foundation-launches-new-partnership-strategy-to-address-fight-bonded-labour-in-apparel-industry|accessdate=2 April 2015|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
{{main|Nick Grono}}

The Freedom Fund's inaugural CEO, [[Nick Grono]], has written articles on modern slavery for the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref name = "Grono Huffpo 1"/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref name="Grono Newsweek 1"/&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' &lt;ref name = "Guardian Econ case"/&gt; as well as contributed to the Freedom Fund blog.&lt;ref name = "Freedom Blog"/&gt; Grono previously served as Deputy President and COO of the Brussels-based [[International Crisis Group]]&lt;ref name="Legatum" /&gt; and as CEO of the [[Walk Free Foundation]], an international anti-slavery organisation. During his tenure, the Walk Free Foundation built a global anti-slavery movement with over five million supporters and launched the first ever [[Global Slavery Index]].&lt;ref name="Slavery Index"/&gt; Grono joined Freedom Fund in December 2013.&lt;ref name=Legatum/&gt;

==Impact==
In keeping with the Freedom Fund’s investment roots, they take their role in evaluating impact very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomfund.org/impact/monitoring-and-evaluation/&lt;/ref&gt; They direct resources to anti-slavery initiatives across the world where they can make the biggest difference, measure what works, learn from unexpected results, and share knowledge.

As of December 2017 the Freedom Fund had:&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomfund.org/impact/global-metrics/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impacted 390,663 lives

The '''HIV Vaccine Trials Network''' (HVTN) is a [[non-profit organization]] which connects physicians and scientists with activists and community educators for the purpose of conducting [[clinical trial]]s seeking a safe and effective [[HIV vaccine]]. Collaboratively, researchers and [[layman|laypeople]] review potential vaccines for safety, [[immune response]], and efficacy. The HVTN is a network for testing vaccines, and while its members may also work in vaccine development for other entities, the mission of the HVTN does not include vaccine design.

The HVTN is the only HIV vaccine research network sponsored by the American government. It also manages the only large-scale HIV vaccine research trial network in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The HVTN collaborates with the [[Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]] (DAIDS). Funding comes from the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] and [[National Institutes of Health]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvtn.org/about/index.html |title=About the HVTN |publisher=HVTN Website |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015142010/http://www.hvtn.org/about/index.html |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which oversee DAIDS. HVTN is headquartered at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fhcrc.org/about/ne/news/2000/05/25/hvtn.htm | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801175001/http://www.fhcrc.org/about/ne/news/2000/05/25/hvtn.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-08-01 | title=Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Named as Core Operations Center for Worldwide HIV Vaccine Trials Network | publisher=FHCRC Press Release | date=2000-05-25 | accessdate=2008-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaccines being tested come from various producers, both commercial and non-profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvtn.org/science/trials.html |title=Current Vaccine Trials |publisher=HVTN Website |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016233144/http://www.hvtn.org/science/trials.html |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
Typically, researchers conduct [[clinical research]] on [[human subject research|human subjects]] by asking volunteers to give [[informed consent]] to participate in an experiment by taking drugs that have not always been proven safe or effective in humans, though their safety has been tested (usually in animals) prior to any human trials. At the HVTN, many current vaccine studies are using products with a safety record that has been established in previous human trials.

The [[Nuremberg Code]], the [[Declaration of Helsinki]], and the [[Belmont Report]] are legal documents written in layman's terms which local governments use to model their laws for establishing rules for conducting clinical trials, and all contemporary clinical trials of international worth follow all the rules set by these precedents.

However, HIV vaccine research requires more than just these protections, and because of this, from the inception of their research the HVTN has instituted a "community advisory board" (CAB) system in addition to the usual controls.  The CAB is similar to an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) in that the researchers facilitate the granting of public data to both entities, but the difference is that the IRB consists of a professional ethics committee and the CAB consists of any community member who wants to supervise the safety, ethics, efficacy, or any other aspect of the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvtn.org/community/cab.html |title=Community Advisory Board (CAB) |publisher=HVTN Website |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212072217/http://www.hvtn.org/community/cab.html |archivedate=2008-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers of the HVTN deemed the creation of the CAB necessary for HIV vaccine research when it has not been necessary for other clinical research because the HIV epidemic is especially urgent, new research techniques are available now that did not exist before recent major advances in [[genetic engineering]], the public is generally overly-willing to volunteer to receive experimental vaccines for this cause, and yet the educational infrastructure already in place to disseminate information about the inherent risk in participating in vaccine research is lacking in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fhcrc.org/about/pubs/center_news/2005/feb3/sart6.html | title=Building a vaccine legacy on trust | publisher=FHCRC Center News | date=2005-02-03 | accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For too many reasons, there is no precedent for research of this sort on this scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art4866.html | title=Joining a Community Advisory Board | publisher=The Body | date=2003-12-20 | accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and without integrating educational programs about this research into existing community institutions, the HVTN simply could not educate people to the required level to make such a fast-moving, expensive, inherently non-commercial research project possible.

==African HIV vaccine trials==

* In 2003 the HVTN partnered with [[Harvard University]] in establishing a small-scale vaccine trials unit in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/now/aug8/ | title=Harvard AIDS Institute Helps Launch HIV Vaccine Trial in Botswana | publisher=Harvard Public Health NOW | date=2003-08-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20031005194755/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/now/aug8/ | archivedate=2003-10-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major reason for this project was gathering data about the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV prevalence in Africa]] and assessing the feasibility of getting [[grassroots]] support for vaccine trials.
* In 2007 the HVTN started the first large-scale HIV vaccine trials in Africa, called HVTN 503/Phambili, with financial assistance from the SA Aids Vaccine Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=62628 | title=Africa's First Large-Scale HIV Vaccine Study Launches | accessdate=2007-03-08 | publisher=Medical News Today | date=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=14&amp;click_id=125&amp;art_id=nw20070301155938256C941815 | title=Volunteers join HIV vaccine trial | accessdate=2007-03-08 | publisher=IOL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phambili was halted in 2007 due to its similarity to the ineffective vaccine used in the American [[STEP Study|STEP]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Research/vaccines/advisory/avrs/avrs.htm | title=Status of NIAID Adenovirus-based Vaccine Studies |  publisher=NIAID | accessdate=2008-10-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001230421/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Research/vaccines/advisory/avrs/avrs.htm |archivedate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, the HVTN collaborated with South African researcher [[Glenda Gray]] on a trial called HVTN 097 which is the only study outside Thailand to test the pox-protein vaccine regimen that had been found to be partially efficacious in the [[RV 144|RV144]] trial.
*Since 2016, the HVTN is collaborating with African researchers and communities on multiple HIV vaccine efficacy trials in Africa, including [http://uhambo.org.za/ HVTN 702 (Uhambo)] which tests a pox-protein vaccine regimen, [https://ampstudy.org.za/ HVTN 703 (AMP)] which tests passive immunisation, and [https://www.imbokodo.org.za/about HVTN 705 (Imbokodo)] which tests a global antigen vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HIV vaccine|date=2018-07-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HIV_vaccine&amp;oldid=849899206|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American HIV vaccine trials==

* HVTN 502/ [[STEP Study|STEP]] was the name for a [[blind experiment|double-blind]] [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted in the US and managed by the HVTN. It was thoroughly reviewed when more participants in the [[experimental group]] contracted HIV than  participants in the [[Scientific control|control group]]. The vaccine contained no HIV and no one could have contracted HIV from the vaccine, but there was intense discussion as to whether the vaccine could have increased anyone's risk of contracting HIV.  Because the study was stopped early, it probably will never be possible to determine why more participants in the experimental group contracted HIV, but various theories have been proposed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* In October 2009, the HVTN began a clinical trial in the USA called [[HVTN 505]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New trial of HIV vaccine in gay men begins |author=Matthew S. Bajko  |newspaper=Bay Area Reporter |date=2009-10-01 |url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=4218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HVTN 505 tested whether two vaccines, a DNA plasmid vaccine plus a recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine (DNA/rAd5), could prevent HIV. The vaccines were developed for HIV subtypes A, B and C by the [[Vaccine Research Center]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). In April 2013, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping vaccinations because there was no evidence that the vaccines could prevent people from getting HIV. The vaccines could also not treat HIV. The vaccines were however found to be safe and well-tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Scott M.|last2=Sobieszczyk|first2=Magdalena E.|last3=Janes|first3=Holly|last4=Karuna|first4=Shelly T.|last5=Mulligan|first5=Mark J.|last6=Grove|first6=Doug|last7=Koblin|first7=Beryl A.|last8=Buchbinder|first8=Susan P.|last9=Keefer|first9=Michael C.|date=2013-11-28|title=Efficacy trial of a DNA/rAd5 HIV-1 preventive vaccine|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=369|issue=22|pages=2083–2092|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1310566|issn=1533-4406|pmc=4030634|pmid=24099601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4000">The '''Health and Social Care Directorates''' are a set of [[Ministry (government department)|directorates]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. They are responsible for [[NHS Scotland]], as well as policies on the development and implementation of [[Healthcare in Scotland|health]] and [[Social care in Scotland|social care]].

The Chief Executive of NHS Scotland and Director-General of the Scottish Government's Health and Social Care Directorates is Paul Gray.

There is a direct relationship between [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] and the Directorates, but this relationship is not consistent across the Government as there is often no direct read across to Ministerial portfolios from DGs. The activities of these Directorates are under the purview of the [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport]]. She is assisted in this work by the [[Minister for Mental Health]] and the [[Minister for Public Health and Sport]].

==Structure==
The current Directorates are:&lt;ref name=Directorates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/About/People/Directorates |title=Directorates |publisher=Scottish Government| date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Chief Medical Officer''' - Chief Medical Officer: Dr [[Catherine Calderwood]]
*'''Chief Nursing Officer''' - Chief Nursing Officer: Fiona McQueen
*'''Health and Social Care Integration Directorate''' - Director: Geoff Huggins
*'''Health Finance Directorate''' - Director for Health Finance: Christine McLaughlin
*'''Health Workforce and Strategic Change Directorate''' - Director for Health Workforce and Strategic Change: Shirley Rogers
*'''Healthcare Quality and Strategy Directorate''' - Director: Michael Kellet
*'''Performance and Delivery Directorate''' - Director: John Connaghan
*'''Population Health Directorate''' - Director: Dr Andrew Scott

As well as responsibility for the regional health boards of [[NHS Scotland]], the Directorates also have responsibility for:
* [[NHS Health Scotland]]
* [[Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland]]
* [[Scottish Ambulance Service]]
* [[State Hospital]]
* [[NHS24]]
* [[Healthcare Improvement Scotland]]
* [[NHS National Services Scotland]]

There are 6 chief professional officers:&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/About/Structure |title=Health and Social care: About us: How we are structured |publisher=Scottish Government| date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Scottish Executive Health Department''' (SEHD) was created in 1999 from the former Scottish Office Health Department (SOHD) (previously part of the Scottish Office Home and Health Department).  The separate departments in the Scottish Government were abolished in 2007 and replaced with Directorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/1124/0059408.pdf |title=Scottish Government (structure diagram from 2007) |publisher=Scottish Government |date=April 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, the functions of the Health Directorates were taken on by the Health and Social Care Directorates.

The octopus was found off the coast of [[North Wales]] in a [[lobster pot]], and was held in captivity at the [[Blackpool]] [[Sea Life Centre]] in [[North West England]]. His unusual number of arms was not immediately noticed, and appears to have resulted from a [[birth defect|natal anomaly]], rather than a physical accident.&lt;ref name="yahoonews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraphuk" /&gt; Developmental biologist [[PZ Myers]] called the defect "an ordinary sort of error."&lt;ref name="scienceblogs"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hexapus! |date=3 March 2008 |author=[[PZ Myers]] |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/hexapus.php |accessdate=5 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306052332/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/hexapus.php |archivedate=6 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After being taken from the sea, Henry was transferred to the [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]], which, in turn, donated him to the Blackpool Centre, where he was featured in an exhibition entitled "Suckers".&lt;ref name="telegraphuk" /&gt; An aquarium spokeswoman stated that "He's a lovely little thing."&lt;ref name="yahoonews" /&gt;

'''Ibn Butlan''' ({{lang-ar|ابن بطلان}}; 1038,&lt;ref name=cam/&gt; 1075) was an [[Arab]] [[Nestorian Christian]] physician who was active in [[Baghdad]] during the  [[Islamic Golden Age]].

== Early life and education ==
Talacek grew up in [[Clayton, North Carolina]]. He earned his first diving certification while attending UNCW. Talacek subsequently worked in [[construction]]. In 1993 he was hired as an underwater bridge inspector by the [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] (NC DOT) Underwater Unit, gaining experience in underwater construction and [[surface-supplied diving]]. While employed by NC DOT, Talacek earned his Commercial Diving Supervisor certification. He also earned a [[United States Coast Guard]] [[Sea captain|Captain]]'s license and [[Divemaster]] certification. Talacek began running dive charters on weekends from [[Carolina Beach]]. During his last six months working for NC DOT, Talacek served as diving supervisor for a dive team stationed at the [[Outer Banks]].&lt;ref name="AutoBio"/&gt;

== Aquarius ==
Talacek serves as Oceanographic Field Operations Manager at [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius Reef Base]] for the [[National Undersea Research Center]] (NURC). In this position he serves as diving supervisor, Aquarius lead habitat technician, boat captain and Divemaster. Talacek is a certified [[trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] diver, [[emergency medical technician]] (EMT) and advanced diver medic (DMT-A).&lt;ref name="AutoBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoBio 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aquarius.uncw.edu/archive/2002/09_2002/Talacek.htm|title=Aquarius - James Talacek|last=Talacek|first=James|publisher=University of North Carolina Wilmington|date=September 2002|accessdate=March 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121211123837/http://aquarius.uncw.edu/archive/2002/09_2002/Talacek.htm|archivedate=December 11, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first ten-day [[saturation diving]] mission aboard Aquarius in July 2001, Talacek commented, "It's really special to see things that only a small group of people ever get to see. I now understand why everyone on our crew is so anxious to work these saturation missions, because I too am loving every minute!"&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nurc.net/blog/july-2001-saturation/james-talacek-mission-day-5 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222004916/http://www.nurc.net/blog/july-2001-saturation/james-talacek-mission-day-5 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-22 |title=James Talacek: Mission Day 5 |last=Talacek |first=James |date=July 2001 |publisher=National Undersea Research Center |accessdate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a habitat technician during Aquarius missions, Talacek's responsibilities include habitat operations and maintenance, including carrying out dives to maintain the exterior of the habitat. He also monitors [[life support]] systems, communicates with the crew on shore, and acts as a [[divemaster]] for the scientists aboard Aquarius.&lt;ref name="Hab Tech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nurc.net/blog/october-2008-saturation/being-an-aquarius-habitat-technician |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112085920/http://www.nurc.net/blog/october-2008-saturation/being-an-aquarius-habitat-technician |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-12 |title=Being an Aquarius Habitat Technician |last=Prager |first=Ellen |publisher=NURC |date=October 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jefferson Morris Fish''' is a [[professor emeritus]] of [[psychology]] at [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]] in [[New York City]], where he previously served as Chair of the Department of Psychology and as Director of the PhD Program in Clinical Psychology.

==Biography==
Fish was born in [[Manhattan]], the grandson of [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jewish]] immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fish |first=Jefferson M. |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/looking-in-the-cultural-mirror/201201/what-does-it-mean-look-jewish |title=What Does It Mean to Look Jewish? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending his internship year, 1966-1967, at the [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute|Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute]] in [[San Francisco]], he returned to New York to complete his studies during the [[Columbia University protests of 1968|Columbia riots]]. He received his PhD in [[clinical psychology]] from [[Columbia University]] and was a postdoctoral fellow at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]].

Although Fish had begun graduate school with the intention of becoming a [[psychoanalyst]], he did a [[Carl Rogers|Rogerian]] PhD dissertation,&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (1970).  Empathy and the reported emotional experiences of beginning psychotherapists.  Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 35,  64-69.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a postdoctoral program in [[behavior therapy]]. It was during his postdoctoral year that he developed his interests in [[hypnosis]], [[placebo]], and [[paradoxical intervention]]s&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (1973).  Dissolution of a fused identity in one therapeutic session:  A case study.  Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 41, 462-465.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as therapeutic [[Double bind|double-binds]])—leading ultimately to his involvement with [[family therapy]]. In his clinical books and articles Fish viewed therapy as a social influence process, and drew on [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]—-in addition to clinical psychology, [[psychiatry]], and [[social work]]—-as sources for ideas and [[empirical evidence]].

At Stony Brook, Fish met his wife, the African American anthropologist [[Dolores Newton]], who had just returned from her second stint of field work with the [[List of indigenous peoples in Brazil|Krikati Indians]] in [[Brazil]]. Married in 1970, the couple spent the years 1974-1976 as visiting professors in Brazil—including a month with the Krikati. It was there that Fish developed his interests in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (1981).  An American psychologist looks at the human side of Brazilian psychology.  In J. J. Brasch and S. R. Rouch (Eds.)  1980 Proceedings of the Rocky Mountain Council on Latin American Studies Conference.  Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press.  Pp. 220-223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M., Monte Serrat, S. and Tormena Elias, M. E.  (1989).  Thalidomide adolescents and preadolescents in Brazil.  In L. L. Adler (Ed.) Cross-cultural research in human development:  Life span perspectives.  New York: Praeger.  Pp.85-92.&lt;/ref&gt; languages, the relationship between psychology and anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (1995).  Why psychologists should learn some anthropology.  American Psychologist, 50(1), 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (2000).  What anthropology can do for psychology: Facing physics envy, ethnocentrism, and a belief in "race."  American Anthropologist, 102(3), 552-563.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cross-cultural psychology]], and the concept of race in different cultures. He contributed a panel comparing the concept of race in Brazil and the [[United States]] to the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s exhibit "Race: Are We So Different?"

Fish is the author or editor of 12 books, and well over 100 journal articles, book chapters and other works. He is a Fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]] and of the [[Association for Psychological Science]], and is board certified in Clinical Psychology and in Couple and Family Psychology by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]]. He served in a variety of roles on local, national, and international psychology organizations and [[drug policy]] organizations, and on the [[editorial board]]s of eight psychology journals in the United States, Brazil, and [[India]].

==Clinical psychology==

Fish has written widely on [[psychotherapy]] as a [[social influence]] process, on social and cultural factors in therapy, and on [[brief therapy]]—including brief [[Behavior therapy|behavioral]], [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive]], [[Strategic therapy|strategic]], [[Systemic therapy|systemic]], and [[Solution focused brief therapy|solution focused]] therapies, and on the use of [[hypnosis]] in brief therapy. In ''Placebo Therapy'',&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (1973). Placebo therapy: A practical guide to social influence in psychotherapy. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Fish argued that stimulating the client's positive expectancy of change was a primary source of the effectiveness of therapy. Hence, rather than attempting to minimize or control for the placebo effect, therapy should be structured so as to
maximize it. Patrick Pentony's ''Models of Influence in Psychotherapy''&lt;ref&gt;Pentony, P. (1981). Models of influence in psychotherapy. New York: Macmillan. (Especially chapter 4, The Placebo Model, pp. 55-66.)&lt;/ref&gt; presented Fish's placebo model as one of only three models of influence underlying the numerous systems of psychotherapy. (The other two are the resocialization model and the contextual model). Fish's book also stimulated [[Irving Kirsch|Irving Kirsch's]] research on response expectancy theory,&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, I. (1990). Changing expectations: A key to effective psychotherapy. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, I. (Ed.). (1999). How expectancies shape experience. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; in which people's experience—such as becoming calmer or happier—is affected by what they expect to experience.

==Cross-cultural psychology==

Within [[cross-cultural psychology]] his writings have dealt mainly with comparing and contrasting the race concept in a variety of cultures, the race-[[IQ]] debate, and Brazil. Contrary to the folk view of race as a fixed biological phenomenon, Fish argues that people can change their race simply by traveling from one culture to another. What changes is not what they look like, or their genes, or ancestry, but rather the set of cultural categories (folk taxonomy) each culture uses to classify them. Fish's article ''Mixed Blood'',&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M. (1995).  Mixed blood.  Psychology Today, 28(6), 55-61, 76, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; comparing the American and Brazilian conceptions of race, has been anthologized by various disciplines, including history&lt;ref&gt;Levine, R. M.  &amp; Crocitti, J. J.  (Eds.)  (1999).  The Brazil reader: History, culture, politics (pp. 391-394).  Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Spradley, J.  &amp; McCurdy, D. W.  (Eds.)  (2003). Conformity and conflict: Readings in cultural anthropology, 11th ed.  New York: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish was a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in Brazil and [[China]]. He speaks Portuguese, French, Spanish, and German.

==Drug policy==

Fish has contrasted two causal models underlying drug policy. The current view is that drugs cause crime and corruption, and spread disease. As a result, drugs have been made illegal. Drug dealers have armed themselves to combat law enforcement, and an escalating arms race has ensued. Fish has argued that this model is fallacious, and has argued for an alternative model: Drug prohibition causes a black market, and the black market causes crime and corruption, and spreads disease. As a result, drug policy should be aimed at shrinking the black market. To achieve this aim, he has been active in bringing together multidisciplinary, international, and American sub-cultural perspectives on [[drug policy]], and to promoting consideration of a wide range of policy alternatives to the [[War on Drugs]]. He has served as Adjunct Coordinator of the Committee on Drugs and the Law of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York; and his broadening the discussion of policy alternatives has influenced debates in legal and policy circles.&lt;ref&gt;MacCoun, R. J., &amp; Martin, K. (2009). Drug use and drug policy in a prohibition regime. In M. Tonry (ed.), The Oxford handbook of crime and public policy, chapter 20. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aoyagi, M. T. (2004). Beyond punitive prohibition: Liberalizing the dialogue on international drug policy. Journal of International Law and Politics, 37, 555-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==

Since his retirement in 2006, Fish has been involved in writing for a broader audience; and he has published in ''Psychology Today'', ''The Humanist'', ''The Independent Review'', and ''Newsday''. His [[Psychology Today]] blog is "Looking in the Cultural Mirror".

On January 8, 2010, as Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]] spoke on the 15th anniversary of the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), JSI president, [[Joel Lamstein]], appeared as a guest blogger in the Huffington Post. The article, "Re-Discovering U.S. Leadership: An Unlikely Contender,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-lamstein/re-discovering-us-leaders_b_416102.html "Re-Discovering U.S. Leadership: An Unlikely Contender"], January 8, 2010. Accessed 7-23-2011&lt;/ref&gt; highlights issues facing woman around the world—in particular refugees and those displaced—as Secretary Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. government's support for universal access to reproductive health. Lamstein wrote, "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will emphasize the U.S.'s commitment to advancing reproductive health worldwide. There will be strong words and very good intentions. However, what is needed is strong action and the political will to do what it takes to save lives and strengthen communities around the world."

JSI is a managing partner in the Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) project, which is funded by the US government's PEPFAR program. PRI's news radio show ''The World'' featured a story on the 8000-mile journey that antiretroviral (ARV) medication takes from factory to the consumer. Titled "Delivering AIDS Drugs: The Long Journey" and reported by David Baron, the medication is followed from its point of manufacture in India, to the remote village of Grabo in Côte d'Ivoire, where a woman named Grace is anxiously awaiting its arrival. SCMS helps get essential, life-saving medication to people in developing countries who live with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pri.org/theworld/?q=node/22808 "Delivering AIDS Drugs: The Long Journey"]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220130550/http://www.pri.org/theworld/?q=node%2F22808 |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

JSI conducted a study of infections in Massachusetts hospitals, "Hospital Staffing and Health Care-Associated Infections: A Systematic Review of the Literature"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/591696 "Hospital Staffing and Health Care-Associated Infections: A Systematic Review of the Literature"], Accessed: 7-23-2011&lt;/ref&gt; in the October 2008 issue of ''Clinical Infectious Diseases'' (2008; 47:937-44). The article is part of the evidence review that the JSI team has carried out for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Healthcare-Associated Infection project. The efforts are focused on eliminating preventable infections through application of clinical 'best practices' and other incentives across Massachusetts hospitals.

JSI staff co-authored an article in the ''Journal of Public Health Management and Practice'' on the use of computer modeling in emergency preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Abstract/2009/03000/Use_of_Computer_Modeling_for_Emergency.3.aspx Use of Computer Modeling for Emergency Preparedness Functions by Local and State Health Officials: A Needs Assessment], Accessed 7-23-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, as the state recognized the need to adopt modern information technology in medical-records management, it turned to JSI to assist with developing a statewide plan to phase in a standardized electronic system for the state's doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers to use in creating, storing, and exchanging medical records. The plan was submitted to the Connecticut legislature for review by the state's lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?Q=443528&amp;A=3659 Department of Public Health Releases State Health Information Technology Plan], July 17, 2009. Accessed 7-23-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

JSI was founded in 1978, by Joel Lamstein and Bert Hirshhorn.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Since then JSI has implemented projects in more than 100 countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} JSI is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and operates from eight U.S. and 86 international offices, with more than 525 U.S.-based staff, and 1500 host country national field-based staff across five continents.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Fellowships ==
Since 2001, JSI has funded the Mabelle Arole Fellowship, which it founded in collaboration with the [[American Medical Student Association]] in honor of Dr. [[Mabelle Arole]]. The fellowship is named in memory of her dedication to the [[Jamkhed]], India community and her wisdom to work with its members to determine what must be done and how to achieve improved child and maternal health status. This award is given annually to a recent college graduate to study community-based primary health care in Jamkhed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamkhed.org/MAFellowship.shtml Jamkhed Fellowship information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819195427/http://www.jamkhed.org/MAFellowship.shtml |date=2008-08-19 }}, accessed 7-23-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2037">The '''leaning tower illusion''' is a [[visual illusion]] seen in a pair of identical images of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; photographed from below. Although the images are duplicates, one has the impression that the tower on the right leans more, as if photographed from a different angle. The illusion was discovered by Frederick Kingdom, Ali Yoonessi and Elena Gheorghiu at [[McGill University]], and won first prize in the [[Best Illusion of the Year Contest]] 2007.&lt;ref name="BVI"&gt;[http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=114 Best Visual Illusion of the Year contest 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors suggest that the illusion occurs because of the way the visual system takes into account perspective.&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;[http://mvr.mcgill.ca/Fred/Papers/KingdomYoonessiGheorghiu_2007.pdf The Leaning Tower illusion: a new illusion of perspective (Perception)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Leaning_tower_illusion Leaning Tower Illusion (Scholarpedia)]&lt;/ref&gt; When two identical towers rise in parallel but are viewed from below, their corresponding outlines converge in the retinal image due to perspective. The visual system normally "corrects" for the perspective distortion and as a result perceives the towers correctly, i.e. as rising in parallel. However in the case of the two identical images of the Pisa tower, the corresponding outlines of the towers do not converge but run in parallel, and as a result the towers are perceived as non-parallel, i.e. as diverging. The illusion reveals that the visual system is obliged to treat the two images as part of the same scene, in other words as the "Twin Towers of Pisa".

Although the Pisa tower demonstrates the illusion and provides a pun for its name, the illusion can be seen in any pair of (identical) images of a receding object.

'''''Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill''''' is a 2002 book by medical journalist [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]], in which the author examines and questions the efficacy, safety, and ethics of past psychiatric interventions for severe [[mental illnesses]], particularly [[antipsychotics]]. The book is organized as a historical timeline of treatment development in the United States.

''Mad in America'' received positive reviews from the general public and mixed reviews from the medical community, which criticized some bias in sourcing but nonetheless acknowledged the need to address the critical questions raised by the book regarding modern psychiatry.

==Synopsis==

===Part One: The Original Bedlam (1750–1900)===
Part One describes early treatments like a spinning chair which could reach 100 revolutions per minute, the Tranquilizer Chair which immobilized patients, and water therapies.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Robert H. | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill | edition = | language = | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 2010 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 0-465-02014-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–13, 16}} Whitaker then describes [[moral treatment]], dating back to 1793 and the French Revolution and established in the U.S. by Quakers in 1817, in which lay superintendents treated the mentally ill in small homes with great kindness and had good outcomes: About 35 to 80 percent of patients were discharged within a year, the majority of them cured. [[Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital|Pennsylvania Hospital]] reported that about 45 percent of patients were discharged as cured and 25 percent discharged as improved. In [[Worcester State Hospital]], 35 percent were chronically ill or had died while mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|36}} Dr. George Wood, a visitor, reported in 1851:

{{cquote|"...you encounter persons walking, conversing, reading or variously occupied, neatly and often handsomely dressed, to whom as you pass you receive an introduction as in ordinary social life; and you find yourself not unfrequently quite at a loss to determine whether the persons met with are really the insane, or whether they may not be visitors or officials in the establishment."&lt;ref&gt;Morton, ''History of Pennsylvania Hospital'', p. 172, cited in Whitaker, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Part Two: The Darkest Era (1900–1950)===
Part Two describes the rise of [[eugenics]] which did away with moral treatment in favor of [[forced sterilization]] of the mentally ill, and led to newly invigorated fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[neuroscience]] whose experts practiced [[Hypoglycemia|insulin coma]], [[Pentylenetetrazol|metrazol]] convulsion, forced [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock]], and [[lobotomy]].&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

===Part Three: Back to Bedlam (1950–1990s)===
[[File:Chlorpromazine-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Chlorpromazine]], marketed in the U.S. as [[Thorazine]], was first synthesized by [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|142}}]]
Part Three describes the invention of the [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptic]] drug [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine) by [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in France, and its purchase by Smith, Kline &amp; French (today known as [[GlaxoSmithKline]]). The drug "produced an effect similar to frontal lobotomy", according to early reports by the company's lead investigator.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|154–55}}  Whitaker says that pharmaceutical advertising, articles published in the scientific literature, and stories in the media of "miracle drugs" transformed Thorazine into a ''healing'' drug.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|158}}

Whitaker says that marketing money from pharmaceutical companies began to flow to the [[American Medical Association]] in 1951, a year after Thorazine was synthesized, because of the [[Durham-Humphrey Amendment]] to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] which "greatly expanded the list of medications that could only be obtained with a doctor's prescription".&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|148–149}}

In Part Three, Whitaker also describes the American (but not for example British) propensity to classify patients as "schizophrenic", as well as the error (confusion of [[schizophrenia]] with the yet-to-be-discovered [[encephalitis lethargica]]) in the original classification by [[Emil Kraepelin]] which psychiatry chose to not revisit and fix.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|167,169}} Whitaker then describes three pathways that [[dopamine]] may take in the human brain, and quotes first-person accounts of the effects of antipsychotic drugs on individuals.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|162–164,176–187}}

He calls a 1996 ''New York Times'' advertisement by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies a "bald-faced lie": the group sought to say that the cause of psychosis and schizophrenia is an abnormal dopamine level and that their drugs worked by altering the level of dopamine.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|199}} Whitaker then criticizes some American studies, and points out the work of George Crane at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to get [[tardive dyskinesia]] recognized, and he contrasts the dosages that British doctors were comfortable in prescribing (300 milligrams per day of Thorazine) with what American psychiatrists prescribed (1,500 up to perhaps 5,000 milligrams per day).&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|200–202,204–209}}

He sees irony in the fact that ''The New York Times'' reported on Soviet forced use of neuroleptic drugs (which Florida Senator Edward Gurney called "chemicals which convert human beings into vegetables") in "psychiatric jails" but called the same drugs "widely acknowledged to be effective" when reporting on American schizophrenic patients.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|216–218}}

Whitaker describes the demise of modern-day moral treatment in a short history of [[Loren Mosher]]'s [[Soteria (psychiatric treatment)|Soteria Project]], funded by the U.S. while Mosher was chief of schizophrenia at NIMH.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|226}} He attributes the results in a [[World Health Organization]] 1979 study of outcomes for schizophrenia patients (which found better outcomes in undeveloped countries like India, [[Nigeria]] and [[Colombia]] than in developed countries like the United States, England, [[Denmark]], Ireland, Russia, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Japan) to doctors in the developed world who maintained their patients on medications.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|226–229}}

He then describes fifty years of American scientists doing experiments on schizoprenia patients: to intentionally exacerbate their symptoms and study the results. He compares the doctors' behavior, unfavorably, to 1947 after American trials of Nazi doctors ended in the [[Nuremberg Code]] for ethics in human experimentation.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|235,247}}

===Part Four: Mad Medicine Today (1990s–Present)===
Part Four is Whitaker's description of drug trials for the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]]s. He says that many of these trials were stacked in favor of the drug being proposed by eliminating the [[placebo]], or by comparing multiple doses of the new drug against a single, very high dose of the old one.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|273–274}} He says that the pharmaceutical companies and the press used their influence to make claims for these drugs (some claims that the [[Food and Drug Administration]] had explicitly asked them not to make).&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|227}} [[Risperidone]] and [[olanzapine]], for example, were both claimed to have fewer side effects than the first generation of antipsychotics. Whitaker also tells the stories of patients whose deaths were caused by drug trials but were not mentioned to the public.&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|269–272}}

===Epilogue===
Whitaker calls it a type of medical fraud that schizophrenics are told that they suffer from too much dopamine or [[serotonin]] activity and that drugs put these brain chemicals back in "balance".&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|290}} He writes, "Little is known about what causes schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs do not fix any known brain abnormality, nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain function in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms....".&lt;ref name="Whitaker_2010"/&gt;{{rp|291}}

==Reception==

Recognizing Whitaker for marshalling evidence, a reviewer writing for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' thought his hopes for moral treatment were admirable but inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Saltzman, Jonathan|title=How the mentally ill have been treated----and mistreated----in America|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-03-24/entertainment/0203230067_1_insanity-defense-illness-mclean-hospital/|publisher=The Institute for Public Affairs|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=November 8, 2010|date=March 24, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'' both liked the book but wondered why the author didn't mention [[Thomas Szasz]], a critic of psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schlesinger, Judith|title='Mad in America': beware chemistry|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-10/entertainment/0202110268_1_robert-whitaker-mad-treatments|date=February 10, 2002|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pechina, Edit M.|title=The Cuckoo's Nest|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/issue/26/16/culture2.shtml|date=June 7, 2002|publisher=The Institute for Public Affairs|work=In These Times|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarly journal reviews===

Clinical psychologist Claudia Bukszpan Rutherford acknowledged that though the author holds an extreme position, the book's insight into many of the problems of clinical psychiatry over the years has good points: "While at times his lack of editorial restraint actually distracts from his message, and one may not agree with all of his arguments, his topic is a vital one that has needed to be raised for quite some time, and one which will hopefully be a catalyst for further discussion." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Rutherford, Claudia B. |year=2002|title=Review of Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill by Robert Whitaker|journal=Human Nature Review|volume=2|pages=95–98|accessdate=8 November 2010|url=http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/mia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also reviewed in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'', where reviewer Daniel J. Luchins, MD, of the University of Chicago observed the review of scientific literature to be biased at times. Despite this, Luchins concluded the book was of value in highlighting social aspects of treatment in psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Jama&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/23/3149.extract|year=2002|publisher=American Medical Association|work=JAMA|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physician J. van Gijn, reviewing the book for the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]],'' writes that "the book is more of an indictment than a historical account," and starts by pointing out that Whitaker "virtually equates mental illness with schizophrenia; depression and other psychiatric disorders are mentioned only parenthetically." Van Gijn summarizes the pre-1950 coverage of the book without much commentary, but then criticizes the rest of the book. Specifically, he questions Whitaker's assertion that Kraepelin's schizophrenia patients in fact suffered from [[encephalitis lethargica]]. With regard to antipsychotic medication, van Gijn notes that "Although there may be truth in the notion that dosages of antipsychotic drugs in the United States are higher than necessary, the author weakens his position by issuing continuous and unrelenting condemnations (for instance, “The [[Nuremberg Code]] doesn't apply here”), despite a dearth of evidence to support them." Van Gijn then describes Whitaker's attack on the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]] as "simplistic reasoning," and concludes that "Although [Whitaker] is widely read on the subject, the facts are largely arranged to suit his prejudice, especially in the chapters on drug treatment. American psychiatric institutions may have their failings in the current management of patients with schizophrenia, but they deserve better critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Gijn | first1 = J. | title = Book Review Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill by Robert Whitaker. 334 pp. New York, Perseus, 2002. $27. 0-7382-0385-8 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 346 | issue = 26 | pages = 2096 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200206273462620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Clare Mundell, PhD, writing for the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry]]'' said ''Mad in America'' "should be required reading not only for mental health professionals, but also for those who still question whether profit has eclipsed patient care as the primary force in medicine in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mundell, Clare E.|title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill: Robert Whitaker, Perseus, Cambridge, MA, 2002, 334 pp., $27.00.|url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=jaa.031.0581a|year=2003|publisher=Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online reviews===

David Pilgrim, writing "News of scandal is a few decades too late" for ''[[Times Higher Education]],'' focuses on the book's shortcomings, saying, "The semi-academic froth he generates distracts the reader from a legitimate outrage, which is not his alone. It was shared by many others well before 1998" (the year Whitaker began writing on mental health).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pilgrim, David|title=News of scandal is a few decades too late|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=180204&amp;sectioncode=30|date=October 3, 2003|publisher=TSL Education|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physician Larry S. Goldman wrote a critical review of the book in [[WebMD]]'s ''[[Medscape|Medscape Today]]'', claiming that Whitaker "is ready to throw the baby out with the bath water" because ''Mad in America'' fails to acknowledge any [[Schizophrenia#Neural|biological abnormalities in schizophrenia]], while at the same conceding that Whitaker's argument is correct in the sense that the true [[causes of schizophrenia]] are not known. Goldman concludes that the "overheated style" of the book "tends to undermine some of its more important points, such as the unhealthy symbiosis between the US pharmaceutical industry and much of the psychiatric research community and the ever-present miserliness of public mental healthcare systems."&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{cite news|author=Goldman, Larry S., MD |title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill |date=May 13, 2002 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/432570 |work=MedScape Today |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=November 6, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715021226/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/432570 |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rejoinder to Goldman's review, physician Nathaniel S. Lehrman disagrees with Goldman, and writes that "Whitaker is right," and goes on to agree with the main points in the book, namely that [[antipsychotic]] drugs cause [[brain damage]], that despite "psychiatrically produced misconceptions," they "do not fix any known brain abnormality nor do they put brain chemistry back into balance. What they do is alter brain functions in a manner that diminishes certain characteristic symptoms." Lehrman then writes that all the data accumulated on the neurobiology of schizophrenia "has hardly helped patient care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lehrman, Nathaniel S., MD|title=Reply to Dr. Larry S. Goldman's Medscape General Medicine Review of Robert Whitaker's Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436376|date=June 12, 2002|publisher=WebMD|work=MedScape Today|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrman later wrote in the official journal of the conservative political organization the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the ''[[Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons#Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons|Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons]]'' that ''Mad in America'' is "perhaps the most important psychiatric book of the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lehrman, Nathaniel S.|title='Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mad+in+America%3A+Bad+Science,+Bad+Medicine+and+the+Enduring...-a0190198292|date=December 22, 2008|publisher=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons via The Free Library|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Perring, editor of ''Metapsychology Online Review'' and who was impressed by the book, wrote, "Even though Whitaker himself could be accused of being overly critical of psychiatry, his argument against schizophrenia medication is cogent enough to urgently require an answer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Perring, Christian|title=Review - Mad in America - Medications &amp; Psychiatry|url=http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=928&amp;cn=390|year=2002|publisher=CenterSite|work=Metapsychology Online Review|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. Fuller Torrey]] writing for the Treatment Advocacy Center called it "histrionic" and "deeply disappointing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Torrey, E. Fuller|title=A review of Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally |url=http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=621|year=2002|publisher=Treatment Advocacy Center|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physician [[Marcia Angell]], MD, writing a two-part review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''  called this and similar books "powerful indictments of the way psychiatry is now practiced," documenting "the 'frenzy' of diagnosis, the overuse of drugs with sometimes devastating side effects, and widespread conflicts of interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angell, Marcia|title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why? |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/|year=2011|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angell, Marcia|title=The Illusions of Psychiatry |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jul/14/illusions-of-psychiatry/|year=2011|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London '''Medical Research Club''' is a society founded in 1891 composed of scientists and medical doctors carrying out research in all fields of medicine and related disciplines. The purpose of the club is to offer an informal venue in which members can confidentially share their opinion and ideas on different scientific and medical topics. Members include scientists who are working or have actively worked in medical research, in academic and biomedical research institutions or in biotech, largely, but not exclusively within the London-Oxford-Cambridge research triangle. Members of the club, many of whom are within the early years of their independent scientific career, meet five times per calendar year in different venues in London. Three guest speakers are invited by members to present their most recent work and these presentations offer the starting point for an open scientific discussion. Speakers may later be invited to join the club.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The foundation date of the London Medical Research Club coincides with that of the first recorded meeting on 1 July 1891.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wellcome Trust Library Archives: Medical Research Club Minutes 1891-1937 - SA/MRC/1/1&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting took place in the Theatre of the Conjoint Laboratories on the Victoria Embankment, and was attended by 15 people: [[German Sims Woodhead|Sims Woodhead]] (chair), Sidney Martin (provisional secretary), [[Emanuel Edward Klein|Edward Emanuel Klein]], [[Victor Horsley|Victor Alexander Haden Horsley]], [[William Dobinson Halliburton]], [[Charles Smart Roy]], Marc Amand Ruffer, [[Samuel George Shattock]], [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Charles Sherrington]], John Sutton, [[Frederick Walker Mott]], John Wickenford Washbourn, [[Almroth Wright|Almroth Edward Wright]], [[Charles Alfred Ballance]], and [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was during this meeting that the motion to found a Medical Research Club was presented and carried forward.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A provisional list of rules had already been produced by an interim committee, and was reviewed by the members present at the first meeting. The second, third and fourth meetings of the club (on 8, 15 and 22 July 1891) focused on further discussion of the rules, which were finally considered point by point and approved at the fifth meeting (28 October 1891).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first ordinary meeting of the Medical Research Club was held on Wednesday 18 November 1891, when the first two scientific papers were presented: "The Influence of the Kidney on Tissue Metabolism" by [[Sir John Bradford, 1st Baronet|John Rose Bradford]]; and "Concurrent Infection" by [[Emanuel Edward Klein|Edward Emanuel Klein]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Original rules and notable changes&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wellcome Trust Library Archives: The History of the Medical Research Club 1891-1991, ed. L.H. Collier 1992 - SA/MRC/4&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Below are some of the 31 original Rules, as first printed in 1891:

1. This Society is called the Medical Research Club.

2. The objects of the Club are the discussion, and, as far as possible, the demonstration of original work in General and Special Pathological Science, excluding purely clinical observation.

3. The Club shall consist of not more than thirty-five members, all of whom shall be actively engaged in medical research.

4. All communications to the Club shall be absolutely private. Any member who shall publish an account of the proceedings of the Club, shall, ipso facto, cease to be a member of the Club.

11. A book shall be kept in which the qualifications of candidates for election shall be stated by the proposers.

12. The election of new members shall take place annually at the meeting in October.

13. At least seven days before the date of election, the Secretary shall send to each member a printed list of the candidates for election.

14. The election shall be by ballot.

19. The meetings of the Club shall take place six times annually, in October, November, February, March, May and June.

21. The meetings shall take place on Wednesdays and at 8.30pm.

23. At each meeting, one of the members shall, on the motion of the Secretary, be elected to act as Chairman.

24. The Chairman shall direct the business of the meeting.

25. All members shall at the meetings sign their name in an attendance book specially kept for that purpose.

26. Each member may introduce one visitor, whose name shall be sent to the Secretary and announced at the meeting. The member shall be responsible for the observance of the rules by the visitor introduced by him.

The rules of the club have undergone several changes throughout the years, in wording, substance or numbering. Nonetheless, the nature and objectives of the club have not changed, and remain clearly stated in the latest fully revised version of the rules (November 2010).

The original rules 1 and 2 are now combined in rule 1: “This Society shall be called the MEDICAL RESEARCH CLUB. The objectives of the Club shall be primarily social, and include demonstration of original work in General and Special Pathological Science, and the discussion of the same, excluding purely clinical observations.”

The maximum number of Ordinary Members has progressively increased, and different types of membership are accepted, as stated in rule 2: “The Club shall consist of Honorary, Senior, Ordinary and Non-resident Members. There shall not be more than 100 Ordinary Members, all of whom shall be actively engaged in research”.

The process for the election of new Ordinary Members, as defined in the original Rules 11-14, formally remains similar in the current version of the rules. However, nowadays under rule 13 “Every candidate whose name is submitted for election to the Club shall previously have read a paper before the Club, and have been supported by the signatures of two members of the Club.” In addition, rule 15 (“The election shall be by ballot. […]”), is accompanied by a note stating that “In 2009, it has become accepted practice that 10 members’ signatures lead to election of a candidate to membership once the ordinary memberships fall below the maximum memberships’ number. […]”

The time limit for scientific communications was a subject of debate during the first years of the Club. Rule 24 states that “No communication to the Club shall occupy more than 15 minutes in delivery […]. The Chairman shall read this rule at the beginning of each meeting and shall enforce it.”

The main point that “All communications to the Club shall be absolutely private […]” (original rule 4) has been retained in rule 25 of the current list, but a note added in 1934 clarifies that “this rule was never intended to be a secrecy rule. Its prime objective was to enable members to bring forward for discussion unpublished work without incurring the risk of having their results prematurely broadcast. Reading a paper before the Club does not constitute publication. […]”

=== Notable facts and meetings&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
The Medical Research Club has held regular meetings since it was founded, with the exception of two periods of interruption coinciding with the two World Wars. The time and location of the meetings have changed over the years, but they have maintained their nature of informal gatherings in which scientific and medical topics are discussed among colleagues and are often accompanied by dinner.

By 1892, the club was already known outside the United Kingdom, and was invited by the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France to send two representatives to the celebrations for the seventieth birthday of [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]], on 27 December 1892. Two members of the club were also present at the commemoration of the fiftieth year of the founding of the Pasteur Institute in Paris (15 March 1939).

Sir [[Almroth Wright]] gave his first presentation to the club in 1892, discussing alterations to the blood in haemophilia. Wright has been one of the most prominent members of the club since its foundation, and gave numerous communications over the years. In 1946 the club sent a congratulatory letter to Sir Almroth Wright on occasion of his 85th birthday and of the 50th anniversary of the publication of his method for prophylactic inoculation against [[typhoid fever]].

Two of the most notable communications to the club were given by [[Alexander Fleming]]. In December 1921, Fleming first presented his discovery of [[lysozyme]]; then on 13 February 1929 he presented a paper entitled "A medium for the isolation of [[Pfeiffer's bacillus]]", in which he described his discovery of [[penicillin]], and its ability to inhibit the growth of [[gram-positive bacteria]]. Fleming suggested that penicillin could have been used to isolate [[gram-negative bacteria]], such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', which are resistant to the antibiotic. Minutes from the meeting indicate that this communication did not elicit any discussion.

On 14 June 1933, the paper "Propagation in ferrets of a virus obtained from influenza patients" by  Wilson Smith, [[Christopher Andrewes]], and [[Patrick Laidlaw]] provided the first demonstration of the presence of a virus in human [[influenza]].

The first woman to be invited as a visitor and speaker to the club was [[Harriette Chick|Harriet Chick]] in 1909 and 1911. However, the first woman to be elected as an ordinary member was [[Dorothy Stuart Russell|Dorothy Russell]], in November 1947.

Between 1967 and 1969, the club agreed that one meeting each year could be devoted to a specific topic, presented by a distinguished invited speaker in one single lecture lasting 45 minutes. [[Peter Medawar]] gave a lecture entitled “Anti-lymphocyte serum” in May 1967; [[Henry Harris (scientist)|Henry Harris]] discussed “The expression of genetic information: a study in a hybrid cell” in 1968; and [[William Hayes (geneticist)|William Hayes]] presented 'The bacterial chromosome' in 1969. Although members of the club received the lectures with enthusiasm, these mono-thematic meetings did not continue in subsequent years.

[[Alick Isaacs]] presented three papers in 1958, 1961 and 1966 describing his work on [[Interferon|interferon-alpha]], a natural anti-viral molecule that is of major scientific and medical interest.

In 1970, Yvonne Cossart illustrated the relation between hepatitis and the [[Australia Antigen|Australia antigen]], now known as the surface antigen of the [[hepatitis B virus]].

Several members of the Medical Research Club have received honours and prominent positions for their contributions to science and medicine. Eight members have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize]], and nineteen current members are [[Fellows of the Royal Society]].

== The club today ==

=== Meetings ===
The Medical Research Club has had regular meetings since resuming its activity after [[World War II|WWII]]. The meetings are held on Wednesdays, namely the second Wednesday of the month, in February, March, May, October and November. Many of the members who regularly attend the meetings are young, active scientists and clinicians in the early years of their independent research careers; 35 new ordinary members have been elected since 2011. Members are encouraged to bring guests, who are invited to join in the discussions. Guests must abide by the rules of the club, under their host’s responsibility. The location is often, but not always, within the research institution in London where the chairman of the meeting works. The meetings are preceded by a social gathering of approximately 30 minutes during which members can introduce their guests to other members. In the meeting proper, the chairman reads the minutes from the previous meeting, then welcomes the members and announces the names of the guests for the evening. Before introducing the speakers, the chairman reads rule 24 to the audience, to remind the speakers of the 15 minute time limit. Three scientific communications are given by the invited speakers, who then become candidates for membership, and the presentation is opened for discussion. The scientific presentations are followed by a dinner in a restaurant, which provides more opportunities for members and guests to interact.

=== Membership ===
During the meeting, members and guests are asked to confirm their presence by signing the attendance book. A nomination book is also circulated during the meeting with the name of each candidate for membership on each page. Members only (not guests) have the opportunity to support a candidate by signing the relevant page of the nomination book. At the annual general meeting, which is usually held in November, a motion is made for the candidates who have received 10 nominations to be invited to join the club, and the page with their name is removed from the nomination book.

=== Types of membership ===
There are four types of members of the Medical Research Club: Honorary, Senior, Ordinary, and Non-resident. Ordinary Members are elected when, after having presented a paper in front of the club, they receive nominations from 10 current members. The number of Ordinary Members is limited to 100, and all Ordinary Members must be actively involved in bio-medical research and reside or work within a radius of 12 miles from [[Charing Cross]].

An Ordinary Member who has retired from the club may be elected as an Honorary Member. Election must be supported by at least four-fifths of the members present at the annual general meeting.

Ordinary Members can become Senior Members if their membership has lasted uninterruptedly for twenty years, or when they reach sixty years of age.

An Ordinary Member who has served at least one year and resides or is engaged in research work outside the 12 mile radius from Charing Cross can become a Non-Resident Member.

=== Members ===
As of January 2016, the London Medical Research Club counts 83 Ordinary, 31 Senior, 45 Non-Resident (32 Ordinary and 13 Senior) and 1 Honorary Member, representing a total of 21 research institutions, including academia, government and industry.

=== Governance ===
Governance of the club is via an executive committee, led by ‘The Club Secretary’ (renamed ‘The Chair’ of the Medical Research Club in 2014), the Treasurer and six members of the club (who consider club governance and support the chair and treasurer). Each member of the executive committee is nominated and voted annually the annual general meeting.

==== The current executive committee (2018) ====
* Chair – Professor Martin Cranage, St. George's, University of London (SGUL)
* Treasurer - Dr Sandra Diebold, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)
* Professor Charles Bangham, Imperial College London
* Professor Mark Marsh, University College London
* Dr Linda Klavinskis, King’s College London (KCL) (former chair)
* Dr Andreas Wack, The Francis Crick Institute
* Dr Nigel Temperton, University of Kent (former treasurer)
* Dr Michael Skinner, Imperial College London

The '''Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China''' (MOH) was an [[executive agency]] of the state which plays the role of providing information, raising health awareness and education, ensuring the accessibility of health services, and monitoring the quality of health services provided to citizens and visitors in the [[mainland China|mainland]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. In the reforms of 2013 the ministry has been dissolved and its functions integrated into the new agency called the '''[[National Health and Family Planning Commission]]'''.

The MOH was also involved in the control of illness and disease, coordinating the utilisation of resources and expertise where necessary. It also cooperates and keeps in touch with other health ministries and departments, including those of the [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|special administrative region]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200711/09/P200711090220.htm Mainland, HK and Macau enhance co-operation on medical and health fronts ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200410/15/1015124.htm Tripartite senior health officials affirm importance of co-operation and exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200510/21/P200510210105_photo_269130.htm Fourth Joint Meeting of Senior Health Officials of the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).

As part of the [[National Health and Family Planning Commission]] it is now headed by Ms. [[Li Bin (politician)|Li Bin]] ([[Simplified Chinese]]:李斌;[[Hanyu Pinyin]]:Lǐ Bīn). Until 2013 it was headed by the Minister for Health, a position last held by Dr [[Chen Zhu]] (陈竺) who was then the only minister in the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and one of the two ministers who are not members of the [[Communist Party of China]]. He is the chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, one of the "8 democratic parties" of the PRC.

==Functions and responsibilities==
The MOH reports directly to the State Council. Its functions include:

PALS services are therefore not always independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Improving Independent Complaints Advocacy in Health and Social Care: Background and Position Briefing|date=November 2013|publisher=Healthwatch England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offices==

Each [[NHS Trust]] has at least one PALS office, although many have more, with Durham PCT having the largest number: five (albeit four shared with Darlington PCT). An individual PALS office will therefore cover either a Trust, or a geographical area, and there may be more than one possible point of contact.

The '''Royal New Zealand Plunket Society''' was an [[incorporated society]] in [[New Zealand]] until 1 January 2018 when it became the Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust. Plunket provides a range of free health services to children under the age of five with their development, health and wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Plunket. (2016). Plunket.org.nz. Retrieved 15 May 2016, from https://www.plunket.org.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; The Plunket Society mission is "to ensure that New Zealand children are among the healthiest in the world". A lot of Plunket's work is organised by volunteer bases all around New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Who we are - Plunket. (2016). Plunket.org.nz. Retrieved 15 May 2016, from https://www.plunket.org.nz/what-we-do/who-we-are/&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different ways to get involved in the Plunket Society.

The society is most commonly referred to in the community as "Plunket".

From 1 January 2018 Plunket became the '''Royal New Zealand Plunket Trust''' under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957.

==History==
[[File:Hilda Ross and Mrs Gilmer at the opening of the Karitane Fair.jpg|thumb|left|MP [[Hilda Ross]] (left) and Mrs Gilmer, president of the Plunket Society, at the opening of the 1950 Karitane Fair, [[Wellington]]]]
With the motivation to form a 'society' that would 'help mothers and save babies', [[Truby King|Dr Frederic Truby King]] worked on an article focusing on child welfare.&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"&gt;Plunket Society formed | NZHistory, New Zealand history online. (1973). Nzhistory.net.nz. Retrieved 16 May 2016, from http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/foundation-of-the-plunket-society&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting, which led to the founding of the society, was held on 14 May 1907, in Dunedin, by Truby King. King was a medical superintendent and lecturer in [[mental disease]]s. He believed that by providing support services to parents, the society could ensure children were fed on a [[nutrition|nutritious]] diet, reducing [[child mortality]] rates. He also believed that this would improve adult health as the children got older.

Originally called the ''Society for the Health of Women and Children'', the society gained royal recognition and the prefix ''Royal''
in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Otago Daily Times]]'' 1915-06-14, reprinted in '100 Years Ago' column, p.30, 2015-06-15&lt;/ref&gt; Plunket's name derives from an early patron of the Society, [[Victoria Alexandrina Plunket]], mother of eight and wife of then [[Governor of New Zealand]], [[William Plunket, 5th Baron Plunket]].&lt;ref name="PSHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plunket.org.nz/about-us/our-history/ |title=Who we are |publisher=Plunket.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;Sullivan, Jim (2007) ''I Was a Plunket Baby: 100 Years of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society,'' Auckland: [[Random House]] {{ISBN|9781869418984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, the society first opened The [[Karitane]] Home For Babies in [[Dunedin]], and then opened centres in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], and [[Christchurch]]. These centres were used for both training camps for the nurses and for the babies that were failing to flourish.&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/&gt;

The society laboured for many years under the false perception that it was set up to cater only for [[Pakeha|European]] women and their babies; this impression was reinforced by the fact that the [[New Zealand Ministry of Health|Department of Health]] operated a ''Native Health Nurse Service'' specifically for Maori in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;

In 1912, King made a lecture tour on the Plunket Society. In these tours he was highly successful in attracting support for the society, partly because he exaggerated the effect on infant mortality rates.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt; As a result of his tour, 60 new centres opened around New Zealand, each employing a [[nurse]]. The centres were badged as '''Plunket Room'''s, however they are now referred to as Plunket Clinics. King published several manuals, among them ''Feeding and Care of Baby'' (1913), and ''The Expectant Mother and Baby's First Months'' (1916). This latter publication was given to every applicant for a marriage licence.&lt;ref name="PSHist"/&gt;

Mothers were even given practices to inform them of domestic hygiene and mothercraft that were based on King's ideology. They included the regularity of feeding, eating and bowel habits.&lt;ref name="nzhistory.net.nz"/&gt; In [[New Zealand]] the Plunket philosophy become 'parenting lore' and within three decades New Zealand had the lowest infant mortality rate in the world.

==Plunket today==
Many changes have been made to Plunket teaching and organisation over the years. The initial strict parenting regimes have given way to more flexible care and support, and Karitane Hospitals were replaced in the 1970s with Plunket Karitane family centres. 1981 saw the introduction of a car seat rental scheme, and in 1994 a telephone advice service, PlunketLine, was inaugurated. Special training schemes have been initiated for Māori Health Workers to give culturally appropriate guidance where necessary, and Plunket is also seeing an increase in the number of Pacific Island families enrolling.&lt;ref name="PSHist"/&gt;

Today, there are hundreds of centres across New Zealand. The Plunket society is continuing to grow, through the help of technology being able to promote the society.&lt;ref&gt;Plunket near You - Plunket. (2016). Plunket.org.nz. Retrieved 16 May 2016, from https://www.plunket.org.nz/plunket-near-you/?start=900&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just having clinics they have centres/services that help with car seats, they also have Facebook chats online so parents/caregivers can ask questions or simply find an answer.

It consists of the [[water retention (medicine)|retention of water]] during the period of time immediately preceding the menstrual cycle (that is, the latter half of the [[luteal phase]], or the week before [[menstruation]]).&lt;ref name="HornsteinSchwerin2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theresa Hornstein|author2=Jeri Schwerin|title=Biology of Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iD1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4354-0033-7|pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This water retention is most noticeable for its temporary [[mammoplasia|enlargement of the breast]]s, which is often related to breast tenderness.

'''Primary care ethics''' is the study of the everyday decisions that primary care clinicians make, such as: how long to spend with a particular patient, how to reconcile their own values and those of their patients, when and where to refer or investigate, how to respect confidentiality when dealing with patients, relatives and third parties. All these decisions involve [[values]] as well as [[facts]] and are therefore ethical issues. These issues may also involve other workers in primary healthcare, such as receptionists and managers.

Primary care ethics is not a discipline; it is a notional field of study which is simultaneously an aspect of [[primary health care]] and [[applied ethics]]. De Zulueta argues that primary care ethics has ‘a definitive place on the ‘[[bioethics|bioethics map’]], represented by a substantial body of empirical research, literary texts and critical discourse (2, 9, 10). The substantial body of research referred to by De Zulueta (9) has a tendency to be issue-specific, such as to do with [[rationing]](11), [[confidentiality]], medical reports, or relationships with relatives.

Much of the literature on primary care ethics concerns primary care physicians. The term [[primary care physician]] is synonymous with [[family practitioner]], or [[general practitioner]]; meaning a medically qualified clinician who is the first point of access to health care, with general responsibilities which may but do not necessarily include child health or obstetrics and gynaecology. Other primary care clinicians; nurses, physiotherapists, midwives, and in some situations pharmacists may face similar issues, and some (confidentially, prioritisation of patients) may also involve administrative staff. In some [[healthcare systems]] primary care specialists may also encounter many of these issues.

== The place of primary care ethics in bioethics ==
Although the ethical decisions made in [[primary care]] are often as less dramatic than those in high-tech medicine (1), their cumulative effect may be profound (2), because of the vast number of health care encounters which take place in primary care, (approximately 400.3 million in England in 2008 alone (3, 4) ). Each of these involves ethical judgements, occasionally difficult, often straightforward; often deliberate but more often unconscious. Also, since primary care is often the first step in the patient journey, small decisions made then may make big differences later on. Most of the bioethical literature however deals with tertiary medicine, and much less attention is paid to the daily concerns of primary care physicians and members of the primary care team (5).

In countries with well developed primary health care, patients often stay with the same practice for many years, allowing practices to gather a large amount of information and to develop personal relationships over time. Patients often see the same clinician for a variety of problems, at once or at different times. Whole families may see the same doctors and nurses, who may also be their friends and neighbours. These factors affect moral decisions in primary care, and raise ethical dilemmas which might not occur often in secondary and tertiary medical care (6, 7). Moreover, the transfer into the community of services previously provided in hospital (such as specialist chronic disease management and mental health) may lead to the ethical dilemmas arising which were previously only encountered in secondary care (8).

Spicer and Bowman argue that the ‘tertiary’ level ethical problems that dominate so much of the debate about healthcare ethics, such as genetics, cloning, organ donation and research, are experienced entirely differently in primary care. Moreover, what might be argued to be core [[moral principle]]s, such as [[autonomy]] and [[justice]], may be reinterpreted when viewed through the lens of primary care (13). Toon, by contrast argues such re-interpretations are not exclusive to general practice and primary care. Doctors in other specialities (such as psychiatry, rheumatology, HIV medicine, where specialists take primary responsibility for a patient’s health care over a considerable period) may perform what he terms the interpretative function, but when then do so they are acting as generalists and practising generalism (14). The extension of this argument is that it is not just good primary care physicians who are aware of the ethics of the everyday, but good clinicians (15).

== What are the values of primary care? ==
According to Toon (16), doctors in primary care are charged with three tasks:

1. To deliver the best possible, [[evidence based medicine|evidence based medical care]] to patients who have physical or mental illnesses that can be understood and treated or cured within a biomedical framework

2. Insofar as it lies within their power, to help prevent avoidable illness and death in their patients

3. To help those who are or who believe themselves to be ill to cope with their illnesses, real or feared, to the best of their ability and so to achieve their maximum potential as human beings.

The first two tasks largely involve understanding the patient as a [[biopsychosocial|biopsychosocial system]] that the doctor is seeking to influence, whilst the third involves seeing the patient as a fellow human being in need. Reconciling these tasks is not easy.

== Gatekeeping ==
In many health-care systems patients can only see specialists by referral from doctors in primary care, a system which restricts access to secondary care and is often called “primary care gatekeeping”. Although historically in some countries this developed as a mutually beneficial arrangement between specialists and primary care doctors, rather than from a desire to improve patient care, it is widely recognised that it benefits both individual patients and the health care system. Individual patients benefit from having a personal doctor who can integrate their health care and view their problems together rather than in isolation, and who can protect them from over-investigation and over-treatment -which Toon characterises as the 'furor therapeuticus' of specialist medicine (16). Patients as a whole benefit because the system ensures that expensive secondary care resources are spent on those who have the greatest need.

Some people however are concerned that gatekeeping can damage the doctor-patient relationship, since the doctor cannot act solely in the interests of the individual patient (17). Others have questioned whether this is ever possible, even without gatekeeping. Much depends on the system within which gatekeeping operates, and how great the pressures are on the primary care doctor not to refer, and how strong the incentives, personal, professional and financial are for or against referral. All are agreed that “positive gatekeeping” in which doctors are rewarded for encouraging patients to have unnecessary or dubious procedures, as exists in many private systems, is unethical, and that avoiding unnecessary treatment (therapeutic parsimony) is desirable. Heath has pointed out that the primary care doctor has influence over two other “gates” between illness and health, and between self care and professional care (18).

== Certification and confidentiality ==
It is traditional in many countries that primary care doctors issue certificates to allow patients to be absent from work for reasons of sickness. In some countries such certificates are required even for one day’s absence from work, and this can form a considerable part of the primary care doctor’s workload. In other countries these certificates are only needed for longer periods of illness. In either case this can function can pose ethical problems for doctors as they try to reconcile a duty to do the best for the patient, a duty not to lie to employers, and the need to maintain the doctor patient relationship for professional and/or financial reasons.

Many people want information on patients’ health, and are prepared to pay for it. Insurance companies, employers, social agencies such as the police and the courts and many other bodies have interests in the health status of individuals. The primary care physician is often best placed to provide this information, but doing so can pose ethical problems, particularly in respect of confidentiality. Although patients may sign a consent form to allow information to be released, this consent is not always free, since the patient is often in a position where it would be difficult to refuse, and/or it is not informed, in that patients are often given forms to consent to the release of medical records without what this means being properly explained to them. Doctors can face a conflict of interest in this situation, since they can benefit financially from the fees paid for the release of such information. This poses a difficult ethical conflict as the doctor tries to “serve two masters”; the patient who has a right to confidentiality and the employer or other agency that is paying for the information. Confidentiality has been identified as a key concern to general practitioners in the UK and has been described as one way in which they display their commitment to [[Patient-centered care|patient-centeredness]] (19).

== Access and use of time ==
As the first point of contact with health services, primary care doctors have particular responsibilities with respect to access. Patients typically and understandably want to see the doctor of their choice at the time and place of their choosing, without waiting, and for the length of time they feel they require; however it is rarely possible for all these conditions to be met. The decisions that doctors make about how best to reconcile these conflicting demands by appointment arrangements, arrangements for emergency consultation etc. have a strong ethical as well as practical component.

So too do decisions doctors make about the allocation of their time and resources between different problems and different patients. The three aspects of general practice are mentioned above but even within these doctors make choices that are ethical. One doctor may give priority to the care of patients with diabetes, another to women’s health, and a third to psychological problems and so on.

In some countries it is common place for doctors to strike – in others this is seen as unethical. This again depends on the values that doctors espouse, and in this case in particular on doctors' understanding of the nature of the [[Doctor-patient relationship|doctor patient relationship]].

== The doctor, the patient and the family ==
A characteristic feature of primary care is that doctors’ often care for several patients who are related to each other. They also often care for a number of individuals and families who live and/or work in close proximity, and whose lives are intimately related to each other. Particularly though not exclusively in rural areas, the same applies to the doctor and to his staff. This can be a considerable strength of general practice, since doctors gain a fuller understanding of the social context in which their patients live and become ill. It can also pose ethical problems, however particularly in conflicts between duties to different individuals – family members, employers and employees, and even between friends, when the illness of one affects the life or health of another. Confidentiality can also be a problem, as patients may not understand or accept that information given to the doctor by one family member may not be divulged to others.

Respect for confidentiality, and maintaining confidence amongst patients that confidentiality is respected can be difficult not just for doctors but also for other members of their staff in such situations.

== Analysing ethical issues in primary care ==
As in other aspects of applied ethics, different approaches may be used to understand these problems; they may be seen in terms of the [[Deontological ethics|rights and duties]] involved in medical practice, or how to [[Consequentialism|maximise the good]] through the work clinicians do, or in terms of the [[virtues]] needed to flourish as a clinician or a patient. Deciding which moral framework to apply brings primary care ethics into contact with meta-ethics and epistemology. There is increasing interest in the empirical study of primary care ethics, often using [[qualitative research methods]], which raises important [[Metaethics|metaethical]] and methodological questions about the relationship between facts and values.

'''Project ALS''' is a [[non-profit]] organization whose mission is to identify and support leading scientific research toward the first effective treatments and a cure for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. Founded in 1998 by [[Jenifer Estess]], Valerie Estess, Meredith Estess, and Julianne Hoffenberg, Project ALS recruits scientists and doctors to work together — rationally and aggressively — toward a better understanding of ALS and other closely related neuro-degenerative diseases.

== History ==
Project ALS was founded in 1998 as a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] when [[Jenifer Estess]], a 35-year-old New York theater and film producer, was diagnosed with ALS. Historically, scientists working separately on various aspects of the disease conducted ALS research. Project ALS changed that approach by requiring that researchers and doctors work together, share data openly, and meet research milestones.

Project ALS's Research Advisory Board (RAB) brings together accomplished scientists to seek out the most promising research and set the agenda for the entire research field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projectals.org/leadership|title=Leadership|last=|first=|date=|website=Project ALS|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{Original research section|date=March 2016}}

=== ALS in a Dish ===
In 2008, scientists from the Jenifer Estess Stem Cell Lab, [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard]], and [[Columbia Medical School|Columbia]] achieved the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' "Scientific Breakthrough of the Year" by reprogramming motor neurons from a small sample of skin from an ALS patient — a method known as iPS, or [[induced pluripotent stem cell]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1855948_1863993,00.html|title=First Neurons Created from ALS Patients|last=Park|first=Alice|date=November 3, 2008|work=Magazine|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improving Cell Metabolism ===
A cell's inability to metabolize proteins is a hallmark of ALS, [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's]] diseases. The Project ALS team led by researchers at Harvard and the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School|University of Massachusetts]] are studying pathways responsible for poor protein management in ALS.

=== Ocular Motor Neuron Resistance study ===
ALS affects nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the muscles controlling eye movement. Project ALS is driving a six-laboratory study of ocular motor neuron resistance. The goal is to confer resistance upon more vulnerable motor neurons in ALS.

=== Lipids ===
Project ALS researchers at Columbia University have identified distinctive lipid signatures that may lead to early diagnosis and information about disease progression.

'''Psychomotor retardation''' (also known as "'''psychomotor impairment'''" or "motormental retardation" or "psychomotor slowing") involves a slowing-down of [[thought]] and a reduction of physical movements in an individual. Psychomotor retardation can cause a visible slowing of physical and emotional reactions, including speech and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].&lt;ref&gt;Tryon, W.W. 1991.Activity Measurement in Psychology and Medicine. Springer Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; This is most-commonly seen in people with [[major depressive disorder|major depression]] and in the depressed phase of [[bipolar disorder]];&lt;ref name="Buyukdura"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Buyukdura JS, McClintock SM, Croarkin PE| title=Psychomotor retardation in depression: biological underpinnings, measurement, and treatment | journal=Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry | year= 2011 | volume= 35 | issue= 2 | pages= 395–409 | pmid=21044654 | doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.10.019 | pmc=3646325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also associated with the adverse effects of certain drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]].&lt;ref name="Allgulander-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  |last1=Allgulander |first1=C. |last2=Bandelow |first2=B. |last3=Hollander |first3=E. |last4= Montgomery |first4=SA. |last5=Nutt |first5=DJ. |last6=Okasha |first6=A. |last7=Pollack |first7=MH. |last8=Stein |first8=DJ. |last9=Swinson |first9=RP. |last10=World Council Of |first10=Anxiety |title=WCA recommendations for the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=8 |issue=8 Suppl 1 |pages=53–61 |date=Aug 2003 |pmid=14767398|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in an inpatient setting, psychomotor retardation may require increased [[nursing care]] to ensure adequate food and fluid intake and sufficient personal care. [[Informed consent]] for treatment is more difficult to achieve in the presence of this condition.

== Causes ==

* Psychiatric disorders – [[schizophrenia]], severe [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]]
* Psychological disorders – [[eating disorder]]s, [[mood disorder]]s, [[anxiety disorder]]s, etc.
* Psychiatric medicines (if taken improperly or abused)
* [[Parkinson's disease]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthool.com/psychomotor-retardation/|title=Psychomotor retardation|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

Examples of psychomotor retardation include the following:

* Unaccountable difficulty in carrying out what are usually considered "automatic" or "mundane" self-care tasks for healthy people (i.e., without depressive illness) such as taking a shower, dressing, self-grooming, cooking, brushing one's teeth and exercising.
* Physical difficulty performing activities which normally would require little thought or effort such as walking up a flight of stairs, getting out of bed, preparing meals and clearing dishes from the table, household chores or returning phone calls.
* Tasks requiring mobility suddenly (or gradually) and inexplicably seem to be "impossible". Activities such as shopping, getting groceries, caring for the daily needs of one's children and meeting the demands of employment or school are commonly affected. Individuals experiencing these symptoms typically sense that something is wrong, and may be confused about their inability to perform these tasks.
* Activities usually requiring little mental effort can become challenging. Balancing one's checkbook, making a shopping list or making decisions about mundane tasks (such as deciding what errands need to be done) are often difficult.

In [[schizophrenia]], activity level may vary from psychomotor retardation to agitation; the patient will experience periods of listlessness and may be unresponsive, and at the next moment be active and energetic.&lt;ref name="Frith1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher D.

RND proteins are large and can include more than 1000 [[amino acid]] residues. They are generally composed of two [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] subunits (suggesting they arose as a result of an intragenic tandem duplication event that occurred in the primordial system prior to divergence of the family members) each containing a [[periplasm]]ic loop adjacent to 12 transmembrane [[Alpha helix|helices]]. Of the twelve helices there is a single transmembrane spanner (TMS) at the [[N-terminus]] followed by a large extracytoplasmic domain, then six additional TMSs, a second large extracytoplasmic domain, and five final C-terminal TMSs. TM4 governs the specificity for a particular substrate in a given RND protein. Therefore, TM4 can be an indicator for RND specificity without explicit knowledge of the remainder of the protein.&lt;ref name="Nies_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nies DH | title = Efflux-mediated heavy metal resistance in prokaryotes | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 27 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 313–39 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12829273 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RND pumps are the cytoplasmic residing portion of a complete tripartite complex (Fig. 1) which spreads across the outer-membrane and the inner membrane of gram-negative bacteria, also commonly referred to as the CBA efflux system. The RND protein associates with an outer membrane channel and a [[periplasm]]ic adaptor protein, and the association of all three proteins allows the system to export substrates into the external medium, providing a huge advantage for the [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid21692366"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nikaido H | title = Structure and mechanism of RND-type multidrug efflux pumps | journal = Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 1–60 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21692366 | pmc = 3122131 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CusA protein, a HME-RND member transporter, was able to be [[Protein crystallization|crystallized]] providing valuable structural information of HME-RND pumps. CusA exists as a [[homotrimer]] with each unit consisting of 12 [[Transmembrane protein|transmembrane]] helices (TM1-TM12). The periplasmic domain consists of two helices, TM2 and TM8. In addition, the periplasmic domain is made up of six subdomains, PN1, PN2, PC1, PC2, DN, DC, which form a central poor and a dock domain. The central pore is formed by PN1, PN2, PC1, PC2, and together stabilize the trimeric organization of the [[homotrimer]].&lt;ref name="pmid20865003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Long F, Su CC, Zimmermann MT, Boyken SE, Rajashankar KR, Jernigan RL, Yu EW | title = Crystal structures of the CusA efflux pump suggest methionine-mediated metal transport | journal = Nature | volume = 467 | issue = 7314 | pages = 484–8 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20865003 | pmc = 2946090 | doi = 10.1038/nature09395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metal ion efflux (HME-RND) ==
The HME-RND family functions as the central [[Active transport|protein pump]] in metal ion efflux powered by a proton-substrate [[Antiporter|antiport]]. The family includes pumps which export monovalent metals—the Cus system, and pumps which export diavlent metals—the Czc system.&lt;ref name="Moraleda-Muñoz_2010" /&gt;

[[Toxic heavy metal|Heavy metal]] resistance by the RND family was first discovered in ''R. metallidurans'' through the CzcA and later the CnrA protein. The best characterized RND proteins include CzcCBA (Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), CnrCBA (Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), and NccCBA (Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in ''[[Cupriavidus]],'' Czr (Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; resistance) in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]],'' and Czn (Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; resistance) in ''[[Helicobacter pylori]].''&lt;ref name="pmid23578014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Valencia EY, Braz VS, Guzzo C, Marques MV | title = Two RND proteins involved in heavy metal efflux in Caulobacter crescentus belong to separate clusters within proteobacteria | journal = BMC Microbiology | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 79 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23578014 | pmc = 3637150 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2180-13-79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that metal-ion efflux occurs from the [[cytoplasm]] and [[periplasm]] based on the location of multiple substrate binding sites on the RND protein.&lt;ref name="Nies_2003" /&gt;

=== CznCBA ===
The Czn system maintains homeostasis of [[Cadmium]], [[Zinc]], and [[Nickel]] resistance; it is involved in [[Urease]] modulation, and gastric colonization by ''[[Helicobacter pylori|H. pylori]]''[[Helicobacter pylori|.]] The CznC and CznA proteins play the dominating role in nickel homeostasis.&lt;ref name="pmid16790756"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stähler FN, Odenbreit S, Haas R, Wilrich J, Van Vliet AH, Kusters JG, Kist M, Bereswill S | title = The novel Helicobacter pylori CznABC metal efflux pump is required for cadmium, zinc, and nickel resistance, urease modulation, and gastric colonization | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 74 | issue = 7 | pages = 3845–52 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16790756 | pmc = 1489693 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.02025-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CzcCBA ===
Czc confers resistance to [[Cobalt]], [[Zinc]], and [[Cadmium]]. The CzcCBA operon includes: CzcA (the RND family specific protein), the [[Membrane protein|membrane]] fusion protein (MFP) CzcB, and the outer membrane factor protein (OMF) CzcC, all of which form the active tripartite complex, and the ''czcoperon''. Expression of the [[operon]] is regulated through metal ions.&lt;ref name="Nies_2003" /&gt;

== Drug resistance (HAE-RND) ==
The RND family plays an important role in producing intrinsic and elevated multi-drug resistance in gram-negative bacteria. The export of [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] and [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;substrates is governed by the HAE-RND family. In ''E. coli'' five RND pumps have been specifically identified: AcrAB, AcrAD, AcrEF, MdtEF, and MdtAB. Although it is not clear how the tripartite complex works in bacteria two mechanisms have been proposed: ''Adaptor Bridging Model'' and ''Adaptor Wrapping Model''.

HAE-RNDs involvement in the [[detoxification]] and exportation of organic substrates allowed for recent characterization of specific pumps due to their increasing medical relevance. Half of the antibiotic resistance demonstrated in ''[[in vivo]]'' hospital strains of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa|Pseduomonas aeruginosa]]'' was attributed to RND efflux proteins. ''P. aeruginosa'' contain 13 RND transport systems, including one HME-RND and the remaining HAE-RNDs. Among the best identified are the Mex proteins: MexB, MexD, and MexF, which detoxify [[Organic compound|organic substances]]. It is proposed that the MexB systems demonstrates substrate specificity for [[Β-Lactam|beta-lactams]]; while the MexD-system expresses specificity for cepheme compounds.&lt;ref name="Nies_2003" /&gt;

=== ''E. coli'' – AcrB ===
In ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' multi-drug resistance develops from a variety of mechanisms. Particularly concerning is the ability of efflux mechanisms to confer broad band resistivity. RND efflux pumps provide extrusion for a range of compounds. Five protein transporters in ''E. coli'' cells that belong to the HAE-RND subfamily have been classified,&lt;ref name="Anes_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anes J, McCusker MP, Fanning S, Martins M | title = The ins and outs of RND efflux pumps in Escherichia coli | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 587 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26113845 | pmc = 4462101 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the multi-drug efflux protein AcrB, the outer membrane protein TolC and the periplasmic adaptor protein AcrA.&lt;ref name="pmid19026770"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nikaido H, Takatsuka Y | title = Mechanisms of RND multidrug efflux pumps | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1794 | issue = 5 | pages = 769–81 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19026770 | pmc = 2696896 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TolC and AcrA proteins are also utilized in the tripartite complex in other identified RND efflux proteins.&lt;ref name="Anes_2015" /&gt; The AcrAB-TolC efflux system is responsible for the efflux of antimicrobial drugs like [[Benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]], [[cloxacillin]], [[nafcillin]], [[macrolide]]s, [[novobiocin]], [[linezolid]], and [[fusidic acid]] antibiotics. Other substrates include dyes, detergents, some [[Solvent|organic solvents]], and [[steroid hormone]]s. The ways in which the lipophilic domains of the substrate and the RND pumps is not completely defined.

The crystallized AcrB protein, provides insight into the mechanism of action of HAE-RND proteins, and other RND family proteins.&lt;ref name="Nies_2003" /&gt;

=== Multidrug transport (Mdt) efflux ===
Mdt(A) is an efflux pump that confers resistance to a variety of drugs. It is expressed in ''[[Lactococcus lactis|L. lactis]], E. coli'' and various other bacteria. Unlike other RND proteins Mdt(A) contains a putative ATP-binding site and two C-motifs conserved in its fifth TMS. Mdt is effective at providing the bacteria with resistance to [[tetracycline]], [[chloramphenicol]], [[lincosamides]] and [[streptomycin]]. The source of energy for active efflux by Mdt(A) is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="pmid11257023"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perreten V, Schwarz FV, Teuber M, Levy SB | title = Mdt(A), a new efflux protein conferring multiple antibiotic resistance in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 1109–14 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11257023 | pmc = 90432 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.45.4.1109-1114.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes sought treatment in the US claiming that she was unable to get timely treatment in Canada. Holmes sued the Ontario provincial government seeking payment for her medical and travel expenses. She has given testimony before members of the US Congress during a Republican-sponsored hearing about healthcare legislation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/shonarobertsonholmes House Republican Health Care Solutions Group, Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; and has appeared in ads seeking to repeal the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and defeat President Obama in the 2012 presidential election.

The facts surrounding her medical condition are controversial and cannot be independently verified because she has refused to release her medical records, citing her lawsuit. However, the Mayo Clinic, where the surgery was performed, has stated that she could have eventually lost her sight without surgery.&lt;ref name="stjohns"&gt;[http://california.providence.org/saint-johns/services/brain-tumor-center/disorders-and-diagnosis/pituitary-tumors/rathkes-cleft-cyst/ SAINT JOHN'S HEALTH CENTER] (or ''John Wayne Cancer Center'') ''Occasionally, this remnant enlarges to form a cyst.

The Canadian Constitution Foundation sponsored the lawsuit, which also included Lindsay McCreith, a [[Newmarket, Ontario]] resident, who traveled to the United States for timely treatment of a brain tumor.  Her case cited ''[[Chaoulli v Quebec]]'', a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling on direct billing filed by [[Quebec]] physician [[Jacques Chaoulli]]. As of September 2009, the lawsuit was still unresolved.

==Youtube video==

Holmes published a [[YouTube]] video of her appearance on [[Global TV]] in 2007. 
Holmes and her husband have two [[YouTube]] channels (homiemagnum and shonaholmes3) where copies were placed for the Canadian Constitution Foundation.  This group is backing the joint statement of claim, along with Lindsay McCreith of Newmarket, against the province of Ontario.  In 2009, the Holmes story was publicized in the United States debates on [[American health care reform]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Holmes continued to participate in the US health care debate, publishing [[op-ed]]s in American papers.&lt;ref name=Projo2008-07-19/&gt;

==US advertising controversy==

=== 2009 US television advertisement ===
In 2009 her story was presented in a US television advertisement as a cautionary tale of what Americans could expect if they were to adopt a [[publicly funded health care]] system like the [[Canadian health care system]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2009-07-25&gt;

After being told she would have to wait six months for treatment in Canada, she mortgaged her home&lt;ref name=SDUT/&gt; to pay $100,000 for treatment at the [[Mayo Clinic]].&lt;ref name=TorontoStar2009-07-18/&gt; She is quoted as saying the Canadian health care system failed her.

The use of her claims triggered comments from [[Ujjal Dosanjh]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]'s health critic, who called her case "an exception to the rule."
Jim Meek wrote in the ''[[Halifax Chronicle Herald]]'', commenting on the strength of Canadian reaction to the Holmes claims:
:"Holmes attacked our medical system from inside the U.S., which is seen in this country as an act of High Treason."

According to the ''Spectator'', Palmira Holmes was inundated by callers' wanting to chastise Shona Holmes, describing the volume of calls as "like being bombarded". The ''Spectator'' commented that the volume of angry calls Palmira was receiving was consistent with the large volume of comments left on Canadian media websites. {{quotation|"Canadian media websites that have carried items on the ad have registered more than 1,000 critical online comments since Monday. A key area of discussion for critics is whether the facts about Holmes' case are accurately portrayed."}}

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' published a [[letter to the editor]] from another Waterdown resident, who had a true brain tumor. She described the care she received in the Canadian health care system as being of "exceptional quality".&lt;ref name=TorStar2009-07-25&gt;

Her letter concluded with the comment: "I know our health care system works and if Holmes didn't have a problem with her physician what exactly are her motives for taking part in this media spectacle?"

===Democrats Abroad reaction===
The ''Hamilton Spectator'' interviewed [[Kenneth Sherman]], a leader of a group of American expatriates who live in Canada.&lt;ref name=HamiltonSpectator2009-07-23/&gt; According to Sherman, Americans who lived in Canada, and received care under the Canadian health care system, recognized that if her account was accurate, her case was an atypical one. He challenged the accuracy of her account. He said the Americans who were members of his group, [[Democrats Abroad]], received care under the Canadian health care system and were considering sponsoring a counterad to rebut Holmes' claims.

'''Tara Mae Thornton''' is a fictional character in [[Charlaine Harris]]'s ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'' and their television adaptation, HBO's ''[[True Blood]]''.

==Profile==

Tara Mae Thornton is a twenty-something Louisiana native and lifelong friend of the main protagonist, [[Sookie Stackhouse]]. Compiling a description of her character is a complex task because quite a few facts about her changed when her character was brought from page to screen.

The fact that Tara had a neglected childhood is one fact that remains the same, but in the books, we read that both of her parents were abusive alcoholics; on ''True Blood'', the only parent we see and hear about is her mother. The television show also expands Tara's family to include the spared [[Characters of True Blood#Lafayette Reynolds|Lafayette Reynolds]] and his mother, [[Characters of True Blood#Ruby Jean Reynolds|Ruby Jean Reynolds]].

===''The Southern Vampire Mysteries''===
Tara has two siblings, a brother and a sister. They both left Bon Temps and Tara behind as soon as they were able.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Charlaine. ''Dead to the World''. May 2004. Berkley Publishing Group.

She then opens up a clothing store called Tara's Togs, and then briefly dates the vampire [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Franklin Mott|Franklin Mott]]. He soon dumps her and gives her to the vampire [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Mickey|Mickey]] who turns out to be a sadist. The situation with Mickey gets so bad, Sookie and the vampire Eric Northman must take steps to rescue her.

After owning and operating her own business for a few years, Tara becomes ready to settle down. During the events of ''[[All Together Dead]]'', she and [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#JB Du Rone|JB du Rone]] elope. Tara is currently pregnant with JB's twins. She confides this to Sookie, telling her that she did not plan on having a baby, but felt she should try her best and be the great mother that she herself never had. It is [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Claude|Claude]] who reveals that Tara is having twins, a boy and a girl. She later gives birth to a daughter named Sara Sookie and a son named Robert Thornton with help from Sookie. She and JB go through some financial problems after the birth of the twins and JB decides to work as a stripper at Hooligans, a bar owned by Sookie's fairy cousin Claude, to great annoyance of Tara. After [[Dead Ever After (novel)|''Dead Ever After'']] Tara and JB divorce. Tara became very successful in her business and even opened up a series of clothing stores.

===''True Blood''===
{{main|True Blood}}
In the HBO series ''True Blood'', Tara is portrayed by actress [[Rutina Wesley]]. Actress [[Brook Kerr]] was originally cast in the role, but she was replaced after the pilot episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsnG8743oxU |title=First actress to play Tara in True Blood |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, she first appeared in the BloodCopy.com video “Maxine &amp; Tara Thornton interview”.

====Seasons 1 and 2====
In the beginning of the television show, Tara lives with her mother Lettie Mae, who is described as an [[alcoholic]] turned [[fundamentalist]] who brings nothing but misery to Tara's life. As a child Tara would run to Sookie's house to get away from her mother's beatings. It is because of this and the fact that Tara's acceptance of Sookie as a telepath that the two became best friends. Despite enduring years of abuse, neglect, and disappointment from her mother, Tara still cares deeply about Lettie Mae's well-being, however, Tara is a very angry and wounded individual.

Tara leaves her mother's house and moves into Lafayette's home. The discovery of a hidden web cam in his bathroom results in her moving out and into her own apartment. After her mother undergoes an exorcism, Tara briefly moves back in with her, but then Tara is arrested for DUI, so Lettie Mae kicks Tara back out. Tara is later bailed out by the mysterious "social worker" Maryann Forrester and she takes up residence at Maryann's luxurious estate.

Tara and [[Sam Merlotte]], who is Tara's boss, explore the possibilities of a romantic relationship, but it never establishes. Before they can give it another try, Tara meets "Eggs" Benedict Talley, who also lives with Maryann. Sensing that something is not quite right with the mysterious lady, Tara resists the temptation to live with them permanently and moves in with Sookie. However, Sookie goes to Dallas and leaves Tara alone. A vulnerable Tara succumbs to the draw of Maryann and Eggs, but instead of moving in with them, Tara invites the pair to move into Sookie's. Tara and Eggs use this opportunity to get to know each other, and Tara even falls in love with him despite his questionable past. The relationship ends when Eggs is killed by [[Jason Stackhouse]].

====Seasons 3 and 4====
Tara then crosses paths with the [[sociopath]]ic vampire Franklin Mott. Franklin glamours and bites her, kidnaps her and holds her bound in a bathroom and takes her to the [[Mississippi]] mansion of [[Russell Edgington]]. Franklin mixes romantic talk and the prospect of turning her into a vampire with coercive actions, while Tara attempts to [[Stockholm syndrome|soothe him with compliant words, while plotting her own escape]]. She escapes him on her second attempt, and makes it back to Bon Temps, where she seeks help in a rape survivors' group. Franklin confronts her once more in the parking lot of Merlotte's Bar and Grill a few nights later and attempts to kidnap her again. Tara is saved when Jason Stackhouse arrives and kills Franklin.

Jason, the object of Tara's affection since she was a little girl, takes her back to his house to recover. They kiss, but then Jason confesses to being the one who shot Eggs. Tara leaves his place and goes back to Merlotte's where she finds a very angry-at-the-world Sam. The two end up spending another night together, and in the morning Tara feels a little less frayed around the edges. The feeling does not last, however, as Sam decides to reveal his shape-shifting secret to her. She leaves his house and goes back to her mother's house where she finds Lettie Mae in an intimate situation with the Reverend Daniels. It is all too much for Tara, and she leaves Bon Temps for [[New Orleans]], where she changes her first name to "Toni" and finds work as a [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]]-style cage fighter. Tara has also started a [[lesbian]] relationship with another female fighter, Naomi. But Tara eventually returns to Bon Temps and, through her association with the [[Mediumship|medium]] Marnie Stonebrook, becomes entangled in the vampires' battle against [[necromancy]]. Shortly afterward she is seen pushing Sookie out of the way of a [[shotgun]] blast from the gun of Debbie Pelt, but the [[buckshot]] hits her in the side and back of the head and neck.

====Seasons 5, 6, and 7====
After being shot and left for dead, Tara is turned into a vampire by [[Pamela Swynford De Beaufort]] at the request of Lafayette and Sookie. She subsequently attacks Lafayette and Sookie upon awaking, holding resentment that the only people she loved would turn her into her worst nightmare. Pam gives her work at Fangtasia first as a bartender, and later as a dancer. As the fifth season progresses Tara becomes more comfortable with her new life, befriends fellow baby vampire [[Jessica Hamby]], and begins to develop romantic feelings for Pam. During [[Eric Northman]] and [[Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)|Bill Compton]]'s involvement with the Vampire Authority, Tara assists in the murder of vampire sheriff Elijah Stormer. Pam is arrested by the Authority and held captive, being freed when Tara joins Eric, Jason, Sookie, and Nora Gainesborough in the infiltration of the Authority's headquarters. Upon reuniting, Tara and Pam share a passionate kiss.

Tara and Pam are then captured and held in the vampire prison camps, created by Louisiana governor Truman Burrell as part of the state's efforts to control the vampire population. She becomes friends with Willa Burrell, the governor's daughter who was turned by Eric. The group later escapes when Bill breaks into the camp and feeds the vampires his faerie-infused blood, which allows them to (albeit briefly) walk in sunlight.

Tara is killed by another vampire in Episode 1 of Season 7.

Throughout season 7 Tara appears to her mother who is under the influence of vampire blood trying to tell her something about their past. In episode 8 it is discovered Tara had an abusive father who left after a fight with Lettie Mae. During the fight a young Tara pulls out her father's gun and almost shoots him but decides to bury it in the yard resulting in his departure. In the end Tara and Lettie Mae make peace one last time. Tara ask her mother to forgive herself and then "let her go". They share a tearful hug and Tara moves on to the after life but not before looking back at mother one last time.

'''Ten Cent Beer Night''' was a promotion held by [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[1974 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] during a game against the [[1974 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] at [[Cleveland Stadium]] on Tuesday, June 4, 1974.

The idea behind the promotion was to attract more fans to the game by offering 12 fluid ounce (355 ml) cups of [[Low-alcohol beer#Low-point beer|3.2% beer]] for just 10 cents each, a substantial discount on the regular price of 65 cents, with a limit of six beers per purchase but with no limit on the number of purchases made during the game.&lt;ref&gt;Lebovitz, Hal. "10,000 six packs?" ''The Plain Dealer'' June 9, 1974: 2C&lt;/ref&gt;  During the game, fans became heavily intoxicated, culminating in a riot in the ninth inning which caused the game to be [[Forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] due to the crowd's uncontrollable rowdiness and because the game could not be resumed in a timely manner.&lt;ref name=fctrib&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XMUVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3879%2C815477 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Fans cost Tribe forfeit to Texas |date=June 5, 1974 |page=1, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Indians had previously held such promotions without incident, beginning with Nickel Beer Day in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/46972289/ | title = Cleveland Indians Plan Nickel Beer Day in July | first = Hank | last = Kozloski | location = Cleveland | newspaper = [[Mansfield News Journal]] | date = June 27, 1971 | page = 63 | quote = Dime Beer Day was a king-size success in Houston's [[Astrodome]]. Then the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] held a Dime Beer Day and, being the beer capital of the world, it, too, was a smasheroo. Now the Indians are going the Astros and Brewers one better. They're planning a combination Nickel Beer and Helmet Day July 5. That's a Monday afternoon (1:30) single game with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)#Washington Senators (1960–1971)|Washington Senators]]. It works this way: dad can buy a 12-ounce cup of suds for five cents, while junior gets an Indians [[batting helmet]] if he (or she) is under 16. The nickel beer will be available before and during the game behind the centerfield fence and at special stands throughout the stadium, but not at regular concession stands. Helmets will be given away at all gates, and "NO" combination admission is required.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[bench-clearing brawl]] in the teams' last meeting one week earlier at [[Arlington Stadium]] in Texas left some Indians fans harboring a grudge against the Rangers.

In Texas, the trouble had started in the bottom of the fourth inning with a walk to the Rangers' [[Tom Grieve]], followed by a [[Lenny Randle]] single.  The next batter hit a double play ball to Indians third baseman [[John Lowenstein]]; he stepped on the third base bag to retire Grieve and threw the ball to second base, but Randle disrupted the play with a hard slide into second baseman [[Jack Brohamer]].&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{cite news | last = Schneider | first = Russell | title = Rangers top Indians, 3–0| newspaper = [[The Plain Dealer]] | date = May 30, 1974 | page = G1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians retaliated in the bottom of the eighth when pitcher [[Milt Wilcox]] threw behind Randle's legs. Randle eventually laid down a bunt. When Wilcox attempted to field it and tag Randle out (which he did successfully), Randle hit him with his forearm.  Indians first baseman [[John Ellis (baseball)|John Ellis]] responded by punching Randle, and both benches emptied for a brawl. After the brawl was broken up, as Indians players and coaches returned to the dugout, they were struck by food and beer hurled by Rangers fans; catcher [[Dave Duncan (baseball)|Dave Duncan]] had to be restrained from going into the stands to brawl with fans.&lt;ref name=schneider /&gt;

The game was not suspended or forfeited, no players from either team were ejected, and the Rangers won 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1974/B05290TEX1974.htm | title = Texas Rangers 3, Cleveland Indians 0 | date = May 29, 1974 | work = Retrosheet Boxscore | publisher = Retrosheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the game, a Cleveland reporter asked Rangers manager [[Billy Martin]] "Are you going to take your armor to Cleveland?" to which Martin replied, "Naw, they won't have enough fans there to worry about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Braham | first = Jim | title = Here's beer in your eye? Could be for Texas' Martin | newspaper = The Cleveland Press | date = May 30, 1974 | page = E2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the week leading up to the teams' next meeting in Cleveland, sports radio talk show host [[Pete Franklin]] and Indians radio announcer [[Joe Tait]] made comments that fueled the fans' animosity toward the Rangers. In addition, ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' printed a cartoon the day of the game showing [[Chief Wahoo]] holding a pair of [[boxing gloves]] with the caption, "Be ready for anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coughlin | first = Dan | title = Crazy, with the Papers to Prove It: Stories About the Most Unusual, Eccentric and Outlandish People I've Known in 45 Years as a Sports Journalist | year = 2010 | pages = 75–83 | publisher = Gray &amp; Company, Publishers | isbn = 978-1-59851-068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The game==

===Problems from the beginning===
Six days after the brawl in Texas, Cleveland's Ten Cent Beer Night promotion drew 25,134 fans to Cleveland Stadium for the Tuesday night game, twice the number expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lebovitz | first = Hal | title = Where was the warning? | newspaper = The Plain Dealer | date = June 6, 1974 | page = F1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rangers quickly took a 5–1 lead. Meanwhile, throughout the game, the [[inebriated]] crowd grew more and more unruly. Early in the game, Cleveland's [[Leron Lee]] hit a line drive into the stomach of Rangers pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]], after which Jenkins dropped to the ground. Fans in the upper deck of the stadium cheered, then chanted "Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again! Harder! Harder!" A woman ran out to the Indians' on-deck circle and [[Exhibitionism|flashed her breasts]], and a [[streaking|naked man sprinted]] to second base as Grieve hit his second home run of the game. One inning later, a father-and-son pair ran onto the outfield and [[mooning|mooned]] the fans in the bleachers.

As the game progressed, more fans ran onto the field and caused problems. Ranger [[Mike Hargrove]], who would later manage the Indians and lead them to the World Series twice in [[1995 World Series|1995]] and [[1997 World Series|1997]], was pelted with [[hot dog]]s and spit, and at one point was nearly struck by an empty gallon jug of [[Thunderbird (wine)|Thunderbird]].

The Rangers later argued a call in which Lee was called safe in a close play at third base, spiking Jenkins with his cleats in the process and forcing him to leave the game. The Rangers' angry response to this call enraged Cleveland fans, who again began throwing objects onto the field. Someone tossed lit firecrackers into the Rangers' bullpen.{{r|jackson20080604}}

In the bottom of the ninth, the Indians managed to rally, tying the game 5–5, and had [[Rusty Torres]] on second base representing the potential winning run. However, with a crowd that had been drinking heavily for nine innings, the situation finally came to a head.

===The riot===
After the Indians had managed to tie the game, a 19-year-old fan named Terry Yerkic&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4911791/remember-10-cent-beer-night&lt;/ref&gt; ran onto the field and attempted to steal Texas outfielder [[Jeff Burroughs]]' cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Experience: Swiping Jeff Borroughs' cap on 10-cent Beer Night |author=Terry Yerkic as told to Andy Netzel |url=http://www.clevelandmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=586CA122EB394032BD4AA3B686FF03D9&amp;nm=Article+Archives&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications::Article&amp;mid=1578600D80804596A222593669321019&amp;tier=4&amp;id=3FC56F65363641CAB16BD220701C0272 |work=[[Cleveland Magazine]] |date=June 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Confronting the fan, Burroughs tripped. Thinking that Burroughs had been attacked, Texas [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Billy Martin]] charged onto the field with his players right behind, some wielding bats. A large number of intoxicated fans – some armed with knives, chains, and portions of stadium seats that they had torn apart – [[Pitch invasion|surged onto the field]], and others hurled bottles from the stands. Hundreds of fans surrounded the outnumbered Rangers.{{r|jackson20080604}}

Realizing that the Rangers' lives might be in danger, Cleveland manager [[Ken Aspromonte]] ordered his players to grab bats and help the Rangers, attacking the team's own fans in the process. Rioters began throwing steel folding chairs, and Cleveland relief pitcher [[Tom Hilgendorf]] was hit in the head by one of them. Hargrove, after subduing one rioter in a fistfight, had to fight another on his way back to the Texas dugout. The two teams retreated off the field through the dugouts in groups, with players protecting each other.&lt;ref name="jackson20080604"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=beernight/080604&amp;sportCat=mlb|title=The night beer and violence bubbled over in Cleveland   |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2008|last=Jackson|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bases were pulled up and stolen and many rioters threw a vast array of objects including cups, [[Criminal rock throwing|rocks]], bottles, batteries from radios, hot dogs, popcorn containers, and folding chairs. As a result, umpire crew chief [[Nestor Chylak]], realizing that order would not be restored in a timely fashion, [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] the game to Texas. He too was a victim of the rioters, as one struck and cut his head with part of a stadium seat&lt;ref name=tencentbeernight&gt;{{cite web|title=This Week in Baseball History: Ten Cent Beer Night | url=http://coffeyvillewhirlwind.wordpress.com/2006/06/06/this-week-in-baseball-history-ten-cent-beer-night/|publisher=Coffeyville Whirlwind|accessdate=July 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724122809/http://coffeyvillewhirlwind.wordpress.com/2006/06/06/this-week-in-baseball-history-ten-cent-beer-night/|archivedate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his hand was cut by a thrown rock.  He later called the fans "uncontrollable beasts" and stated that he'd never seen anything like what had happened, "except in a zoo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/oconnor/2003-04-17-ian_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Alcohol puts a damper on fun and games | date=2003-04-17 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Joe Tait]] and [[Herb Score]] called the riot live on radio, Score mentioned the security guards' inability to handle the crowd. Tait said, "Aw, this is absolute tragedy." The [[Cleveland Police Department]] finally arrived to restore order.{{r|jackson20080604}}

Later, Cleveland general manager [[Phil Seghi]] blamed the umpires for losing control of the game. ''[[The Sporting News]]'' wrote that "Seghi's perspective might have been different had he been in Chylak's shoes, in the midst of knife-wielding, bottle-throwing, chair-tossing, fist-swinging drunks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neyer | first = Rob | year = 2006 | title = Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | pages = 175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; American League president [[Lee MacPhail]] commented, "There was no question that beer played a part in the riot."&lt;ref name="tencentbeernight" /&gt;

The next Beer Night promotion on July 18 attracted 41,848 fans with beer again selling for 10 cents per cup but with a limit of two cups per person at the reduced price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Campbell | first =W.

==Notable attendees==
Among the Indians players fleeing was outfielder [[Rusty Torres]].  In his career, Torres wound up seeing three big-league baseball riots close up (all of which resulted in forfeits):  in addition to this game, he had been with the [[New York Yankees]] at the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)#Washington Senators .281960.E2.80.931971.29|Senators' final game]] in Washington in 1971, and he would be with the [[Chicago White Sox]] during the infamous [[Disco Demolition Night]] in 1979.

[[NBC]] newscaster [[Tim Russert]], then a student at the [[Cleveland–Marshall College of Law]], attended the game. "I went with $2 in my pocket," recalled the ''[[Meet the Press]]'' host. "You do the math."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jindra|first=Christine|title=Russert returns to Cleveland State for debate|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2008/02/russert_returns_to_cleveland_s.html|work=''Cleveland.com''|publisher=Cleveland Live|accessdate=July 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608135526/http://blog.cleveland.com/openers/2008/02/russert_returns_to_cleveland_s.html|archivedate=June 8, 2009|date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20119">'''Third-hand smoke''' is contamination by [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]] that lingers following the extinguishing of a [[cigarette]], [[cigar]], or other combustible [[tobacco]] product.&lt;ref name=ProkhorovCalabro2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.soncn.2016.05.003 |pmid=27539276 |title=Nicotine and Tobacco Use Prevention among Youth and Families |journal=Seminars in Oncology Nursing |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=197–205 |year=2016 |last1=Prokhorov |first1=Alexander V |last2=Calabro |first2=Karen S |last3=Tamí-Maury |first3=Irene }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''third-hand smoke'' or "THS" is a [[neologism]] coined by a research team from the [[Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center]].&lt;ref name="scientificamerican"&gt;{{cite news |author=Ballantyne C |title=What is third-hand smoke? |newspaper=[[Scientific American]] |date=January 6, 2009 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-third-hand-smoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'third-hand' component of the term is a reference to the remnants on surfaces after "[[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]]" has cleared out. The term ''[[smoke|first-hand smoke]]'' refers to what is inhaled into the smoker's own lungs, while ''second-hand smoke'' is a mixture of exhaled smoke and other substances leaving the smoldering end of the [[cigarette]] that enters the atmosphere and can be inhaled by others; third-hand smoke, by that token, is contamination on the surfaces of objects that remains after the second-hand smoke has cleared.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican" /&gt;

==Biomarkers of disease==
It is important to acknowledge the [[biomarkers]] of third-hand smoke because they indicate the severity and presence of disease. In a recent study involving mice, biomarkers of THS were discovered after four weeks of initial exposure at equivalent levels to those found in homes of smokers. Researchers used a system that mimicked that of the exposure to humans and sought out biomarkers found in serum, liver, and brain tissues in the mice. The mice were then exposed to THS at varying months and at as early as one month, they began to show signs of increased circulating inflammatory cytokines, [[tumor necrosis factor]], [[granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor]], and an increase in the stress hormone [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/CS20171053 |pmid=28912356 |title=Biomarkers of disease can be detected in mice as early as 4 weeks after initiation of exposure to third-hand smoke levels equivalent to those found in homes of smokers |journal=Clinical Science |volume=131 |issue=19 |pages=2409–2426 |year=2017 |last1=Adhami |first1=Neema |last2=Chen |first2=Yuxin |last3=Martins-Green |first3=Manuela }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage from THS exposure continued after two, four, and six months. Such damages included oxidative stress and molecular damage. Some of the mice also became [[hyperglycemic]] and hyperinsulinimic, which could mean that insulin resistance could be a consequence of long-term exposure.&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt; This study implies that increased exposure time to THS can have dramatic effects. Additional studies with human subjects are still needed to fully understand the implications of THS.

==Potential harm ==
Although "second-hand smoke" dissipates from a room or confined space after a short period of time, nicotine and other components of the smoke tend to coat a space's surfaces including exposed skin, hair and clothing and continue to emit toxins.&lt;ref name=scientificamerican/&gt; Third-hand smoke is environmental tobacco smoke that has oxidized with environmental nitrous acid to create carcinogens not seen in cigarette ingredients or tobacco smoke. The chemicals released in third-hand smoke reacts with indoor pollutants to create a toxic hazard to those exposed, especially children. Carcinogenic tobacco-specific [[nitrosamines]] (TSNAs) can be formed when the common indoor pollutant, nitrous acid, comes into contact with nicotine. One TSNA, called 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone, is a potent lung-specific carcinogen ubiquitous in tobacco smoke and smokers' homes.&lt;ref name="fiber"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.4939941 |pmid=26909119 |pmc=4752521 |title=Detection of third-hand smoke on clothing fibers with a surface acoustic wave gas sensor |journal=Biomicrofluidics |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=011907 |year=2016 |last1=Cheng |first1=Chi-Yung |last2=Huang |first2=Shih-Shen |last3=Yang |first3=Chia-Min |last4=Tang |first4=Kea-Tiong |last5=Yao |first5=Da-Jeng }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The carcinogens found in THS are known as tobacco-specific nitrosamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24217845 |year=2013 |author1=Giraldi |first1=G |title=Environmental tobacco smoke: Health policy and focus on Italian legislation |journal=La Clinica terapeutica |volume=164 |issue=5 |pages=e429–35 |last2=Fovi De Ruggiero |first2=G |last3=Marsella |first3=L. T |last4=De Luca d'Alessandro |first4=E |doi=10.7417/CT.2013.1623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done in 2016 to look at how long third-hand smoke stayed in three different fabrics over a timespan of 72 hours and post washing.&lt;ref name="fiber"/&gt;  The three different fiber types included wool, cotton, and polyester. Levels of THS were measured using a self-designed surface acoustic wave gas sensor (SAW)  which measures a frequency change when a compound is laid down on the surface of the sensor. The results of this study found that third-hand smoke  does tend to stay in wool the most right after smoking and polyester the least. Wool had the slowest desorption while polyester had the fastest. Also, the study concluded that even though doing laundry and washing these fibers with detergent was an effective way to get rid of some of the smoke, there was still about an average of 300&amp;nbsp;Hz of THS residue left on all the fibers.&lt;ref name="fiber"/&gt;

A 2010 study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] found that [[nicotine]] residue which coats smokers as well as interior car or room surfaces can react with [[nitrous acid]] present in the air to create [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]], [[carcinogen]]s found in tobacco products.  This was demonstrated by spraying what was termed a "high but reasonable" level of nitrous acid (about 4–12 times the levels typically found in homes) onto cellulose substrates used to wipe the interior of a vehicle that had been heavily smoked in over time.  Similar results were found when cellulose substrates were kept (without wiping) in the same vehicle for three days when smoking occurred.  Ensuring ventilation while a cigarette is smoked does not eliminate the deposition of third-hand smoke in an enclosed space, according to the study's authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0912820107 |pmid=20142504 |pmc=2872399 |title=Formation of carcinogens indoors by surface-mediated reactions of nicotine with nitrous acid, leading to potential thirdhand smoke hazards |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=15 |pages=6576–81 |year=2010 |last1=Sleiman |first1=M |last2=Gundel |first2=L.

A study in 2004 measured the levels of nicotine in dust in the homes of three different groups of families. Homes where parents smoked with children present in the home had the highest levels of nicotine found in dust in all rooms of the house, including the rooms of infants and children. Homes where parents attempted to limit exposure of cigarette smoke to their children had lower levels of nicotine found in dust. Homes that had not been smoked in did not contain any traces of nicotine.&lt;ref name ="clear"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.119-a70 |pmid=21285011 |pmc=3040625 |title=Does the Smoke Ever Really Clear?

== Exposure and health effects ==
Humans can be exposed to THS through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion. There are also many surfaces that can accumulate THS compounds. Common surfaces that humans come into contact with daily include couches, furniture, curtains, and car seats. THS is thought to potentially cause the greatest harm to infants and young children because younger children are more likely to put their hands in their mouths or be cuddled up to a smoker with toxins on their skin and clothes. Infants also crawl on the floor and eat from their hands without washing them first, ingesting the toxins into their still developing systems.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author=Caryn Rabin, R |title=A New Cigarette Hazard — 'Third-Hand Smoke' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 2, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/03/health/research/03smoke.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.1103500 |pmid=21628107 |pmc=3230406 |title=Thirdhand Tobacco Smoke: Emerging Evidence and Arguments for a Multidisciplinary Research Agenda |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=119 |issue=9 |pages=1218–26 |year=2011 |last1=Matt |first1=Georg E |last2=Quintana |first2=Penelope J.

According to a study conducted by Northrup, 22% of infants and children are exposed to SHS/THS in their homes each year, comprising a major proportion of the 126 million nonsmokers exposed to harmful tobacco products annually.&lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/003335491613100206 |pmid=26957657 |pmc=4765971 |title=Thirdhand Smoke: State of the Science and a Call for Policy Expansion |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=131 |issue=2 |pages=233–8 |year=2016 |last1=Northrup |first1=Thomas F |last2=Jacob |first2=Peyton |last3=Benowitz |first3=Neal L |last4=Hoh |first4=Eunha |last5=Quintana |first5=Penelope J.E |last6=Hovell |first6=Melbourne F |last7=Matt |first7=Georg E |last8=Stotts |first8=Angela L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though research is limited, there are many harmful health effects that have been linked to THS exposure. THS has the potential to impair wound healing by altering the body’s natural anti-inflammatory response, remodel respiratory structure due to increased [[collagen]] deposits in airways, and cause permanent damage to [[DNA]]. Other health effects include [[asthma]], increased cough morbidity, and other respiratory conditions.&lt;ref name="wound healing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/CS20160236 |pmid=27129193 |title=Tobacco toxins deposited on surfaces (third hand smoke) impair wound healing |journal=Clinical Science |volume=130 |issue=14 |pages=1269–84 |year=2016 |last1=Dhall |first1=S |last2=Alamat |first2=R |last3=Castro |first3=A |last4=Sarker |first4=A. H |last5=Mao |first5=J.-H |last6=Chan |first6=A |last7=Hang |first7=B |last8=Martins-Green |first8=M }}&lt;/ref&gt; If pregnant mothers are exposed to THS, it can slow fetal lung development in the third trimester. In children, THS exposure has also been linked to [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) as a potential cause factor{{Citation needed|reason=What study was this link found?|date=April 2018}}, and has also been linked to cognitive and memory deficits in growing children.&lt;ref name="hazards"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4081/monaldi.2013.108 |title=Third-hand smoke exposure and health hazards in children |journal=Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease |volume=79 |year=2015 |last1=Ferrante |first1=G |last2=Simoni |first2=M |last3=Cibella |first3=F |last4=Ferrara |first4=F |last5=Liotta |first5=G |last6=Malizia |first6=V |last7=Corsello |first7=G |last8=Viegi |first8=G |last9=La Grutta |first9=S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not these largely theoretical relationships are actually causal in humans at realistic exposure levels remains to be seen.

== Public awareness and solutions ==
Third-hand smoke is a relatively newly postulated concept, and public awareness of it is lower than that of [[second-hand smoke]]. A 2013 study with six focus groups in metro and rural Georgia asked participants whether they had heard of THS, most of the participants had not heard about it and did not know what third-hand smoke was.&lt;ref name="intervention"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/her/cyt056 |pmid=23669213 |pmc=3772331 |title=Third-hand smoke as a potential intervention message for promoting smoke-free homes in low-income communities |journal=Health Education Research |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=923–30 |year=2013 |last1=Escoffery |first1=C |last2=Bundy |first2=L |last3=Carvalho |first3=M |last4=Yembra |first4=D |last5=Haardorfer |first5=R |last6=Berg |first6=C |last7=Kegler |first7=M. C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on THS is growing, but does not compare to the 40 years of research on the effects of second-hand smoke. Yet, it is estimated that 5%-60% of second-hand smoke-related harm may actually be attributable to third-hand smoke exposure.&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; THS poses such a risk because its exposure can linger much longer than second-hand smoke. Third-hand smoke-contaminated surfaces like carpet, walls, and car interiors are also especially hard to clean whereas second-hand smoke can be removed with ventilation.&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt;

Smoking rates in the United States have fallen considerably from a high of 42.4% in 1965 to around 17.8% in 2016. But the downward trend is slowing and it is estimated that 23% to 42% of adults in America with low education or living in poverty still smoke. This exposes millions of nonsmokers, many of which are children.&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt;

Awareness campaigns for THS are steadily growing in number and primarily focus on the health risks for young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising Awareness Of Third Hand Smoke|url=https://quitza.com/awareness/third-hand-smoke|website=Quitza}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study published in [[Pediatrics (journal)|''Pediatrics'']] demonstrated that parents are more likely to attempt to quit smoking if they become convinced that third-hand smoke is harmful to children and are more likely to have smoke-free home and car policies if they are aware of the dangers of third-hand smoke. It was recommended for parents to safeguard their children by ensuring they have a smoke-free zone. One such way recommended for smokers to protect family, friends and others is by smoking outside and showering and changing clothes before coming into contact with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2013-3392 |pmid=24590745 |pmc=3966506 |title=Thirdhand Smoke Beliefs of Parents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=e850–6 |year=2014 |last1=Drehmer |first1=J.

P }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has shown that parents who are heavy smokers (&gt; 10 cigarettes per day) are less likely to believe that third-hand smoke is harmful to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2012.07.020 |pmid=23079177 |pmc=3486922 |title=Pediatrician Interventions and Thirdhand Smoke Beliefs of Parents |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=533–6 |year=2012 |last1=Drehmer |first1=Jeremy E |last2=Ossip |first2=Deborah J |last3=Rigotti |first3=Nancy A |last4=Nabi-Burza |first4=Emara |last5=Woo |first5=Heide |last6=Wasserman |first6=Richard C |last7=Chang |first7=Yuchiao |last8=Winickoff |first8=Jonathan P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-hand smoke is one of the issues promoting indoor smoking bans, especially supported by performers such as musicians, who are forced to bring third-hand smoke contamination into their homes through contaminated instruments and cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160330090403/http://www.healthcarejournalno.com/the-journal/hjno-contents-index/features/2288-clearing-the-air{{full citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy in the United States==

Smoking restrictions have been in place in the US as early as 1975 starting in Minnesota and carrying on with various local and state governments legislating smoke-free or clean indoor air laws. By 1999, all 50 US states and the District of Columbia had some public smoking restrictions. Currently, 26 states have implemented comprehensive “smoke-free” laws that ban smoking in worksites, restaurants and bars and other public areas.&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt;

[[File:State smoke-free indoor air laws in effect for private worksites, restaurants, and bars --- United States, December 31, 2010.gif|thumb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21508923 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6015a2.htm |year=2011 |author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) |title=State smoke-free laws for worksites, restaurants, and bars--United States, 2000-2010 |journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=60 |issue=15 |pages=472–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, while many states have laws in place to ensure smoke-free public areas, children especially receive the majority of their exposure while at home, in private spaces.

A exposure assessment study performed by the Lawrence Berkeley National lab found that 80% to 90% of combusted cigarette nicotine adsorbs into surfaces.&lt;ref name="emission"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9679214 |year=1998 |author1=Daisey |first1=J. M |title=Toxic volatile organic compounds in simulated environmental tobacco smoke: Emission factors for exposure assessment |journal=Journal of exposure analysis and environmental epidemiology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=313–34 |last2=Mahanama |first2=K. R |last3=Hodgson |first3=A. T }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that deposited nicotine may desorb or resuspend from non-cleaned surfaces and adsorb or redeposit elsewhere,&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt; including previously cleaned surfaces.

According to the Americans for NonSmokers’ Rights organization website, “Parents, landlords, business owners and others need to be aware of the health risks of exposure to thirdhand smoke and recognize that eliminating smoking is the only way to protect against tobacco's smoke contamination.” &lt;ref name="quote"&gt;According to the Americans for NonSmokers’ Rights, “Parents, landlords, business owners and others need to be aware of the health risks of exposure to third-hand smoke and recognize that eliminating smoking is the only way to protect against tobacco's smoke contamination.”&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is referred to as the "cessation imperative" in a 2017 paper; the only way to fully protect people from exposure to thirdhand smoke is for smokers to quit smoking because even smoking in places when others are not present can expose people to tobacco smoke contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drehmer|first=Jeremy E.|last2=Walters|first2=Bethany Hipple|last3=Nabi-Burza|first3=Emara|last4=Winickoff|first4=Jonathan P.|date=2017|title=Guidance for the Clinical Management of Thirdhand Smoke Exposure in the Child Health Care Setting|journal=Journal of clinical outcomes management : JCOM|volume=24|issue=12|pages=551–559|issn=1079-6533|pmc=5716630|pmid=29217965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Webster ruling''' is a [[test case (law)|test case]] in association football [[sports law|law]] involving [[Andy Webster]], a [[defender (association football)|defender]] formerly with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] [[football club]] in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [[transfer (football)|transfer regulations]] of [[FIFA]], football's [[sport governing body|governing body]], which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [[Bosman ruling]] of 1995 in its potential significance.&lt;ref name="landmark"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harris | first = Nick | authorlink = | title = Webster ruling sets transfer landmark | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = 5 May 2007 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/webster-ruling-sets-transfer-landmark-447523.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revolution"&gt;{{cite news | last = Spiers | first = Graham | authorlink = Graham Spiers | title = Andy Webster ruling set to herald a revolution to rival Bosman | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | date = 31 January 2008 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3279498.ece | format = | doi = | accessdate =  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="exit-door"&gt;{{cite news | last = Nisbet | first = John | authorlink = | title = Webster ruling opens exit door for 'big-name stars' | work = | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = 21 February 2008 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/webster-ruling-opens-exit-door-for-bigname-stars-784861.html | doi = | accessdate = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players&lt;!--This section heading is the name of a legal ruling and should be in capitals. Please do not attempt to "correct" this. --&gt;===
The regulations which led to the Webster ruling were enacted in response to the [[European Commission]], who in 1998 opined that [[FIFA]]'s then current [[transfer (football)|football transfer system]] served as an obstruction to players' [[freedom of movement]] compared to workers in other industries.&lt;ref name="d-day"&gt;{{cite news | title = Transfer D-day put off | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 6 October 2000 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/959827.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soccernet"&gt;{{cite web | last = | title = EC warns FIFA over transfers | work = | publisher = ''Soccernet'' | date = 19 June 2000 | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/euro2000/news/20000619fifatransfers.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA, and its European governing body [[UEFA]], campaigned for a special exemption for football,&lt;ref name="safe"&gt;{{cite news | title = Blatter: Transfer system safe | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 10 January 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1110566.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="optimistic"&gt;{{cite news | title = Fifa optimistic over transfer talks | work = | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 10 December 2000 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1064846.stm | format = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the Commission threatened to abolish the system, the new regulations were put in place by September 2001. Because of the complexity and potential legal ramifications for players, it was five years before Webster's test case emerged.&lt;ref name="pay-as-you-go"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harris | first = Nick | authorlink = | title = Stars will buy into 'pay as you go' system | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = 13 February 2007 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/stars-will-buy-into-pay-as-you-go-system-436166.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article 17===
Article 17 of FIFA's ''Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players'' is entitled "Consequences of Terminating a Contract Without Just Cause", and is the fifth article of Chapter IV, "Maintenance of Contractual Stability between Professionals and Clubs". It outlines the provisions which apply if a contract is terminated without just cause, and the requirement for the party in breach to pay compensation.&lt;ref name=regulations&gt;{{Cite web | title = Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players | pages = 14, 33 | url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status_transfer_en_25.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it states that any player who signed a contract before the age of 28 can buy himself out of the contract three years after the deal was signed. If he is 28 or older the time limit is shortened to two years.&lt;ref name="tough"&gt;{{cite news | last = Spiers | first = Graham | authorlink = Graham Spiers | title = Celtic get tough over contracts | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' | date = 3 November 2007 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article2797091.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurosport"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacDonald | first = Kenny | authorlink = | title = Webster ruling signals new era | publisher = ''[[Eurosport]]'' | date = 9 May 2007 | url = http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/09052007/58/premiership-webster-ruling-signals-new-era.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 17 was introduced in December 2004, with effect from 1 July 2005.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thomson | first = Ross | authorlink = | title = Playing by the rules&amp;nbsp;— FIFA's regulatory powers | journal = The Journal | volume = | issue = March 2007 | pages = 43 | publisher = [[Law Society of Scotland]] | url = http://www.journalonline.co.uk/Magazine/52-3/1003977.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Webster's transfers===
In March 2001, Andy Webster joined Hearts from [[Arbroath F.C.]] for a reported [[Pound sterling|£]]75,000,&lt;ref name="transfer_75k"&gt;{{cite web | title = Jambos in new move for Webster | publisher = ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' | date = 29 March 2001 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72416176.html }}
&lt;br /&gt;
{{cite web | last = Docherty | first = John | title = Jambos in a Spin for Web Star; Andy snubs United for Tynecastle | publisher = ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' | date = 29 March 2001 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72416184.html}}

&lt;br /&gt;
{{cite web | title = Hearts catch Andy in a Web | publisher = ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' | date = 31 March 2001 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72558981.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a "sell-on clause" which entitled Arbroath to 17.5 percent of any future sum received by Hearts for him.&lt;ref name="mad"&gt;{{cite web | title = Interview with Gary Callon, Club Secretary, Arbroath F.C. | work = The current state of Arbroath FC Ltd&amp;nbsp;— the future is bright | publisher = arbroath-mad.co.uk | date = 8 February 2008 | url = http://www.arbroath-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&amp;id=376419 | quote = Arbroath FC did include a sell on clause when Webster was sold to Hearts for a percentage of any fee received if his registration was transferred while he was still under contract. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played regularly for the next five years, and also played for the [[Scotland national football team]].&lt;ref name=sfa&gt;{{cite web | title = Scottish nation team player details&amp;nbsp;— Andy Webster | publisher = [[Scottish Football Association]] | url = http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/player_details.cfm?playerid=24461}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, [[Glasgow]] side [[Rangers F.C.]] were credited with an interest in Webster, and the player requested permission to speak to them. This was refused, and Hearts told the player he would be part of their squad that season.&lt;ref name="rangers3"&gt;{{cite news | title = Webster keen to talk to Rangers | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 11 July 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4671637.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006 he became involved in a dispute with club owner [[Vladimir Romanov]] after refusing to extend his contract, and was subsequently omitted from the squad for the remainder of the 2005–06 season.&lt;ref name="skacel"&gt;{{cite news | title = Romanov admits Skacel wants to go | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 3 May 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4970138.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivanauskas"&gt;{{cite news | title = Ivanauskas could keep Hearts job | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 5 May 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4976948.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster, who still had a year of his existing contract remaining, then signed for English [[Premier League|Premiership]] club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in August that year.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; The transfer was a protracted affair; it took several months before contracts were approved by FIFA, and the governing body took further time to ascertain if Webster's former club were due any compensation.&lt;ref name="waiting"&gt;{{cite news | title = Fifa allows Webster to join Wigan | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 4 September 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/5233096.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was further complicated by Hearts' initial refusal to release the player from their books as they sought to challenge the decision.&lt;ref name="fight"&gt;{{cite news | title = Webster to fight for Wigan place| publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 29 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/6218221.stm}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the efforts made to sign him, Wigan did not provide Webster with a regular first team place, and in January 2007 he returned to Scotland after Rangers signed him on loan for the remainder of the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref name="checks-in"&gt;{{cite news | title = Webster checks in as loan Ranger | work = | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 5 January 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6236095.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite persistent injuries which prevented him playing, Rangers manager [[Walter Smith]] extended his loan contract to 2008, although a permanent move was not organised until June 2008 as litigation over the Hearts–Wigan transfer continued.&lt;ref name="extended"&gt;{{cite news | title = Webster extends Ibrox loan deal |publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 29 June 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6255574.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transfer"&gt;{{cite news | title = Webster completes Rangers switch | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 9 June 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7443909.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FIFA and CAS rulings on the Webster case==
Hearts had initially placed a valuation of £5&amp;nbsp;million on Webster.&lt;ref name="demanding"&gt;{{cite news | title = Hearts demanding £5m for Webster | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 17 March 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6462949.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because he had served more than three years of his contract he was outside of FIFA's "protected period", and any compensation due to Hearts would, per Article 17, be based primarily on the amount of Webster's salary still outstanding—a figure estimated by Webster's advisors at approximately £250,000.&lt;ref name="landmark"/&gt;

FIFA's transfer arbitration tribunal, the Dispute Resolution Chamber, met on 4 April 2007 and ruled that Hearts were due £625,000, based on Webster's future wages, his earning potential, and the legal costs.&lt;ref name="625k"&gt;{{cite news |title = Webster must pay Hearts £625,000 | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 4 May 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/6526119.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drc"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Decision of the Dispute Resolution Chamber | date = 4 April 2007 | pages = 19 | url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/47936_15014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found Webster guilty of breaking his contract "without just cause", although only on a technicality; he and his [[sports agent|agent]] were late informing the club of his intention to leave, because of confusion over the final match of the season (Hearts had reached the [[2006 Scottish Cup Final]], but the time limit was calculated from the club's last league game, four days prior to the Cup match). For this he was suspended for the first two weeks of the 2007–08 season.&lt;ref name="landmark"/&gt;

Hearts were quick to lodge an appeal against the ruling, disputing the figure which they said had not been unambiguously calculated.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite news | last = MacDonald | first = Kenny | authorlink = | title = Hearts appeal FIFA's Webster ruling | publisher = ''[[Reuters]]'' | date = 25 May 2007 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2519224120070525}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite news | title = Hearts challenge Webster ruling | publisher = ''[[BBC Sport]]'' | date = 25 May 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/6692841.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster had also indicated a desire to appeal, believing the fine against him was excessive.&lt;ref name="625k appeal"&gt;{{cite web | title = Webster may appeal FIFA fine | publisher = ''[[Eurosport]]'' | date = 9 May 2007 | url = http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/09052007/58/spl-webster-appeal-fifa-fine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2008 the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], the highest arbitration authority in sport, met in [[Lausanne]] and clarified the original ruling.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Award&amp;nbsp;— CAS 2007/A/1298/1299/1300 Wigan Athletic FC/Heart of Midlothian/Webster | date = 30 January 2008 | url = http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/sites/CaseLaw/Shared%20Documents/1298,%201299,%201300.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also reduced the compensation due payable by Webster to £150,000.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vindication"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacPherson | first = Graeme | title = Vindication for Webster but a 'dark day' for clubs | publisher = ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' | date = 31 January 2008 | url = http://www.theherald.co.uk/sport/headlines/display.var.2007018.0.Vindication_for_Webster_but_a_dark_day_for_clubs.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions and analysis==
The general assessment from commentators is that the ruling is the most significant since [[Jean-Marc Bosman]] [[Bosman ruling|successfully challenged]] the restrictions on [[freedom of movement for workers]] for footballers in 1995.&lt;ref name="landmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iht-cas"&gt;{{cite web | last = Spiers | first = Graham | authorlink = Graham Spiers | title = CAS issues landmark decision in soccer contract dispute | publisher = ''[[Associated Press]] / [[International Herald Tribune]]'' | date = 30 January 2008 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/01/30/sports/EU-SPT-SOC-CAS-Contract-Ruling.php | format = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also speculation that the days of record-breaking transfer fees may be at an end.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; High-profile players like [[Frank Lampard]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Steven Gerrard]] and [[Wayne Rooney]] have all been cited as examples of players who could either leave their club for a relatively small amount, or increase their contract bargaining power as a result.&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Webster's clause for concern | work = | publisher = ''[[Special Broadcasting Service]]'' | date = 20 February 2007 | url = http://www6.sbs.com.au/epl/index.php?pid=st&amp;cid=83643 | format = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/rooney-could-quit-united-for-only-1635m-2110324.html |title=Rooney could quit United for only £5m |work=[[The Independent]] |last=Harris |first=Nick |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other players have taken advantage of Article 17, including [[Tony Sylva]] and [[Jonás Gutiérrez]].&lt;ref name="sylva"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dieval | first = Pierre | title = ''Tony Sylva et le LOSC dans un incroyable imbroglio juridique'' | language = French | publisher = Lavoisdessports.com | date = 22 July 2008 | url = http://www.lavoixdessports.com/Football/Transferts/Ligue_1/Lille/2008/07/22/article_tony-sylva-et-le-losc-dans-un-incroyable.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Newcastle's Jonas deal in doubt| publisher = Metro.co.uk | date = 4 July 2008 | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?in_article_id=204941&amp;in_page_id=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA were highly critical of the ruling; president [[Sepp Blatter]] said "the verdict in favour of the player will have far-reaching and damaging effects on the game as a whole. [It] is... a Pyrrhic victory for those players and their agents who toy with the idea of rescinding contracts before they have been fulfilled."&lt;ref name="criticise"&gt;{{cite web | title = FIFA criticizes CAS ruling on soccer contract dispute

Conversely, players' organisations were highly supportive of CAS's decision. [[Tony Higgins]], a Scottish representative of international footballers' union [[FIFPro]], said "Article 17 gives footballers the sort of employee rights that anyone else would expect in the workplace",&lt;ref name="revolution"/&gt; while [[Fraser Wishart]], the general secretary of the Scottish players' union who had supported Webster's case, described it as "a new groundbreaking decision enabling players to enjoy greater freedom of employment."&lt;ref name="iht-cas"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6714">In [[health physics]], '''whole-body counting''' refers to the measurement of [[radioactivity]] ''within'' the human body.  The technique is primarily applicable to radioactive material that emits [[Gamma ray|gamma]] rays. [[Alpha particle]] decays can also be detected indirectly by their coincident gamma radiation. In certain circumstances, [[Beta ray|beta]] emitters can be measured, but with degraded sensitivity. The instrument used is normally referred to as a whole body counter.

This must not be confused with a "whole body monitor" which used for personnel exit monitoring, which is the term used in [[radiation protection]] for checking for external contamination of a whole body of a person leaving a radioactive contamination controlled area. &lt;ref&gt;''Operational Monitoring Good Practice Guide - The Selection of Alarm Levels for Personnel Exit Monitors.''  Industry Radiological Protection Coordination Group, NPL, UK, Dec 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Principles ==
[[File:WHOLE BODY COUNTER IS USED TO MEASURE NATURAL LEVELS OF RADIATION - NARA - 547319.tif|thumb|Whole body monitor in use.]]
If a gamma ray is emitted from a radioactive element within the human body due to [[radioactive decay]], and its energy is sufficient to escape then it can be detected. This would be by means of either a [[scintillation detector]] or a [[semiconductor detector]] placed in close proximity to the body. Radioactive decay may give rise to gamma radiation which cannot escape the body due to being absorbed or other interaction whereby it can lose energy; so account must be taken of this in any measurement analysis. 

There are many ways a person can be positioned for this measurement:  sitting, lying, standing.  The detectors can be single or multiple and can either be stationary or moving. The advantages of whole-body counting are that it measures body contents directly, does not rely on indirect bio-assay methods (such as [[urinalysis]]) as it can measure insoluble radionuclides in the lungs.

On the other hand, disadvantages of whole-body counting are that except in special circumstances it can only be used for gamma emitters due to self-shielding of the human body, and it can misinterpret external contamination as an internal contamination. To prevent this latter case scrupulous de-contamination of the individual must be performed first.
Whole body counting may be unable to distinguish between radioisotopes that have similar gamma energies. Alpha and beta radiation is largely shielded by the body and will not be detected externally, but the coincident gamma from alpha decay may be detected, as well as radiation from the parent or daughter nuclides.

== Calibration ==
[[Image:Stand-up_WBC.JPG|thumb|A walk-in whole-body monitor with phantom (mannequin) for calibration.]]
Any radiation detector is a relative instrument, that is to say the measurement value can only be converted to an amount of material present by comparing the response signal (usually counts per minute, or per second) to the signal obtained from a standard whose quantity (activity) is well known.

A whole-body counter is calibrated with a device known as a "phantom" containing a known distribution and known activity of radioactive material. The accepted [http://hps.org/hpssc/N13_35_1999.html industry standard] is the Bottle Manikin Absorber phantom (BOMAB).   The BOMAB phantom consists of 10 high-density polyethylene containers and is used to calibrate ''in vivo'' counting systems that are designed to measure the radionuclides that emit high energy photons (200 keV &lt; E &lt; 3 MeV).

Because many different types of phantoms had been used to calibrate ''in vivo'' counting systems, the importance of establishing standard specifications for phantoms was emphasized at the 1990 international meeting of ''in vivo'' counting professionals held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Kramer and Inn 1991). The consensus of the meeting attendees was that standard specifications were needed for the BOMAB phantom. The standard specifications for the BOMAB phantom provide the basis for a consistent phantom design for calibrating ''in vivo'' measurement systems. Such systems are designed to measure radionuclides that emit high-energy photons and that are assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the body.

== Sensitivity ==
A well designed counting system can detect levels of most gamma emitters (&gt;200 keV) at levels far below that which would cause adverse health effects in people.  A typical detection limit for radioactive caesium ([[Caesium-137|Cs-137]]) is about 40 Bq.  The Annual Limit on Intake (i.e., the amount that would give a person a dose equal to the worker limit that is 20 mSv) is about 2,000,000 Bq.  The amount of naturally occurring radioactive [[potassium]] present in all humans is also easily detectable. Risk of death by potassium deficiency approaches 100% as whole-body count approaches zero.

The reason that these instruments are so sensitive is that they are often housed in low background counting chambers.  Typically this is a small room with very thick walls made of [[low-background steel]] (~20&amp;nbsp;cm) and sometimes lined with a thin layer of lead (~1&amp;nbsp;cm).  This shielding can reduce [[background radiation]] inside the chamber by several orders of magnitude.

==Count times and detection limit==

Depending on the counting geometry of the system, count times can be from 1 minute to about 30 minutes.  The sensitivity of a counter does depend on counting time so the longer the count, for the same system, the better the [[detection limit]]. The detection limit, often referred to as the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA), is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;MDA = \frac{2.707+4.65\sqrt{N}}{ET} &lt;/math&gt;
...where N is the number of counts of background in the region of interest; E is the counting efficiency; and T is the counting time.

This quantity is approximately twice the Decision Limit, another statistical quantity, that can be used to decide if there is any activity present. (i.e., a trigger point for more analysis).

The '''Yaoundé General Hospital''' ('''Hôpital Général de Yaoundé''' - HGY) is a hospital in [[Yaoundé]], Cameroon, established in 1985. 
It serves as a teaching center, and is a reference hospital for other hospitals in the Yaounde region.&lt;ref name="Binder2001"/&gt;

The hospital was designed by the C. Cacoub and Buban Ngu Design Group and built by SBBM &amp; Six Construct. It covers an area of 20,301 square metres and as of 2001 had 302 beds.
The hospital provides medicine, surgery, [[obstetrics]], [[gynaecology]] and [[pediatrics]].&lt;ref name="Binder2001"/&gt;
It is the only hospital in the Central Region with a dialysis center.
However, as of July 2011 patients were being turned away due to shortage of dialysis units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
