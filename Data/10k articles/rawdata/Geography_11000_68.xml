'''Abahlali baseMjondolo''' is a South African social movement.  It is based in the provinces of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and [[Western Cape]] with the bulk of its membership in the former.  The structure of the organisation is centred on open mass assemblies and elected committees at the community level and Annual General Meetings and open committee meetings at the movement level.  The movement also holds a number of rallies, workshops and political youth camps open for all its members to attend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sds.ukzn.ac.za/default.php?2,4,80,4,0 The Work of violence:a timeline of armed attacks at Kennedy Road] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826221439/http://sds.ukzn.ac.za/default.php?2%2C4%2C80%2C4%2C0 |date=2011-08-26 }} by Kerry Chance, School of Development Studies Research Report, 83, July 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=31596 Churches want justice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacklooks.org/2009/04/unfreedom_day_-_iam_not_turning_back_anymore_durban_shackdweller/ UnFreedom Day – “Iam not turning back anymore” Durban shackdweller]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/7230 Abahlali baseMjondolo Youth League Camp Motala Heights 30 - 31 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

The movement claims to have around 25 000 active supporters and 10,000 card-carrying members in over 64 different shack settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/7580 The opening remarks of S'bu Zikode, President of the Abahlali baseMjondolo movement of South Africa,at the Center for Place, Culture and Politics at the CUNY Graduate Center (NYC)], 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abahlali.org/node/7709 ANC Intimidates Witness X, More Intimidation and More Killing in Kennedy Road], 23 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sds.ukzn.ac.za/default.php?2,4,80,4,0 The Work of violence:a timeline of armed attacks at Kennedy Road] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826221439/http://sds.ukzn.ac.za/default.php?2%2C4%2C80%2C4%2C0 |date=2011-08-26 }} by Kerry Chance, School of Development Studies Research Report, 83, July 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of these members are in Kwazulu-Natal.

The '''Alto Paraná Atlantic forests''', also known as the '''Paraná-Paraíba interior forests''', is an [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forests]] [[Biome]], and the South American [[Atlantic Forest]] biome. It is located in southern [[Brazil]], northeastern [[Argentina]], and eastern [[Paraguay]].

==Geography==
The Alto Paraná Atlantic forests are an interior extension of the coastal forests, extending across the southern portion of the [[Brazilian Highlands]]. The ecoregion extends from the mouth of the [[Paraíba do Sul River]] eastward along the Paraíba valley lying behind the coastal [[Serra do Mar]], and further eastward and northward along the basin of the [[Paraná River]] and its tributaries, forming a complex mosaic with the surrounding ecoregions.

[[File:Alto Paraná Atlantic forest.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Alto Paraná Atlantic forests ecoregion (within yellow line).]]
[[File:Anodorhynchus glaucus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Glaucous macaw]], an extinct endemic species formerly of this ecoregion.]]
;States, provinces, and departments
The ecoregion covers portions of the Brazilian states of [[Rio de Janeiro State|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[São Paulo State|São Paulo]], [[Goiás]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Santa Catarina State|Santa Catarina]], and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the Argentinian province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], and the Paraguayan [[Departments of Paraguay|departments]] of Alto Paraná, Amambay, Caaguazu, Caazapa, Canindeyú, Concepción, Guairá, and Itapúa.

;Adjacent ecoregions
The [[Cerrado]] lie to the north and east (in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]), entwining with the Paraná-Paraíba forests in a complex mosaic. The [[Serra do Mar coastal forests]] lie to the south, on the Atlantic side of the Serra do Mar range. The Alto Paraná Atlantic forests wrap around the north, east, and south of the [[Araucaria moist forests]], which cover a higher-elevation portion of the plateau in Paraná, Santa Catarina, and northern Rio Grande do Sul states. The [[Uruguayan savanna]] lies to the south, and to the west lie the [[Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna]] and the [[Humid Chaco]] in Argentina and Paraguay, respectively.

==Climate==
The climate of the ecoregion is subtropical, with {{Convert|1200|to|1600|mm|in}} of rainfall per year. The winter dry season extends from April to September.

==Flora==
The main vegetation type is semi-deciduous forests, akin to the other interior forest ecoregions of the Atlantic forests. Approximately 40% of the trees lose their leaves during the winter dry season.

'''Anne Kelly Knowles''' (born 1957) is an [[United States|American]] geographer and a specialist in [[Historical GIS]].  After teaching for over ten years at Middlebury College in Vermont as a professor of geography, she is now a professor of history at University of Maine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umaine.edu/history/faculty/anneknowles/ Faculty page at U of Maine Dept of History]&lt;/ref&gt;

She received her MA and PhD from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Her first book, ''Calvinists Incorporated  Welsh Immigrants on Ohio’s Industrial Frontier'' examined the influence of immigrants’ traditions and social values on their economic behavior during the industrialization of their new region as workers and investors in Welsh-owned charcoal iron companies.

In 2002 she edited the first book ever published with case studies of the use of [[Historical GIS]] in various disciplines. She was the guest editor of a special issue of the journal ''[[Social Science History]]'' about this field.

Her research has included [[spatial analysis]] of the role of skilled [[ironworkers]] in the transfer of technology in the U.S. iron industry 1800-1868, and the mapping of the [[Holocaust]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4325">[[Image:Phoronid ASlotwinski.jpg|thumb|An example of zooplankton - Actinotroch larva of a phoronid worm, otherwise known as horseshoe worms]] The '''Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder (AusCPR) survey''' is a joint project of the [[CSIRO]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/ Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Australian Antarctic Division,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aad.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division (AAD)&lt;/ref&gt; [[DEWHA]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/ Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts&lt;/ref&gt; to monitor [[plankton]] communities as a guide to the health of Australia's oceans.

Plankton respond rapidly to changes in the ocean environment compared to other marine animals such as fish, birds and mammals, which makes them ideal biological indicators of ecosystem change. 

AusCPR was initiated in 2007 and funding has been secured initially for four years, although it is envisaged that the survey will continue well into the future. 

[[Image:Sahfos cpr.gif|thumb|Diagram showing the CPR]] 
The aims of the AusCPR survey are to: 

* map [[plankton]] [[biodiversity]] and distribution
* develop the first long-term [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] baseline for Australian waters
* document plankton changes in response to [[climate change]]
* provide indices for [[fisheries management]]
* detect [[harmful algal blooms]]
* validate satellite [[remote sensing]]
* initialise and test [[ecosystem models]]

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Aus CPR Routes.jpg|thumb|The AusCPR survey will initially operate two routes in Australian waters]] --&gt;The AusCPR survey uses the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] (CPR), a device developed by pioneering British marine biologist [[Sir Alister Hardy]]. In 1931, this device formed the basis of the ongoing CPR survey of the [[North Atlantic]]. This survey is one of the longest running marine biological surveys in the world, and many climate related changes in the plankton have been observed over the past 70 years. 

The design of the CPR has remained fundamentally unchanged over time as the simple yet robust design is a key to its success as an effective plankton sampler. The key to its success as a frequent basin-scale sampler is that the device is towed behind ships of opportunity (SOOPs) unaccompanied by scientists or research staff, making it a cost-effective sampling platform. The CPR is towed at about 10 metres below the surface and for about 450 nautical miles (830&amp;nbsp;km) per ‘tow’. The plankton enters a small opening in the device and is trapped and preserved between two layers of silk mesh. In the laboratory the silk is unrolled and phytoplankton and zooplankton are counted and identified.

Data generated by the survey will be made freely available according to the  Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)]  &lt;ref&gt;http://imos.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt; data policy and will provide researchers and policy makers with environmental and climatic indicators on harmful algal blooms, eutrophication, pollution, climate change and fisheries. 

The AusCPR survey will collaborate with sister surveys, the [[SCAR Southern Ocean Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey]] and the [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] in the North Atlantic.

The '''''Desert Breath''''', located in the [[Egypt]]ian desert near [[Hurghada]] on the [[Red Sea]] coast, is a double-[[spiral]] work of [[land art]].

It was created by the D.A.ST. Arteam, a group made up of three Greek artists - [[Danae Stratou]], sculptor, [[Alexandra Stratou]], industrial designer, and [[Stella Constantinides]], architect. The work, completed on March 7, 1997, covers an area of about 10 hectares (25 acres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/02/desert-breath-a-monumental-land-art-installation-in-the-sahara-desert/ Desert Breath: A Monumental Land Art Installation in the Sahara Desert]&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 89 protruding cones of gradually increasing size set in a spiral and another 89 depressed (incised) cones set in spirals. The sand dug out from the depressed cones was used to create the protruding cones, resulting in the displacement of 8000 cubic meters (10500 cubic yards) of sand.  At the center of the art piece used to be a body of water 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter which has since evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is this an alien landing site, ancient monument, or something else?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/14/world/africa/alien-landing-site-desert/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The artwork is subject to natural erosion and in due course the area will revert to original desert plain. It is viewable by satellite pictures via [[Google Earth]].

==Intention of the Project==
The artists have stated that the project was meant to suggest an experience of infinity with the desert as a landscape of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danaestratou.com/projects/exterior/desert-breath] Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though it is in a state of slow disintegration, Desert Breath is still viewable two decades after its creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/02/desert-breath-a-monumental-land-art-installation-in-the-sahara-desert/ Desert Breath: A Monumental Land Art Installation in the Sahara Desert]&lt;/ref&gt;  Through its slow disintegration, the installation has been seen as an instrument to measure the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipedia.org/landscape/desertbreath Desert Breath — archipedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

EJF's core tenet, as set out in its Mission Statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page476.html Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807143929/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page476.html |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the injustices suffered by people living in [[poverty|poor]] and [[disenfranchised]] communities are often closely related to the [[environmental destruction|destruction]], [[over-exploitation]] and other abuses of the local natural environment these people depend on.

EJF makes direct links between&lt;ref name="EJF Website: About Us"/&gt; the western world's demands for [[cheap food]] and other goods, especially fish, shrimp and cotton and [[environmental degradation|degraded natural environments]] in developing countries.

In seeking to resolve environmental and human rights abuses, EJF works to give an international voice to vulnerable communities working to protect the local environment that sustains their basic human [[need]]s of a shelter, food and income.

Its work covers five main campaigning areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejfoundation.org/page80.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625131400/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page80.html |archivedate=2011-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated' fishing ([[IUU]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page261.html Pirate Fishing and Bycatch: Save the Sea campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726024836/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page261.html |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pesticide use;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page241.html End of the Road for endosulfan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628094229/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page241.html |date=2011-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cotton production;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page141.html Pick Your Cotton Carefully campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727153618/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page141.html |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[shrimp farming]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page211.html Shrimp campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722010636/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page211.html |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[climate refugee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page578.html A campaign for Climate Refugees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727160729/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page578.html |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EJF has also campaigned on the issue of the trade in wild animals with NGO partner [[WildAid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html An Illegal Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194512/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html |date=2011-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the Environmental Justice Foundation's work involves training&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page191.html Activist Training Manuals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528175021/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page191.html |date=2011-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and equipping affected environmental justice communities in producer countries to investigate, record and expose abuses and then campaign effectively for an equitable resolution to the issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page124.html "Training to Protect the Environment: An active program to combat environmental and human rights abuses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163325/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page124.html |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasis is placed on the power of film,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vimeo.com/ejfoundation Vimeo EJF Page]&lt;/ref&gt; both to record irrefutable evidence of environmental injustice and to create strong campaigning messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf Impact Report 2008-2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034300/http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sees its role as a catalyst working to achieve long-term change,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf Impact Report 2008-2009 p5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034300/http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by alerting governments, international policy makers, consumers and businesses to the damaging human and environmental effects that western demand has on the natural environment and local communities, primarily in the global south. EJF aims to encourage action from key decision-makers in business and politics, along with individual action from consumers and concerned individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf Impact Report 2008-2009 p7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034300/http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Environmental Justice Foundation was founded in London, UK in 2000 and became a Registered [[Charitable organization|Charity]] in August 2001 by Steve Trent and Juliette Williams. EJF's creation was a response to the [[human suffering]] and [[environmental degradation]] that its founders witnessed in their work as environmental campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report.pdf EJF Impact Report 2000-2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034443/http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experience had led both founders to conclude that the basic [[human rights]] of people in the world's poorest countries often depend on those people's access to a [[healthy environment]] for food, [[shelter (building)|shelter]] and a means to make a living.

EJF undertook its first campaign in 2001: defending a community's fishing rights in Cambodia. As a result of training and documentation programmes, a national network – the Fisheries Action Coalition Team – was founded. The Fisheries Action Coalition Team is a coalition of NGO consisting 12 NGOs, both local and international,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forumsyd.org/templates/FS_ArticleTypeA.aspx?id=3694 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318040215/https://www.forumsyd.org/templates/FS_ArticleTypeA.aspx?id=3694 |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was localised from NGO Forum. A campaign report called Feast or Famine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/feast_or_famine.pdf Feast or Famine: Solutions to Cambodia's Fisheries Conflict] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034543/http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/feast_or_famine.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was produced and presented to policymakers at a meeting hosted by the British Ambassador to Cambodia, proving to be a catalyst for the issue in the country as well as securing international support.

EJF expanded its work to encompass the pesticide [[endosulfan]] (2002), trafficking of  [[wildlife]] (2003), shrimp trawling and [[shrimp farming]] (2003), illegal, unreported and unregulated [[IUU]] fishing (2004), cotton production (2004) and climate refugees (2009).

==Areas of work and EJF's approach==

According to the Impact Report 2008/09, the Environmental Justice Foundation pursues its goals through: investigation, campaigns, aiding grassroots action by communities in producer countries and catalysing consumer, business and governmental action internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf EJF Impact Report 2000-2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034300/http://www.ejfoundation.org/pdf/impact_report_10_web.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It sends its own reporters to investigate, document and compile reports of environmental and human rights abuses in the Global South. It also works on the ground to help train local groups in effective investigative and reporting  techniques to publicise abuses in their area and then advocate on those issues nationally and globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page124.html Activist Training Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163325/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page124.html |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EJF's work often takes it into partnership with other NGOs, national governments  and international bodies, businesses and corporations. It works with celebrity ambassadors to publicise its campaigns including its Patrons – artist [[Rachel Whiteread]], actress [[Emilia Fox]], writer [[Iain Banks]], explorer [[Benedict Allen]] and model, actress and activist [[Lily Cole]]. Nobel Prize-winner [[Harold Pinter]], CH, CBE was an EJF Patron from 2003 to 2008.

==Campaigns==
{{Empty section|date=January 2012}}

EJF campaigns directly at policy-makers including the European Commission, Parliament and United Nations organisations. In January 2011 EJF presented a petition of 10,000 signatures to the UN in 2011 calling for a Global Record on Fishing Vessels.&lt;ref name="care2"&gt;[http://www.care2.com/causes/the-end-of-the-road-for-endosulfan.html#ixzz1QTgbvejX Care2 News: May 5th 2011 End of the Road for Endosulfan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Road for Endosulfan==

One of EJF's first programs was its campaign for national and ultimately a global ban on the manufacture and use of chemical pesticide [[endosulfan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page241.html What's Your Poison?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628094229/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page241.html |date=2011-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Categorized by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] as a ‘highly hazardous' substance, endosulfan has been compared to [[DDT]] in its potential for environmental harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeonline.com/research/article/13556 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928155252/http://www.landscapeonline.com/research/article/13556 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EJF points out that pesticides such as endosulfan, that are banned or restricted in the EU, the US and other developed nations, are widely used in developing countries, where their harmful potential can be exacerbated by low levels safety awareness, inadequate labeling, illiteracy and poor access to safety equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html Endosulfan: A deadly chemical] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219205051/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endosulfan is readily absorbed by humans via the stomach, lungs and skin&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbtvlive.com/News-Bengaluru/latest-news-ban%20endosulfan-events-07-jun-2011-bangalore-nimma%20bengaluru-19933.html NB TV Live – Latest News Ban Endosulfan ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326135201/http://nbtvlive.com/News-Bengaluru/latest-news-ban%20endosulfan-events-07-jun-2011-bangalore-nimma%20bengaluru-19933.html |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it can cause hormone disruption as well as being a [[neurotoxin]], haematoxin and [[nephrotoxin]].

During its investigations, EJF has documented in a series of reports&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbtvlive.com/News-Bengaluru/latest-news-ban%20endosulfan-events-07-jun-2011-bangalore-nimma%20bengaluru-19933.html Reports on pesticides and human health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326135201/http://nbtvlive.com/News-Bengaluru/latest-news-ban%20endosulfan-events-07-jun-2011-bangalore-nimma%20bengaluru-19933.html |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of acute medical symptoms linked to endosulfan among farmers and local populations. These symptoms include headache, nausea, breathing problems, renal problems, loss of consciousness, and seizures; numerous fatalities have been documented, particularly in West Africa 
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getipm.com/articles/benin-deaths.htm Endosulfan deaths and poisonings in Benin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its reports EJF has expressed concern that, like DDT, endosulfan is persistent in the environment, where it is harmful to mammals, fish, bees, birds and other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/poprc%20documents/endosulfan%20fact%20sheet%20pan%20europe.pdf Pesticide Action Network Fact Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002010048/http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/poprc%20documents/endosulfan%20fact%20sheet%20pan%20europe.pdf |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endosulfan use has led to the pollution and abandonment of agricultural land&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?st06032  Surfactants enhanced recovery of endosulfan from contaminated soil]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been shown to bioaccumulate and travel long distances through air and water. In 2009 the Stockholm Convention's Scientific Committee acknowledged endosulfan as being a persistent organic pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemicalwatch.com/7317/delegates-agree-endosulfan-ban-under-stockholm-convention Chemical Watch: Delegates agree endosulfan ban under Stockholm Convention ]&lt;/ref&gt;

EJF began documenting the use of endosulfan in Cambodia in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page242.html Cambodia Summary ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817162620/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page242.html |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a report called Death in Small Doses in 2003.

Death in Small Doses, a report on the problems of and alternatives to pesticide use in Cambodia, was presented to Ministries in Cambodia, international donor agencies, media, business and NGOs as part of an advocacy strategy to raise public and political awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page242.html Cambodia Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817162620/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page242.html |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with [[CEDAC]] (Centre d'Etude et de Développement Agricole Cambodgien), a Cambodian NGO,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedac.org.kh/home.asp CEDAC Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722132432/http://www.cedac.org.kh/home.asp |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EJF documented widespread use of endosulfan by Cambodian farmers and recorded numerous safety concerns, including a lack of protective equipment and exposure of children, homes, livestock and family food crops.

Labelling inadequacies where endosulfan was being imported to [[Cambodia]] from [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]] were also highlighted in EJF's 2004 briefing paper "End of the Road for Endosulfan".&lt;ref name="ejfoundation.org"&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page97.html End of the Road for Endosulfan (2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011114358/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page97.html |date=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of EJF's work in Cambodia in 2002, the charity worked with Cambodian farmers to promote sustainable agriculture and educate them about risks of hazardous pesticides. A short briefing entitled End of the Road for Endosulfan&lt;ref name="ejfoundation.org"/&gt;  was used to convince the Cambodian Environment Minister to ban endosulfan in the country.

This briefing was later cited in the [[European Union]]'s 2008 proposal to include endosulfan in the Annexes of the [[Stockholm Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/Reviewedchemicals/tabid/7 81/language/en-US/Default.aspx POP Review Committee – click 'Download Proposal' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, EJF produced a report, Deadly Chemicals in Cotton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page97.html Report – Deadly Chemicals in Cotton 2007 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011114358/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page97.html |date=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following investigations that gathered evidence of hazardous pesticide use on cotton crops in Mali and India in 2006, which included documenting the medical impacts of the chemical.

The report, Deadly Chemicals in Cotton, was produced with the [[Pesticide Action Network]] UK to raise awareness of the human and environmental costs of [[pesticide]] use in [[West Africa]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/144765/ Financial Express "Cotton Growers face Health Hazards says study" 2007 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also highlights the heavy reliance of cotton production on [[pesticides]] and [[insecticides]]: an average estimated eight times more per hectare on cotton crop than per hectare of food crop.  EJF reports that US$2 billion-worth (2007) are used on cotton crops each year, US$819 million-worth of which are classed as hazardous by the [[World Health Organization]] according to the report. EJF characterises cotton as the world's dirtiest crop.

In 2009 EJF launched a new report with the same name as the 2004 briefing paper, 'End of the Road for Endosulfan'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page97.html Report – End of the Road for Endosulfan 2009 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011114358/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page97.html |date=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This documents health and [[environmental impacts]] associated with endosulfan exposure and advocates alternatives available for all its uses, organic crops and the avoidance of chemical [[fertilisers]] and pesticides.

In 2009/10 EJF recruited high-profile Indian celebrities, including film directors [[Deepa Mehta]] and [[M Night Shyamalan]], and musician [[Ravi Shankar]], to lend their support to the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page249.html Celebrity support to end the road for endosulfan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930040348/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page249.html |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, EJF was involved in securing a commitment from [[Bayer Cropscience]] to end its manufacture of endosulfan by the end of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page575.html Bayer confirms phase-out for endosulfan ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930040440/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page575.html |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, EJF announced on their website that they were "delighted to announce that, after extensive review and debate, we have finally reached the end of the road for chemical pesticide endosulfan"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page743.html Pesticide endosulfan to be banned globally ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728073400/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page743.html |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following news that on Friday April 29, 2011, national delegates at the fifth conference of parties (COP5) agreed to list endosulfan under Annex A of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-30/india/29490669_1_endosulfan-plantation-corporation-stockholm-convention Times of India: Global Phaseout of Endosulfan ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==

EJF's stated objective for its [[Wildlife management|wildlife]] campaign is to train and support investigators and advocates for wildlife in key [[Conservation movement|conservation]] locations around the globe.&lt;ref name="An International Trade"&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html An International Trade ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194512/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html |date=2011-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly concerned that [[illegal trafficking]] of plants and animals for pets, trophies, food and [[traditional medicines]], estimated to be worth $20 billion a year, has a detrimental effect on [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystems]] and is pushing some species to the brink of extinction.&lt;ref name="An International Trade"/&gt;

The campaign has so far concentrated on working in [[Vietnam]] where EJF report that a great diversity of wild species is under threat from the swift recent conversion to [[agriculture]] and building development. EJF believe that, Vietnam, although a signatory to CITES, lacks the manpower and legal framework to enforce domestic [[wildlife legislation]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page132.html Wildlife Trade in Vietnam – a Crisis facing Bears] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822005457/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page132.html |date=2011-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [ ]

EJF first collaborated with the NGO Education for Nature Vietnam (ENV) in 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page134.html Education for Nature-Vietnam (ENV)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817041241/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page134.html |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 2000 as Vietnam's first non-governmental organization focused on conservation of nature and wildlife, to combat illegal bear farming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page135.html ENV and EJF – working together] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817162605/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page135.html |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EJF reports that estimated 4000 Asiatic black bears and sun bears&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; are kept illegally in Vietnam's bear farms.  Adult bears are caged and their bile regularly extracted for the ursodeoxycholic acid it contains which is then used in traditional medicines and tonics.

In 2003, EJF provided ENV with video, media and advocacy training, a digital stills camera and a computer for film editing and design. It also gave advice and support on website development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page134.html Education for Nature – Vietnam ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817041241/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page134.html |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 EJF helped ENV to conduct undercover investigations into bear farms in and around Hanoi and undertake a consumer survey in preparation for a campaign to influence people's attitudes to bear farming. This included recruiting Vietnamese singer My Linh to front a public service announcement (PSA) shown on Vietnamese television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html PSA My Linh ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194512/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html |date=2011-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [ ]

In 2006-07, EJF continued training ENV in the use of film to produce another PSA, supplying a cameraman and editor to give assistance. The charity used funding from the World Society for the Protection of Animals to equip ENV with new computer and filming equipment and professional editing software.  Further video and media training for ENV was completed in 2008-09.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page134.html ENV and EJF a Partnership ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817041241/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page134.html |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a separate part of its wildlife campaign, EJF has committed to support the leading wildlife charity [[WildAid]] in their work to support protected areas, investigate illegal wildlife trade and reduce consumer demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html EJF &amp; Wildaid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194512/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page123.html |date=2011-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EJF and WildAid UK share a London office and Steve Trent, EJF's Executive Director is the President of [[WildAid]].

==Awards==
The Environmental Justice Foundation received the [[SeaWeb]] Seafood Champion Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodchampions.org Seafood Champion Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; for Advocacy in 2015 for its work combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in West African fisheries.

'''Eziobodo''' is an ancient kingdom located in today's Owerri-West local government, Owerri - Imo State Nigeria. Eziobodo is an [[Igbo language|igbo-speaking]] community with a population of over 15,000 locals.

Eziobodo is also known as Alueze or Alu-eze as this was the ancient name of the community before the colonial arrival of the former British Empire and Warrant Chiefs that followed much later around the 1930s. The town is made up by four villages namely; Eziobo (the first sons), Umuayo village, Umuokele village and Umuezala. There is a fifth village battling for independence from Umuokele village called Umuechem but they are grouped as one entity most of the time.

The town hosts the Federal University of Technology Owerri - FUTO. There is a misconception that a neighboring village Ihiagwa is the host community of FUTO but that is not true as Eziobodo accounts for over 70% of the landmass of Federal University of Technology Owerri.

The town is also known for agricultural produce such as [[cassava]], pumpkin leaf (Ugu), [[cocoyam]], [[maize]], and [[palm oil]]. The [[Otamiri river]] crosses through Umuayo and Eziobo villages.

The traditional stool, and the traditional leadership responsibility in Eziobodo autonomous community, is a right reserved for the OKOROAGBARA royal family from Umuezala. An application and attempt to split Eziobodo into two autonomous communities was not approved by the Imo State Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imostate.gov.ng/okorocha-gives-staff-of-office-to-19-monarchs/|title=Imo State Portal|website=ImoState.gov.ng|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable people of Eziobodo include HRH Eze Lucky Ndubueze Okoroagbara (Eze and Custodian of Traditional Institution), Kelly Hansome (musician), [[Emmanuel Amuneke]], Chidiebere Nwakali - (Former  U17 World cup winner in 2013), Kelechi Nwakali (Former U17 World cup winner in 2015) now with Arsenal Football club in England, Chukwudi Agor (Former U17 World cup winner in 2015), Miss Ego, former singer for popular musician Lagbaja, Emeka Bethel, CEO Bensoft Enterprise and Linux/open source activist in Nigeria, Sir Bobby owner of Bobby's signature - The beautician for former miss world winner Agbani Derego in 2001, Dr. Steve Eke-Okoroagabra MD, CEO Doctors Charity Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docint.org|title=Home|website=DrsOfCharity.org|access-date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MapLibrary|Nigeria_sat.png|Nigeria}}
'''Nigeria''' is a country in [[West Africa]]. [[Nigeria]] shares land [[border]]s with the Republic of [[Benin]] in the west, [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]] in the east, and [[Niger]] in the north. Its coast lies on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the south and it borders [[Lake Chad]] to the northeast. Noted geographical features in Nigeria include the [[Adamawa highlands]], [[Mambilla Plateau]], [[Jos Plateau]], [[Obudu Plateau]], the [[Niger River]], [[River Benue]] and [[Niger Delta]].

Nigeria is found in the [[Tropics]], where the climate is seasonally damp and very humid.
Nigeria is affected by four [[Köppen climate classification|climate types]]; these climate types are distinguishable, as one moves from the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|southern part of Nigeria]] to the [[Northern Nigeria|northern part of Nigeria]] through Nigeria's [[Middle Belt|middle belt]].

== Climate types found in Nigeria{{anchor|Climate}}==

The [[tropical monsoon climate]], designated by the [[Köppen climate classification]] as "Am", is found in the southern part of the country. This climate is influenced by the [[monsoon]]s originating from the South [[Atlantic ocean]], which is brought into the country by the (maritime tropical) MT [[airmass]], a warm moist sea to land seasonal wind. Its warmth and high humidity gives it a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious rainfall, which is a result of the condensation of water vapour in the rapidly rising air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390302/monsoon|title=Monsoon - meteorology|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tropical monsoon climate has a very small temperature range. Then temperature ranges are almost constant throughout the year, for example, [[Warri|Warri town]] in the southern part of Nigeria, records a maximum of {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} for its hottest month while its lowest temperature is {{convert|26|°C|°F|1}} in its coldest month. The temperature difference of Warri town is not more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C (5&amp;nbsp;°F).

The southern part of Nigeria experiences heavy and abundant rainfall. These storms are usually [[Precipitation (meteorology)|convectional]] in nature due to the regions proximity, to the [[equator|equatorial belt]]. The annual rainfall received in this region is very high, usually above the {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} rainfall totals giving for tropical rainforest climates worldwide. Over {{convert|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall is received in the coastal region of Nigeria around the [[Niger delta]] area. Bonny town found in the coastal region of the Niger delta area in southern Nigeria receives well over {{convert|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually. The rest of the southeast receives between 2,000 and {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain per year.

The southern region of Nigeria experiences a double rainfall maxima characterised by two high rainfall peaks, with a short dry season and a longer dry season falling between and after each peaks. The first rainy season begins around March and last to the end of July with a peak in June, this rainy season is followed by a short dry break in August known as the August break which is a short dry season lasting for two to three weeks in August. This break is broken by the short rainy season starting around early September and lasting to Mid October with a peak period at the end of September. The ending of the short rainy season in October is followed by long dry season. This period starts from late October and lasts till early March with peak dry conditions between early December and late February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cometonigeria.com/nigeria/climate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511223039/http://www.cometonigeria.com/nigeria/climate.html |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna climate or tropical wet and dry climate]], is extensive in area and covers most of Western Nigeria to central Nigeria beginning from the Tropical rainforest climate boundary in southern Nigeria to the [[Middle Belt|central]] part of Nigeria, where it exerts enormous influence on the region.

This climate, the tropical savanna climate exhibits a well marked rainy season and a dry season with a single peak known as the summer maximum due to its distance from the equator. Temperatures are above {{Convert|18|C|F}} throughout the year. [[Abuja]], Nigeria's capital city found in central Nigeria, has a temperature range of {{Convert|18.45|C|F}} to {{Convert|36.9|C|F}}, and an annual rainfall of about {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a single rainfall maxima in September.&lt;ref&gt;http://iahs.info/redbooks/a281/iahs_281_277.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The single Dry season experienced in this climate, the tropical savanna climate in central Nigeria beginning from December to march, is hot and dry with the [[Harmattan]] wind, a continental tropical (CT) airmass laden with dust from the [[Sahara]] Desert prevailing throughout this period.

With the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)]] swinging northward over West Africa from the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in April, heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of [[squall line]]s also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical(south westerlies) and the  Continental tropical(north easterlies),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/w33602907w473v31/ | doi=10.1007/BF01043455 | volume=41 | title=Initiation of West African squall lines | year=1989 | journal=Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics | pages=99–103 | author=Adedoyin J. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity, heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria.Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from {{convert|1100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} along the south western escarpment of the [[Jos Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1010|name=Jos Plateau forest-grassland mosaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sahel|Sahel climate or tropical dry climate]], is the predominant climate type in the northern part of Nigeria. Annual rainfall totals are lower compared to the southern and central part of Nigeria.&lt;br /&gt; The rainy season in the northern part of Nigeria last for only three to four months (June–September). The rest of the year is hot and dry with temperatures climbing as high as {{convert|40|°C|°F|1}} .

[[Alpine climate|Alpine climate or highland climate or mountain climate]] are found on highlands regions in Nigeria. Highlands with the alpine climate in Nigeria, are well over {{convert|1520|m|ft|0}} above sea level. Due to their location in the tropics, this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands, mountains and the [[Plateau|plateau regions]] standing above this height, a  cool mountain climate.

== Seasons ==
Nigeria, like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands, has only two [[seasons]]. These are the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert, locally known as [[Harmattan]], or by its main name, The Tropical Continental (CT) airmass, while the rainy season is heavily influenced  by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean, locally known as the south western wind, or by its main name, The Tropical Maritime (MT) airmass. These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the [[trade winds]].

==Trade winds==

===Tropical maritime airmass===

The tropical maritime airmass (MT) is responsible for Nigeria's rainy season. This wind (the tropical maritime airmass) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country, reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June. Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat, of the tropical continental airmass (CT) known as the harmattan. The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass (CT), is caused by the sun's northward shift from the [[Tropic of Capricorn|tropic of capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]] to the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic of cancer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]]. This shift begins from February and ends in June, when the sun is fully overhead, at the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic of cancer]] in the northern hemisphere.

During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis, the sun crosses the equator (around March), moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere. West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time. The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun's northward migration to the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic of cancer]] in the northern hemisphere.

The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased [[insolation]] received from the sun being overhead over west Africa. Temperatures can climb as high as  {{convert|35|°C|°F|1}} over west Africa during this time. Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as {{convert|48|°C|°F|1}} in cities like Maiduguri.&lt;ref&gt;http://sunday.dailytrust.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3565:maiduguri-residents-how-we-cope-under-harsh-48-degree-celsius&amp;catid=41:latest-news&amp;Itemid=26 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830073021/http://sunday.dailytrust.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3565%3Amaiduguri-residents-how-we-cope-under-harsh-48-degree-celsius&amp;catid=41%3Alatest-news&amp;Itemid=26 |date=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria (between March to May). The Tropical continental airmass (CT) from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of West Africa, is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time. The Tropical continental airmass (CT) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass (CT) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land. This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass (CT) in turn, causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds.
The Tropical continental airmass (CT) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time (around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass (Tropical continental airmass (CT)), further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria.
The Tropical continental airmass (CT) finally retreats from most part of Nigeria, and the West African [[atmosphere]] around April to May, leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria. The sun's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass, which contained dust (in form of haze) that reduced the intensity of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desertification.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/late-dust-storm-covers-nigeria-google-ap/|title=Nigeria: Late dust (harmattan) storm covers the country  (Google / AP)|author=|date=25 March 2010|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria. This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.

The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm [[humid]] and unstable trade wind due to its warmth. Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the [[Obudu Plateau|obudu plateau]] or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of  [[cumulonimbus clouds|cumulonimbus cloud]] leading to [[thunderstorms]] within the airmass.

During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT) in the rainy season of Nigeria, mornings are bright and sunny, the sun's heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents, these currents rise vertically and [[cumulonimbus]] clouds are formed, by afternoons to evenings, torrential downpour follows.

The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria.

The nature of this waves changes at about the [[Latitude|15 degrees line]]. The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/news/eo-04zzf.html|title=EARTH OBSERVATION Researchers Seeing Double On African Monsoons |author=College Park MD (SPX) |date=Jun 11, 2004 |work= |publisher=SPACE MEDIA NETWORK PROMOTIONS  |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria's northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canuk.org.uk/aboutnigeria.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316152855/http://www.canuk.org.uk/aboutnigeria.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 March 2011 |title=About the Country Nigeria |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=CANUK |accessdate=27 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria's location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons.

===Tropical continental airmass===
The Tropical Continental Airmass (CT) locally known as the [[harmattan]], is a wind originating from [[North Africa]] which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria. This airmass dominates Nigeria's climate during the dry season from December to March. 
The Tropical continental airmass is dusty and creates a haze within the atmosphere of west Africa and Nigeria when it predominates. The haze is as a result of the dust within the airmass limiting visibility and blocking much of the sun's rays from reaching the earth.

====Effects of the tropical continental airmass====
The mass has no ability of forming rain due to low humidity within the airmass, since it crosses the Sahara Desert, it picks up dust instead of water thereby creating little chances for rainfall.

The airmass makes life difficult as a result of low visibility which hampers transportation.
The dust haze creates an almost desert conditions in the country during the dominance of the Tropical continental airmass (the harmattan). But its coming brings some relief to farmers since the low humidity present in the air quickens the drying of their [[crops]].

== Temperature ==
Nigeria's location in the tropics has given her a tropical hot climate. Temperatures in Nigeria vary according to the [[seasons]] of the year as with other lands found in the tropics. Nigeria's seasons are determined by rainfall with rainy season and dry season being the major seasons in Nigeria.

The rainy season of Nigeria brings in cooler weather to the country as a result of an increased cloud cover that acts as a blockage to the intense sunshine of the tropics by blocking much of the suns rays in the rainy season; this in turn cools the land, and the winds above the ground remains cool thereby making for cooler temperatures during the rainy season. But afternoons in the rainy season can be hot and humid, a feature of tropical climates. In the rainy season it is damp, and the rainfalls are usually abundant.

The dry season of Nigeria is a period of little cloud cover in the southern part of Nigeria to virtually no cloud cover in the northern part of Nigeria. The sun shines through the atmosphere with little obstructions from the clear skies making the dry season in Nigeria a period of warm weather conditions.In the middle of the dry season around December, a dusty wind from the Sahara Desert called the harmattan enters Nigeria from the northeastern part of the country blocking sun rays partially from shining and also creating haze in the atmosphere, this activities of the wind lowers temperatures considerably saving inhabitants for sometime, from the scorching heat that would have occurred as a result of clearer skies during the dry season. But with the withdrawal of this wind around March to April following the onset of the rainy season, temperatures can go as high as {{convert|44|°C|°F|1}} in some parts of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nigeria-weather.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi temperate weather conditions prevail on the highlands in [[Middle Belt|central Nigeria]] above {{convert|1200|m|ft|0}} above sea level, namely the [[Jos Plateau]]. Temperatures on the Jos plateau ranges between 16&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C which are cool all year round.

[[Temperate]] weather conditions occur on the highlands along the Nigeria [[Cameroon]] border, in the eastern part of Nigeria. Highlands in these region attain an average height of more than {{convert|1524|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to some standing above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}} above sea level. The climate on these highlands is temperate all year round. The major highlands in this region are the [[Obudu Plateau]] above {{convert|1584|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mambilla Plateau]] above {{convert|1524|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and [[Chappal Waddi|Mt Chappal Waddi]] above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

== Topography ==
[[Image:Nigeria Topography.png|thumb|left|Topography of Nigeria]]
Nigeria's most expansive topographical region is that of the [[valleys]] of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River]] valleys (which merge into each other and form a "y" shaped [[confluence]] at [[Lokoja]]).&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Nigeria |encyclopedia=[[Encarta]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557915/Nigeria.html |accessdate=2007-07-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpluZiN?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557915/Nigeria.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plains rise to the north of the valleys. To the southwest of the Niger there is "rugged" [[Highland (geography)|highland]], and to the southeast of the Benue hills and mountains are found all the way to the border with [[Cameroon]]. [[Coastal plain]]s are found in both the southwest and the southeast.&lt;ref name="encarta"/&gt;

== Niger Delta ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
The [[Niger Delta]] is located in the southern part of Nigeria. It is one of the world's largest [[River delta|arcuate]] fan-shaped [[river delta]]s.

The [[riverine]] area of the Niger Delta is a coastal belt of swamps bordering the [[Atlantic ocean]]. The [[swamps]] are vegetated tidal flats formed by a reticulate pattern of interconnected meandering [[stream|creek]]s and distributaries of the [[River Niger]].

===Vegetation of the Niger Delta===
The [[vegetation]] of the [[Niger Delta]] consist mainly of [[forest]]  [[swamps]]. The forest are of two types, nearest the  [[sea]] is a belt of saline/brackish [[Mangrove]] swamp separated from the sea by sand beach [[ridges]] within the mangrove swamp. Numerous sandy [[islands]] occur with fresh water vegetation. [[Fresh water]] swamps gradually supersede the mangrove on the landward side. About 70% of Nigeria's [[crude oil]] and [[gas]] production is from the area.

===Human population in the Niger Delta===
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
The riverine area is home to a large population of people living mainly in small [[villages]] scattered along the banks of [[rivers]] and [[stream|creeks]].

===Rainfall in Niger Delta===
Rainfall in the [[coastal]] belt of the Niger Delta is heavy due to the closeness of the Delta region to the [[equator]]. Annual rainfall totals vary from 2400 to over 4000 millimeters.

Niger Delta cities and their annually rainfall totals in millimeters:

* [[Warri]] — 2,730mm
* [[Forcados]] (coastal town in the Niger Delta) — 4,870mm
* [[Port Harcourt]] — 2,400mm
* [[Calabar]] (coastal city) — 3,070mm (rainiest city with over one million people in Nigeria)
* [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]] (south of Port Harcourt) — 4,200mm

==Vegetation==
[[Image:Nigeria veg 1979.jpg|thumb|right|Vegetation map of Nigeria.]]
Nigeria is covered by three types of vegetation: forests (where there is significant tree cover), savannahs (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees), and [[montane]] land. (The latter is the least common, and is mainly found in the mountains near the Cameroon border.) Both the forest zone and the savannah zone are divided into three parts.&lt;ref name=gai4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard4.html |title=The Human and Physical Characteristics of Nigeria |accessdate=2007-08-13 |work=Geographical Alliance of Iowa |publisher=[[University of Northern Iowa]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328172528/http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard4.html |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the forest zone's most southerly portion, especially around the [[Niger River]] and [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] deltas, is [[mangrove]] swamp (see [[Central African mangroves]]). North of this is fresh water swamp, containing different vegetation from the salt water mangrove swamps, and north of that is rain forest.&lt;ref name=gai4/&gt;

The savannah zone's three categories are divided into mm' [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]], made up of plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees, the most common across the country; Sudan savannah, similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees; and [[Sahel]] savannah patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast.&lt;ref name=gai4/&gt;

==Natural resources and land use==
Nigeria's natural resources include but are not limited to  [[petroleum]] (see [[petroleum in Nigeria]]), [[tin]], [[columbite]], [[iron ore]], [[coal]], [[limestone]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[natural gas]], [[hydropower]], and [[arable land]].

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Nigeria]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Niger]] immediately northwest of the town of [[Chadawa]], [[Sokoto State]].
* Easternmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Cameroon]] immediately east of the village of [[Munyego]], [[Borno State]].
* Southernmost point – unnamed headland south of the town of [[Egeregere]], [[Bayelsa State]].
* Westernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Benin Republic]] immediately east of the Beninoise town of [[Jabata]], [[Oyo State]].

==Projects==

=== Hecht Park, Haifa ===

[[File:פארק הכט.JPG|thumb|Hecht Park]]
"Hecht Park" of about 75 dunam, is the largest intensive [[park]] in [[Haifa]] and is a component in the sequence of Haifa's coastal [[promenade]]. The park includes varied [[flora]] areas and emphasized the use of natural flora matching the existing [[coastal]] [[flora]] of the area. Furthermore, in the [[park]] there are wide lawns for public use.
The park addresses a diverse target of users: [[families]], [[children]], [[adults]],  open air sports, bicycle riders, joggers etc. 
The park is located along the southern entry to the city and was built by the initiative of [[Haifa]] Municipality, in co-operation with Hecht Foundation.

=== Shikmona Coastal Park and Promenade, Haifa ===

[[File:טיילת חוף שקמונה.jpg|thumb|Shikmona Coastal Park and Promenade]]

Haifa Shikmona [[coast]] is a narrow strip of about 80 dunam, divided by the rail way from park Hecht. Shikmona [[coast]] is a [[National Park]] and a [[Marine habitats|Marine]] Nature Reserve. Tel Shikmona is located at the north end of the park.
Much effort was taken to preserve the existing coastal [[flora]], as well as to reintroduce the local flora which had been typical of this area in the distant past.
The [[coastal]] complex of Hecht Park and Shikmona Coastal Park is designated to respond to the ever-growing needs for recreation activities, exposing the [[city]] residents and its visitors to the [[ecological]], landscape and archaeological values of this unique shore.	
Shikmona Coastal Park includes a [[pedestrian]] [[promenade]] of about 1&amp;nbsp;km and a [[bicycle]] path of 1.6&amp;nbsp;km. The park was erected by the initiative of [[Haifa]] Municipality, with the assistance of a contribution of the Electric Company.

===Israel Cross Highway (no. 6), Ramot Menashe section===

[[File:אדריכלות מנהרות ותכנון נוף, כביש 6.jpg|thumb|Israel Cross Highway (no. 6)]] 
This section of the [[Israel]] Cross [[Highway]] passes through a highly sensitive [[landscape]] of Oak hills. The road crosses also 11 river beds some of which are Nature Reserves.
The landscape restoration concept was of an ecological-landscape, reconstructing the landscape, which had existed prior to carrying out the road, and blended into the [[natural]] and [[agricultural]] landscapes around the [[road]]. The [[plant]] restoration complements the "external" landscape and "interweaves" the patterns of the landscape around. Seeds, and geophytes were gathered, prior to carrying out the works, for sprouting local [[habitats]]. The use of local [[flor]] enables to reduce the [[water]] quantity required for irrigation and emphasizes the seasonal change experience of the country's [[landscapes]].
Greenstein Har-Gil Firm "accompanied" the engineering planning from its early stages. The landscape design included a landscape analysis, participating in determining the horizontal and vertical road route in order to minimize the environmental damage, examining the various alternatives and determining the location and length of the [[bridges]] and [[tunnels]] as well as planning the interchanges. Due to the landscape sensitivity of the area and the nature of the planning process, the [[landscape]] and environmental aspects received particularly great emphasis and importance and affected significantly the engineering of the road. Erecting the road was managed by Cross Israel Highway Company.

== Awards and Competitions ==
Over the years the firm staff has gained recognition and appreciation for many projects:
* Karavan Award for [[landscape architecture]], [[Tel-Aviv]] municipality, 2009, for Hecht Park in Haifa
* Azrieli Urban Planning Prize, Council for a Beautiful [[Israel]], 2006, for the [[German Colony, Haifa]] in [[Haifa]]

[[File:Dhaka Crowd in Gulistan Crossing.JPG|thumb|Dhaka Crowd in Gulistan Crossing]]
'''Gulistan''' is a very busy street of [[Dhaka]] city in [[Bangladesh]]. It means 'Flower Garden' in [[Persian language|Persian]], which lead to the speculation that in medieval times there might be prominent flower gardens.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Several important streets are connected to Gulistan which makes it busy and crowded. The street is full of roadside shops. Thousands of people visit this place for their daily needs. The road is always occupied with traffic and passersby. One of the oldest transports of Dhaka City ‘Tom Tom’ can be seen in this street. There is a shrine right at the middle of the road. It is called “Golap Shah’s Shrine”. Thousands of people show their devotion to this shrine everyday and make donations so that their desire can be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Shahnaz | last=Parveen | title=History of Golap Shah's shrine still a mystery | url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=49669 | format=Online | publisher=The Daily Star | date=10 August 2008 | accessdate=5 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one major bus stand situated in Gulistan, called the Gulistan (Fulbaria) Bus Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Stuart John |date=2008 |title=Bangladesh |edition=6th |publisher=Lonely Planet |page=68 |isbn=978-1741045475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the buses here are public and the number of buses is very few according to the number of passengers. People often get on top of the bus as there are no longer spaces inside the bus. Some people can be seen hanging at the doorways. Banga (or Bango) Bazar is the prime shopping place here. New and fashionable clothes can be found here with reasonable price. There are hundreds of shops inside the place. The narrow pathways make it hard to roam inside the vicinity. The place is so congested and hot that it is hard to stay long time inside the complex. There used to be a Cinema complex (‘Gulistan Cinema Hall’) here which was one of the oldest architectural monuments. Even though the design was not eye catching and the structure was bizarre, it was one of the modern buildings in Dhaka city.&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture'', A.B M Hossen, Asiatic Society, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11-km-long Gulistan–Jatrabari Flyover was opened in October 2013 to ease traffic jams and reduce travel time from the usual one hour to just five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Rafiqul | last=Azad | title=PM opens Gulistan-Jatrabari flyover | url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=189346:pm-opens-gulistan-jatrabari-flyover&amp;catid=132:backpage&amp;Itemid=122 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610215413/http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=189346:pm-opens-gulistan-jatrabari-flyover&amp;catid=132:backpage&amp;Itemid=122 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=10 June 2015 | format=Online | publisher=The Independent | date=12 October 2013 | accessdate=19 November 2013 |quote="Oct 11 [2013]: ... 11-km-long [flyover] is being opened to traffic on Saturday ...

'''Herbert John Fleure''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Garnett | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1970.0009 | title = [[Herbert John Fleure]]. 1877-1969 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 16 | pages = 253–278| year = 1970 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (6 June 1877 &amp;ndash; 1 July 1969), was a [[Zoology|zoologist]] and [[geographer]]. He was secretary of the [[Geographical Association]], editor of ''Geography'', and President of the Cambrian Archaeological Association.

==Early years==
Fleure was born in [[Guernsey]] on 6 June 1877, the son of Jean Fleure and Marie Le Rougetel. He often astonished friends and relatives in the mid-twentieth century by recounting how his father had been taken to visit the battlefield of Waterloo shortly after the battle (his father was born in 1803 and died in 1889). In 1897, he attended the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]], where he founded the [[Aberystwyth Guild of Students#History|Student Representative Council]]. He graduated [[B.Sc.]] with first-class honours in late 1901 and was offered a [[Fellow|University Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Thursday |date=5 December 1901 |page_number=11 |issue=36630| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to study at the Zoological Institute in [[Zurich]], Switzerland.

==Career==
Returning to Wales, he became Head of the Department of Zoology at Aberystwyth in 1908. In 1917, he became Professor of Anthropology and Geography at the university, holding the post until 1930, when he became Professor of Geography at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Victoria University]], [[Manchester]]. He was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;  Following his retirement in 1944, he was President of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]] from 1945 to 1947.

He was a founder member of the [[Guernsey Society]], which was established in 1943 to represent the interests of the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|Nazi-occupied island]] to the British Authorities. After the war, he was a regular contributor to ''The Quarterly Review'', as well as to ''The Guernsey Farmhouse'', a book published by the Society in 1964 celebrating the ancient family houses in the island. He also authored biographies of several scientists including [[Arthur Robert Hinks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = H.

From 1927 through 1956 he was the co-author of the ten volumes of ''The Corridors of Time'' by [[Harold John Edward Peake]].

==Honours==
He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the [[American Geographical Society]] in 1930, and its [[Charles Patrick Daly#Honors|Daly Medal]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="amergeog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf|title=American Geographical Society Honorary Fellowships|publisher=amergeog.org|accessdate=2009-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704200812/http://www.amergeog.org/honorslist.pdf|archivedate=2009-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/157651c0 | title = Royal Geographical Society: Awards for 1945-46 | journal = Nature | volume = 157 | issue = 3994 | page = 651| year = 1946 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Theodor Sapper''' (6 February 1866 – 29 March 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] traveller, explorer, [[antiquarian]] and [[linguistics|linguist]], who is known for his research into the [[natural history]], cultures and languages of [[Central America]] around the turn of the 20th century.

Sapper spent over twelve years (1888–95)&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Dienhart (1997), [http://maya.hum.sdu.dk/mayabiblioauth.html "Data sources listed by author"].&lt;/ref&gt; traveling through much of Central America, and in the process published a number of scientific works on aspects from [[vulcanology]] to [[Mesoamerican languages]] to descriptions and maps of [[List of Maya sites|Maya archaeological sites]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapper's contributions to the study of Mesoamerican languages include his initial proposal, made in a 1912 paper, which surmised that the highland regions of [[Chiapas highlands|Chiapas]] and [[Guatemala]] was the location from which the [[Mayan languages]] and the [[Maya peoples]] later diversified.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández de Miranda (1968), p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment of a number of modern linguists places the likely home of the [[Proto-Mayan]] language as being centered on the [[Cuchumatanes]] highlands of Guatemala, with a subsequent early occupancy of the Chiapas highlands proper.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Campbell (1997), p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapper is commemorated in the scientific names of two Central American snakes: ''[[Rustyhead snake|Amastridium sapperi]]'' and ''[[Micrurus diastema|Micrurus diastema sapperi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Six [[Commonwealth nation]]s have the Union Jack on their national flag. The first Commonwealth country to drop the Union Jack was [[Canada]] in 1965, after [[Flag of Canada|adopting a new national flag]].  The most recent country to drop the Union Jack from its flag was [[South Africa]] in 1994, after [[Flag of South Africa|adopting a new national flag]].  The only overseas territory without the Union Jack on its current flag is [[Gibraltar]].

The list also includes [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]], [[Province|provinces]] and [[Federated state|states]].

The following is a list of [[marine ecoregion]]s, as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]]

The WWF/Nature Conservancy scheme groups the individual ecoregions into 12 [[marine realm]]s, which represent the broad latitudinal divisions of polar, temperate, and tropical seas, with subdivisions based on ocean basins. The marine realms are subdivided into 62 [[marine province]]s, which include one or more of the 232 marine ecoregions.

The WWF/Nature Conservancy scheme currently encompasses only coastal and [[continental shelf]] areas; ecoregions of the deep oceans have not yet been delineated.

The '''Lost Library of the [[Moscow]] [[Tsars]]''' also known as the "Golden Library," is a library speculated to have been created by [[Ivan III]] (the Great) of [[Russia]] in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Search for the Lost Library of Ivan the Terrible|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/search-lost-library-ivan-terrible-002598|website=Ancient Origins|publisher=Ancient Origins|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the Library of [[Ivan IV]] (Ivan the Terrible) to whom it is believed the disappearance of the library is attributed.  The lost library is thought to contain rare [[Greek literature|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Egyptian literature|Egyptian]] works from the Libraries of Constantinople and Alexandria, as well as second century [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] texts and manuscripts from Ivan IV's own era.  The library has been historically placed as being underneath the [[Kremlin]] and has been a source of interest for researchers, archaeologists, treasure hunters, and historical figures like [[Peter the Great]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].  Under Ivan IV's rule the library's legend had grown.  Myths surrounding the library include Ivan cursing the library before his death, causing blindness to those that came close to locating the library, and Ivan attempting to have scholars translate the ancient texts in order to gain knowledge of black magic.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== History ==

The earliest reference to the lost library was in 1518 when Michail Tripolis known widely as [[Maximus the Greek]] was sent to Russia and came into contact with Moscow Grand Prince [[Vasili III]], the son of Ivan III.  Tripolis' reputation as a scholar and translator of works like the [[Psalter]] into Russian brought him to the attention of Vasili III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golubinskii|first1=E.E.|title=Istoriia Russkoi Tserkvi (Volume 2, Part 1)|date=1900|publisher=Universitetskaia Tipografiia|location=Moscow, Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in a meeting between Michail and Vasili wherein it is described that "countless multitudes of Greek books" were shown to Michail by Vasili III.  A Russian contemporary of Michail wrote a biography of him called "The Tale of Maxim the Philosopher."  This biographer, [[Andrey Kurbsky|Prince Kurbskii]], a member of the Moscow nobility, detailed this meeting between Michail and Vasili III.  Kurbskii wrote that "Maxim was astounded and impressed, and assured the prince that even in Greece he had never seen so many Greek books."&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;{{rp|304}}

Close to eighty years after Kurbskii wrote Maximus the Greek's biography the next mention of the lost library as well as a location appeared.  Livonian writer Franz Nyenstadt wrote about Johannes Wetterman, a [[Germans|German]] [[Protestant]] minister who established a church in Russia and met with Ivan IV.  Ivan IV purportedly had been hiding multitudes of weapons underneath the Kremlin.  Some of the weapons were actually discovered in 1978 by Soviet construction workers working on the subway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Masha|title=Kremlin Tunnels: The Secret of Moscow's Underworld|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-28/news/mn-4159_1_kremlin-tunnels-underground-passageways-dirt|accessdate=27 November 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetterman was summoned by Ivan IV not to look at a weapons arsenal but to look at ancient books that had been secured in a locked storeroom somewhere inside the Kremlin for well over a hundred years.  Wetterman and three other Germans and three Russian officials were told to conduct a survey of the works.  Wetterman noted that there were many works present that were only referenced in passing by other scholars because they had been either destroyed in fires or lost during wars previously.  Wetterman was offered the opportunity to work with and translate a book found in the survey. Wetterman however was afraid that taking such an assignment would lead to more work which would keep him in Moscow indefinitely.  The works were then locked away again in the underground Kremlin perhaps to protect them from potential fires.

A 1724 report of Moscow Petty Official Konon Osipov mentions a discovery made by V. Makariev in 1682.  Makariev while being ordered to go into a Kremlin secret passage found a room full of trunks.  When Makariev reported the find to Princess [[Sophia Alekseyevna]] she made it forbidden for anyone to access those rooms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arans|first1=David|title=A Note on the Lost Library of the Moscow Tsars|journal=Journal of Library History|date=1983|volume=18|issue=3|pages=304–316|jstor=25541406}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306–307,310}}

== Search for the Lost Library ==

In the early nineteenth century, Professor Dabelov of the University of Dorpat ([[University of Tartu]]) found in the archives of the city of Pernau ([[Pärnu]]), a document called "Manuscripts Held by the Tsar."  Dabelov left Pernau to inform a university associate, Professor Clossius, of the find, yet when returning to the Pernau archives the document had seemingly vanished.  The only information left on the document was some of what Dabelov had copied down on his first visit.  This information detailed that the tsars had around 800 manuscripts and some of these were gifted to Russia from an unknown [[Byzantine]] emperor.

In 1834, Professor Clossius wrote on a collection of Russian history including the work of [[Nikolay Karamzin]] author of "History of the Russian State."  Karamzin mentions the meeting between Ivan IV and Protestant minister Wetterman.  In Professor Clossius' article, he wrote that he believed the lost library had been destroyed by fires caused by the seventeenth century Polish invasion.

In the 1890s, Professor Thraemer of the [[University of Strasbourg]] located a manuscript of Homer's hymns that he believed was once a part of the collection of manuscripts brought to Moscow by Byzantine Princess [[Sophia Palaiologina]] when she married Ivan III.  Ivan III and Sophia married in 1472 and her dowry included a rare collection of books from the [[Library of Constantinople]] and [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;  For several months in 1891 Professor Thraemer lived in Moscow searching through all of the city's libraries and archives in the hopes of locating the lost library.  Thraemer eventually decided that it must be located inside hidden subterranean rooms underneath the Kremlin.  In 1893 Professor I.E. Zabelin wrote an article called "The Underground Chambers of the Moscow Kremlin" where he concluded that the library did exist there but that it was destroyed in the seventeenth century.  Around this time some attempts were made at excavating underneath the Kremlin.  The excavations found several underground chambers and tunnels but all were found empty.
Several Russian scholars of the era also refuted the existence of the library.  S.A. Belokurov in 1898 wrote that the "Tale of Maxim the Philosopher" was not written by Prince Kurbskii, but 75 years after the fact by another monk.  Belokurov states that he found enough contradictions and inconsistencies in the Maximus the Greek biography that he believed Maximus never even saw the library.  Belokurov also believed that Professor Dabelov's document was a forgery and he refuted other sources as well.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;{{rp|310–311}}

In the early twentieth century Archaeologist [[Ignatius Stelletskii]] became a seeker of the lost library.  A 1929 article of [[The New York Times]] details Stelletskii's search.  The article reports that Stelletskii found archives showing "two large rooms filled with treasure chests and known to exist under the Kremlin" half a century after the death of Ivan IV.  Also reported is the fact that Protestant Minister Wetterman never returned home after being in Moscow.  Ivan IV according to myth had the architect of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] blinded in order to never be able to recreate it, hiding its secrets.  Therefore, Ivan IV involved in Wetterman's disappearance after seeing the library would seem standard protocol.  [[Peter the Great]] also attempted to locate the library hoping to find treasures that would help the treasury after his several years involved in wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duranty|first1=Walter|title=Ivan's Tresures Lure Russia Again|url=http://search.proquest.com//docview/105041108/|accessdate=27 November 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 6, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stelletskii's search however ended without ever finding the library.

S.O. Shmidt in 1978 described an unpublished work by N.N. Zarubin from the 1930s called "The Library of Ivan the Terrible and His Books."  Zarubin argued that the work of S. Belokurov was not impartial when claiming that the library did not exist.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;{{rp|312–313}}

By the 1990s archaeologists broadened their search beyond the Kremlin into [[Sergiyev Posad]], [[Alexandrov, Vladimir Oblast]], and [[Dyakovo]], all places under the influence of Ivan IV.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6230">'''Medveščak''' ({{IPA-sh|medʋeʃtʃǎːk|pron}}, also called ''Crikvenik'') is a [[Stream|creek]] in central [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. It flows from [[Kraljičin zdenac]] in [[Podsljeme]] down along the southern slopes of the [[Medvednica]] mountain to the Manduševac Fountain, its mouth. The creek was covered in 1898 and today forms part of the Zagreb sewer system. Medveščak has long served as an important geographical feature of historic Zagreb, delineating the border between the often warring twin cities of [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] (Gornji Grad) and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] between the 11th and the 19th century and causing many violent floods which often decimated houses on its banks. Most of the stream is located in the [[Gornji Grad - Medveščak]] city district, running underground under [[Tkalčićeva Street|Tkalčićeva]] and Medvedgradska Streets.{{sfn|Milčec|1993|p=164}}{{sfn|Milčec|1993|p=166}}

The creek today plays a minor role in the Zagreb sewer system, having ceased powering the Manduševac Fountain in 1882.&lt;ref name=vjesnik_pc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2002/03/17/Clanak.asp?r=pis&amp;c=4 |title=Zar projektanti nisu znali gdje je izvor Manduševac |date=17 March 2002 |last=Orešković |first=Marko |accessdate=16 October 2008 |work=[[Vjesnik]] |language=Croatian }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it gave its name to the [[Medveščak (neighborhood)|Medveščak]] neighborhood.

== Description ==
The stream's source is located on the [[Medvednica]] mountain, near [[Kraljičin zdenac]]. Therefrom it flows through a flood retention dam near the Šestinski Lagvić restaurant, and onwards through the neighbourhood of [[Mlinovi]] (Croatian for "mills") in a concrete basin. It has a confluence with Gračanec stream near Okrugljak, which used to be responsible for a large part of its downstream water flow, and continues to Medveščak, where it joins the city's sewage system.{{sfn|Kljajić &amp; Mikulec|2013|p=32}}

== History ==
The banks of Medveščak stream have been inhabited since antiquity. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] coins spanning the time from [[Germanicus]] (1st century BC/AD) to [[Crispus]] (early 4th century AD) have been found in Medveščak's riverbed.{{sfn|Deželić|1923|p=102}}

One of today's best known roles of Medveščak is as the border between the two cores of modern downtown Zagreb, [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]]. The two cities often had disputes about the creek's sovereignty and the ownership of [[watermill|mills]] built on it. One of the relics remaining as the evidence of these tumultuous times is the Krvavi Most, a former bridge and currently a very short street in the Zagreb pedestrian zone, whose name literally means "Bloody Bridge." It has been the site of several battles between the twin cities.{{sfn|Milčec|1993|p=164}}

Medveščak has been the center of Zagreb industry since the early days of the city, spawning numerous [[watermills]]. The watermills caused the development of Zagreb industry, easing the construction of Zagreb's first cloth, soap, paper and liquor factories and later [[animal skin]] industry. The watermills were often the subject of feuds between the twin cities, Kaptol and Gradec. A 1392 peace treaty forbade construction of new watermills along the shared city border, between today's southern end of Medvedgradska Street and [[Ban Jelačić Square]], leaving only two mills within the city. Both mills were owned by a [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]]. However, they were both razed during the 1898 covering of the creek.&lt;ref name=tkalca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monel.hr/povjest/tkalca.html |title=Tkalčićeva ulica |accessdate=16 October 2008 |work=Monel.hr |language=Croatian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018211638/http://www.monel.hr/povjest/tkalca.html |archivedate=18 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creek often produced catastrophic [[flood]]s until 1898, at which time it was covered by the Creek Road ({{lang-hr|Ulica Potok}}, today Tkalčićeva Street) and became part of the new [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]].{{sfn|Piškorić|2007|p=408}} The most tragic flood was the one in 1651, when 52 people were confirmed to have drowned in the creek.{{sfn|Milčec|1993|p=168}} The creek thus earned the name "Krvavi Potok" ("Bloody creek"), as described by the notable Zagreb historian [[Baltazar Adam Krčelić]] in his work ''Annuae''.{{sfn|Milčec|1993|p=166}}

'''Meherabad''' (''meher'' meaning "friend" from Iranian "Mihir", ultimately from Sanskrit "Mithira"; ''abad'' meaning a prosperous settlement, or a flourishing colony) was originally an [[ashram]] established by [[Meher Baba]] near Arangaon Village, [[India]] in 1923 about {{convert|9|km|0}} south of [[Ahmednagar]]. It is now the site of [[Samadhi of Meher Baba|Meher Baba's samadhi]] (shrine/tomb) as well as facilities and accommodations for [[pilgrim]]s. A large number of buildings mostly associated with the earlier decades of Baba’s work, the graves of disciples, and a range of pilgrim accommodation and charitable establishments are also there. Many Baba-lovers work or live in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Avatar Meher Baba, His Life, His Message and His Followers,'' Copyright 1996 Ray Kerkhove, Peter Milne and Ray Kerkhove,&lt;/ref&gt;

Meherabad is a popular place of [[pilgrimage]] for both Eastern and Western followers of Meher Baba, with reported numbers of around 30,000 annual pilgrims at [[Amartithi]] (the commemoration of his death each January 31).&lt;ref&gt;Meher Baba Trust - Calendar of Events {{cite web |url=http://www.ambppct.org/events/events.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423035553/http://www.ambppct.org/events/events.php |archivedate=2008-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[free dispensary]] and school.

Established in May 1923, Meherabad was the first permanent residence of Meher Baba and his disciples in [[Ahmednagar district]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba,'' by Bhau Kalchuri, Manifestation, Inc. 1986. p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Meher Baba moved his residence north to [[Meherazad]], located {{convert|24|km|0}} away on the other side of Ahmedagar.&lt;ref&gt;Meher Baba's Last Sahavas, pp. 15-16
Copyright 1969 Dr. H. P. Bharucha&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meher Pilgrim Center''' (also spelled "Centre") is the central administrative facility for the [[Meher Baba]] pilgrim [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]].The Pilgrim Center and Pilgrim Retreat are closed during the hot Indian summer from 15 March to  15 June of each year.On 15 June 2006, new pilgrim facilities were established with the construction of '''Meher Pilgrim Retreat''', an {{convert|88000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ambppct.org/inhisservice/IHS_NL_98_Dec.pdf# |title=In His Service, A Newsletter from Meherabad, December 1998 |access-date=26 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044258/http://ambppct.org/inhisservice/IHS_NL_98_Dec.pdf# |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Pilgrim Center and Pilgrim Retreat were designed by architect Ted Judson.

'''Mineral springs''' are naturally occurring [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]s that produce water containing [[mineral]]s, or other dissolved substances, that alter its taste or give it a purported [[therapeutic]] value. [[Salts]], [[sulfur compounds]], and [[gases]] are among the substances that can be dissolved in the spring water during its passage underground.

[[Mineral water]] obtained from mineral springs has long been an important commercial proposition.

[[Mineral spa]]s are resorts that have developed around mineral springs, where (often wealthy) patrons would repair to “take the waters” — meaning that they would drink (see [[hydrotherapy]] and [[water cure (therapy)|water cure]]) or bathe in (see [[balneotherapy]]) the mineral water.

Historical mineral springs were often outfitted with elaborate stone-works — including artificial pools, [[retaining wall]]s, [[colonnade]]s and roofs — sometimes in the form of fanciful "Greek temples", [[gazebo]]s or [[pagoda]]s. Others were entirely enclosed within [[spring house]]s.

==Types==
For many centuries, in Europe, North America and elsewhere, commercial proponents of mineral springs classified them according to the chemical composition of the water produced and according to the medicinal benefits supposedly accruing from each:

*[[Lithia water|Lithia springs]] contained [[lithium salts]].
*[[Chalybeate|Chalybeate springs]] contained salts of [[iron]].
*[[Alum springs]] contained [[alum]].
*Sulfur springs contained [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas (see also [[fumeroles]]).
*[[Salt spring|Salt (saline) spring]]s contained salts of calcium, magnesium or sodium.
*[[Alkaline spring]]s contained an [[alkali]].
*[[Calcic spring]]s contained [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[calcium hydroxide]]).
*[[Thermal spring|Thermal (hot) spring]]s could contain a high concentration of various minerals.
*[[Soda spring]]s contained [[carbon dioxide]] gas ([[soda water]]).
*[[Radioactive spring]]s contain traces of [[radioactive]] substances such as [[radium]] or [[uranium]].

==Deposits==
[[File:Badab Surt Najafi2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Stepped [[travertine]] terrace formations at [[Badab-e Surt]], [[Iran]].]]
Types of [[sedimentary rock]] - usually [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) - are sometimes formed by the [[evaporation]], or rapid [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], of mineral spring water, especially at the mouths of hot mineral springs. (These mineral deposits can also be found in dried lakebeds.) Spectacular formations, including terraces, [[stalactite]]s, [[stalagmite]]s and “frozen waterfalls” can result (see, for example, [[Mammoth Hot Springs#Mammoth Hot Springs|Mammoth Hot Springs]]). 

One light-colored porous [[calcite]] of this type is known as [[travertine]] and has been used extensively in [[Italy]] and elsewhere as building material. Travertine can have a white, tan, or cream-colored appearance and often has a fibrous or concentric “grain”. 

Another type of spring water deposit, containing [[siliceous]] as well as [[calcareous]] minerals, is known as [[tufa]]. Tufa is similar to travertine but is even softer and more porous.

'''Pico do Fogo''' {{IPA-pt|ˈpiku du ˈfoɡu|pron}} is the highest peak of [[Cape Verde]], rising to {{convert|2829|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref name=yearbook/&gt; It is an active [[stratovolcano]] lying on the island of [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]]. The main [[Volcanic cone|cone]] last erupted in 1680, causing mass emigration from the island.&lt;ref name=jenkins/&gt; A subsidiary [[volcano|vent]] erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when [[earthquake]]s killed several people.

Fogo is a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanic island. Its most recent eruptions have occurred in 1951, 1995 and 2014. It is the youngest and most active volcano in the Cape Verde Islands, a short [[Archipelago|chain]] of volcanic islands that generally are younger at the western end, formed as the [[African Plate]] moved towards the east over the hotspot.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

Fogo consists of a single volcano, so the island is nearly round and about {{convert|25|km|mi|sp=us}} in diameter. The large summit caldera (about 10 kilometers in the north-south direction and 7 kilometers in the east-west direction) is not located in the center of the island, but rather towards its northeastern corner. The caldera is bounded by steep near-vertical [[fault scarp]]s on the north, west, and south sides but is breached to the east where lava can flow to the coast. North-northeast-trending [[Fissure vent|eruptive fissures]] opened along the western flank of Pico, which formed inside the caldera between about 1500 and 1760.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt; The last eruption from the top was in 1769. The current [[topography]] of Fogo, with the caldera open to the sea on the east side, results from the sliding of the east flank of the volcano towards the ocean.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

The mountain's slopes are used to grow [[coffee]], while its [[lava]] is used as building material. Near its peak is a [[caldera]] and a small village, [[Chã das Caldeiras]], is inside this caldera. The crater rim, which reaches 2,700 m elevation, is known as [[Bordeira (Fogo)|Bordeira]].

==73,000 years ago==  
The eastern side of Fogo collapsed into the ocean 73,000 years ago, creating a tsunami 170 meters high which struck the nearby island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Island boulders reveal ancient mega-tsunami|url = http://www.nature.com/news/island-boulders-reveal-ancient-mega-tsunami-1.18485#/b1|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tsunami was dated by isotope analysis of boulders deposited on Santiago.

==1680 eruption==
In 1680 AD, a major summit eruption of Pico do Fogo produced large ash falls over the whole island rendering agricultural lands temporarily unusable and triggering mass emigration from the island, to Brava in particular.&lt;ref name=jenkins&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://appliedvolc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13617-017-0057-6|title=Damage from lava flows: insights from the 2014–2015 eruption of Fogo, Cape Verde|journal=Journal of Applied Volcanology Society and Volcanoes|date=20 March 2017|author=S. F. Jenkins et al.|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1995 eruption==
The 1995 eruption began on the night of 2–3 April, covering the island with a cloud of [[Volcanic ash|ash]].&lt;ref name=hvo_1995&gt;{{cite web |url = https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html?vwid=1123 |publisher = [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] |title = Volcano Watch: Fogo Volcano, Cape Verde Islands |date = April 21, 1995 |accessdate = 2018-10-11 }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents were evacuated from Chã das Caldeiras, as their homes were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/africa/fogo/ |title = Fogo Caldera |publisher = Michigan Technological University |work = MTU Volcanoes Page |accessdate = 2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fogo, Cape Verde Islands.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of Fogo.]]
Residents reported that the eruption was preceded by small [[earthquake]]s which began about six days prior to the first eruption of lava. These earthquakes increased in [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] and frequency through April 2, and a particularly strong one was reported at about 8 p.m., four hours before the eruption apparently began. Just after midnight, fissures opened on the flank of Pico. One resident said it looked as if the cone had "been cut by a knife." The eruption began with [[Strombolian eruption|Strombolian activity]], quickly followed by a 'curtain-of-fire' [[lava fountain]] that fed a flow which cut off the road to the village of Portela by 2 a.m. The 1,300 people living inside the caldera fled during the night to the safety of villages on the north coast. No one was killed, but about 20 people required medical attention.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

During the day on April 3, the island was engulfed by a thick cloud of dark ash that reached 2.5 to 5 kilometers high. The initial flows were [[pahoehoe]] lava, although their extent was apparently small. The violent eruption produced lava bombs up to 4 meters across that were ejected as far as 500 meters from the vents. On April 4, lava fountains reached 400 meters high beneath a cloud of ash about 2 kilometers high. A new [[scoria cone]] formed that was open to the southwest and fed a growing [[lava]] flow. On April 5, the new lava flow reached the western caldera wall and destroyed about five houses and the main water reservoir. During these first few days, civil authorities evacuated about 3,000 people.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

[[File:Fogo, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Chã das Caldeiras and main ash cone, Fogo, 2009]]
The eruption became steadier after the first few days, and moderate, [[Hawaiian eruption|Hawaiian-style]] lava fountains about 100–120 meters high built a spatter cone more than 140 meters high. The flows were lava, and flowed towards the west to the caldera wall, then turned north. These flows advanced episodically as pressure built from ponding and thickening of the flows. On April 13, a second lava flow began to cover an earlier, stagnant lava flow, and was almost entirely on top of the earlier flow until April 15, when it spread out and destroyed another home. [[Cinder]] fell as far as two kilometers south of the vents on April 15. By the 17th, the flow had advanced to within 420 meters of the nearest house in the village of Portela.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

On April 18, a portable seismometer began to record much stronger [[volcanic tremor]]s that indicated a change in eruptive style from lava fountains back to Strombolian activity. Spatter was discharged every 3–8 seconds with loud [[Volcanic gas|gas]] bursts. In addition, the eruptive rate increased and the upper 300 meters of the channel was largely pahoehoe lava. The eruption rates, estimated from the dimensions and flow rates in the channel, were between 4 and 8.5 million cubic meters per day.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

During the night of April 18, a series of large, explosive bursts occurred that may have followed collapse of parts of the cone into the vents and subsequent explosive clearing of the debris. By morning, the activity had returned to lava fountaining, and the seismic record was much quieter. The lava flows continued to thicken, and lava ponded along the central channel.&lt;ref name=hvo_1995/&gt;

==2014-15 eruption==
{{Main|2014-15 eruption of Fogo}}
The Fogo volcano returned to activity in 2014, having started erupting shortly after 10 a.m. of Sunday, 23 November 2014.&lt;ref name=oceanpress&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oceanpress.info/index.php/en/home4/fogo2/item/12811-volcano-of-fogo-in-eruption#k2Container |title = Volcano of Fogo in eruption |publisher = Oceanpress.info |date = 23 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a few days of heightened seismic activity,&lt;ref name=oceanpress/&gt; but they worsened beginning at 8 p.m. on Saturday night.&lt;ref name=dn&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.dn.pt/inicio/globo/interior.aspx?content_id=4256538 |title = Vulcão do Fogo está em erupção e obriga a evacuar Chã das Caldeiras |author = Susana Salvador |date = 23 November 2014 |publisher = [[Diário de Notícias]] |language = pt |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080418/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/globo/interior.aspx?content_id=4256538 |archivedate = 29 November 2014 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of [[Chã das Caldeiras]], totaling around 1,000 inhabitants, spent the night outside their homes due to the strong earthquakes,&lt;ref name=oceanpress/&gt; and started being evacuated when the eruption began.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt; As in 1995, some people initially refused to abandon their homes, but eventually heeded the authorities' instructions.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt;

Bruno Faria, a Cape Verdean vulcanologist, said the intensity of the eruption surpassed that of the 1995 eruption, and approached that of the 1951 eruption, one of the strongest ever recorded on the island.&lt;ref name=dn/&gt; The eruption gained in intensity after 23 November 2014.The village of  Portela in the Chã das Caldeiras  is now covered by a lava stream  which has completely destroyed the housing stock.&lt;ref name=paysages&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cneffpaysages.blog.lemonde.fr/2014/12/10/blognotice-10-12-2014-leruption-du-pico-do-fogo-du-23-11-2014-leruption-oublie/ |title =  L’éruption du Pico do Fogo du 23.11.2014 – l’éruption oublie ….|author = [[Christophe Neff]] |date = 10 December 2014 |publisher = Blogs le Monde on [[LeMonde.fr]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 77 days of activity, the eruption stopped on 8 February 2015.&lt;ref name=cneffpaysages1 &gt;{{cite web |url = http://cneffpaysages.blog.lemonde.fr/2015/04/26/blognotice-26-04-2015-retour-sur-le-vielle-homme-le-pico-do-fogo/ |title = retour sur le vieil homme – le Pico do Fogo |author = [[Christophe Neff]] |date = 28 April 2015 |publisher = Blogs le Monde on [[LeMonde.fr]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of the buildings in Portela, Bangaeira and Ilhéu de Losna, sections of [[Chã das Caldeiras]], had been destroyed.

'''''Portrait of Canada''''' is a 10-minute 1959 Canadian [[documentary film]], made by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) as part of the  postwar ''[[Canada Carries On]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner 1997, p. 1051.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, directed by Guy Glover, described the creation of the ''All Canadian Atlas''. The film's [[Canadian French|French]] version title is ''L'Atlas du Canada''.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Synopsis ==
Canadian mapmakers 400 years ago relied on hand-drawn maps derived from personal accounts by explorers, fur traders and settlers. These maps were limited to coastlines and partial interior views. Explorers like [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[Jacques Cartier]] and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] made their own maps. Later explorers and prospectors were often the first to go into uncharted regions, and their information on the land was invaluable in drawing up the maps of the time.

In 1959, the new ''All Canadian Atlas'' is a product of the joint efforts of geologists, meteorologists, prospectors, agronomists, draughtspersons, naturalists and especially, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. Aerial photography was essential in mapping the vast north of Canada. In 1948, [[413 Transport and Rescue Squadron|No. 413 RCAF Squadron/No. 13 (Photographic) Squadron]] flying specially converted [[Avro Lancaster|Avro Lancaster 10P]] aircraft undertook the task of mapping Canada's Arctic. Three large islands were discovered and one island near [[Baffin Island]] was named "Air Force" in their honour.

With all the accumulated data from photographs, the mapmakers of the ''All Canadian Atlas'' consulted with interested parties from government, industry and [[academia]] to ensure that all relevant information is included. Each of the 500 maps contains a wealth of information, depicting Canada in a hundred different ways from political boundaries, settlement, urban development, habitats, mineral and agricultural areas, temperatures and climates, transportation and industry to provide an accurate portrait of Canada in the late 1950s.

==Production==
''Portrait of Canada'' was a [[short film|short]] informational documentary in the NFB's films ''Canada Carries On'' series (first created as a [[World War II|wartime]] series).&lt;ref name="CFE"&gt;Morris, Peter. [http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&amp;csid1=615&amp;navid=66 "Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On."]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Canadian Film Encyclopedia''. Retrieved: February 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a [[compilation documentary]] that combined newsreel material with animated sequences and original footage, including aerial footage from the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Reception==
''Portrait of Canada'' was produced for television broadcast on [[CBC Television]]. Individual films were distributed worldwide by the NFB and were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Evans 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 199 films in the ''Canada Carries On'' series were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.&lt;ref name="Ohayon"&gt;Ohayon, Albert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22511">'''Seismic inversion''', in [[geophysics]] (primarily in [[oil and gas | oil-and-gas]] exploration/development), is the process of transforming [[reflection seismology|seismic reflection]] data into a quantitative rock-property description of a [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir]]. Seismic inversion may be pre- or post-[[stack (disambiguation)|stack]], deterministic, random or [[geostatistics | geostatistical]]; it typically includes other reservoir measurements such as [[well logging|well logs]] and cores &lt;ref name="fwi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Yangkang|last2=Chen|first2=Hanming|last3=Xiang|first3=Kui|last4=Chen|first4=Xiaohong|title=Geological structure guided well log interpolation for high-fidelity full waveform inversion|journal=Geophysical Journal International|date=2017|volume=209|issue=1|page=21-31|doi=10.1093/gji/ggw343}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Introduction==
Geophysicists routinely perform [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]] to gather information about the [[geology]] of an [[Petroleum|oil]] or [[Natural gas|gas]] field. These surveys record sound waves which have traveled through the layers of rock and fluid in the earth. The [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]] of these waves can be estimated so that any side-lobe and tuning effects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=tuning%20effect Oilfield glossary] Retrieved 2011-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by the wavelet may be removed.

Seismic data may be inspected and interpreted on its own without inversion, but this does not provide the most detailed view of the subsurface and can be misleading under certain conditions. Because of its efficiency and quality, most oil and gas companies now use seismic inversion to increase the resolution and reliability of the data and to improve estimation of rock properties including [[porosity]] and net pay.&lt;ref&gt;Pendrel, J., "Seismic Inversion—A Critical Tool in Reservoir Characterization", Scandinavian Oil-Gas Magazine, No. 5/6, 2006, p. 19-22
.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different techniques used in seismic inversion.&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;Sen, M. K., "Seismic Inversion", Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These can be roughly grouped into two categories:

# pre-stack or post-stack
# seismic resolution or well-log resolution

The combination of these categories yields four technical approaches to the inversion problem, and the selection of a specific technique depends on the desired objective and the characteristics of the subsurface rocks. Although the order presented reflects advances in inversion techniques over the past 20 years, each grouping still has valid uses in particular projects or as part of a larger workflow.

==Wavelet estimation==
All modern seismic inversion methods require seismic data and a [[wavelet]] estimated from the data. Typically, a [[reflection coefficient]] series from a well within the boundaries of the seismic survey is used to estimate the wavelet [[phase (waves)|phase]] and frequency. Accurate wavelet estimation is critical to the success of any seismic inversion. The inferred shape of the seismic wavelet may strongly influence the seismic inversion results and, thus, subsequent assessments of the reservoir quality.

Wavelet amplitude and [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|phase spectra]] are estimated [[statistics|statistically]] from either the seismic data alone or from a combination of seismic data and well control using wells with available [[Sonic logging|sonic]] and [[Density logging|density]] curves. After the seismic wavelet is estimated, it is used to estimate seismic reflection coefficients in the seismic inversion.

When the estimated (constant) phase of the statistical wavelet is consistent with the final result, the wavelet estimation converges more quickly than when starting with a [[Deconvolution|zero phase]] assumption. Minor edits and "stretch and squeeze" may be applied to the well to better align the events. Accurate wavelet estimation requires the accurate tie of the [[acoustic impedance|impedance]] log to the seismic. Errors in well tie can result in phase or frequency artifacts in the wavelet estimation. Once the wavelet is identified, seismic inversion computes a synthetic log for every seismic trace. To ensure quality, the inversion result is convolved with the wavelet to produce synthetic seismic traces which are compared to the original seismic.&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt;

==Components of inversion==
Inversion includes both seismic field data and well data, where well data serves to add the high frequency below the seismic band and to constrain the inversion. Well logs are first conditioned and edited to ensure there is a suitable relationship between impedance logs and the desired properties. The logs are then converted to time, filtered to approximate the seismic bandwidth and edited for borehole effects, balanced and classified by quality.

Seismic data is band-limited, reducing resolution and quality. To extend the frequency band available, low-frequency data is derived from log data, pre-stack depth or time migrated velocities and/or a regional gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, R., Davison, R., van Riel, P., "An Interpreter’s Guide to Understanding and Working with Seismic-Derived Acoustic Impedance Data", The Leading Edge, March 2000, p. 242-256.&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency can be derived from well control or geostatistical analysis.

Initial inversions are often run with relaxed constraints, starting with the seismic and then adding limited-trend data from the wells. This provides a rough overview of the reservoir in an unbiased manner. It is critical at this point to evaluate the accuracy of the tie between the inversion results and the wells, and between the original seismic data and the derived synthetics. It is also important to ensure that the wavelet matches the phase and frequency of seismic data.

Without a wavelet, the solution is not unique. Deterministic inversions address this problem by constraining the answer in some way, usually to well log data. [[Stochastic]] inversions address this problem by generating a range of plausible solutions, which can then be narrowed through testing for best fit against various measurements (including production data).

==Post-stack seismic resolution inversion==

An example of a post-stack seismic resolution inversion technique is the Constrained Sparse-Spike Inversion (CSSI). This assumes a limited number of reflection coefficients, with larger amplitude. The inversion results in acoustic impedance (AI), which is the product of rock density and [[p-wave]] velocity. Unlike seismic reflection data (which is an interface property) AI is a rock property. The model generated is of higher quality, and does not suffer from tuning and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] caused by the wavelet.

CSSI transforms seismic data to a pseudo-acoustic impedance log at every trace.  Acoustic impedance is used to produce more accurate and detailed structural and [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] interpretations than can be obtained from seismic (or [[seismic attribute]]) interpretation. In many geological environments acoustic impedance has a strong relationship to [[Reservoir petrophysics|petrophysical]] properties such as porosity, [[lithology]], and fluid saturation.

A good (CSSI) [[algorithm]] will produce four high-quality acoustic impedance volumes from full or post-stack seismic data: full-bandwidth impedance, [[bandlimited]] Impedance, reflectivity model, and low-frequency component. Each of these components can be inspected for its contribution to the solution and to check the results for quality. To further adapt the algorithm mathematics to the behavior of real rocks in the subsurface, some CSSI algorithms use a mixed-norm approach and allow a weighting factor between minimizing the sparsity of the solution and minimizing the misfit of the residual traces.

==Pre-stack seismic resolution inversion==

Pre-stack inversion is often used when post-stack inversion fails to sufficiently differentiate geologic features with similar P-impedance signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Pendrel, J., "Seismic Inversion—The Best Tool for Reservoir Characterization", CSEG Recorder.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous inversion solves for S-impedance and density, in addition to P-impedance. While many geologic features can express similar P-impedance characteristics, few will share combined P-impedance and S-impedance traits (allowing improved separation and clarity). Often a feasibility study using the wells logs will indicate whether separation of the desired lithotype can be achieved with P-impedance alone or whether S-impedance is also required.  This will dictate whether a pre- or post-stack inversion is needed.

Simultaneous Inversion (SI) is a pre-stack method that uses multiple offset or angle seismic sub-stacks and their associated wavelets as input; it generates P-impedance, S-impedance and [[density]] as outputs (although the density output resolution is rarely as high as the impedances). This helps improve discrimination between lithology, porosity and fluid effects. For each input partial stack, a unique wavelet is estimated. All models, partial stacks and wavelets are input to a single inversion algorithm —enabling inversion to effectively compensate for offset-dependent phase, bandwidth, tuning and [[Normal Move Out|NMO]] stretch effects.&lt;ref&gt;Pendrel, J., Dickson, T., "Simultaneous AVO Inversion to P Impedance and Vp/Vs", SEG.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inversion algorithm works by first estimating angle-dependent P-wave reflectivities for the input-partial stacks. Next, these are used with the full [[Zoeppritz equations]] (or approximations, such as Aki-Richards, for some algorithms) to find band-limited elastic reflectivities. These are in turn merged with their low-frequency counterparts from the model and integrated to [[Elastic modulus|elastic properties]]. This approximate result is then improved in a final inversion for P-impedance, S-impedance and density, subject to various hard and soft constraints. One constraint can control the relation between density and compressional velocity; this is necessary when the range of angles is not great enough to be diagnostic of density.

An important part in the inversion procedure is the estimation of the seismic wavelets. This is accomplished by computing a filter that best shapes the angle-dependent well log reflection coefficients in the region of interest to the corresponding offset stack at the well locations. Reflection coefficients are calculated from P-sonic, S-sonic and density logs using the [[Zoeppritz equations]]. The wavelets, with amplitudes representative of each offset stack, are input directly into the inversion algorithm. Since a different wavelet is computed for each offset volume, compensation is automatically done for offset-dependent bandwidth, scaling and tuning effects. A near-stack wavelet can be used as the starting point for estimating the far-angle (or offset) wavelet.

No prior knowledge of the elastic parameters and density beyond the solution space defined by any hard constraints is provided at the well locations. This makes comparison of the filtered well logs and the inversion outputs at these locations a natural quality control. The lowest frequencies from the inversion are replaced with information from the geologic model since they are poorly constrained by the seismic data. When applied in global mode a spatial control term is added to the objective function and large subsets of traces are inverted simultaneously. The simultaneous inversion algorithm takes multiple angle-stacked seismic data sets and generates three elastic parameter volumes as output.

The resulting elastic parameters are real-rock properties that can be directly related to reservoir properties. The more advanced algorithms use the full Knott-Zoeppritz equations and there is full allowance for amplitude and phase variations with offset. This is done by deriving unique wavelets for each input-partial stack. The elastic parameters themselves can be directly constrained during the seismic inversion and rock-physics relationships can be applied, constraining pairs of elastic parameters to each other. Final elastic-parameter models optimally reproduce the input seismic, as this is part of the seismic inversion optimization.

==Post Stack Geostatistical inversion==

Geostatistical inversion integrates high resolution well data with low resolution 3-D seismic, and provides a model with high vertical detail near and away from well control. This generates reservoir models with geologically-plausible shapes, and provides a clear quantification of [[uncertainty]] to assess risk. Highly detailed petrophysical models are generated, ready for input to reservoir-flow simulation.

[[Geostatistics]] differs from statistics in that it recognizes that only certain outcomes are geologically plausible. Geostatistical inversion integrates data from many sources and creates models that have greater resolution than the original seismic, match known geological patterns, and can be used for [[risk assessment]] and reduction.

Seismic, well logs and other input data are each represented as a [[probability density function]] (PDF), which provides a geostatistical description based on [[histogram]]s and [[variogram]]s. Together these define the chances of a particular value at a particular location, and the expected geological scale and composition throughout the modeled area.

Unlike conventional inversion and geomodeling algorithms, geostatistical inversion takes a one-step approach, solving for impedance and discrete property types or lithofacies at the same time. Taking this approach speeds the process and improves accuracy.

Individual PDFs are merged using [[bayesian inference]] techniques, resulting in a posterior PDF conditioned to the whole data set. The algorithm determines the weighting of each data source, eliminating potential bias. The posterior PDF is then input to a [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] algorithm to generate realistic models of impedance and lithofacies, which are then used to co-simulate rock properties such as porosity. These processes are typically iterated until a model emerges that matches all information. Even with the best model, some uncertainty remains. Uncertainty can be estimated using random seeds to generate a range of realizations. This is especially useful when dealing with parameters that are sensitive to change; an analysis of this sort enables greater understanding of development risk.

==Pre-stack log-detail inversion==
[[Amplitude versus offset]] (AVO) (AVA) geostatistical inversion incorporates simultaneous AVO (AVA) inversion into the geostatistical inversion algorithm so high resolution, geostatistics, and AVO may be attained in a single method. The output model ([[Realization (probability)|realizations]]) are consistent with well log information, AVO seismic data, and honor rock property relationships found in the wells. The algorithm also simultaneously produces elastic properties (P-impedance, S-impedance and density) and lithology volumes, instead of sequentially solving for lithology first and then populating the cell with impedance and density values. Because all output models match all input data, uncertainty can be quantitatively assessed to determine the range of reservoir possibilities within the constraining data.

AVA geostatistical inversion software uses leading-edge geostatistical techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and pluri-Gaussian lithology modeling. It is thus possible to exploit "informational synergies" to retrieve details that deterministic inversion techniques blur out or omit. As a result, geoscientists are more successful in reconstructing both the overall structure and the fine details of the reservoir. The use of multiple-angle-stack seismic volumes in AVA geostatistical inversion enables further evaluation of elastic rock properties and probable lithology or seismic facies and fluid distributions with greater accuracy.

The process begins with a detailed petrophysical analysis and well log calibration.  The calibration process replaces unreliable and missing sonic and density measurements with synthesized values from calibrated petrophysical and rock-physics models.  Well log information is used in the inversion process to derive wavelets, supply the low frequency component not present in the seismic data, and to verify and analyze the final results. Next, horizon and log data are used to construct the stratigraphic framework for the statistical information to build the models. In this way, the log data is only used for generating statistics within similar rock types within the stratigraphic layers of the earth.

Wavelet analysis is conducted by extracting a filter from each of the seismic volumes using the well elastic (angle or offset) impedance as the desired output.  The quality of the inversion result is dependent upon the extracted seismic wavelets.  This requires accurate p-sonic, s-sonic and density logs tied to the appropriate events on the seismic data.  Wavelets are extracted individually for each well.  A final "multi-well" wavelet is then extracted for each volume using the best individual well ties and used as input to the inversion.

Histograms and variograms are generated for each stratigraphic layer and lithology, and preliminary simulations are run on small areas. The AVA geostatistical inversion is then run to generate the desired number of realizations, which match all the input data. The results are [[quality control]]led by direct comparison of the inverted rock property volumes against the well logs. Further QC involves review by a multidisciplinary team of all input parameters and the results of the simulation. Analysis of multiple realizations produces mean (P50) property cubes or maps. Most often these are lithology or seismic [[facies]] cubes and predicted lithology or facies [[Probability|probabilities]], but other outputs are also possible. Selected lithology and facies cubes are also generated for P15 and P85 probabilities (for example). Reservoir 3-D bodies of [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing units are captured with their corresponding rock properties, and the uncertainty in reservoir size and properties is quantified.

'''Superimposition''' is the placement of one thing over another, typically so that both are still evident.

==Graphics==
In [[graphics]], superimposition is the placement of an [[image]] or video on top of an already-existing image or video, usually to add to the overall image effect, but also sometimes to conceal something (such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a [[photograph]]). 

==Cartography==
This technique is used in [[cartography]] to produce [[photomapping|photomaps]] by superimposing grid lines, [[contour line]]s and other linear or textual mapping features over [[aerial photograph]]s.

==2D images==
Superimposition of two-dimensional images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce [[moiré pattern]]s. Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise [[line moiré]] patterns. The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moiré superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as [[moiré speedup]] (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moiré patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switzernet.com/people/emin-gabrielyan/070227-random-line-moire |title=Aperiodic random line moiré |website=Switzernet.com |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely line Glass patterns (after [[Leon Glass]], 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot moiré,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switzernet.com/people/emin-gabrielyan/070212-random-moire |title=Examples of random moiré |website=Switzernet.com |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may give rise to magnified shapes, called [[shape moiré]] patterns.

==Audio==
Superimposition (SI) during sound recording and reproduction (commonly called [[overdubbing]]) is the process of adding new sounds over existing without completely erasing or masking the existing sound. Some [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorders]] of the mid 20th century provided crude superimposition facilities that were implemented by killing the high-frequency AC feed to the erase head while recording as normal via the read-write head.

A '''Yazoo stream''' is a [[Geology|geologic]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] term f&lt;nowiki/&gt;or any [[tributary]] stream that runs parallel to, and within the [[floodplain]] of a larger river for considerable distance, before eventually joining it. This is especially the characteristic when such a stream is forced to flow along the base of the main river's [[Levee#Natural levees|natural levee]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert L Bates, Julia A Jackson, ed. ''Dictionary of Geological Terms: Third Edition'', p. 568, [[American Geological Institute]] (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the two meet is known as a "belated [[confluence (geography)|confluence]]" or a "deferred junction". The name is derived from a now vanished Native American tribe, the Yazoo Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "yazoo" by Emily Hiestand: Home Ground|url = http://test.ourhomeground.com/entries/definition/yazoo|website = test.ourhomeground.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Choctaw word is translated to "River of Death" because of the strong flows under its bank full stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Johnson's Universal Cyclopædia: A Scientific and Popular Treasury of Useful Knowledge|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S51GAQAAIAAJ|publisher = A.J.

=== Tributaries of the Wakarusa River ===
Yazoo streams here drain the back swamps of the Wakarusa River Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wetland Soils: Genesis, Hydrology, Landscapes, and Classification, Second Edition|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YmbmCgAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = November 25, 2015|isbn = 9781439898000|first = Michael J.|last = Vepraskas|first2 = Christopher B.|last2 = Craft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==

=== Natural levees ===

Over time, the main river flows through the landscape, widening a valley and creating a [[floodplain]].  [[Sediment]] accumulates and creates a natural [[levee]]. [[Tributaries]] that want to enter the main channel are not allowed because of this levee.  Instead, the water then enters the back swamps, or form a yazoo stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meander Formation and Features of Meandering Streams|url = http://www.indiana.edu/~g105lab/images/gaia_chapter_12/meander_formation.htm|website = www.indiana.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because yazoo streams are separated from the main river by natural levees, they flow and meander (streams and rivers rarely flow in straight lines) parallel to the main stream channel or river on the [[floodplain]] for a considerable distance. These series of smooth bends or curves flows with a slight gradient, usually south, and is normally blocked from entering by a natural levee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Floodplain – The shape of the land, Forces and changes, Spotlight on famous forms, For More Information|url = http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Floodplain.html|website = www.scienceclarified.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; along the larger stream. A yazoo stream will join the major river where it will eventually break through the natural levees and flow into the larger waterway at its belated confluence.

=== Glaciers ===

[[File:Montanaseries2.jpg|thumb|Mendenhall Glacier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The City and Borough of Juneau|url = http://www.juneau.org/parkrec/trails/montanamcginnis.php|website = |accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Yazoo stream formation can also be influenced by glacial processes.  An example is the formation of the Montana Creek valley during the recent [[Little Ice Age]].  The [[Mendenhall Glacier]] carved out a wide [[floodplain]] that is domed in the center.  High valley walls due to [[tectonic uplift]] and [[glacial outwash]] (the natural levee) create two yazoo streams that parallel the Mendenhall River.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Flooding and human influence ==
Floods are a major driving force for yazoo streams.  In the Yazoo Basin, [[settler]]s were faced with high waters for most of the year, making it hard for building homes and maintaining agriculture.  A few man-made [[levee]]s were built to improve conditions.  In 1927, large floods ravaged the area, allowing [[United States Congress|Congress]] to take action into building dams and more levees to reduce the risk of floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proceedings of the second international symposium on the management of large rivers for fisheries: Volume II|url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ad526e/ad526e0b.htm|website = www.fao.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human influence has damaged the natural order of things. Human alteration within [[wetland]]s and streams have resulted in a decrease in ecological functions and associated benefits to society. Miles of streams are in poor condition with high [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] concentrations.  Yazoo streams have been altered through intense agricultural activities and flood control measures. Low water, excessive sedimentation, and the accumulation of [[pesticide]]s such as [[DDT]] are the consequences of human disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Incorporating Science-Based Approaches into the Rapid Assessment of Wetlands and Streams: Validation, Restoration Trajectory, and Method Development|url = http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06182013-205633/|website = etd.lsu.edu|date = June 30, 2013|accessdate = 2015-11-29|first = Jacob Franklin|last = Berkowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
